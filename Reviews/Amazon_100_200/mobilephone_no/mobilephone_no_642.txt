The phone works fine in general.The alarm do unexpected behavior, some times does not work, but when I touch the screen starts with sound, it happened many times, I waked up at 5 AM, then I note the failure with alarm, when I touched the screen on phone 5, 8, 10, 25 minutes later, the alarm starts and I have to silent as normal, sliding my finger on the scren.The PDF reader is really slow with heavy files, plus only reads up to 40 or 50 pages, it fails with remaining pages, and worst, it can not work with some files.
