I purchased this phone in July 2004. I previously had a Sanyo 5150 and other Samsung phones. This phone is simple to operate has great reception and has many other nice features, especially the speakerphone.There are three annoying things that I have found with the  PM-8200.1. Earpiece sound is poor, especially at higher volumes it really sounds like an AM radio from the 60's. (my Sanyo SCP-5150 sounded like a landline phone)2. The speakerphone is nice, however it is really just okay to be on hold or for dialing and not to have a conversation.  I always hear "are you there?" and am told that the sound comes in broken words.3. The camera is average at best and if you use the highest quality setting which is a little better you get very few pictures.  Overall, I am pleased with the phone and would recommend it. You can't have everything.
