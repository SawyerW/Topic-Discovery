After the phone arrived, I notice immediately that it was missing the SIM card holder, so all I actully had was a very expensive iPod. I have since aquired a SIM Card holder, just to find out the the unlocked phone I purchased was locked. Because I know a little something about this phone, it is working find now. I am truly disappointed in you amazon, because I know you are better then this. I hope and pray this was just an oversight, as a number of my friends are looking to purchase from you as well.By the way, can I still get the SIM Card Holder that should have been in my iPhone from the start?Rev.CLC
