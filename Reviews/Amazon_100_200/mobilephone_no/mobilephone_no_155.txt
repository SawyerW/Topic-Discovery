when i first recieved this phone i had no problems with it.  however after having it now for 4 months its nothing but crap.  calls get dropped just sitting at my desk.  loss signal in area's that i normally have great recpetion, and the cover constantly flips open when its attached to my hip.  the biggest agravation is when i am in the middle of a call the call gets dropped and theres an error message on the screen. In addition the back cover is a cheep piece of metal, instead of plastic which it should me. i have sence invested in the i530 and love it.
