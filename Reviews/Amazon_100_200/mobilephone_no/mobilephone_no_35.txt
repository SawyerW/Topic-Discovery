I love this phone. I've had my own for over a year now and have since bought one for my son and for my daughter. Battery life is excellent, more features that I could dream of using. The phone camera takes OK photos (don't even try at a concert... haha) - and the more modern phones do better in this department, but I'm very satisfied. Just be forewarned. With Sprint PCS, you will encounter many dropped calls and ignorant customer service staff. I've been with Sprint for 7 years now, so I know what I'm talking about. I'd switch, but we get a really good deal through our company. But I digress... the phone is great, I highly recommmend.
