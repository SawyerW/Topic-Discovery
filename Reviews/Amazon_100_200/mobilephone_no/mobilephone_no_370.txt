I love the phone. Let's start with that. I don't have much more to add to anyone else's review. Except - while I was futzing around with the phone I discovered it had the Tiger Woods EA golf game. Now, I am pretty technically adept but I had no idea it even came with the phone as you certainly can't find it off any menu. [...]From there I was trying to customize the Short Press Messaging button and as I scrolled through the list of choices (options/change) one of the many many options was this game.If you find any other cool widgets, please post them here.Fore!
