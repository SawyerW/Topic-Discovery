my husband had not one, but two of these phones in less than a year and they were both lemons!  The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there!  The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it!  He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely.  I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone.  Either way, we'll never have another one!!!
