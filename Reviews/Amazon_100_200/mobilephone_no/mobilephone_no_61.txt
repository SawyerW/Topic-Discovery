Had an old Nokia Digital phone with ATTWS for about the last 3 years and it wasn't working to well anymore.  After being a customer wiht ATT for about 6 years I figured it should be no problem to get a new phone.  Not so.Apparently if you buy an ATT cell phone and you don't buy directly from ATT, ATT doesn't stand behind it.If you are a new customer, ATT will give you a great price on a new phone.  If you are an exisiting customer they charge you up to 3x as much for the same phone.  In addition it did not appear to be possible to buy this phone from the ATT website as an existing customer.Ended up paying over $200.00 for this phone from ATT.  We'll it is a great phone but not as intuitive as past Nokias.  Color screen is nice, tons of features, but as noted the screen is tough to see in the sunlight.Don't hesitate to buy this phone, just don't buy it from ATT.
