Very poor communication and customer service. I purchased this phone with 1500 minutes and when I activated it was given a rep who spoke almost no English but assured me I was good to go. When I realized there were only ten minutes on the phone, I called to figure out what was going on and was told my promotional period had ended and that there was nothing they could do. I said of course you can, you can credit the account with the minutes I purchased and was assured would be applied to the phone. Again I was told that this was impossible. Rather than argue, I am switching back to verizon and will never fall into one of these scams again.
