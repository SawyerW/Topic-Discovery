I had this phone for 2 years then I switched to Sumsung Galaxy S3, I must say that I sold this phone and after using S3 I went and bought a second hand N8 again  and using it now for another year. While it doesn't have great Web browser or doesn't allow do many things S3 is capable of it is still the phone of my choice today. I use it today and its great, GPS is quick and free, voice clarity, reception, FM transmitter, FM/AM radio, etc. Inspite of limited apps Nokia store provides it is still the best thing I ever owned. 12mp camera is great enough for vacations where you don't want to haul large and expensive dslr. The picture quality is compared to point and shoot cameras especially with real flash on board.
