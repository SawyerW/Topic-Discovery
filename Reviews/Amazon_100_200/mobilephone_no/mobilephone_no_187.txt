I am so disappointed with this phone.  I fought hard to convince my wife I needed this more expensive model so that I could get the speaker version for work calls, while she got a plain vanilla model (Nokia I think).  Well, the speaker phone works ok, but little did I realize until the warranty wore off is the volume of the regular press-to-ear mode fades terribly.  If you are not in the quietest environments, don't expect to hear anyone.  It's very embarrassing to call someone while driving and have to tell them you cannot talk because you can't hear them over your car (I have an '02 Subaru, so it's not exactly a monster truck show SUNDAY-SUNDAY-SUNDAY level of volume).  Cingular wouldn't do anything for me.  I had even bought the insurance for it and asked if I could get the much cheaper, plain vanilla model my wife has.  Absolutely not, have to get the same model phone (a refurbished one).  But Ms. Cingular representative, this other phone is much cheaper and you can actually hear = SORRY, HAS TO BE EXACT SAME PHONE.  Argh!
