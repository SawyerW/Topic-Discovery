Pros:-Syncs outlook contacts, notes and appointments-Well built, quality-Nice large and bright screen-Opens Word,Execl, Powerpoint or PDF-EDGE fast internet access (I hookup my laptop via bluetooth)-Games, apps, web browsing, emailing is way cool-Video recording is only limited by your memory size.-Extra memory is cheap to buy.Cons:-Camera sucks in doors. You can not get a good picture in bad lighting. Flash is either insufficient or camera screws up white balancing when flash is used. Colors go orangey when flash is used in close distance-Bundeled Headphones are not practical. They are uncomfortable, too long and cord is too stiff.-MP3 organization is not practical. Sorting by album or artist is not supported. Playlists are cumbersome.
