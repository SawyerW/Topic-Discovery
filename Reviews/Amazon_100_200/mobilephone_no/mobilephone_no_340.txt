I don't like reviews that really don't rate the actual product, but I feel I must rate the contents of this phone's box ... and the vendor UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC. The manual is a joke and is a Nokia generic black & white 8-pager. I question that it is even by Nokia since I subsequently downloaded the real Nokia user manual for this phone from another site (114 pages compared to 8). And the battery is made in China and has no indication it is an OEM version. Also, it was fully charged when it arrived. THEREFORE, I presume I have been sold a used phone with a worthless, self-printed manual and a Chinese non-OEM battery. I would not recommend buying from this vendor. If I have problems with the phone, I'll report back.
