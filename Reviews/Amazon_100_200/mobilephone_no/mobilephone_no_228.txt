First off, the color isn't blue, it's more of a cobalt, and I love the cobalt. The speaker on the outside is loud. I can actually hear this phone ringing as opposed to many other flip phones. The color LCD on the outside is just one of those extra things that you don't need, but is really awesome to see who is calling. The screen quality (for both screens) is amazing. Very sharp colors. The phone doesn't flip open and closed easily, it clicks... and that's good because it's not always falling open all the time and I'm not worried about it breaking the hinge.My only quarrels with the phone are that it is sort of confusing at first to navigate around and figure out all the settings (since there are so many) and you are not able to change the default soft keys for the main screen.
