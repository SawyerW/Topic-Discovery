I like this phone very much. But since Milestone 3 is released, I think MS2's price should get down. Well it is a good stuff, I have it for a month and everything is fine. I root it, put in a lot of apps and it works great! The only thing is the battery. It cannot afford a whole day if I play games on it. But I think that's all the Android phone's problem. And there is one thing I really feel strange that when it warns me that "connect your phone to the charger. The battery is low", I only charge it maybe no more than one hour and a half and it is full-charged. But the batery is fine, I still can use it for a the time as usual. Anyway, MS2 is a good phone!
