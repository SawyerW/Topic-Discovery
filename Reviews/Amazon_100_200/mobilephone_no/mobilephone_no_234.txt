Summary: Buy the new Sanyo 8300. It is the best sprint phone I have found.I just bought the Sanyo 8300 last night. It has the best reception of any Sprint phone that I have owned. Reception is the top factor for me when I buy a phone since my home and work are in borderline areas. I have owned the Sanyo 8200, 8100, and 4900. The 8300 is a huge improvement in reception versus the 8200 and 4900. The 8300 works in areas of my office where you cannot ever get a sprint connection with the 8200.At one point 2 years ago, I actually bought the best phone of all the Sprint manufactures. At the time the Sanyo 4900 was the only phone that provided better reception. I would say the 8200 and 8100 are similar to the 4900.
