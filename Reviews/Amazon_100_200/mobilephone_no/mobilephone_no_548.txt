two weeks ago I purchased a razr which advertised "video" feature which it did not offer.  The company I purchased from replaced it with another phone for an additional charge.  This phone is also useless.  If I want to take photos or utilize video I have to buy an additional "sim" type card and open phone up to utilize these features.  I spent 2 hours at my local AT&T; retailer to find out that my 5 year old razr offers more options with the sim card i have .  I want to return this phone, but I'm not sure I'll get my money back so I guess I'll just hang onto this loser
