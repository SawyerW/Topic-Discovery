Nokia was my first brand phone, then Samsung -- and as soon as I could, switched back to Nokia.I use this phone, get this: to make phone calls.and for texting.and sometimes photos.using the calendar to remind myself of upcoming mtgs/appts.that's it.no checking emails, browsing, etc. For me, the phone is to make phone-calls , and not to cook my dinner, wash my laundry, sprinkle the lawn ...The battery holds very well. No complaints (those are reserved for At&T;, sigh ...)All features are easy to handle - in my experience. Would buy it again. But hope this will last for a while...
