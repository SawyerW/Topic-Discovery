I was a little skeptical.  Some of the reviews I read on the company shopcell deals left some doubt.  I placed the order and 3 days letter the card arrived.  Everything worked beautifully.  It could not have been any easier or better.  I saved at least $20.00.  One recommendation I received somewhere told me to  not to use the telephone to redeem as the bonus codes may have expired and it is difficult to redeem others.  I used the computer and sure enough the first code had expired but the option to enter the second appeared instantly.  It worked.  Within 20 seconds of submitting the order the 365 days and 1000 minutes appeared on my phone.I give this company the highest grades for service and price.
