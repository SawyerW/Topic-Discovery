I've had my phone for over 6 months.  Reception is generally good, with few dropped calls.  Coverage is mediocre at best (doesnt matter which provider).Disadvantages are: 1) handset gets really hot after phone conversations longer than 2 minutes2) Ringing volume (meaning from incoming calls) extremely LOW even at highest volume setting.  I mean you can hear the person you're speaking with loud and clear, but that's only IF you can hear the phone ring in order to answer it.  I have missed so many calls because I can't hear the phone ringing!!!3) Downloaded games don't work: I don't know if this is the service providers fault, or the phones, but I downloaded 2 games, and was able to play them only once!4) Backlighting of keys extremely poor, so that you have difficulty in dialling numbers in poorly lit conditions.
