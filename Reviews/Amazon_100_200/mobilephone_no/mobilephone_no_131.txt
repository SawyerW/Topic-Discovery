Could not afford to buy it new. I dropped it and yes it kept on ticking but I dropped it on its antennae and it broke off so I superglued it back on.  Some things can only happen to some people im sure.  Now, it could be because of that, but the phone drops calls without shame, left and right.  Usually in poor weather or when the signal is not strong.  So reception is poor but when the signals strong it is 95 percent reliable.  Battery is fine but you need to fully charge it and not keep it on too much.  that massive (relatively speaking) LCD display is what talkes up all the juice. So what if the addresses take a while to appear...the recently called numbers are readily available.  Funny but even after all of that I still like it because it is one of the most aesthetically pleasing phones out there.  I would recommend it to people who want a sexy phone but not a serious one.  IE.  You would not want to use this for business calls...It would annoy you.  Whatever you do make sure you do not drop it antenae first.
