I have now had this phone for about 4 months. I've been reading through the reviews where people have problems with the battery heating up and the phones not charging, but I have never experienced this. The internet browser works very well, the phone supports PDF files, you can create microsoft office documents...etc. Ovi files also works well with this phone so its easy to transfer files between your phone and a computer.The music player is decent, I don't really use it as a primary mp3 player,but as long as you have a decent pair of headphones its fine. Call volumes are also better than any phone I've ever owned.The only problems I've had are when texting/emailing the response is a little slow, but its not really much of a problem. Also be sure to buy a micro-USB cable because there isn't one in the box.
