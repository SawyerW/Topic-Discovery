Much better than the non-smart phones offered by AT&T.; The frequency response gives clear voice with both the microphone and speaker.  The menus and address book are clear and easy to use. The Bluetooth works reliably in our cars.  The case is sturdy and convenient.  The main drawback is that the battery usually needs to be charged every 2-3 days.  The camera is limited in light level and does not capture very accurate color.  This is our 4th RAZR, I still am using my original phone with a replacement battery.  Another benefit is that we don't have to sign up for a 2 year commitment with our carrier.
