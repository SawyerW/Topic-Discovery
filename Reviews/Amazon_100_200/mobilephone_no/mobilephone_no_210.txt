I bought this phone for speakerphone and it was free (in 2004). The quality of speakerphone is satisfactory (definately better than sanyo)The battery life is very very low. It may be about one call of 40 minutes. It also doesn't give few minutes before one can notice that battery is draining because it draines within 5-8 mins once you notice 4 bars (max is 5 bars)Camera is totaly worthless as it has very blurry/grainy picture.The phone also works very slowly.In case if it's on eg. if you hit menu button by mistake it will stay on untill you exit after hours. There is no settings that can change this property and it ultimately drains batery even more quickly. And the same thing is bothersome as if you turn the alarm on but the phone turns on then the alarm will not work!!!!!!In short I would never buy a NOKIA again.
