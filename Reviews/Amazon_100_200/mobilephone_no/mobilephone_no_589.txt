I bought this phone because I was looking for something simple and easy. The product said that it was thoroughly tested for quality but after only 1 day of use I had to get rid of the phone. I am not sure what standard of measure the company was using when they said that it was working efficiently but I couldn't use the phone without severe static and feedback blasting through the receiver, even people on the other end of the phone said they could barely hear me because of the noise. After awhile of using the phone I got a headache from the noise. I took it to AT&T; and tried getting a new sim card to see if that would help. It didn't.Dissatisfied. Very.
