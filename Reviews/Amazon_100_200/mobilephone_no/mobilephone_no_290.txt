I have been a Palm user for about 5 years. My Palm 600 series was dropped and quit. I replaced it with the Palm 750.I liked the old operating system better than the windows based 750. The 750 will not sync with ACT! I have used this contact manager for 15 years and do not intend to switch. The old 600 series did sync direct with ACT!.Since I can no longer sync with ACT, my next phone will be something other than Palm. I liked Palm because of the ACT connection. I have not had much fun with the new operating system. It might be training time, but it sures feels bulky.
