Well,the phone is just ok, too bulky. My biggest disatisfaction came from the fact that I could not connect to the internet. The phone works with T-Mobile, but I use it with simple mobile. I got the phone only to learn that this particular sidekick is not compatible with the internet, simple mobile does not support it with internet use. I therefore have to buy another phone that is compatible with internet in order to make benefit of my data plan. Talk and text is fine. It is also not the best phone to navigate, just very clumpsy, can't even find a darn calculator.
