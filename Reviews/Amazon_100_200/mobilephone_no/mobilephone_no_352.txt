People, people...this is an amazing opportunity; move on it.  This phone is an EU phone that is being offered here in the US to gain market share and put the phone in the hands of the more casual user.  Go ahead, go to CNET and PCworld and check out the reviews; the E63 is typically compared with units costing 2-3 times as much.  So, it falls a bit short in some areas (camera, headphones, et al) so, it's not perfect.  For under $200, who cares?  Come on.  All current phones are obsolete in three years anyway, (or after the first drop on the airport floor)!The E63's got a vivid screen, great speaker, gets FM radio, a decent app store @ NOKIA.com, MicroSD slot, easy to sync up, great build quality and offers clear reception for TMobile, ATT and international travel, whenever we decide to do that again.  QKeyboard, ability to netsurf in hotspots w/o dataplan, US WARRANTY and by the way, currently less than $150 beans with rebate.  And no two-year contract.  Yankee Blue or Sox Red, they easily stand out among the Crackberry drones.  Wake up and smell the symbian, Baby...getting a great deal is the hot trend.
