This works amazingly well. Buy the card from Amazon. You will receive a rather nondescript piece of paper by Priority Mail which you may have to sign for. Then search the web for the best promo code that applies to a 400 minute card. The one I found gave 250 minutes bonus.  When you add the minutes via the phone web site, just fill in the number you receive from Amazon and the discount code you have found on the web and your minutes are added instantly. I have a double minute phone so I got double the minutes (400X2) plus a bonus of 250, so I received 1050 minutes from the card. Also, you save the sales tax on the minutes by buying from Amazon instead of direct.
