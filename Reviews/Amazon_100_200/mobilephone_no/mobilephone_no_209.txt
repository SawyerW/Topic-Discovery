I agree with the gentleman who had the comment on the poor battery performance. I had this phone about 10 days ago and I noticed this problem already. The camera has a poor quality as well. You can see strange shining from the high lighted part of the picture. The most serious problem would be the poor battery performance. I took a test on this cell phone since I got this cell phone new. It can only last about 3 days w/t any call or camera use, and the call time could only last less than a hour. After the a call, the phone will die very soon. which means you'll have to get the travel charger wherever you go. Its battery life is even worse than my old NOkia cellphone. I'm returning it.
