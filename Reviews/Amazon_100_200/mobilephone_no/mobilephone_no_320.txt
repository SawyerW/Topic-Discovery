I bought my unlocked iphone3gs from Apple for $375. It came with charger, Usb, and earphones. It is SO easy to use.I can use it as a regular phone or a smartphone. I have no problems with it at all. It's the first smartphone I've owned and  I'm delighted with it's ease of use.I'd recommend Apple's unlocked iPhone3GS for those who do not want an expensive monthly data plan and also for those who travel. It's simple to swap out the simcard. Added bonus, it comes with the new ios5!Update, two years down the road and my iPhone3gs is still going strong. It automatically gets any new software updates and I've never had any problems with my phone. I live it because it has some structure and weight to it. I do not like these new thinner and lightweight iphones. I'm going to keep using my iP3gs for as long as it will last.Side-note: some techy compared all the iPhone models out there from the earliest to the latest and the ip3gs was just a smidg slower at booting-up/loading/shutting down than the iPhone5. It fared better than all the others!
