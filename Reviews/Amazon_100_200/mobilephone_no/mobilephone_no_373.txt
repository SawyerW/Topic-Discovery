I've had this phone for over a year and I'm proud to say that I absolutely LOVE it! There haven't been ANY issues!!!! I'm SOOO amazed!!!!Unlike a lot of other people who are willing to shell out over $300/500 for a Blackberry or an iPhone, I'd personally rather use the extra money to pay off my school loans. When I first got this phone, I prayed that it wouldn't break because I forgot to get a warranty, so I was VERY careful with downloads from the internet, uploading pictures, dropping the phone, etc... but after a while I just got used to having this phone and never really had to give extra care and it's still fine.The benefits of this phone is that I didn't have to pay too much for it, the applications on the phone is amazing and  temporarily replaced my laptop when it broke and I can not only use this for personal use...I can also use this for school.I give this 10 thumbs up!!!
