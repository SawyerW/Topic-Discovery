To start, the phone is a very nice phone.  It comes with many features, feels solid and high quality in your hands, and it is small and stylish with a large color screen.  The drawlback of the phone are that the display is hard to see in bright light.  Also, it can be hard to use until you get used to all the menus and such.  Overall, this phone is an excellent phone and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.But ATT tested my anger managment skills.  They charged more than the starting price and added on all the extra cost features that I didn't ask for!  They also charged 88 dollars for roaming when I went to New York!  The service also isnt very good.  sometimes it switches to the cingular tower or the verizon tower.  It's your money, and I would go with T-mobile personally.  Better yet, Verizon.
