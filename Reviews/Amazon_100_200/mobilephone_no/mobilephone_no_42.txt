I received this phone from Sprint as a replacement for an LG 5350 which the Sprint store "killed" while doing a firmware upgrade.  The only good thing I can say about this phone is the reception is generally excellent.  The Sanyo software is really awfull compared to Samsung & LG - you can have only 8 speed dials!  They told me it came with an "extended" battery.  I thought the battery life looked good until I actually made a couple of 20-minute calls, then bam - the battery is dead.  The battery gets quite warm after about 5 minutes of talking.  The camera is not something I really care about.  It is kind of cool though to have a person's picture pop up when they call you.  The ringers are lousy (they're all that way now as they want you to pay to download ringers).
