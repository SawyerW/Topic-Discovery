I purchased 2 phones which supposed to be new. One of them worked fine, the second one  was not new. It was damaged. The SIM Card holder was missing a contact. The phone was not unlocked. I contacted the vendor's direct phone line and they never got back with me. I already spent $75.00 in getting it to work. I am currently in the Dominican Republic where I brought both phones as a gift to relatives. I will be back in the US this Saturday and will write a detail review. Again this was the worst online purchase I ever made.
