After 4 days of use, I can say that I love this phone - especially for the price. It is not as sophisticated as an Iphone (but what else is?) All the GUI aspects of the phone work perfectly. I read several reviews where the users were having trouble removing the back cover. They must have not read the directions or looked at the cover. The little arrow suggests that you slide it in a specific direction - pretty simple and you will not break the case as some have suggested if you do it the right way. The call quality and ability to pair up with bluetooth devices has been very good, too.For the budget concious, who don't need every possible bell and whistle, but who want a good smartphone that works well, this is your baby.
