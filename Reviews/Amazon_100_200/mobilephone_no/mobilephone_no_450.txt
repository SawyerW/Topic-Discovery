I just bought a Virgin Mobile Account for my son, who often goes weeks without using his phone. With the one year plan, I don't have to worry about the minutes expiring while the phone lies unused in his sock drawer; and since the phone has triple minutes, I spent $79.00 and ended up with a total 1400 minutes after entering the card pin number and promotional code for an additional 200 minutes.  This will probably be enough to last him for the entire year. It sure beats the $19.99/month we were spending to include him on our Sprint Family Plan.
