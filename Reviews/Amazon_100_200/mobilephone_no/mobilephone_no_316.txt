The first phone got hot and the battery discharged in 4 hours from a full charge, so I returned it.  I tried to update the software in the second phone on the Apple site and was given an error 1015, which stated the error can occur when an unauthorized modification to the IOS has occurred, also the phone could not be restored.  I called Apple and gave them the serial number.  Apple advised me the phone was NOT NEW (as stated on the web page) and the warranty had expired some time ago.  They sold it to a company in europe March 19, 2003.  Further APPLE stated they NEVER sold ANY UNLOCKED iPhones prior to the iPhone 4 and had NOT unlocked this phone (as stated on the web page).
