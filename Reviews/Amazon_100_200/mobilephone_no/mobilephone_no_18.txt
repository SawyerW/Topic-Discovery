I have had no problems with this phone.  I use it quite frequently and have had no problems with it.  I think if you take care of the phone and use it in a normal fashion, the phone will last as long as any other phone, and I have tried a lot of phones!  The flip phone is great as it allows you to save the life of the key pad.  I would reccomend this product, and feel very comfortable in doing so.  I think most of the problems arise from the carrier and how helpful they are in correcting problems.  Choose the right company and you will be happy! I chose a wireless carrier with a Month-to-Month option and can cancel service anytime without any cancellation fees.  Maybe that's the way to go.
