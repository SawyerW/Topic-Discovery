This is my first foray with Nextel. I have had service with cingular(w/Motorola accompli 009),verizon(w/Motorola t720)and a short-lived stint with t-mobile(w/motorola v300). Out of all the phones and services,Nextel is the best for me. The phone is fantastic. Beautiful color screen and a very nice platinum outer finish. Its bigger than my previous phones, but it fits nicely to my ear and the phone feels more durable. I was please to find out this phone has a one touch direct connect, which is a real cool feature. The speaker is real loud-much louder than my boyfriends i95cl, and I can honestly say the earpiece has better reception (RF). Also the telenav feature is a very nice touch,I recently moved to Seattle and its helped me out tremendously. This phone is also feature-rich(JAVA,airplane mode,voice notes,datebook,the ability to give diffrent ringtones on your contacts etc..) I highly recommend this phone to anyone, but I wish it had a status light.
