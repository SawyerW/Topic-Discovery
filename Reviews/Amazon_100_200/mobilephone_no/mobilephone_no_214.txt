I have had 9 different Sprint phones in a little over two years and 8 of those phones were between January 2004 and October 2004.  The first was a LG, the next 7 were Samsungs and the 9th and final is the Sanyo 8200.  This is the best phone I've ever had.  Sometimes, Sprint's service is crappy, but this phone is great.  It's the only Sprint phone that I would recommend.  Get either color, silver, red or blue and you won't be disappointed.  Just stay away from a Samsung phone, especially the VGA 620 and VGA 1000.  Just go with this phone.  It has great sound, takes great pictures and the speaker phone and ready link make talking so much easier.
