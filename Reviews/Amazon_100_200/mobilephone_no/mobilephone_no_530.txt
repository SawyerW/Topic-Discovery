I am having this phone for past 1.5 years now.Features of this phone are really impressive (1.2 MP camera with sliding cover, Symbian OS, Office application etc.)It is little bit heavier than other smartphone (Blackberry Pearls, Sony Walkman). Keys are also very small and sometime troublesome to operate.However biggest problem with this phone is that it has that so called "morning sickness" problem. Phone gets frozen or automatically switches off every 4-5 days. I have all the latest firmware and so but that could not solve the problem.I was Nokia fan and all my previous phone were from Nokia. But I am very disappointed with this phone.
