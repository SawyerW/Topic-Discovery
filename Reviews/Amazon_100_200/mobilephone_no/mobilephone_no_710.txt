Used this phone for about 20 days & to be honest, I was looking for an excuse to keep it...But i returned it at last...Pros: Great design,  Cool camera for daylight,  Sound quality is good.Cons: Applications run slow, shut down in the middle of the function,  WiFi is horrible, it cuts itself off from the internet, could not use an uninterrupted internet using WiFi.  Night photograph quality is not good.  Could not run two applications at the same time without getting stuck.There are some other features i did not like but that is my personal opinion. Anybody may like those.I am not sure that whether the one that i used had these problems or all of the Nokia N8 phones have the same problems. I have been using Nokia phones since 2000 and this was my first touchscreen phone from Nokia. I was really looking forward to use this phone.
