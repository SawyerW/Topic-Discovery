I bought this camera/phone primarily for the camera.  I wanted a pocketable video/still camera that would deliver good quality videos that would not disappoint when viewed on a TV and pictures I could include on my signature photo-collages.  The video quality is quite good as viewed on my computer monitor.  I have not yet printed any stills, but the screen quality is also quite good.  The photos are sharp and detailed with no noticeable color fringing.  The shutter lag is acceptable when pre-focusing is done.  The only problem I had was with taking video with too many other apps open.  I got sound, but the frames froze, probably due to lack of free memory for processing the video frames.Angry birds plays well on this phone. Hard to keep it out of my 3 and 5 year old kids hands due to this.Oh, and by the way, the phone works well too.
