This item was sold as NEW. The phone ONLY works while plugged in to an outlet. The screen does NOT register the fact that there is a battery installed. It completed 2 phone calls abroad. It was purchased and immediately sent to Spain, where my daughter is at school. We talked on it twice. It has not held a charge or shown a battery present since. Tried different battery - which was also sold as NEW from a different seller, that didn't work either.-My original feed back was pulled as it was stated it was a not a reflection of the seller, I feel deceived by the SELLER because the product did not live up to expectation.-I purchased this phone because we had RAZR's in the past.  They were excellent units and performed perfectly.
