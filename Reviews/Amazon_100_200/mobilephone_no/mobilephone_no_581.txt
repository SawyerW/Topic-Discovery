So I have had a V3i noir for a long time. It was quite the fashion statement when it first came out in mid 2000s. Unfortunately my phone finally gave up and died last month. Despite already having an iPhone, I realized I can not really live without my V3i, so I ordered another one from this seller.Bottom line, this is NOT the original phone released by Motorola. Everything about is off and feels cheaply made and they haven't even made any efforts to make it look legit. For example the user manual is quite clearly made by stapling a bunch of black and white photocopied sheets! And as another reviewer mentioned, the battery looks completely random, perhaps recycled with a sticker glued on it.I have contacted the seller for a refund and I will update this review to tell you about the customer service.
