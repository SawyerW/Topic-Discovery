This phone works everywhere in the world,  (anywhere there is GSM service)  Being unlocked, you can use local Simm cards in each country, or purchase an international simm card.  The Simm card slot is very easily accessible, too (no need to pull out batteries, ect.)  The Palm pilot is great, and very useful for travelers with many currency conversion, language softwares available for it.  Texting from a Treo is way easier than typical mobile phones, because you have a full keyboard.  International SMS (text) messages are typically very affordable, too, and a great way to keep in touch while abroad without spending alot on airtime..i highly recommend this treo for overseas travellers.  If you're staying in the states, this phone will work well with Cingular or T mobile too.Price is reasonable because the the treo 650 and 700 are now out.  the 650 adds bluetooth, and a removable battery.  the 700 uses microsoft software instead of palm software.  (i am a huge fan of the palm software for organizing my life..)But unlocked versions of these newer models are at least $200-300 more in price, and the 600 works great.  Battery life is fine because its a GSM phone.
