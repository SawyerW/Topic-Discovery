I love this phone. I wanted one so bad the first time I saw it. I've owned my Shine for 4 years now. It has literally been through hell and high water. It's been dropped, kicked, stepped on, sat on, thrown, drowned in a toilet and it still works perfectly. It's got it's scratches and dings but it's still pretty and shiny. I've never had a case for it. I still have the original battery but it needs to be replaced now because it gets low and starts beeping at me after using it a lot in one day but will stay on for a few days when not used often. When I got my new LG Prime and the calibration went out after a month, I went back to my Shine. I would like to get a new phone so that I can save my Shine as a back up phone but I just don't think I can find a phone that's as durable. Perhaps I should just buy a new Shine since I enjoy it so much.
