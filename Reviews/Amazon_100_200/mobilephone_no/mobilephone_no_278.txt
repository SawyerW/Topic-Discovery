I got this phone a couple of months ago once my old nokia died, literally.  I've owned several nokias and I always feel very familiar with the menus.  Although the battery life isn't that wonderful, I don't mind charging it daily.  I love the look of it.  It's display is amazing.  The only thing I'm not really fond of is that when you take out the micro sd card to add anything to it, if you don't have the usb cable (which i couldn't find anywhere when i bought the phone), you have to reset all the pictures and ringtones that were linked to people.  Anyway, I love this phone.
