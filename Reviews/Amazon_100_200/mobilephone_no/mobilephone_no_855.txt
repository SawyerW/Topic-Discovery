This phone is really neat and a great eye catcher the problem is the screen resolution. I honestly thought that it wouldn't bother me when I read it on other reviews, but it did. It's as if they took the resolution and graphics of a 2005 flip phone and put android on it. The keyboard feels cheap and, for me, is difficult to type on but I'm used to keyboard such as the ones on the LG Doubleplay and Palm Pre. I like to use it occasionally because it's really cute but it's not something I could use full time. The battery doesn't last very long as stated in other reviews. For example it was fully charged at 12 when I went to bed and by 6 am with no use, it was dead.
