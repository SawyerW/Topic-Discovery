I would like to warn T-Mobile subscribers to stay away from this phone.I bought it and used it for 3-4 weeks before finally returning it.  I should explain the 3-4 weeks delay by underscoring I loved everything about this phone (granted, I didn't try/need all the features, so some of the complaints may be legitimate), but as a phone it (reception) simply sucked.  I had been using previously, and reverted to a Nokia E51, excellent phone, and reception, even on T-Mobile (my E51 is an unlocked Singaporean model, so the bands don't necessarily match T-Mobile's).I will miss the E75's keyboard mostly, but the device is very feature rich, as everyone details herein.  If only it also functioned as well as the E51 as a phone... on the T-Mobile network.
