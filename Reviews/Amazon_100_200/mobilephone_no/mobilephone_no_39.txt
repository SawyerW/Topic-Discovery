i got this phone when it first came out; and at the time this was the lowest priced flip camera phone. i love the feel, and how easy it is to use. besides the fact that sprint's service is getting worse by the day, the only problems i am having with the phone is it gets hot when i'm on it for more than fifteen minutes, the battery life is a little below average, and it tends to shut off and turn back on by itself when i'm in the middle of using my vision service. the phone is decent, but i am pretty ticked about sprint service.
