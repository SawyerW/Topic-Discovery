Unfortunately I have to say, the product arrived damaged or defective me, I get to touch damaged, when I opened the package, take the phone powered ON it with much emotion, lit it and I saw a line on the screen that I found rather odd, I started using it and Tacti malfunctioning, applications took me until I realized it was not me, was the PHONE NOKIA E6-00, which is really disappointing, the first purchase I do in the amazon store and I the product arrives damaged, you tell me now I can think of me from the store, and exacerbating this situation is that I'm from Venezuela and the cost and return shipping process is complicated, but will do my best to return it because it may be possible to buy a new product arrives damaged box and I hope to obtain a prompt solution to my BIG PROBLEM!!This comment should be without stars ...!!!
