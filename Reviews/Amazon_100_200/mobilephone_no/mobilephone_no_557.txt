So after ordering this phone I read some of the reviews here about it and for the most part people were really hard on the phone. Though Hot Pink really isn't my colour I never the less loved this phone. I bought it to go on holiday to Europe and used it everyday to stay intouch with home. It got reception everywhere I was staying and even though I kept the phone on day in and day out the battery lasted a longtime over the course of the week I only had to charge it once and that was just to be on the safe side when I was flying back to Canada.This phone is cute, takes up little to no space, gets clear reception even in the middle of nowhere and has fantastic battery life.I would definitely recommend this phone.
