I have this phone for about 10 months.  The calls are clear in many places where I can't get my other service to work. I have dropped it numerous times on our concrete driveway and never had a problem other than a few scratches from the impact.  A few weeks ago I even dropped it in our pool.  As it stopped working, I called a local authorized repair shop and they told me it could not be repaired.  To save the $200 they wanted to charge me for a new phone and sign up to a new contract, I open it up and dried it well and a couple of days later it was working as before. This is the best phone I ever had!
