I have been a Tracphone user for years. I don't use my phone for much else except phone calls and emergencies while on the road, so Tracphone fits me just right. The price and the rollover minutes keep me coming back. And I very rarely drop a call. I once lost my cellphone while hiking, and when I bought a new one, Tracphone replaced the minutes I had lost, and took my word for the amount of time, and replaced it. When the phone was recovered a year later by another hiker, it still worked, and I found I had overestimated by a couple of hundred minutes. They were very supportive and gave me no trouble at all. I would definitely recommend them to anybody.
