I have had this phone for almost a week, and unlike all others I have tried this on works in my home which has very poor cell service.  I would have to go outside to use other phones.  I tried a Razr and it would not even work well enough inside the house for it to wring in and I could run outside to take the call.  This phone works in my home!  It is clear and has not dropped a call!  As for battery it last a few days and it is a quick charge so I do not have a problem with that,,and since this is my only phone (no home phone) I am very satisfied with it so far.  That said I have a camera so that is just something that I would use in an emergency and don't care that much about rings, as long as it is loud enough and it is.  Some others may want all the bells and whistles but if you live or travel to a place with poor cell service this is YOUR Phone!  The sleek design is a plus!
