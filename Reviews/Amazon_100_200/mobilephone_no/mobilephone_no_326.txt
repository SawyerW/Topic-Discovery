I had the following notes ..1. The delivery was as I expected ... No delay2. The item as described new .. Except that the outer cover was for iPhone 3GS and not for 3G and this made no difference ..3. The phone was unlocked as described and working on our local networks in Iraq ... Firstly I had a problem with that but the seller was so helpful and help me to resolve that problem as he send me emails and call me day and night to solve that ... I recommend this merchandise as I did not leave you back and he try to help you with your purchase ...4. It is so useful to find an iPhone with that price and newness despite apple stoping his production a couple of years ago ..
