I bought this RAZR V3 several years ago.  The color was wrong, but the style and price were right ($59).  The camera is worthless, and battery life is poor.  However, I have dropped it several times, and once it slid across the car dash, went out the window, and got run over by another car.  The battery door came off, so I put it back on.  That was a year ago.  It still works fine.I wish the camera worked, especially in dim light.  And I wish the battery life was closer to the Philips phones sold in Asia (a month standby time and 8+ hours talk time).  I have no use for most apps, so I'm considering a Motorola V3XX even though it's not of the latest phone generation.I recommend the RAZR V3 if just making calls is what you want it for.  Just keep an extra battery around.November 2012: My RAZR V3 died (after four years of abuse), but it served well.
