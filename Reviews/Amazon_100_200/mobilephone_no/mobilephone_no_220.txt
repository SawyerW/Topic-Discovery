I purchased my Sanyo 8200, and Qwest service, 13 months ago.  Over the last few weeks I've experienced these SAME issues others mention here (I came online to find a replacement phone and then I began reading the reviews).  How it never keeps a charge, the beeping when the charging pin is in as if it is being plugged and unplugged, starting a call with a "full" batterly then the phone dieing after 20 minutes because the battery is dead.  I was baffled and called for service, and they said perhaps it was exposed to humidity (I live in the desert) or perhaps I carried it too close to my body and it was exposed to  moisture (huh?).My warranty was up 3 weeks before I called, so they wont replace it, I have to buy another at retail.  I had my last phone, a Kyocera, for over 5 years and NEVER had a problem.For such an expensive phone, you would think it could last more than a year.A big thumbs down.
