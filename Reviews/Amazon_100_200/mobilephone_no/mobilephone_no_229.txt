I was looking for phone w/ good functionality. I could careless about the bells and whistles. Custom ringtones, screensavers, games? Who cares! I remember when phones were just phones. But I must confess this time around I wanted a camera in my phone. I'm always using my digital camera but because it's so big and bulky (plus who wants to drag around a digicam when you're in a poolhall or bar?) I rarely have it with me. After doing my homework I settled on the 8200 and wow was I ever impressed! The camera works great but obviously it can't compare to my 4MP digicam. But whenever I need a camera I can always count on my phone being there w/ me. The rest of the phone is great. The menu is intuitive and very easy to use. The speakerphone is clear and web browsing just as good. Although navigation can be kind of tricky at times. Overall a very well balanced phone. I highly recommend this!
