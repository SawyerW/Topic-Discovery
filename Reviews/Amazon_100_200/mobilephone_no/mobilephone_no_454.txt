Buying this 1-year Tracfone card from Card-Art, one of the "Fulfillment by Amazon" vendors at a price under $70 with free S&H; simply can't be beat. It arrived very quickly and as expected, the code added a year and 800 minutes (I'm another of the Double Minutes for Life Tracfone folks) with no problems at all.As at least one other reviewer noted, we're talking about our rating of the 1-year Tracfone card and the vendor at Amazon from which we bought it. The negative reviews are from folks who don't like Tracfone. Well, duh!, why would someone who hates Tracfones as a cell phone provider want to buy another 1-year of service which is what this card offers and what we're supposed to be reviewing.5 stars to Card Art and any other Amazon vendor who has such great customer service and low pricing![Update Feb 2012] One year later I bought my second 1-yr card, once again through Amazon Seller CartArt. As expected, the card activated as expected with no problems. The card this year was $75, $5 more than last year--but still $25 less than retail and with free shipping, it remains a great deal. Thanks, CardArt!
