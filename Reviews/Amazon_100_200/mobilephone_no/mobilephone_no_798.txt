Having lived overseas for awhile, I wanted a U.S. spec. unlocked phone in which I could freely replace SIM cards.  After looking at a few other brands, I decided to go for the Nokia N8.  I was impressed by the camera, and its voice navigation and maps features.  The phone is sometimes a bit slow to respond, but all it takes is a reset every once in awhile.  Also, since pre-paid SIM cards are pretty standard in many countries,  I would recommend this phone for international travelers and for expatriates that don't want to spend a ton of money for cellular phone service.  The SIM card is easily replaced by popping it out of the left side of the phone.
