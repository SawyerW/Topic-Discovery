I bought the pink motorola razor 2 months ago. About 2 weeks after I bought the phone it started locking up.  The keypad would not work. Powering the phone off did not work.  I took the phone back to the T-mobile store and was told I had to contact Motorola.  The next day it started working again.  It had intermittant lock ups, and made beeping noises on it's own.  3 days ago, it locked up and is still not working.  I had to buy a new phone.  Motorola nor T-Mobile would replace it.  Both say it has to have been dropped or has water damage, and neither of these is the case.Lesson learned, not everything that is pretty on the outside is pretty on the inside.  Save your money, get a better quality phone.
