We bought two of these with two trac phones and LOVE them...great place to order them from because they are a bit cheaper than in the stores and they were delivered promptly.  What a wonderful alternative to the expensive DRoid or iPhone...my kids love them and it costs me less when I buy the one year of service with each phone...with triple minutes. CAn't beat it. The phone keeps track of how many minutes are left so my kids know how much they have left....they manage the minutes themselves as I only buy them enough for one year or they have to get another card themselves.  It is much more affordable than Droid.
