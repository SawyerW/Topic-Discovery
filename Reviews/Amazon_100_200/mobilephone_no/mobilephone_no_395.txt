I like having a basic flip phone. I want to be able to text occasionally, take pictures if I forgot my camera, and get clear calls. This phone fits the bill. I have had mine for a few years. I got an upgrade to another basic model and within a week switched back to this one. I am so excited to see that I can still get this phone if mine ever dies. I tell people that I will switch from this phone when it is certified dead. It has never butt-dialed anyone, it's easy to adjust the settings, takes fairly decent pictures and holds one of those mini-data cards. Best of all, I am not required to have a data plan with this phone (very rare these days!).I really can't say enough good about this phone!
