This phone was ordered at the height of xmas orders. It came within a few days of order placement. The item came as described. We were delighted that these phones are still available because the newer phone that we were using didn't meet our needs. We had a question about the product when it arrived. We e-mailed the company and they responded immediately; after a few e-mails, the question was settled. I would definitely buy from this company again as they are efficient and trustworthy. LG VX8300 for Verizon Wireless in Black - No Contract Required If you do order the phone, you will probably have to call Verizon to transfer your number to it, as it didn't go through as Verizon on-line directs. The customer service at Verizon was surprised that we had an "old" phone! Batteries for this should be ordered on line, which this company sells. Verizon charges a crazy amount of money for a battery ( I had to emergency buy one during Sandy) that is under $10.00 on-line.
