I have had this phone since 2009 and it has worked great for the last almost 4 years. Battery life is still great, I get almost a week out of a full charge still to this day. I use the phone a couple times a day. One feature I like is the ability to lock the keys since it would be easy to accidentally push buttons since it is a bar phone. Can't comment on texting and web access, I do neither on a cell. I gave 4 stars because the keys are a bit small, otherwise has been a great phone!
