One of two of ours went white screen after 4 plus years of hard use.  Ordered here and received it within a few days-fast.  The phone is NEW.  good purchase.Pros. Reliable, good volume, small.Now for the cons.  Battery life is two days,  my wifes was the same (expect her new one to be no different). Tried new battery's with the same results.  Thats if you are mostly on standby and do not play with any of the menu settings or actually get or make some calls.  Then it needs recharging daily.  The dialup buttons are definitely in the way as they want you online to spend your bucks.  Camera is very poor. Bottom line, there's almost no competition nowadays in the sensible dumb phone market, so all in all its not bad.  Beats packing something the size of a smart phone around as some of us more mature folks just want to make actual phone calls.  For the hearing impaired go to menu/settings/phone/T coil mode and change to ON.Why do I rate it so high after saying what I did?  Well, after using the 777 all of the others went into the dresser drawer and will stay.
