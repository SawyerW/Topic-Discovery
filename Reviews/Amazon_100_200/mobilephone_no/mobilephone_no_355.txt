This is my first smartphone, and I can't beleive I waited this long to migrate from my old Razor. Pairing an unlocked smartphone with the ATT family data plan keeps the montly cost down.Pros: Call quality, Wi-Fi (works great at home and office), Keyboard, email set-up, VPN/intranet access, bluetooth, FM radio, Real Player, Maps, Opera browser (downloaded app), huge battery.Cons: no external button to quickly silence the ringer, hard to unlock while driving (2 key sequence), only 6 application Icons on main screen, screen a bit small.Overall: Very happy with the phone. I recommend it to anyone looking for a cost effective smartphone.
