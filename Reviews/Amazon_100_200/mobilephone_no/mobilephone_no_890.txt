When I first got this phone, I was very excited about the features, etc. But as I've used it more and more, it's gone downhill. The phone often freezes up, going to a green screen and then dying, or sometimes only freezing and forcing me to take out the battery. Also, sometimes it simply will not make a call, and has to be turned off and on again in order to work.The scroll ball on the right of the phone has already gone out, and the memory for messages is terrible, holding only 100 total. Putting in a memory card doesn't help, either. Also, the camera doesn't work unless you have a SD card in the phone. Even then, sometimes it fails to save the pictures to the memory.I should mention that I am not a smartphone user, so I'm not used to a phone with a lot of features, but even my expectations were sorely disappointed with this phone.Please, save your money and get a  phone that will last longer and doesn't have the major glitches this phone does. It's not worth the $50.
