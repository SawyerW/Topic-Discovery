I bought this phone on New Year's Eve 2011, I've been using it for exactly one month. All in all I would say I'm very satisfied of the features included. The touch screen works! the qwerty typing experience is very good, thought it would be nice to have the qwerty keyboard in the portrait (vertical) position too.. From time to time, quite rarely though, the screen does hang for a sec or two.. it's irritating when that happens. However, I have seen that on Iphones and androids too.Taking into consideration the really cheap price, and the great camera, I would recommend this phone
