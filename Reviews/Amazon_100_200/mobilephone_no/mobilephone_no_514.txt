I transitioned from a regular cell phone and a palm vx to this treo 600. The 650 was not available at that time.This phone works great. It crapped out once and all data was lost (synch backup a week before). Otherwise it works great.Pluses:- Palm functionality integrated well with phone functionality.- SD Card reader- Camera- backlight keyboardMinuses:- Very slow data transfer via synch - instead transfer via sd card- low res screen- camera is pretty poor in quality, but comparable to some first generation camera phones- small keyboard buttons- need adapter to use headphones- very low volume speaker and poor quality speakerphone- No graffiti pad- Not bluetooth or Wifi (although I heard you can get a wifi sd card)I would highly recommend you get a nice case to protect this phone and screen protectors to minimize damage to the screen.
