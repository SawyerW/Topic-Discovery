I have had this phone for almost a year now, and although the signal reception is great, the sound quality on this phone is HORRIBLE!  I have to ask the person calling me to repeat themselves at least once every call because the voice quality is so muddy.  My wife has a different (and cheaper) phone and it sounds MUCH better.  The only reason I have put up with it this long is I do not use my phone very often.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.  This phone sounds worse than any other phone I have owned.  Stay away from this phone!!!
