I've had this phone for 2 months. The camera is great, as advertised; I used it on a trip to Europe and didn't regret not bringing a digital camera. The reception and voice quality are excellent -- far better than my iPhone 3GS. The GPS works offline with voiceover turn-by-turn directions and OVI maps for visuals. Very good calendar with integrated To-Dos. The recent Symbian Anna update has made the OS a bit more user friendly, although it's still far from iOS.Overall, this is a very good smartphone. Its main deficiencies are limited and somewhat clunky apps. But I don't need a phone for slick apps -- I have an iPad. This gives me what I was looking for: good telephony, great camera, free GPS, unlocked phone that works on all U.S. and European GSM networks.
