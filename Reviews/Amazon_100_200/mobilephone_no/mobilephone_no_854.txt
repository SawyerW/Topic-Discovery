My friend got me this Motorola Flipout phone few days ago, the phone was unlocked and I also test the phone at friends house everything works fine. The only thing I need to do to set up this phone is an google account, it use google acount to unlock the home screen. When I got home I tried with my own sim everything is different. It's showing another message on the home screen"SIM CARD IS REMOVED OR CHANGED. LOG IN TO YOUR MOTOBLUR ACCOUNT TO UNLOCK". I did tried to use my google acount to unlock this phone like the first time but it doesn't work. And I don't have the MOTOBLUR account. I also try with friends account and still did not work. So I got stuck! A phone like this can only can be use for one time...
