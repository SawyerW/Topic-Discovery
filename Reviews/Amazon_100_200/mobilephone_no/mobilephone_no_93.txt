I tried for 3 weeks to get service for my Nokia 3300 phone.  AT&T and Amazon kept pointing fingers at each other, and finally Amazon told me to send the phone back, then order a new one. I sent the phone back w/out ordering a new one (one time shame on you, two times shame on me), and I'M PRAYING THAT I ACTUALLY GET MY MONEY BACK.  The phone seems pretty nice especially for the price, but alas it was too good to be true. I may just go to the AT&T store where I can get face to face service and instant activation.
