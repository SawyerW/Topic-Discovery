Great phone alot better then sprint! Setting it up with the 800 # Well let's say pack a LUNCH! It took me 4 hours on the phone, and six different people to get connected! They need alot of work on that! After all said and done great phone, great coverage, walkie talkie feature breaks up now and then, but is really quick talking back and forth.No alarm clock? would be nice! if had to activate again would take it to a nextel dealer to do it instead of calling it in! nice pic on colored screen, games look nice.thinking of an upgrade to the i730, GPS but no alarm clock? a full feature phone with GPS to take you anywhere but NO alarm clock to wake you up  when your there? I go camping and 4 wheeling where the GPS would come in handy and so would the ALARM CLOCK! think they might get the message and make it a downloadable  feature! HOPE THIS HELPS!
