This is the best option for someone stuck on a contract an wants to switch their phone for cheap. It arrived within 3 days and is working fantastic. Super fast, crisp screen, and for a heavy texter like me a great experience. The only thing is it's no linfer a 3G phone, tmobile removed the data. The phone works excellent without it though, no delayed texts, nothing. Make sure to buy a separate memory card as there is none included, if you plan to take more than five pictures and use the media player. The battery comes pretty mug completely empty, dont expect to play with your new toy right away, as it needs tocharge for around 4 hours. I did not lose any of my contacts after turning the phone off or taking out the battery, as I am an existing tmobile customer. The camera flash is very bright. Overall, I recommend it to anyone. Best phone for text & call plans. When you turn it on it asks to set up 3G, just select talk and text plan.
