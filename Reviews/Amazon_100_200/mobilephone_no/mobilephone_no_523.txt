Before I Buy ANYTHING, I always do my research and read EVERY review. I knew this was the phone I was going to get and when I got it, it was MUCH better than I expected.First I Like that its big and bulky. People seem to forget that TOO SMALL and THIN means easy to lose and fragile. I like that I can feel this phone at all times but its not so big that it protrudes. EVERYONE loves this phone.It is AMAZINGLY customizable, I can upload MP3s after installing the easy to use software it runs just like a Digital Camera. I can use MP3s as ringers change phone themes, Camera works really well, sounds great, bluetooth is nice if you have a good headset, and MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL RECEPTION IS AMAZING. I Went from VERIZON to CINGULAR in the NYC area and I can barely tell the difference which Im sure there is but its hard to tell.Razr is a good phone too but If you want to be a little different from everyone else, go with this.
