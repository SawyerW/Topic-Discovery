I really liked to keep this phone. The 720 MHz processor is a breeze. Initially I had problems with battery life but once I did a factory reset and let the battery drain fully and recharged it to 100%, I was easily getting one full day of moderate use. I would recommend not to install any app killers on this one as it seems to drain the battery. I use my phone for email and some browsing. The Universal inbox was quite good but the stock android browser was lacking. I installed DolphinHD browser and it was quite good. The only problem I had and the reason I am returning is because once a week the screen gets stuck at the orange logo and I had to remove the battery to get it out of the jam. This especially happens when ever I use the head phones supplied with the device.
