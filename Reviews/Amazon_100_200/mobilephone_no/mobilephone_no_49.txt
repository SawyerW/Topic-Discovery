I went from a Samsung N200 with Sprint service to this T616 with AT&T and am soooo much happier!My Samsung was dropping calls, showing no signal strength, and cutting out so bad I could only hear every couple words of the conversation.So I got this phone and what a difference! The sound is crisp and CLEAR. It sounds like a land-line phone, unlike my Samsung which made conversations sound as if the phone was buried in a snowdrift or something.The phone aesthetically is much cuter than the picture makes it look.  It is small and thin and the color display is excellent!  It has more options than I need and the camera is quite decent considering it is built into a cell phone.  I love that I can take a picture of someone and add it to their profile so when the call me their picture comes up on the screen.It came with alot of ring tones, none of which I particularly enjoyed (save for the "antique telephone" ringing sound), so I downloaded one.  The sound quality itself is very good.If I had this to do all over again I would still buy this great little phone!
