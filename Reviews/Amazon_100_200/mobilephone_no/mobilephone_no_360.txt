Got this item 3 months ago and finally decided to review it.Unlocked is good since my mobile provider is LIME.Price is good.Full QWERTY keyboard is good.Camera could be better but I usually have my SLR with me so it does not affect my rating of this product.Vibration is acceptable but could be better.It is a Nokia so you know it is easy to use, everything is right where you would want it to be.Get a case and a screen protector.Battery life is good (with bluetooth turned off and wifi scanning off)I use bluetooth to transfer videos, MP3s,photos and other stuff to and from my computer, so not having a data cable does not affect my rating.It is an over all good product.
