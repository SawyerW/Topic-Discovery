The Jitterbug is a basic phone, no email, no IM, no internet access at all. As a matter of fact, it doesn't have a sim card ...which means neither Verizon nor AT&T; can support it. I went with Great Call [...] as the access provider -- it may be through Sprint (?), but the billing is thru Great Call; it's fine, not a ripoff, but just make sure you know what you're getting when you buy the phone!The phone and its service are targeted to older individuals: big buttons, an honest-to-goodness dial tone, a medication reminder service, a 24/7 advice nurse, no contract ... see what I mean?Also, I changed my mind about the color I wanted and Amazon said it was too late to change the order; I e-mailed Jitterbug and they were happy to cancel the white phone for the graphite one. Nice, guize!
