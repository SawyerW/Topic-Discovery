I've had my phone for a little over a year.  It gradually stopped taking charge from the pin charger that came with the phone, and would say it was full when the battery was completely empty!  It would beep to charge and then uncharge and at first it was ok, but it got so bad that it stopped charging at all!  I also have problems with redialing and calls being forwarded straight to voicemail and way too many lost calls.  The phone gets hot when talking on it for more than 20 minutes and it takes 2 minutes to open text messages and another few minutes to send them.  Half the time my friends don't even get the text messages I send, esp. if it is a reply message!  I have been to the Sprint Store only to be told that the phone is not defective if the other charging port works!  They tried to sell me the other type of charger, instead of using insurance exchange program...  Very disappointed with phone and service!!!
