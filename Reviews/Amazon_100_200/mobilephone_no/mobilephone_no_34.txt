Being the type who said he would never have a cellular phone, my wife and I went ahead and took the plunge about a year ago and bought matching 8100s--and let me say we're now the converted.  This picture phone has paid for itself in so many different ways, including, but not limited to; international calling plan (SPRINT PCS) which has great quality of reception, been used in several emergency situations, the camera-function has allowed us to send fun and important photos back and forth.  The only complaint we have is that the battery tends to die quickly with a lot of use - and it does not give much warning before just shutting down.
