This phone is awesome! I LOVE IT!!! It is so fast! Best of all, however, is you can use it as your primary internet. Yep! Just uninstall your old Blackberry desktop manager and install the new disc that comes with your Bold. Connect your phone to laptop with the usb cable that comes with your phone. Open your new desktop manager...you now set an IP profile from the list...like say T-mobile if that's who you're with...click start ip session and you're connected to the internet. And it is FAST!!! I got rid of my DSL and my Sprint air card it's so good. Have fun with your new phone. You're going to love it!
