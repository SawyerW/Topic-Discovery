I've owned this phone for about 18 months and if I hadn't paid so much for it I would have taken a hammer to it long ago.  Even in the center of a large town I get lousy signal strength; people can't hear me and I can't hear them.  The PDA works well and I bought it so I could carry my calendar and contacts with me and dial them directly with one tap...nice features, well worth the $700+ I paid...IF I could get a signal.  Now I have learned this is because this phone doesn't work on the "third" GSM band.
