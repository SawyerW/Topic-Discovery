No alarm, I knew it had no WiFi, so that was no big deal, but no caledar, and texting is a B@!4h on this thing! You have to constantly open the phone to make a call and the close it, and when you're texting you have to press two seperate buttons at the same time to compose a new text. Once you do that if you're in the middle of a text and you're getting a text in the process, I have yet to figure out how to save the text you've created to "drafts" so that you can look at the new text in your inbox! Super frustrating. It comes with a fold out poster for instructions, which doesn't go into detail at all. Says it go do IM, but it can't. You also can't save pictures to the phone like most cell phones, you have to have an sd card, so I havn't been able to take any pics at all. The only good thing is you can record your own ringtones, but they only last 29 secs, and come out sounding crappy. I think I'll turn this phone in an get a new one.
