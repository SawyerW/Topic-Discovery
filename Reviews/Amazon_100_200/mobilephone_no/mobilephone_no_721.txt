I had a lot of phones but I always had at least a Nokia all the time. I previously N95 which I bought a week before it was even released. Before than I had another Nokia, 7610. I' always happy with Nokia. They always have the best wi-fi connectivity (which they have perfected in N8) and the best camera with Carl Zeiss lenses. Guess what, the N8 is the new best phone of Nokia and as a person who used iPhones, Blackberry's, and Android powered phones (Droids, Samsungs and Lg's mostly) I can easily say that N8 is better than them all. Even though the Nokia Ovi App Store is not better than the other app stores, the fact remains that you can download an app from any website and simply install it on your phone with one easy step. No stupid restrictions or anything. Oh by the way, when you pull the N8 out of your pocket it becomes the center of attention instantly especially a color like this green one.
