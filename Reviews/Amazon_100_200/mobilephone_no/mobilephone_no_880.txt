It's a Sidekick..which is sort of an outdated phone by today's standards. You get what you pay for. I bought mine this week for about 45 dollars, refurbished. I have T-Mobile but could no longer afford a 30 dollar data plan for my MyTouch (which I LOOVVE). So I downsized for the time being.For 45 dollars, it does what I need it to do. I talk, I text. I take pictures, I send pictures. If I wanted to do things on the internet, I would have stayed with my MyTouch and continued to pay for the Data plan. I would not use this phone expecting to use the internet, or apps, or download games, etc. If you are a heavy texter, like I am, then this phone is great for the price. It's sturdy and cool looking, if not a tad bulky for my tastes, but it will do the job.I hope to be able to get back on the Smartphone band wagon by next year, but until then, I will enjoy my Sidekick.
