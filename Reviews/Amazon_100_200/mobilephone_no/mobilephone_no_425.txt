I have had this phone for two years now. It is a simple phone for voice and text, and I love the qwerty hybrid keys. I was able to unlock this phone by emailing Tmobile so I could use it while visiting China. In China and US, calls have great quality. Bluetooth was a bit hard to hear a few times, but that could just be from a combination of factors (me being on the road). Pictures are an added bonus. The battery is getting old and isn't what it used to be, but the phone itself is in great condition.The only cons for this phone are the verification sounds that CANNOT be turned off without muting your entire phone. These sound whenever you change a setting, set an alarm, or save anything in general (I have searched forums about this). This also applies whenever you take a picture - there is Always a sound.
