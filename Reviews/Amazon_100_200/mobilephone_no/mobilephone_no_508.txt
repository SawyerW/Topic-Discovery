I've owned my Treo 600, bought via Amazon, for about 4 months now and I am really enjoying it. I had previously owned an old Palm V, and then an HP Jornada, but found, lacking a utility belt, carrying a PDA in addition to a cell phone annoying to the point that I eventually abandoned PDA use. The Treo has brought me back.As a writer, I've been able to work on manuscripts (via QuickOffice) any time, any place (indeed, I probably did 25% of the editing for my latest novel on my Treo) which in invaluable. The phone functions clearly, and the camera lets me take photos (albeit low-res) on the go, which is handy to capture family moments and work diagrams equally well.With the free CoreMedia player, DVD/AVI conversion software, and a 1G card, I've even been able to take my favorite movies with me on the go, and watch martial arts instructionals any time.Only downsides are the lack of higher screen resolution and the inability to preserve data when fully discharged. I understand these are both fixed on the Treo 650, so perhaps I'll look into upgrading in a year or two.Definately my favorite gadget to date!
