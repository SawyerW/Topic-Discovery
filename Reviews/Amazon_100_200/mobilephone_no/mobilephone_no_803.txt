I can now add this to my list of Nokia Phones tried. I tried it out on both T-mobile and ATT networks. Data wise the phone worked better on T-mobiles Network. Now onto my P & C'sProsCamera Starts Quickly (no waiting unlike some phones)Camera shots were very fast and good qualityVideo Quality was goodVery Solid Build QualityScreen picture quality was much better than most reviewed sites led me to believeOvi Software (slow but can do almost anything) Even imports Itunes songsFree software tetheringConsBad keyboard layoutno portrait keyboardunlike most Nokia phones I had allot of dropped callslocked up more than a few timesstability issueswifi speeds seemed a little slowWhen and if this phone ever gets a quality software update from Nokia to fix some of the stability issues amongst a few other things it could be a great phone. Right now if your looking for a camera phone then this is it definitely.
