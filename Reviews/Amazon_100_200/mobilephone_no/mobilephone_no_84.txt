I was seduced by AT&T's pitch in the NYC area of tons of minutes and very inexpensive phones.  I picked the T616 on its reviews, and the phone was fine, except the reception from AT&T stunk.  At my desk, I received no signal, while T-Mobile and Verizon users received full signals.  My wife could barely hear me when I supposedly had a full signal.  After 3 days, I cancelled the contract, after much hassle from AT&T (Their questions were "Are you sure you are using the phone correctly?" and "I'm sorry you are having reception difficulties, would you like a free leather case?" I switched to T-Mobile and have no problems whatsoever.
