I used to be with SprintPCS.  I started out using the Motorola StarTac and owned many different Samsungs, LGs and Sanyo's.  Well Nextel rolled around with a good plan so I switched to them after being a customer with SprintPCS since 1997.  I went and bought a I730 and I95c.  The I730 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned.  I have had it for 3 months and the darn thing is falling apart.  My so called Smart button has fallen off one day and I don't even know where it is.  The phone's reception is horrible.  Everyone around me with other phones get great reception and I get "NO SERVICE" all the time.  This phone is over priced and not user friendly at all.  Don't waste your money!  I would have given it 0 stars, but 0 stars does not exist.
