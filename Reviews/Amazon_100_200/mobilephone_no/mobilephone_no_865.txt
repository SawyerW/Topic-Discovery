I purchased this phone after my blackberry torch started to give me problems. I'm an avid blackberry user (no i phone, nor android phone appealed to me on the past) and was drawn to this phone because of its compact size, affordable price, and qwerty keyboard.  Being a blackberry user,  I'm still stuck on using a keyboard.  Phone ended up being a huge disappointment. Phone powered off every time I closed or opened it, the battery life was the worst I've ever had in a phone, and the screen really was too small to appreciate any browsing you decide to do. Those three things outweighed any pro's I may have seen  (which I didn't,  other than aesthetic reasons) I definitely don't recommend this phone.
