I have a smart phone now, it's black sleek and yknow...smart. All the apps are great and all but i find myself missing the cool smooth surface of this flip phone, messing with the little red lights into my own designs or changing the light pattern on the front. I remember lying in bed listening to the music with the front LED flashing allover my ceiling. I'm still looking for this phone now, it broke one day after mopping the floors at work, sliding out of my pocket and crashing into two pieces on the floor, broke my heart when it broke. I love this phone so much ):
