I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my 3 year old Nokia 6230. I won't bore you with comparison trivia, instead I'll jump foward to the summary.Beautiful phone utilizing the latest wireless technologies hampered by poor power management in a rush to market.I am not a power user so a benchmark of 3 hours talk or 11 days standby should easily cover my usage. After talking as little as 10 minutes a day for two days the battery had to be recharged. Twenty minutes talk and two days standby is too high maintence for me.The call quality of this phone is the very best and cannot be distinguished from a land line call.After two visits to the AT&T; store - they swapped the first 6555 for another with a "special setting" - ??My new cell phone is the Nokia 6085 - rated at 5 hours talk or 10 days standby. I'm on my 5th day with 58 minutes talk and the battery icon is still displaying a full charge.... now I'm happy!
