I ordered this deal when the price dropped about $25 from the week before.  It was sold by Shopcell Deals, fulfilled by Amazon.  I do not understand the negative reviews out there about this seller and/or this product.  This is the fourth or fifth card bought by either me or my girlfriend or my dad.  At no time have we had an issue except the time when my dad applied the new card to a wrong number.  Tracfone straightened it all out, so no problem.  With this order, rather than receiving an actual retail card, I got a boilerplate letter with a code number on a sticker at the bottom.  I was a little skeptical, but I found a 250 minute promo code, went to Tracfone online, and followed the instructions to active and enter the promo code.  In a matter of about six seconds, my phone alerted me the activation was sucessful.  All 1050 minutes were applied to my phone along with the one year extension.  It couldn't have been easier.  This was a bargain from Amazon - no tax, no extra fees, free shipping, and a lower up front price.  This was a no-brainer.
