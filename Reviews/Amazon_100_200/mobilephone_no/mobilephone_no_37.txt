On a whole, this is a good cell phone.  I've had this phone since 8/2003 and haven't had too many problems.  The camera is a nice toy, but the resolution is bad - the novelty of having a camera phone has worn off a long time ago for me.  Reception and call clarity are for the most part good.  The phone is a bit bulky - can't really put it in your jeans' pockets or in a small clutch/purse.  I usually don't have problems with calls until last night when my calls kept getting dropped - even though I had 4-5 signal bars.  According to Sprint, it might because they're doing software updates.  If this continues, I'm just changing carriers because my contract just ended about 3 days ago and they won't entice me into staying by giving me more minutes for the same price.
