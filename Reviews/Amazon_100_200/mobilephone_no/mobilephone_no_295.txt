Ive had the phone for 2 and half years....(more than most get out of cell phones these days). I did not find that it drained the battery too quick, ive never had to replace the battery all of this time. Its durable too, i take it to work with me and I am a builder so you can imagine the abuse it takes.  I didnt give it a 5 star raiting because I want to give Moto the insentive to make their phones even better. I like basic phones without cameras this is a practical phone for economic non advanced uses. best of luck to you all.
