was reading other reviews, and many people are idiots. most of them have a RAZR, but probably not this version. the black or silver one perhaps. the pink'ness of this phone makes is worthwhile.this is the third version, which is the best of all RAZR's. some guy said, want an mp3 player, buy an mp3 player. want a camera buy a camera...etc. well, this handy object has all, not to be the best but to be somewhat a toy. if you buy it for those features, you're stupid. buy it as a phone and see everything else as an extra. i have this pone, an iPod and a digital camera.i love this phone. it's a motorola so it's sturdy. drop it and you're ok, not like a nokia phone. i used to have a nokia phone, and i love nokia because it's so easy to use, but this pink phone was too cute to let up.this hot pink phone is of the "bratty" variety. that's it's unique selling point. don't get me wrong, it's a good phone too...but you can find a cheaper one out there if you don't care what your phone looks like.
