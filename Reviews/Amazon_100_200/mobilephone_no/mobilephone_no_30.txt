I tend to upgrade cell phones once a year, and this is my latest that I've had for a month.  Relative to the "state of the art" a year ago, here's the pros/cons:- Photo feature is very fun.  I have no "real" use for it, but it is extremely amusing to have the photo of the person come up as their caller ID.  Emailing a picture is slow.  Picture quality is good enough really only for use on the tiny phone screen -- even on a computer the image looks lousy, and it certainly isn't good enough for printing.- Range is a big improvement.  I'm getting service in areas I didn't use to.- Slightly thicker than not having the photo option -- so there's a slight "carrying cost" to the camera- Sound quality is mixed.  Even though the reception is stronger, for some reason voices sound a little garbled on this phone.  You have to line your ear up just right too to listen.
