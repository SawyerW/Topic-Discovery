This phone is great if you want a walkman built in your phone. It does not have alot of nice things like the iphone but it does the job. I like it because its small light and has alot of cool things. like the walk meter. its great it tells you how many steps you have taken during the day and it keeps track of it. the walkman is also a great feature for when your jogging or just want to listen to your favorite tunes. it also has a built in radio which is also great and alot of other things that are cool. Overall this is a neat little phone.
