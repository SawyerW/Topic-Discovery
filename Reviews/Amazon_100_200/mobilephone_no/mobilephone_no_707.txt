Ordered what I thought was a new phone. Sure its older but no where did the ad state that it was used. What I received was an obviously used phone phone with a cracked screen. I'll update the review after I receive the replacement......if it ever shows up.UPDATESecond phone arrived and seems to work fine. It does what I need it to do so. Too bad amazon felt the need to lie about the shipment date and actually send it out the day before it was supposed to be delivered. I've noticed anything shipped by amazon is guaranteed to arrive late.UPDATE 2second phone also malfunctioning in less than a week. now waiting on refund.
