This is the first time I have ordered a Tracfone card from Amazon or anyplace else.  I have been buying cards from one of the local stores, Wal-Mart or Target.  When I saw the price at $79.00, I decided to try it.  I almost chickened out and actually tried to cancel the order but it was too late.  Well, I got the card today and went to Tracfone's website and added the pin code and in less than two minutes it was added to my phone.  I will continue to look for bargain prices here for my phone, although with over a 1000 minutes (I have double minutes) on my phone now, I'm not sure how soon I will need another card.
