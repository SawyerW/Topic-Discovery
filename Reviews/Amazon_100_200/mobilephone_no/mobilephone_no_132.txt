My family & I purchased this phone (6 phones) more than a yr ago. I was very excited at first b/c the phone works very well and much nicer than my previous Motorola phone. I liked many functions, ring tones & graphic that it offers. But unfortunately we've experienced a lot of problems w/ this phone after a good 6 months! Like some other customers in here have already said, the phone shuts off during conversation. Sometimes the phone is on but the screen is out! You can't see anything..  and this happens to all our phones! I don't know how long should a cell phone last but I dont think a year is very long... well we got our phones for free (after rebates) so can't really complain... just want to share w/ everyone my exp.. My family members are getting the new Samsung E715 soon.. they have a great promo on it until 8/25 too..
