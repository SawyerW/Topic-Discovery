After reviewing the newests options such as Iphone, Blackberry, Android. I went for the N8. I can confirm that it was the best decision. It does everything I expected to do.Yes it is not as "friendly" as an Iphone, but the capabilities , versatility and functionality are way better than the Iphone.Having owned and still have a Blackberry and an Iphone, The N8 is my preferred choice.* Easy access to email accounts* Excellent access to Facebook and Twitter* Maps for Free...* Excellent Camera and Video* Plays almost any video format* Very Good Apps, maybe not as flashy as the Iphone but they do what is neededSo far I have not found any negatives
