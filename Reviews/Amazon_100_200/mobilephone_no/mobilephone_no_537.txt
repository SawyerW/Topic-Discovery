The phone works great.  Great reception, sound, and video quality.  The only real problem is the charging.  Plug in the charger, set the phone down and it is charging fine, come back in a few minutes and it is no longer charging as if the cord is not even there, or it has completely shut down and is no longer charging.  Have to unplug the cord and replug it and the charge starts over.  This can happen over and over, can take days to charge this phone.  Have taken it back twice.  First time they replaced the battery, it did the same thing.  Second time they replaced the whole phone, it worked great for a few weeks, now the new one is doing the SAME thing.What good is a phone that won't charge!
