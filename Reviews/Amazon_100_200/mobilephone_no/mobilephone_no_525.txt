I definitely like this full-featured smartphone. It does everything I'd like in a phone (and then some...). This phone uses the Reduced Size MMC and comes with a 64M card, which I felt was too small to be truly useful, so I replaced it with a 1G card for less than $35. I picked up a Logitech Bluetooth hands-free that works very well with the Nokia. The display is large, bright and has vivid colors. On the down side, the speaker leaves a little to be desired, and the voice recognition is a somewhat clunky to operate and doesn't seem to be as "forgiving" as my old Kyocera. Finally, the shape is a definite candybar--it's almost perfectly rectangular, so I've been unable to find a decent case for the phone, and Nokia doesn't offer one. All in all, a very good phone worthy of the Nokia name.
