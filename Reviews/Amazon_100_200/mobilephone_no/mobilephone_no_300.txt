The Nokia E75 is my latest Nokia Eseries phone acquisition. Before the E75, I owned and used the E71 and the E51. Emailing with the E75, I must agree, is nice,easy and definetely the large keybord is a plus besides the great Email display . The big  problem I encountered  with the E75 is in the only Fring app version(22) it  accepts to work with. This version is an awfull one compared to the Fring  version 20 which  the E71 and  E51 do accept.  Even though E51 has a numeric keyboard only ,a small screen and a poor Email display, is much  lighter  than the other ones and is a better performer for 3G Voip.The E71, on the other hand , is great for Emailing because of a larger Kwerty keyboard and great Email display but dialing out numbers is very difficult due to the very small number keys it has.For these reasons I decided to stick with the E51, the least expensive one!
