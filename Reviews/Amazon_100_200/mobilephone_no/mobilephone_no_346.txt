Pros: N85 packs a lot of features in a small body - see other reviews. Some say it's flimsy - I disagree. I dropped it twice on the floor at home and once on asphalt in the street. It works as if nothing happened.Cons: People mention minor things. I'll talk about the most important. (1) When I was travelling outside the US, my N85 stopped functioning. The local service center refused to repair it, even for money, even though I had an invoice proving that I was the original purchaser. The representative said that's Nokia's anti-smuggling policy. What the service center did not want to do for $36, a local pirate did for $14. When I posted my negative review on NokiaUSA, they censored it out. (2) Only beginning users can be happy with Symbian. I am an advanced user, and I buy an advanced phone like N85 to be able to do many more things than Symbian allows.
