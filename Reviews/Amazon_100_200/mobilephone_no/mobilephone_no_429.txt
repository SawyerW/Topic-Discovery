Bought this Tracfone 1yr service card from the seller shopcelldeals, arrived on time. I was nervous buying a minutes card online because of the risk it would arrive already used. The card worked fine - using the phone's built-in activation didn't work so I called the number instead and that worked. The automated voice asks a few odd questions like birthday which you don't have to answer (stay silent and it will eventually skip ahead).Ordered another one and it arrived not as a card but as a piece of paper with a sticker having the code attached. Seemed sketch but it still worked.
