Having just sent a Samsung A-500 swimming off of Catalina Island, I decided to try a change of pace with the Sanyo 8200. As others have noted, the Functions and Menus on this phone are outstanding. The Camera is a lot of fun and really preforms pretty well.That being said, I'm really dissappointed with this phones sound quality. When listening to callers with the phone flipped open, you'd swear that each and every one of your callers has swallowed a bag full of cotton or marbles. The calls sound downright horrible. It only gets worse once you plug in the earbud. Turning up the volume only distorts the call even worse.I'd love to keep this gadget friendly phone but will be switching back to the Samsung. Its sound quality is 10 times better than the 8200 even though I will have to live with its limited features.Really surprised Sanyo skimped on a key feature for this otherwise excellent phone.
