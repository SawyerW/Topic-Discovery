I bought this phone thinking about another sonny ericsson I had couple years ago. There is nothing related to that one. Seems like this phone comes from another brand. Instead of improving they made it worst.The features that come with this phone, don't work properly, but how did I was going to know it until trying to use each of them with time?The instruction manual is incomplete.It took me years to load music to it. The memory is small and it is not explained that it comes with one of this tiny memories that is great enough for two or three songs. After buying the 2G memory ($20 extra)I only could record music directy from an original disc... another of sony's great ideas. The music that was already in my computer marks error, can't be copied.The phone sounds good and can be listened as a small radio.The support page never offers real solutions either.What I like is the big screen. I will hardly go back with a phone with a smaller screen.A shame it doesn't have camera, but stiil it won't work properly for sure... I just give it two and a half stars as it works pretty mediocre.
