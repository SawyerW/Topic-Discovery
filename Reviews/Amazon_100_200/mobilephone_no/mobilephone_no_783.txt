Folks,In a word, excellent.Ok, so it's a few years old at this stage, but it's still in 2nd place in the camera stakes (only beat by its newer brother).- 12 MP with Xenon flash (unlike the mickey-mouse LED type flash seen in other manufacturers phone/camera).- What's Xenon flash? --> the real deal, as found in dedicated cameras.- 720p HD video recording (search online for a short film made by Nokia N8, 'the commuter' I think!).- GPS: that doesn't need a data plan; it's a GPS (ie. no cost, it will work as a GPS device with or without the SIM card inserted).- Signing up to Facebook/Twitter and the like doesn't expose all your data to these corporations. Nokia uses a middle-man tool called 'Nokia Social' that pulls information from FB rather than dumping (sorry, sharing) your phonebook onto the FB servers.Highly recommended.Regards,Happy Shopper.
