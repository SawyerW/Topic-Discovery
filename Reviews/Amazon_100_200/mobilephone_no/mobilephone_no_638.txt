This device is a fake.Cortes Inc is selling some working phones and others not working.This is the second non functional phone delivered to my country Trinidad and Tobago.I now got this phone and when placed to charge it just displays a red light and then nothing.I plea with amazon to investigate the products sold by this seller.I do not expect a perfect product as it is used but to have it working at least would be good which is not the case.It shocks me to know that these people are actually using Amazon to sell non-functional products.If there was a governing system to report "Cortes Inc" i would send them a report of this non-functional product.I plea with future buyers not to buy products sold by "Cortes Inc".Thank you for your poor serices and I hope someone from Amamzon investigates your organization "Cortes Inc", soon.
