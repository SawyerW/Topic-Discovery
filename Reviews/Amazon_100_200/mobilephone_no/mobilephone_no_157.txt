This phone is good, but not great.  I've had it for about two years. The second year the datebook started malfunctioning. No matter what date you would enter for future reminders, it would ring at 7AM the day before.  For ex., If I wanted the alarm to ring at 2:30 pm on March 25 and set it under the custom 90 minutes, it would ring on March 24 at 7AM.  I also didn't like the fact that this phone only holds datebook data for 3 weeks.  What if you need to check back in 6 months for reference to appointments.  They are erased!  If you can stand those annoyances then the phone is good, not great.
