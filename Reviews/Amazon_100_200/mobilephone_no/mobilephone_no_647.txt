I used to love the blackberry, but now I just plain hate it. I bought one used on from a supplier here on Amazon, the phone died on me three weeks later, so I brought it back into the metro store where I had insurance, they ordered me a new one, it constantly freezes, I cannot view the home screen, the keys lock up. I don't know what happened because back in the day, blackberry was a sturdy, user friendly reliable phone. now it seems to be so cheaply made and the network it runs on is terrible. I'm very disappointed that a phone I used to love because of its reliability is now just a piece of crap. personally I don't think its the phone per say, metro is selling refurbished phones to consumers. I have purchase phones brand new that died a couple months later. metro needs a class action lawsuit for fraudulent business practices.
