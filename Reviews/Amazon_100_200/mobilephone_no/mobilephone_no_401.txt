After some usage, I can tell I have used this cellphone enough for writing a review. It is a nice phone with really cool features. The size is good enough for you to handle it comfortably. The camera takes good quality photos but not so good quality videos. It only works on GSM so Internet browsing is slow --probably also depends on the provider-- The bluetooth is easy to turn on/off and the speaker is really good for conferencing as it's very loud. The screen sensibility is cut at the corners/borders. It reads MP3s and the FM Radio works only with the earphone but it is OK. The games it comes with are really good --especially the sudoku one-- I plugged a 4GB microSD class 4 card and no problems detecting the card or uploading/downloading stuff from it.
