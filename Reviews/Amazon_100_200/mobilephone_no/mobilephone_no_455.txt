Discounts on cards are hard to find. Card worked as it should (purchased from CardArt, fulfilled by Amazon). Minutes doubled on my phone, plus I found a 300 minute promo code giving me 1100 total. What a deal!I've been a TracFone user for many years and I have nothing but praise for them. Coverage is excellent in my area (North Jersey) and when I travel. Customer service has always been courteous and helpful (even when correcting my goofs). I think TracFone is the most straight forward and flexible of all the prepaid plans. It's also amongst the least expensive - less than $7 a month (if you don't chat much) using 60 minute / 90 day cards. Using an annual card is a little more expensive, but you get more minutes & 5 extra days of service, plus you only have to recharge once a year.I highly recommend TracFone. My only advice to new customers is to buy a phone with Double Minutes.
