Nothing against the phone but the cell phone service provider "Greatcall" is the ONLY one that can provide cell phone service for this phone.  In order to know if your phone has service in the area you have to actually purchase the phone and call to get service for their "system" to determine if Verizon has cell phone coverage in your area. When you call Greatcall they promote Verizon and how much coverage there is with Verizon, I even told them the area. It's not until I called to get the phone service activated for my aunt that I found out there's no service in her area.
