With a name like breed I should of known I would get screwed. First the phone came without a battery, breed said they would ship one but I didn't want to wait so I spent 40 dollars getting a battery. I put my SIM card card in the phone turned it on and it asked for an unlock code, I called my provider and they told me the phone is locked so I called breed again and they told me they would send an unlock code via email in a couple days. This phone was also not brand new it is locked by a previous provider. Breed customer service was horrible, no apology or even a sorry for this inconvenience, they acted like I was wasting their precious time. Also the imei on the box didn't match the one on the phone. So instead of getting a new unlocked phone I got a used or refurbished locked phone.
