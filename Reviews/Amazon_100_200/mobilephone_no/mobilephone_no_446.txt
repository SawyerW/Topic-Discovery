I saw this on Amazon for only $74.99 - much cheaper than Tracfone's $99 website price.  It arrived in days, in a large padded envelope.  Inside, I found a Tracfone 400 minute/1 year card - exactly like you'd see at a store.  After scratching off the silver strip on the back, I typed in the sequence of numbers on the Tracfone website - be sure to use the bonus code for an additional 200 minutes.  So, I received a total of 800 minutes (my phone has double minutes for life) + the bonus 200 minutes = 1000 minutes with a 1 year expiration.  Not bad for $75!  Easy to use, no problems, FAST delivery.  A real no brainer for Tracfone users.
