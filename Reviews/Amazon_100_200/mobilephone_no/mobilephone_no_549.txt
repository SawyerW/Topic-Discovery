I loved the phone at first.It worked for about a month and now the screen nore the camera work!!the screen is black!! it won't do anything!!!Even the outside screen is black!!!  and I cannot take any pictures because the screen won't work!!i can call out and get incomming calls but cannot see anything the only way i know who it is is beacuse i set certain ringtones.  I can get texts but of couse cannot read them because the top half of the phone doesn't work!!!!!! i am very careful with my stuff so it was nothing i did. i really like the phone if it would just work right.
