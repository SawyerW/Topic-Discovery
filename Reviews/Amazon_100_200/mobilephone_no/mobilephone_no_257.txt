I bought this cell phone from an authorized retailer.  I usually do not write reviews (this is my first), but I feel like I should let people know this is not a quality product.  In the first couple of months, the keys cracked on the phone.  When I called they told me I would have to pay for the warr. service.  I was told that this was a "known issue" with the phone.  I got the new phone, and the keys are cracking AGAIN.  It does random things like turn off by itself.  This was not a referb. and I would recommend staying away from this phone.  I am stuck in my service contract until 6/2009 and will have to baby this fragile phone until then!
