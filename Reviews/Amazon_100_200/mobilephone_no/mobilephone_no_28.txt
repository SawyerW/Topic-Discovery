Don't bother buying this phone unless you get it cheap! battery replacement is $216 thru Siemens repair depot only. This phone is a real orphan. Talk about a short life cycle!!!I bought mine 2+ years ago and gave up on the phone portion (GSM coverage was lousy). With all the hype about good coverage I switched from TDMA phone back to GSM. Coverage is still bad. What is worse the battery doesn't hold much of a charge now and can't handle PDA and celular functions. As per the above, Siemens wants $216 to replace it plus a nominal 10 day turn around. AT&T; / Cingular wants to know nothing!
