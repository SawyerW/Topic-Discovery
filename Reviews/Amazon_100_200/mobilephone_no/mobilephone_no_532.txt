I'm using it for the last one-week and so for so good.Pros:1. Screen is visble in bright sunlight too. Motorolla's Razor is just the opposite.2. Call Recpetion/ Speaker Phone/ Battery life or charge all are good.3. Camera's Image quality is between Ok and Good.4. Simple Navigation.Cons:1. Just a bit too big.2. Key pad space could have been more.3. Camera shutter/cover dosen't fit perfectly.Conclusion: I recommend u to buy this. It does it's job unlike Razor whose reception, screen, speaker phone, battery life - all are Compromise for it's sleek/stylish design. If you want a phone for communication buy this. If you want to show-off buy Razor.
