I found out that with TMOBILE, the contacts might be in the memory of the old phone. So that is why if you don't see your contacts, that might be the problem. To get the music on there, I had to order a Micro SD Card. As well as a MICRO SD TO USB thing. With that you load your MP3 music on the Micro SD, and put that Micro SD in the phone, and when you want to play the music, it will ask you to add the music. But all that does, is tell the phone it is finding the music on the SD. If you take it out, you won't have that music. The speakers aren't great, so I had to order a headset for this phone.
