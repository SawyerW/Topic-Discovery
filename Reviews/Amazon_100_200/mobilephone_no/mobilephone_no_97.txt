I purchased the Samsung SGH-e105 to replace my old Nokia 3390. At first I was hesitant to purchase it, because it was not a Nokia, but this phone is much better than my Nokia and it is much smaller. The color screen can display 65000 colors. Most color screen phones can only display 256 or 4056 colors. The menu is easy to understand and everything is pretty straight forward. It also has AIM built into it, like the Nokia 3390. Other features include Polyphonic ringtones (which sound like real music), a huge screen, and an orgnaizer. If you are looking for a good color screen flip phone, then the Samsung SGH-e105 should be your choice.
