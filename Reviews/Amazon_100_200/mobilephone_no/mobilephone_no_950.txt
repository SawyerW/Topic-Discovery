I bought a XP3300 force. After 1 year the battery can't last more than a day. I checked the website and it actually said accessories like battery won't last more than a year. I did send email to ask about it (to the provided support email) but no one replied. After that I had to call them, but there's no one answer. I tried to dig for more phone numbers (from other countries' support phone number) and finally got 1 number that worked. I talked to a guy and he said he'll send me a new battery, he wrote down my address and all other details, then of course nothing happened, no one sent me anything.I did try to call back but this time no numbers work.The phone itself is ok, but battery won't last, and you can't even contact them to do anything about that so just forget buying it.
