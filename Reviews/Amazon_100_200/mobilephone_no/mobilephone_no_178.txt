I purchased a used Nextel i730 under the assumption that if I owned my own phone, I wouldn't be locked into any sort of contract with Nextel.  I WAS WRONG!!! Whether they give a free phone for signing the contract, or you pay cash for a used phone, YOU MUST SIGN NEXTEL'S CONTRACT!!!  NEXTEL WOULD NOT LET ME ACTIVATE A PHONE I OWNED OUTRIGHT WITHOUT A ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!!  Looking back, I would have never paid cash for the phone.  There are hundreds of internet cell companies that will give this and almost all phones available for free if you sign for the alotted contract term.  NEXTEL TOLD ME THEY WILL NEVER ACTIVATE ANY PHONE WITHOUT A MINIMUM ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!!
