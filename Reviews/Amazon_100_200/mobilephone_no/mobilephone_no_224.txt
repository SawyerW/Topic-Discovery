I was pretty happy with it at first, light, good looking. The problem is that the sound is really not good and it lacks a lot of the features that I loved on my previous Samsungs. For example you can't scroll down to the previous numbers you called after you hit "talk", it only keeps the last one, so you have to go into the menu the look for the outgoing calls... not convenient. On my 3 previous Samsungs, I also liked the fact that I could stop the ring when I received a call. So for example I would hit any side button and the ring would stop, then I could take it out of my purse and answer without eveybody noticing me. I find the menu also a little messy.In other words, I am going to return this one and buy a new Samsung!
