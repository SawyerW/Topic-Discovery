This was my first flip phone, so I can not really compare with other flip phones, but after having this phone for a pretty long time I can not say I am unhappy with it. Has one of the best screen resolutions and most vivid color (especially compared to some top selling non motorolla bluetooth phones). Very sturdy body (I have dropped it numerous times, including once from the second floor. Have some scratches, but works perfectly). Great reception (even when you remove the external antenna). I have used the phone in multiple countries. Since this phone comes unlocked, one just needs to change the SIM.Now about the drawbacks. One is of course the constant beeps when the battery runs down - even on vibration mode. Second is the position and functionality of the side buttons. And it is not very easy to open/close the phone with one hand, although after some practice, it can be done :)Bottomline: good phone, but could be improved. Definitely recommended.
