So I constantly buy products from Amazon. I happened to buy several units of the Nokia N8. Turns out that some units work perfectly, no problems at all. But some others, well, they hang up, lag... etc. Some even arrived DEAD. Wont even turn on. If you receive a dead phone, is better to send it back right away, don't do what I did and make a hard reset. I discovered that a hard reset would bring back to live to one of my DEAD N8. But the joy didn't last. Yeah the phone turned on and was functioning (with problems) for a couple of weeks. Then it simply DIED on me again, but this time was for Good. No way to turn it back on. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you are lucky, you will get a well functioning phone. In any other case, just return it, don't be a Hero.
