This is a review for boost mobile (nextel's prepaid service).  I have a company phone when I travel during the school year, so I wanted a cool prepaid phone.  I had (still do) a Nokia 1220 (Tracfone) and that phone was good (very basic), but I only had service in my local area (Houston) and no where else.  After getting stuck at Chicago O'Hare without cell service, I decided I needed a phone that would get service in all major areas of the USA.  I have not been dissappointed!!  The rates are VERY reasonable for prepaid ($.15 - $.25/minute), customer service has been WONDERFUL, and it has (almost) all the cool features I had on my Sprint vision phone.  TM, internet and walkie talkie (to Nextel and Boost customers).  I hope what I read in an earlier review is not right about them getting bought out by sprint, because I was with them for almost 6 years and the customer service and plans went VERY steadily downhill!  If you need a REALLY COOL phone and do not want a monthly contract, consider Boost Mobile.
