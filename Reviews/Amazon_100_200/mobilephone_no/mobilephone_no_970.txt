I love this blackberry because it works so easy with one hand and I am familiar with it. But I have had more problems with this phone then any other and I only had this phone for 5 months before it went well lets say dead. The spot for the memory card was broken so I had no way to latch in the memory card except with tape. Anytime I took the battery out for purposes of sim card or memory card my phone would not turn on again for 8 hrs or more, it was extremly frusterating. Lastly my phone fell off the tv and the middle touch ball broke off and now my phone is completly unusable! Not strongly made.
