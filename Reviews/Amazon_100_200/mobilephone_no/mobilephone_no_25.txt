This phone bills itself as "international" with two GSM bands, but on a recent trip to London and Dubai I could not get it to work at all and had to revert to my tri-band Sony Ericsson Ti68, so if you travel out of the USA think twice!  Also, on weekends, I found the added size of the SX-56 needless and reverted to my smaller phone.  Windows CE is less intuitive than the Palm OS - CE does not prompt for confirmation of entries, leaving you wondering if they were accepted.  One great feature of the SX-56 is the speakerphone ability, not common in a handheld - but overall I would say stick with a Palm plus a small mobile phone.
