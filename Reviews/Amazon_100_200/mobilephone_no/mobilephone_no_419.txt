I bought this phone for my wife & now she has it for about 3-4weeks.First we were Very excited to take it out the box. Turn it on and setting it up to work with T mobile network and automaticaly found the t mobile network. But settings it to send and receive picture txt messages was a little difficult to set up. I Wish if there was a speaker button to turn the speaker on without the too many steps to get the speaker on. So we'll see as time goes on.But she do love the fact that she can easlly put music on there.
