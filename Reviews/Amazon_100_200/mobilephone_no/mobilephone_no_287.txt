This phone hangs up and does not let answer calls, or end calls; it is extremely frustrating when it freezes..you have to take out the battery and restart the phone.I think the processor may be too slow for "running" windows mobile 6.It seems it is even slow in turning on the microphone, you have to say "hello!!" like 5 times before someone actually hears you.In 13 years, this is by far, the worst phone I ever had.Even the camera stopped working in 3 months, seems like a software problem; but anyway it took so bad pictures that I never miss it.Save your money, buy anythig but this one
