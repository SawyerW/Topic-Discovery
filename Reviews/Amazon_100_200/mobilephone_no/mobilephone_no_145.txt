When the i95 came out, i thought it was amazing.  I thought it was durable and easy to use.  Then i got the i730 and I am very happy with it.  A couple of my favorite features is that it's alot thinner and half of the size of the i95.  The speaker in the front of the phone lights up for an incoming call.  It has very precise color.  The only problem i had when i first used it was the bottons are close when choosing things from the menu or the scroll up.  I got used to it, in like 3 days.  Now, i am loving this phone.  By far the best phone that Nextel has come out with.  I heard they are getting one w/ a camera soon but i dont think i want to change, this phone is perfect!!!
