I bought this phone because I needed a full keyboard as I am sending out more text messages than I needed to in the past. However, my carrier is T-Mobile while this phone was customized for the AT&T; network. That being said, the following AT&T; features do NOT work with T-Mobile: Instant Messaging, Mobile E-Mail, AppCenter, Mobile Web, Mobile Care.However, the items that I do care about work fine and these include the camera, the multiple alarms, texting, address book, sound recorder, etc.I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because the speaker phone feature is practically worthless due to its low volume capabilities.
