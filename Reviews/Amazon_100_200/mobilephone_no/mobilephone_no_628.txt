This is a low end phone intended to entice customers to buy long term contracts with Canadian cell companies like Rogers. The phone is cheap and the one we purchased suffered an internal screen break after a month. It was not dropped, did not get wet, did not freeze or anything like that--in normal use the screen just broke. We had to buy a new phone since it would have cost nearly as much to fix the LG piece of junk as to purchase a new one. We bought a Samsung.this is a scam product which Cell phone service providers get for next to nothing, then use to convince you to buy extended service contracts.
