I love this phone, I have had it a month or so now, it gives me reception in alot of areas that my daughters blackberry will not hardly pick up on.  Works great with bluetooth, has a lock on the keypad to keep mishaps from happening if I drop it in my handbag.  I may order another before to long, when there is a great phone it seems like they don't stay around long.  The battery life is excellent. I charge mine once every three to four days.  I am a medium user, talk some, text some, so the phone is far better than what I had before.  Battery life was my first concern, did not want to have to recharge everyday, with this one I do not, the speaker works well without problems, the sound quality is very good, volume is easy to up or down (button on the side) if you want camera quality then this phone does not take pics like the iphone, but its decent, if your more concerned about getting reception and good connection then this phone is for you.
