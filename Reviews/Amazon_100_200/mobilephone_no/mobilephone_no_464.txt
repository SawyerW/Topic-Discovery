It's not a regular tracfone min. card like I received before.  I wasn't paying attention to the picture posted. Just so happened, I was expecting a new sim card fr tracfone but this came first, so I called tracfone that the package has no sim card but a piece of paper with the pin# on it. He told me, it's not fr tracfone... so, I set aside without realizing what is that for.  Just today, I realized that it's been long to receive my tracfone card so I check the amazon order and now I found out that the paper I set aside was the one I'm waiting for, My trcfone minutes.  Hmmm I'm glad I did toss it out in the trash. Otherwise, there goes my $89.98 money....
