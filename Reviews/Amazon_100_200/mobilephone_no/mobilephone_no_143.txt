I've had this phone for a little over a week, and while it performs good enough, there is room for improvement. First is the poor battery life that other reviewers have mentioned. Even when I haven't made any calls, it still drains about fifty percent daily. Secondly, it doesn't seem to be as well made and as sturdy as my old Samsung 850 phone. For the price, Motorola should have a product that is not so flimsy.But that being said, I still like the phone. The display is bright and clear; and it performs better than my previous phone. So if you're considering buying one, make sure you buy a spare battery and extra battery charger. You'll need it. And if you need a phone that can take abuse, I would look at the i530 with the rubberized exterior. It's not as slick as the i730, but it looks like it is designed more rugged use.
