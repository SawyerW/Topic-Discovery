I bought this phone at the Verizon store, and replaced it on Amazon with the earlier Samsung Rogue U960.  I still use it as a backup phone, but the only reason it better than the Rogue is it is slightly smaller and lighter, and has slightly better battery life.  It also has a Skype function, which the Rogue does not have, but the Rogue has Twitter, which is more useful  to me.  The keyboard is smaller than the Rogue's, and the camera is much more limited, does not zoom, and does not take very good photos.  It is much harder to use for the Internet than the Rogue, and the only thing that it excels in is making and receiving phone calls.
