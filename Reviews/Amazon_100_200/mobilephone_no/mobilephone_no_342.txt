I've always loved Sony Ericsson phones.  In addition to being just a little bit differnet, they sport a wonderfully intutive interface and intertesting desings.  I've been using this phone for a couple of days and here are my thoughts so far:Pros:-Beautiful screen,-Nicely weighted, feels solid-Understated design, very attractive-Keys are good for texting, maybe a little small for larger hands-Interface is intuitive and snappy-Phone has a decent set of features for the price-Charges quickly-Good battery life/talk time-Decent reception-Phone feels well built-Unlocked version allows more customization such as shortcuts/custom tones-Camera is decent and has lots of settingsCons:-No way to use the camera flash as a flash light (like on the old W810i)-Call quality could be a little better but is by no means poor-Volume rocker is small and hard to change while talking-I wish Sony Ericsson would switch over to micro USB for charging-No 3.5mm headphone jackThis is by far the best Sony Ericsson phone I've owned, or any phone for that matter.  If you are looking for a loaded smartphone obviously look elsewhere, but this is a phone that does all the basics really well and sports a few nice features as well.
