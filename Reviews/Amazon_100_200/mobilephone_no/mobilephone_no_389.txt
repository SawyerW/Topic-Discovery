I am truly upset with this phone. Like any good buyer I spent countless weeks researching and debating which phone to get. Finally I saw this great deal of a phone on Amazon and was sold instantly. I couldn't wait, and when it came I had high hopes. To my dismay the call quality is poor, very poor, almost non-existent. All the other phone features worked great, except the one that mattered the most, the phone aspect, calling and talking. I hear other people fine, but they say I fade in and out and a lot of the time end up with a bad phone call because of the argument between me and the caller. I am hoping by christmas to get a bluetooth earpiece to help the quality because after that, my only other option is to try and get another phone. In the end, just a disappointment.
