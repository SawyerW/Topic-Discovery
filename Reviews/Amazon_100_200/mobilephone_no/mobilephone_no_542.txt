I purchased a (RED) Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Quad phone and paid SEVENTY DOLLARS or more.  This is supposed to be a NEW phone.  This phone has the following problems:  1) Cannot hear person speaking, 2) When you scroll down letters A-Z in the Phonebook, and hit ex. Le, this phone goes back to the beginning of the Phonebook.  You can only choose L, then you have to scroll down all the L's, to get to the right person.  3)  This phone is not holding its battery.  Although it is a NEW phone that is charged all night, and has a NEW battery, it loses its battery during the day hours. 4) When texting, you have to hit letter and select, which actually takes too much time.Motorola New Cell Phone thru Amazonrmmcdonald@charter.net
