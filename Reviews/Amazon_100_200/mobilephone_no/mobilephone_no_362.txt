I searched and searched for an unlocked phone that wouldn't break the bank but that would offer wi-fi capability and a qwerty keyboard for texting and messaging. This phone doesn't disappoint. There was some learning curve, but now I am really pleased with the phone's features and call quality. (The speakerphone is not very loud, though)The keyboard is easy to manage and I don't make many mistakes typing. Be warned, though, that with the qwerty layout, you can't dial words correctly...like 1-800-nokia12. The letters are not on the same numbers as they are on a standard phone. Even Nokia didn't know this when I called tech support because my password (a word) wouldn't work. I had to figure it out myself.I still have one issue, though, and that's with mp3 output. It doesn't seem to offer stereo even with a stereo headset. I didn't buy the phone as an mp3 player, but would think that if they offer that feature it would be in stereo.The phone feels good. I bought an otterbox cover that fits great and offers protection.For the money, this is a great phone.
