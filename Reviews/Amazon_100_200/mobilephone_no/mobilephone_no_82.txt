AT&T; wireless GSM coverage is a joke.  They will blame anything on it too:  hurricane, sunspots, "It's new technology," "somebody didn't renew antenna tower contracts" (that is on Interstate 95, if you can believe it).  Don't do it!!!  You will eventually be very unhappy!!!  If you have a brief weakness and try it out, and you get their service, and have slight problems in the first 30 days, then send the phone back IMMEDIATELY.  You are, otherwise, consigning yourself to whatever they want to do to you.  DO NOT sign a contract with them.  That is the only thing that has saved me is that I couldn't bring myself to sign the contract.  That means that I have two phones that cost me [a lot]--because the rebate requires the contract--but at least I don't have to give them money for service that reminds me of spotty cell phone service ten years ago.  'Love the phone?  Find another carrier!!!Good luck...
