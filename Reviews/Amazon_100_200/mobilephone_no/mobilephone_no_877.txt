We bought this phone as a replacement for our daughter. It worked great but could not get the internet options (browser, Facebook, etc.) features to work. Called T-Mobile and they said that all of the Sidekick 3g phones use an older digital network that has been shutdown. The newer 4g Sidekicks are all Android based and work fine.The text messaging, phone, and address book features all work great. The phone is really nice even with the missing 30% of features.If you don't need Internet/Facebook/IM chatting then it will work fine. If you want any of those internet features don't buy this phone look for the 4g version of it.
