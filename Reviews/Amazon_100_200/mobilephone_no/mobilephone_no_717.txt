i got this little power house two weeks ago and i cant put it down it plays all my media files without me having to convert them, it gives me facebook updates every time i unlock the screen, and when i get a call i can see my contacts facebook status, its a great flashlight and quick office works great, i connects flash drives to it all the time and the paid apps work perfectly, i use the fm transmitter everyday on the way to work the call quality is great and the phone app is easy to use, the camera is amazing just point and click the pictures litterally come out great every time. my only complaints about it are the free apps are buggy and the music player doesn't have search other than that this is my favorite device
