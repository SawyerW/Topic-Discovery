The phone came as promised and is a great bargain, but...  You cannot send media messages and you will need to look online for the set up options regarding this phone.  It is set up to be used in another country.  The Spanish language thing was not a real issue but the settings needed to be tweaked and I still cannot do all of the things I could do with my Samsung Impression (I realize it is not the same but was hopeful).  Many of the apps that could be downloaded for the Impression cannot go on this phone.  Cheap replacement phone but the word cheap here is key.  Do not tap this phone or jostle it too much as it will shut off.  Be sure if you have alarms that you set them to turn on the phone if off.
