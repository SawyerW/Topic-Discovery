I have no complaints of the phone itself, anyone who does they're research and is wanting to have one in 2013 will decide if it is a suitable phone for they're personal needs. I do have a huge complaint with the seller itself, I bought my sidekick new from BLUETEKUSA, the description of the phone clearly said PV300GR! And they sent me the model: pv300...again anyone who does research on this specific phone, should know that their is quite a big difference on the model. I sent a message to the seller, explaining the situation, and they only thing they could reply back was that they no longer carry the model pv300gr, so my only option was to return it to amazon for a refund.Conclusion: DON'T sell an item under a false description, it's a waste of people's money and time!Sincerely, Julia.
