I am new to the cell phone era, but I am glad I waited until now. I have been able to see people all around me get them and see what problems they encountered.I am very pleased with the phone and service I get from T-Mobile. I have not had any problems making or reciving calls from where ever I have been. I have even been able to get service when other could not. I generally have at least 4 lines on reception and others around me have all they can do to get 1.The phone was very easy to setup and learn. I like the online feature of adding people to the address book. Makes it so much easy to load that.I was also very pleased with the service I got from Amazon. Phone was shipped very fast. I had an issue with the first one I got (has discoloration on outside) and they resolved the problem immediately. Couldn't ask for more from a company.All in all I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who would ask.
