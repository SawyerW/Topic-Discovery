I'm hoping I can upgrade to a better phone.+After several Nokia bricks, I was happy to own a light clamshell-design phone. No more accidental dialing! Caller groups and assignable rings are very useful as well. I like the silver exterior, the outside caller id screen, the color display and the outside light.  I've accidentally dropped this phone several times with no noticeable problems afterwards, so it's sturdier than it looks.=Reception is not thrilling but I live in a hilly area which seems to have spotty reception for everyone.-Functional problems:  First, the phone book takes forever to initialize, as others have noted. Second, the clock has to be set manually and it becomes more inaccurate as the battery slows down.  I miss the way my old Nokias used to grab the correct time.Aesthetic problems: The obnoxious ringtones that shipped with the phone were also a step down from the Nokia. (The pop songs available for download through T-Mobile aren't much better. It's truly sad when you have to search and download a ring that just sounds like a ring. )
