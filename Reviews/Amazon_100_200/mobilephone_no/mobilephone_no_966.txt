I am not a big phone person. I don't like really like them and think of them more as a leash of sorts. So, when I had to buy a new one I knew what I needed. Cheap, simple and dependable. This phone was all these things. Super easy to get going when i got it in the mail. Part of the reason i chose this phone was because it had a keyboard. But-the keyboard is made for Tinkerbell fingers. I do not have sausage fingers- I assure you.-I have 20/20 eyesight and am a GenXer. But the keys on this sucker are so small that accurate quick texts are next to impossible.
