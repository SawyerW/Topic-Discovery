On Receiving this phone write a review, the phone is much more than i expected, before i got it i want to swap for a blackberry but as soon as it came into my hands i killed the idea especially  because it has all the features of a berry - full key, wifi, small and compact, stylish and totally irresistable.  I would go as far to say buy this phone and forget about any blackberry they only have name nokia E63-2 can be compared to blackberry and their features, the wifi is off the hook i just turned on my router and that was it. For $200 i would gladly buy this baby over a blackberry again.
