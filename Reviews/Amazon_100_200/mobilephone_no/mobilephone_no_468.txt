I was really unhappy with the seller of this item. I expected a new card to be mailed to me for use;When I received the pin number by email (yes the pin number was revealed) i tried to use it to add minutes to my phone and the message came up that it was a pin that was already used. I would not use this seller at all in the future. Thank goodness for Amazon's A to Z guarantee. They refunded my purchase after trying to contact the seller and after I filed a claim for a refund. Amazon has my confidence for a safe purchase.
