This is a nice handset. The battery life is amazing compared to android handsets. I own Samsung Vibrant, HTC G1, and HP veer. Nokia N8 is really great for an entry level smart phone. If you rely heavily on Google services, this isn't the handset for you. If you want a device that is very good at the specific tasks of: Navigation, Taking Photos, Media Playback, texting, email and phone calls, this is a great choice. I load up my micro sd and listen to podcasts broadcast to the FM radio in my car on my daily commute. I never have to worry about charging my phone at work. The picture quality is fantastic in regular lighting. The set up was WAY more complicated than I have ever experienced on any handset. It is a good buy for a basic user. My biggest gripe is that there is no way to sort the app reviews in the App Store by language! I have to pass 50 or so arabic, spanish, and italian reviews before I see one English app review that says "cool".
