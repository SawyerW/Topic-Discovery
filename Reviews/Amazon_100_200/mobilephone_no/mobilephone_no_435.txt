This seemed too good to be true and I hesitated on buying this but with all the good reviews and fulfillment by Amazon I went ahead. So glad I did. Delivery was fast and I added the airtime to my phone in less than 5 min on the tracfone website. A great deal for only about $6.25/mo!! Be sure to search for promo codes first. I found one for 250 bonus minutes which means I added 650 total minutes. I'm not a heavy user, so if I have minutes leftover at the end of the year I will buy tracfone's monthly service extension (time only, no minutes) for less than $10/mo.
