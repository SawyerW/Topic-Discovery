If you have to buy a nokia , buy the 6126, it has a better screen, clearer and louder sound, is smaller and has a somewhat better battery , does not drop calls. But this one has 3G, the slowest( 3.6 MB is a lie its only applicable to blacberrys and other phones , these have 356kbps theoretical , which effectively comes out to 12-15 kbps max) . The 11 days standbay is a lie, its more 11 hours . The battery dies without warning, no beeps just dies. This phone is just not worth it, there are much better phones out there , so save yourself a lot of frustration and dont buy this phone.The battery is pathetic and it drops calls , the sound is pathetic...this is the truth. The people who say otherwise are a bunch of liars who mislead people and who probably work for the big companies.
