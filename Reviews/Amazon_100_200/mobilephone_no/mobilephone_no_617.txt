I have really enjoyed this phone and am quite pleased that I purchased it. I read a lot of reviews on this model and many other similar Nokia models and also other brands but have always had excellent luck with Nokia. The one thing that I really notice about this phone is the reception....I live in very rural WY and, while the towns have pretty good cell reception, away from town doesn't always.  I use this phone for both business and personal and have had NO problem sending or receiving calls or text messages.  The features are very functional, the display is bright and easily readable, the camera takes phenominal pictures and it has been very sturdy.  I am still playing with and learning about all its features and how to use them.  Overall, I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.
