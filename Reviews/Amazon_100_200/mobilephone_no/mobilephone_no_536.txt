I wish I could give no stars for this phone.  I have had two Nokia 6682s in my possession since October and both of them had serious, but different, flaws.  Since I bought the phone from Cingular, I tried to get the issues resolved there, but Cingular refused to replace the 6682 with a similar device, despite the fact that I pay a premium every month for this very service.  Next I tried Nokia, who directed me to send my phone to the wrong service facility.  Long story short, Nokia has had my phone for 24 days and does not expect to return it to me for another two weeks.  Don't be tempted - it looks cool and it would be cool if cool if it actually worked, but it doesn't.  You'll be stuck paying Cingular for a service you can't use!
