This phone is a piece of shit i owned one of these phones before and had no problems with it.  I was was in the menu setting and some of the words were spelledwrong i thought that this was i sony product, they do know how to spell. Then after the third day a piece of plastic at the top of the case broke off and then another piece, about 11 days having this phone the key pad square button came loose and fell off. One more thing it has such bad reception that i can not use it. Now that my warrenty is passed i have useless phone in the junk pile. Thank you for talking my money i hope the you spend and don't get rip off, enjoy  my $166.00 gift.
