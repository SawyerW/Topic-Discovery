The phone works fine but the battery is TERRIBLE!!!!!!  I would have it fully charged before bed, and before the next morning it would be dead. I would have to charge it 5-6 times a day and who has time to do that.  I thought it might just be the one I had so I told Amazon and they sent me another...nope, same exact thing happened, the battery wouldn't last 3 hours (and that's with me not even talking on it). I even tried my old razr battery because it works fine and it did the same thing so it was just those phones. Do not get it, it's a waste of your time!
