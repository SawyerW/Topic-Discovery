First of all, I thought this would be a steal. Since it's so cheap. Sidekick was the best thing back then so I decided to get one, to see whats all the fuzz is about. Bought it directly from Amazon and not any other seller. It did not come with original packaging, it did not come with any micro SD card, and the back of the swivel screen of the sidekick did not have any logo to show that its a sidekick lx 2009, instead its a black piece of plastic covering it.Return it because it did not turn on after I charge it. Since they gave me a white box instead of the original box, I'm assuming I got a returned product and that its defective. I would suggest it but after what happened, I will stay away from the Sidekick.
