I bought this iPhone as a gift in October of 2011, it was shipped on time and eventhough it is a very old model of the iphone, i bought it new.The person that received this gift did not tell me at first but i found out later on that it gave him so much trouble that he stopped using it after 3 months time.He later told me that the screen stopped responding at first, then there was no sound, then it would not turn on. He sent it to an Apple specialist to fix it, but they told him that it would cost more than what the phone is actually worth. so he abandoned this route.The reason i am writing this review today is to warn people who might be thinking of buying an old model iphone, most probably those are refurbished because they had a manufacturing problem.I bought this phone as brand new from the seller and it did not work, had i known earlier i would have returned it and got my money back. BEWARE!!!!
