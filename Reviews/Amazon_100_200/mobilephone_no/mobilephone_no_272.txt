Thanks to all the previous reviewers who helped me make the decision to choose this phone. Let me preface my review by saying I upgraded from a classic design $50 Tmobile Nokia that I bought two years ago and which had no fancy features but served me well. So I decided to go for a Nokia phone again and decided to buy the Nokia 6555 :)My verdict is I think its awesome and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, has a nice interface and is sleek and easy to manipulate (keys are great).Like previous reviewers, I was surprised that the battery doesn't necessarily last a day even with just phone usage since my previous basic phone had a battery life that lasted up to a week. However, after chatting to my friends (who thanked me for coming into the 21st century with my new phone), I discovered that most 3G phones have a short battery life.So in all, I am really happy with my upgraded phone and recommend it to any Nokia fans :)
