For the price this phone is wonderful.  It's solid, and very easy to setup.  I am using with TMobile prepaid SIM card and when inserted, it worked perfectly.  Brought over all my contacts.  Easy to connect to my home and work WiFi.I read a lot about this phone before I bought it and purchased it just because of reviews on Amazon. I read on other sites that it was hard to figure out and that the WiFi couldn't be turned off. Neither is true you just click on on the big square button and scroll down to turn on or off Wlan scan. And if you just read the start up you can figure it out no problem.  You don't need to set up a connection for email. Just Google your personal one and go there. Texting is easy with this keypad. Sound is excellent, I highly recommend this phone.
