I bought this phone for one of my 14 year olds, he needed a new phone and all the phones out there today are expensive and smart phones.  I did not want to pay for another data package on my phone bill - and this was the phone he wanted.  He loves it - it gets the job done that he needs - texting and calling - and not breaking the bank for me.  I ordered it for a Christmas present, and it came quickly, packaged nicely - in a new box.  Everything was there that he needed for his phone to work - I am a pleased shopper with Amazon, no problems with anything I have ordered. So far so good. If you are looking for a phone for the basic services this one is working well for my son and he is very happy.
