I and my wife have been Tracfone customers for several years; like many other cell phone users, we call on the cell phone only occasionaly. We really like Tracfone. You have to realize that if you get a really good deal on a cell phone and air time the customer service will be commensurate. So if you want snappy customer service, buy your cell phone from ATT&T; or Verizon -- they can afford it because you are paying a whole lot for it.I especially like the prices of Tracfone air time here on Amazon; We usually just buy a year's air time every January. Buying a year from Tracfone is about $100.00. We just paid $75.00 for a years airtime here on Amazon - that's about $6.00 plus a month - not bad - for our 2011 service.If we lose a phone, we'll just buy another one, and get it from Amazon.We were pleased with the prompt service from this retailer of airtime, the card even came with a thank you note with an email contact if there was any problem. the airtime loaded without a hitch.
