There are goods and bads of the phone. The build quality is definitively its strong point. And the camera.... oh my god. its just absolutely amazing. Blows away my point and shoots and is miles ahead of the camera on my nexus one. It come close to me DSLR, but not quite. The most frustrating things about the phone is the web browser and the on screen keyboard.First the keyboard. It just plain sucks. Hopefully sywpe will be release soon and fix this. No portrait keyboard and text prediction is horrible.Second, web browser. Coming from an Android browser... you get spoiled. The symbian web browser was once the king of the hill, but its showing its age now. Again rumor has it a new browser is coming out. Opera may be a good alternative, but I personally do not like it.I may return the N8 to nokia and wait for a new keyboard/browser to come out before committing the full $500+ on this phone. Its definitely a worthy competitor to my Nexus one and I'm having a hard time deciding which phone to keep. It all comes down to software vs. hardware.
