Pros:Very good form factor, Good RF reception, Good sound qualityGood camera .. even has a lens cover.Camera takes good quality pictures .. music player is pretty good and loud and so is phoneCons:Keys are too small and close to each otherSoftware is totally useless if you want to synch with outlook.Connector for Stereo head phone is bulky.Standard 2.5 mm jack is missing.Lens cover feels cheap and wiggles.No way to upgrade software.These may seem like small items, but they will annoy you quickly to curse the phone.Comments:It's good phone .. but doesn't work for the PDA functionaliy, the software is too bad. I love Nokia .. but there are much better phones in the market today to spend your money on this.The new phones have too many features and are pushed out by vendors very aggressively, not having the ability to uprade the phone software makes this phone very unattractive.If you want a PDA phone with MP3 player .. Sony has better solutions though as a standalone phone . .it's excellent.The manual is rather skimpy
