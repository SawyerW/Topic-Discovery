Alot of people complain about this phone, but I liked it. I got bored with it, but it never stopped doing what it's suppose to: text, call, pictures, and occassional games. Mine started screwing up and I had to send it back and get a new one, other than that, the buttons work fine, the phone isn't slow, and I've hacked it and put games on it, so it is very capable.I have pokemon and mario. Pokemon runs fine but Mario is kind of slow.Overall, for a teen who texts his girlfriend 24/7 everyday, it is a good phone that won't wear quick.
