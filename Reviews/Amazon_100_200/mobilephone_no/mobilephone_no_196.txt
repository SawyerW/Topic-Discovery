I have had this phone for about ~1 year.  Recently I have only barely been able to hear the person I am talking to on the phone. At first I attributed this to maybe a bad connection, but then I found out a friend was having similar problems.  I looked on the internet and found people were having similar problems.  This phone is WORTHLESS, it can have all the features in the world but if you cant hear the person you are talking to what is the point.I recommend not buying this phone.  If you are looking to buy another motorola I would check to make sure that it doesnt have similar earpiece problems.
