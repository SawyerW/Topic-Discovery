I got this phone two days ago. I have to charge the phone twice. After fully charged the phone last night, I only made one 15 minutes call, now the battery indicator shows the remaining power is only 1/3.Other than the battery, the phone is great, with good range -- I used to have Verizon with Motorola Krzr K1m, due to the poor receiption, I switched to ATT, and this phone has very good signal for me -- I can talk in any room inside the house without drop the call.The sound level is on the soft side.One plus is the phone book actually has address information in it also. While Motorola Krzr only allow phone number and email address.  It also can sync up with Outlook without purchase additional software.  I downloaded the PC sync suite, then using a PC bluetooth adapter, I was able to sync the phone with PC.But I don't like to charge the battery everyday.  With average 20 minutes calling, I expect the phone only need to be charged once a week.  Nokia gives me some extra daily work, that is not good.
