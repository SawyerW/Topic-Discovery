LG optimus 7.MultiMedia service does not work with T-Mobile USA! It means you can not send or receive picture messages etc. Tmobile can't resolve this problem. WWW does not have enough info. You can update and upgrade it to win 7.5 only with MS Zune on your PC. That's why I sent it back (thanks Amazon it was very easy). But on other hand it works fast, fills like solid piece (battery cover is metal - I like it), has a lot of free useful apps to download. So, FIRST of all check with your provider if it has technical support for this model.Good luck.
