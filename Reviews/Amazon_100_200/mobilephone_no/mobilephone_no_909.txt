I am impressed with how this phone works. I enjoy the widget menu as it puts the apps I want right at my finger tips, and I can move them from the widget bar to one of three 'home' screens.  The call clarity is very good, far better than any other cell I've had.  Very sharp image on the display, I've uploaded images from my PC and they look great!The largest problem I have is that the virtual keyboard is very small (hey its a small phone so this issue isn't one I didn't see coming), and I have fingers that cover between 2 and 4 characters.  So I've been having some issue with hitting the correct keys when entering text.Also due to the small screen, using the web browser so far has been more trouble than its worth, but I've only tried it a couple of times so far.
