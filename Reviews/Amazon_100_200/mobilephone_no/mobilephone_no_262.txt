It's simple and very sleek and has a lit keyboard.All and all very nice. The battery life is good. Build quality is good.Get the $139 double mins for "Life of phone" you can get the phone "Free" and 800 mins which in theory stick around for a year if you are careful. Not so bad.  I really have no complaints. If you order it online you have to sign for it which is annoying... Lucky I was at home when it got here. I don't want to make a special trip to UPS or wherever.To get the $139 deal you may have to get it from Tracfone. Maybe amazon has it? Keep in mind I DO NOT use a cell phone a lot. There may be better deals out there for you.Also the reception will be different in whatever area you are at.OK, that's pretty normal.From what I am seen read and re-read their "deal". Sometimes you don't get what you pay for. This phone is pretty much what it says it is.
