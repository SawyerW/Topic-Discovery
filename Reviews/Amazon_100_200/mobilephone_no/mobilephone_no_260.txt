I waited over a year to get a different pre-paid phone; one with a camera feature.[I had a nokia 1600 and it was a no frills phones, but it's reception was rather good, no matter where I took it. All across the USA, on trips and such.]The C261 takes about 1-2 minutes to:1. turn ON2. come up3. "Search-for-network"4. locate network, then be ready for talking.I understand it has a browser feature that my Nokia 1600 did not, butit's painful to wait on this thing to power up and become available for talking.I tried leaving the unit on, with powersaver functions all enabled.A couple days later I went to use it and it started up; then powered down  because it had run out of power.I notice that I have a lot more areas that have weak signals, or NO SIGNALS (the same areas the Nokia 1600 found adequate signals for phone service within).A very sorry phone.
