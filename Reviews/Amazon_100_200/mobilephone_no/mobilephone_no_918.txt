I wanted to ditch my smart phone and go back to the basics so i bought this phone. when i did my search on Amazon i entered "At&t; basic flip phone" and there wasn't much selection, but some were posted as "unlocked" and can be used with any carrier. This one however was listed as an At&t; phone which was not accurate, it's actually an unlocked T-Mobile Phone. The phone itself works great, and it's pretty much what i needed, but the listing is misleading and well, when i buy something online i need all the info on the product to be accurate. I want to know exactly what I'm getting for my hard earned money. Other than that, I'm back to the stone age with my Cell phone ha ha ha
