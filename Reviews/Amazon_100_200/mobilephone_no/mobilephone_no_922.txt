I bought this phone for $200 plus tax and I immediately had problems with it. It would turn off right in the middle of calls, the screen would randomly go black, and sometimes the web browser wouldn't work. Within 30 days I wanted to return it to the store, so I called the Straight Talk customer service number but they said not to return it. They said they would give me some trouble shooting steps and if that didn't work I could return it to them and they would replace it for me. The steps they gave me helped for a little while, but then it started messing up again. Of course, now it was too late to return it to the store. I called Straight Talk again and they basically told me it was too bad. So I basically wasted $200 on a phone that only lasted a few months. This was the worst phone and phone service I've ever had.
