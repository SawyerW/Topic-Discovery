I recently got this phone for Christmas. I love the outside soo much because it is Hot pink and very versatile. The keypad is very cool seeing as it is just like a touch pad. Now the frequent problems i have had with this phone is: 1) It is unable to charge sometimes and i have to take out the battery 2)Its Memory is terrible! for the 2 weeks ive had it now its memory is full 3) its battery lasts for a very short time and you must charge it EVERY night. Now my review is not intitled to disincourage you to buy the phone but if u do you must suffer the consequences. Oh and 1 more reason EVERYONE has it.
