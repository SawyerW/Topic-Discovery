On 9 December, I ordered a T616 phone from amazon.com, including an AT&T; service agreement. On 12 December, this phone arrived. Upon plugging it in and turning it on, I immediately called AT&T; customer service, by dialing 611 from the phone, to attempt to port my old T-Mobile phone number to this new phone.I ended up calling AT&T; about 10 times, and never getting through. Twice I waited on hold for over 60 minutes, and was not connected to a representative.  Both times I hung up after over an hour.Three times, I was given a recorded message saying that "due to circumstances beyond our control," ATT was unable to answer my call.Once I was asked for my phone number, then played a message saying that AT&T;'s system is down, followed by a click (hangup).I ended up returning the phone to Amazon, and sending a letter to AT&T; asking that service be canceled.  I never was able to speak to a representative.I think I will stay with my t-mobile service, thank you.  I thought t-mobile's 10 minute hold times were bad, but they're nothing compared to AT&T.;I would recommend the Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile) instead. - Jason Parsons
