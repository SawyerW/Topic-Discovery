i got this phone thinking its a t-mobile phone well i was wrong i wish i never bought this phone from these people when u look at the pictures it states that its a t-mobile phone along with the description i wish i had gone and bought the phone from where i was originally going to buy it  when u turn the phone on it says its a jump phone seriously what kinda phone is that u ppl stated it was a t-mobile phone when it clearly wasn't come on it didn't even have the t-mobile logo on it.i payed 60 dollars for a phone thats not even a t-mobile phone whne i could have took that 60 dollars and bought a real t-mobile phone.
