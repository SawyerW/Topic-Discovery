This phone is awesome!  I can take photos on here that I've never been able to take due to its 12mp camera.  I love taking this thing out and photographing beautiful scenes in nature.  And the video capture is great too.  Unlike other video captures this one not only records in 720p but retains that resolution when you zoom in... seriously!!!  Call clarity is great too.  Address book is easy to navigate.  The only drawbacks would be that there is no qwerty keyboard for portrait texting, and the default web browser is a bit odd.  But those two things are not enough to make me rate this anything lower than 5 stars.
