The phone seems to be great when the battery has juice.  Problem comes when you actually try charging the phone.  It says charging, but never actually charges the battery.  Told Nokia support this, but they still managed to return it twice NOT FIXED!  Today I sent it off again for the 3rd time.  The support isn't very supportive...  Have to wait 2 weeks each time i send it for repair.  No matter what i tell them or how upset i am, they don't offer any type of consolidation, or speedier postage for all this trouble and my wasted time!  All i can do each time is send it for repair, wait 2 weeks to have it sent back and have it not work all over again.  I decided to just buy a $30 unlocked phone for the time being and simply keep up this charade of theirs at their expense.Sincerely,Not Impressed!
