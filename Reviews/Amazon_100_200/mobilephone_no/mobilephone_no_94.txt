This is my 3rd Samsung GSM phone purchase. I originally bought the R225, then the S105, now the E105. I think Samsung makes a quality phone overall. However, they do some things that aggravate me. The holster that comes with the phone does NOT allow you to make or receive calls or txtmsgs while its in the holster! You simply can't open the cover at all while its in the holster. Therefore, you also can't turn it on or off. Also, the headphone jack is not a standard 2.5mm jack - the jack is standard - in fact, it looks identicle to a regular jack - but if you plug a "universal" headset in there, it will redial the last number you called - this is because Samsung requires a "special" 2.5mm plug for this phone - that means you either have to go back to Samsung for one of these headsets or you have to buy a particular one made for this phone.  Other than that, its a great phone. Battery life is good... I can even read the display in the sunshine (which is a nice improvement from the S105).
