I upgraded from the Sony Ericsson T300 to this phone and I think this one is fab!! I use it practically all day. It is a small and sleek flip, the outer caller ID is great. The menus were a bit confusing to navigate at first, but after having it two days it became second nature. The sound quality on calls is excellent, and having AIM is awesome! I have friends on T-mobile and the text messaging is a hot ticket!! The whole organizer section (calendar, alarm, to-do list, calculator and phone book) makes this phone practically indispensible to me. Add cool Java games and a huge selection of ring tones (and the ability to download more) and I don't know how I ever lived without it.I have two minor complaints - one is the number of steps it takes to delete things (numbers from the phone book, text messages, etc.), I have to go into the message, click options, select delete and then confirm (my old phone was half as many steps). The other feature missing is personalized ringtones (different rings for different callers).
