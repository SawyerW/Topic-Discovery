I've only had this phone a few weeks but so far i love it. The internet connection is so much faster than any other phone i've had. Nextel's customer service has been fantastic so far with set up and number porting. This phone is durable and surpisingly comfortable. The speaker phone is wonderful, ive used it twice and works great. The only thing that this phone could use, is a quick alarm. You have to use the calendar feature to set an appt and reminder in order to use your phone as an alarm. Other than that...it's the best phone and service i've ever had.
