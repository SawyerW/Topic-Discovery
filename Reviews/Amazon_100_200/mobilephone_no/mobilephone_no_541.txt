This order was a HUGE mistake.  Would have verified.details if I truly meant to order.  NOT as. Described.  NOt compatible with my plan.  STUCK BECAUSE LITTLE DID I KNOW IT WAS COMING FROM PANAMA.  It wasn't even the color stated. Black is not the new "magenta" to my knowledge.  In the picture I was viewing it looked red.  Now I have to try and sell it.  It would cost too much to return it.  Very disappointed and dissatisfied.  Seller said "was as described" I had typed in cell phone U.S. cellular and this phone popped up...and seriously how is "black" MAGENTA?
