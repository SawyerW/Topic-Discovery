I used this phone for over a year. This replaced another Nokia (that I no longer remember the model number to). This phone has 1 feature that is only present in a handful of phones in the world!!!This phone will broadcast to an FM frequency of your choosing directly. This phone has a built in FM transducer!The Nabigation was awesome, the apps were great. Nokia just did not make it future proof enough and the symbian OS is quite dated. The screen was big enough to watch videos, make calls but not for imersive gaming. Battery life was quite good and the screen's colors were awesome.12 MP camera blows most current phones out of the water.Voice quality was the best I've heard of any phone I've had for the last 5 years. Including the samsungs.The exterior was beautiful, brushed aluminum finish in GREEN! Loved it, upgraded to an SIII after I could not keep defending the Symbian OS anymore as android had killed everything else.Still if you're on a budget or traveling abroad and can't get your phone unlocked, this is a great phone to have.
