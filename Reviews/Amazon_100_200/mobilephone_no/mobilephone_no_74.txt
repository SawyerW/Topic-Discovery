i think that this is a pretty nice phone its lasted for a long time and has been dropped many times with very little damage. the best part about this phone is that it is simple and easy to understand. plus it has the coolest jumpnrun game on it ever! ok yea so the game deepabyss probably made this phone better since all the other games on it are kinda dumb..the worst part about this phone is that the joystick starts to get kinda sticky after a while.. but keep in mind that i have owned this phone for a long timeoverall its a pretty good phone not a very good camera thou
