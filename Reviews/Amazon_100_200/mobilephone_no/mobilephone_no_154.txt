I Recently purchased this phone and service.  Overall i am very impressed. great features.  I have no problems with coverage, It is at least 5 times better than my AT&T (TDMA/Digital) Coverage was. My only gripe is that the GPS is abit finiky (dosent always get a good fix, takes time) and there is no outright alarm clock, although the datbook 'workaround' makes up for it.The iDEN network is awesome, it is extremely fast; for example, an IM sent from my phone reaches the computer within 2 seconds, no lie!If you like a feature filled phone, and great service, I would make this the phone to get.
