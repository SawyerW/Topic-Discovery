This is basically the best phone I ever owned. Why? Because it has functions that I dreamed about having in my phone. I am not a multiple gadget guy, so I like having just one with everything. Nokia N8 does just that. It has a fantastic camera which rivals of even exceeds that of a regular point-and-shoot, powerful music player which delivers fantastic sound, all kinds of connectivity options: Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth.......and most importantly the call quality. Its just better. Then again it has its drawbacks, like its hard to find stuff in the menus, but thats probably because I have this phone for about 6 hours. About the app store...Why do people complain about it? It has tons of apps that are functional, there are a lot that I would use everyday, not like the IPhone or Android (I had both). Those app store are full of junk, and not a lot of usefull apps. So thats about it. If you are willing to cope with not the best UI, and would like to see lots of features and have great call quality, then this is the phone for you.
