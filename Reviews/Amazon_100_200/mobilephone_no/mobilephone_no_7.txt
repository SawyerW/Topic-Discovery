I've been a Nextel customer for years for both business and personal use. I've used almost all lines of phones. The i95cl was my favorite until i830 came along. The i95 is good for casual and especially heavy business users. The color LCD screen is huge compared to i730 and i830. Apparently Nextel had to reduce screen size in order to reduce phone size. That is one thing I miss in i830. I never had a problem with i95 size since it weighs about 5 oz. Great phone and I could not believe Nextel would discontinue it. *Note: I have an extra i95 for sale. It was my personal phone and in very good condition with some scratches. It is fully operational, travel charger and holster, shipping in USA included for flat $120.00. I will accept paypal only.
