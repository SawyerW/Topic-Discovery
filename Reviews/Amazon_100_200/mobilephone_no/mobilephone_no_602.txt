Have owned Motorola cell phones, and previously used a RAZR phone for several years until it was destroyed in an accident.  Liked that phone so much, I decide to replace it.  This Chinese made V3 is not what I had before.  It lacks several features, and after using only a few hours, the ringer doesn't function.  (what good is a cell phone that you can't tell if you are getting a call?).  It is also cheaply made compared to the original Motorola V3 supplied by Sprint some years ago.  Motorola cell phones are usually of high quality, but this piece of junk was a true disappointment.  Don't buy V3's from this seller!  IT IS NOT A U.S. VERSION
