I bought this phone because my old one couldn't hold a battery charge to save its life, despite all the new batteries I bought for it. This particular phone is one that if you are a small child, you will have a good ol time texting on. I, however, am an adult, so I add a lot of extra letters when texting. Like, I press three letters with one finger and then spend the whole time trying to backtrack to fix my spelling mistakes so people don't think I am a total idiot. It keeps its battery life, and the call quality is average. I don't think I would recomend it to anyone who would buy it as a two year phone, but it's an alright replacement untill the next upgrade.
