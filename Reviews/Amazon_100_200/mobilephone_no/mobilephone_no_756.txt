The free mapping software is actually pretty good. The phone knows where you are the instant you activate the Nokia Maps. I find myself using it much more then the built in GPS of my car.I can run 5 or six apps at the same time with no slow down in the processor.You can watch live tv for free via your carriers data plan.The camera is amazing. I have used every function on it including the software to compose a video with titles and credits.Nokia is adding new apps to their store every day.My only complaint is There should be a way to remove words from the built in predictive text dictionary.  When I press 4 then 5 the first word brought up is Im (upper case I). Tapping the star key brings up im (lower case i). I do not care about caps when texting.
