This phone is loaded with bells and whistles. This is one of the best phones that i have ever owned. The battery life is excellent, I charge the phone about every 3 days(usually waits until the bar is empty befor recharging) the talk time is great. Very small lightweight. I have MMode with att and i also use my phone with my laptop to access the internet at times when i am not in a hotspot. The IR on this phone works great and barely needs line of sight to make it work w/pc. Software was provided w/phone and it is very easy to sync outlook and contacts. voice support is really great also. I purchased this phone for $49 from ATT store, price was originally $199, but i printed out ad from Att website and took to the Att store and they matched the price...What a steal!!!!!!!!!!!!
