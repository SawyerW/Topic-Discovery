Stupidest keyboard layout in the history of text messaging. There is NO DELETE KEY. No backspace. No erase key. The manual says to press the "clear" key, but nowhere does it explain what this key is. Online, I find references to using a "softkey" to backspace, but when I use the right softkey as described, it merely skips over a letter without deleting it. In short, you'd better be an expert typist on this tiny keyboard, because if you hit the wrong key or time your typing wrong, you are out of luck. You have to be perfect every time.Stupid, stupid, stupid design.
