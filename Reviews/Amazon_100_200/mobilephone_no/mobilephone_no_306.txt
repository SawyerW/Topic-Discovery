An ok phone.  Definitly not worth the money. The phone looks better than it performs.  The phone is heavy for its size.  I didn't notice any improvement in reception from my old phone using T-mobile. The phone is relatively slow running through the apps.  This phone is not on Nokia's list for automatic transfer of GPS maps, so you have to download a map loader program.  The polished metal phone case is really slick, so you have to be really careful not to drop.  The inside camera image quality is not very good. Saving photos is not automatic. I upgraded the firmware, and now the Bluetooth asks me to connect.  There is no option to leave the Bluetooth always on (as far as I can find).  A plus is the keyboard quality.  Amazon is usually pretty good about price.  The price dropped just after I purchased, but Amazon wouldn't honor.
