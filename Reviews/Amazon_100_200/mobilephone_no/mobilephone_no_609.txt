I like it.  Everything works, good reception, and sounds clear.  That is all I ask of a phone.My wife does not like the numbers on the keys.  They are a different finish rather than a different color.  In low light, you have to hold it so the light reflects on it at just the right angle to see the numbers.First time it got knocked off the night stand while plugged in, the back of the case cracked next to the charger plug.  I put a glob of superglue gel on it to stop the crack from spreading any more.  That worked, but it does not look very good.
