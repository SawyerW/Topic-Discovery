Sprint is great, but this phone is not.  I bought it for my wife since it matched the UI on her old ATT nokia.  She HATES this phone for three reasons:1. My wife needs to charge it every night, whether she has used it or not.  Sprint says this is normal because it has a small battery.2. The buttons are impossible to use when you are driving since they flow together.3. When you go to unlock the phone the screen doesn't light upIf Nokia came out with a battery that lasted twice as long - even if the phone ended up bigger - we could deal with it.  As it is I have been directed by "she who must be obeyed" to get her the new Treo when it ships, or any other sprint phone except this piece of junk.
