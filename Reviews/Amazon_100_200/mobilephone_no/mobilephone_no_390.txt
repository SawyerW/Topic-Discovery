This phone has given me more headaches!  I got the phone brand new and it did not charge.  It has never charged.  I have just sent it to be repaired for the 3rd time for the SAME problem that they just never fixed.  So I have had the phone for 2 months now and never even used it.  Because I bought it through Amazon, NOKIA won't just replace it, but rather they keep making me send it back to the same place (PALCO) to "fix" it, even though they have never actually ever fixed the problem.  SO, I have no idea if the phone is a quality product, because I actually have never used it!  Customer service with NOKIA sucks too!
