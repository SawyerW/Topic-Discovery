I have enjoyed two previous Sanyo phones and when the 8200 came out I was eager to get one.  However, after having the phone for about 3 months I knew this one was a "bad apple". The voice distortion is so acute that I am often embarrassed by how often I have to ask people to repeat themselves.  If you use your phone for business calls, like I do, look elsewhere unless you want to constantly ask your customers to repeat themselves.  Just recently I have been facing the battery charging issue mentioned by several of the other reviewers.  I am disappointed that this product does not live up to the service I received from my previous Sanyo's.  I will say that the other features of the phone have been okay, but overall I would not recommend this phone.  I spoke with Sprint several times regarding the voice issue and either they didn't care or dismissed it as bad reception.  Bye-Bye, Sprint!
