I have been using this cellphone for over one year and all I can say that it's fine for the price.I experienced many crashes in almost every app ie. alarm, reminder, motoblur etc which sometimes can be a little bit irksome. There are many apps you can add at the android market, but many of them are really useless and they make your phone really sluggish.The camera it's ok, though it does not have a flash.And finally a noteworthy aspect of this devise is that it doesn't have a hung key, therefore sometimes its annoyingly difficult to find it at the screen.Overall, this phone is fine for what you pay but if you are looking for useful devise this is not the one you are looking for.
