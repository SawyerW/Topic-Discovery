I have been using this phone over nine months now and I didnt have any problems yet.Bigger displlay is very advantageous. It has good sound quality. Also the mp3 player is good.The phone software is easy to use and comes very handy in adding contacts or sycnchronizing calender from pc.Camera - its ok. You cant really expect much from a phone camera. But takes quite good pictures if there is enough light. The pics are blurry in low lighting conditions.Battery life is good too.Cons - Its bit bulky. Can be uncomfortable to hold in hand and talk for a long time.Doesnt come with auto keypad lock. But the software can be downloaded for free.People have complained that phone hangs, I have faced that problem only once.Overall its a good phone I will give it 4/5 rating.
