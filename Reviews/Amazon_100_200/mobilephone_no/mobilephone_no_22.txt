I have only had this phone for six months.  I am not a "heavy" cell phone user and only charge the battery when I'm down to 1 or 2 bars. I am having a problem that is sporadic;  the battery indicates full charge however when I turn it off and on again the battery will suddenly drop from full charge to "empty" (no charge at all).  In my opinion there seems to be a problem in the "on/off"  button.  I have phoned Sprint to ask if they are aware of any design problems;  their employees say, "yes, but not exactly like that, but you can bring it in if you want to."  I will make the trip to the nearest Sprint store (about 40 miles away) as I do not feel secure that this phone is reliable.  I have spoken with two other people who have stated they were not satisfied with "LG" models in general and upgraded to a better phone.  I wonder if this is a case of "premature" planned product obsolescence?
