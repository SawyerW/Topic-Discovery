I got this phone for work relaited reasons.  It does exactly what I want it to do.  Yes there are areas where you do not get service but remember, the type of phone does not decide your service, the coverage of the carrier does.Facts:  This phone will make and recieve calls when you have service.  This phone will work with direct connect when BOTH YOU AND THE PERSON YOU ARE CALLING has service.  *Important that both of you have service*  This phone is capable of downloading ringtone, wallpaper, and games/applications.Cons:  The phone does not come with a data cable.To summerize this, If you a signal on the phone and you make a call, it will go through.  I work for a Police Department and use my phone daily for work. It works fine. If it has saved my butt a couple of times (and it has) then it will work for everyone else.
