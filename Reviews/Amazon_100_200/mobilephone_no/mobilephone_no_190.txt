I purchased this phone last year sometime and have been using it since.  I am not very pleased with the phone for numerous reasons. Let me break it down in list form.PROS:1) Small, compact, light2) Good LCD screen, bright, good colors3) Pretty decent camera4) Good layout of the buttons that are inside the phone (not the exterior side ones); easy to pressCONS:1) Side buttons get mashed inadvertently when stuck in your purse or pocket.  This causes it to make a sound as it changes your settings.  Very annoying to have to reset it back to what you had it to before2) Intermittent freezing of phone.  I'm not sure if it is the phone's operating system or if it is just a defective unit.  Either way, it is annoying for me to have to open and close then try to power off and power on the phone to get it to respond again.3) Slow response to buttons being pressedI am looking at other phones to buy to replace this one.  If I were you, I'd look into other phones with similar options and features.
