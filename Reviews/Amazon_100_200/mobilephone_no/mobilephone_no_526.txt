Having had several cell phones damaged over time, I got tired of always losing address books on my phones. I decided that I wanted to sync my information with my iMac. I carefully researched all Mac-compatible cell phones, and I selected the Nokia 6682. And I am absolutely glad that I did. This is by far the best cell phone I've ever owned. I've had 3 Nokia phones with BellSouth Mobility & Cingular), 1 Samsung (Sprint), and 1 LG (Verizon) before buying this one.I was able to sync with my Mac on the first try, although it took 2 tries to get the two items as "trusted devices." I sync my address book, calendar, and to-do items effortlessly.The buttons are a little small, but that is my only complaint, and that is a minor issue with me since I do mainly voice dialing.
