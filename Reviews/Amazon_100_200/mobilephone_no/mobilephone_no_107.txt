I've had the e105 for about 2 weeks now and I must say it's one of the best phones I've owned.  The included ringers are truly embarrassing to play in public, but it's easy to download new and free ringtones with the free WAP access that T-Mobile includes. The rings are very loud though, and the sound quality is superb... my ringer is currently a song with the voice and all! The sound quality is great, but I guess that depends on your location and service in your area.  T-Mobile includes free basic WAP browsing which I use everyday on this phone, and for the people who can't access their favorites in T-Zones...all you have to do is hold down the pound button and your favorites will pop up. The battery life is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making a call, playing games, or browsing the web.  Overall this is an excellent phone, the people who complain about this phone really need to do their research before they blab, I downloaded new games, backgrounds, and ringtones for FREE.
