The Nokia N85 is an awesome phone!  The display looks great and all the features work nicely.  The auto-rotate feature isn't very responsive when trying get it back to vertical, but other than that, only praise for this phone.  The camera looks really good and the built-in GPS makes this phone a real 3-in-1 bargain.  I did read a review that said "this phone is painful to message on if you're a major texter" which I am, and it did take some adjusting to since my Nokia 6263 had a much larger keypad and the buttons were out-pressed.  It does get easier and after a while I couldn't text on the 6263 anymore.  I think a case is a good idea but beware before buying one that this phone slides up and down to expose the keypad and music controls, and the case I bought online didn't allow the phone to slide.  Real pointless considering you need to slide the phone to text or dial a number.  This phone also has quite a bit of internal memory and comes with a 7gb memory card.I recommend this phone!!
