Amazon has a good reputation for its customer service so I buy things from them all the times. This phone was the worst thing that they can try to sell to their customers. first, it won't turn on out of box so i tried to charge it. Now, it will stay turned on for two mins only when it's plugged in charged mode. Phone weight was so light like peace of plastic. Also, when phone turns on for two mins, all the menus and everything was in some other language (not in english). This really pissed me off. It looks like Amazon has given me the refund and i have shipped the phone back via UPS. Amazon customer service is good, but this phone sucks. Don't buy it.
