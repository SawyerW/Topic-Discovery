Well, it does the job. It is a wonderful pda. As a phone, I have to say that it has a few things left to be desired. For instance, the clarity of the phone is just not that good. I have seen cheaper phones with great clarity.By now, I would have thought that the size would have decreased. It is still a bit large.The feature that I have not figured out is the hold button. When you are on the phone and have an incoming call, you switch over. But, when you switch back to the original caller, it still keeps the second caller on hold - even if you chose to hang up. All the while, you see the minutes adding up - go figure.What I do like is all those features. When there is something that I do not understand, I simply go and chat with someone at palm.com. They will usually walk you thru whatever issue you have.Because of so many features and having the ability to hot sync, I will certainly keep the phone - it is a small price to pay.
