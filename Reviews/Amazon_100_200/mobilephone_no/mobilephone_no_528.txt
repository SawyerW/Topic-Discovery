I've owned a couple MOTOROLA  before and have to admit they do have cool-looking phones. They look so fashionable, stylish, and making you feel young. But...the only thing I hate is they dropped my calls a lot. I mean...A LOT! My calls would be just disconnected unreasonable when I only talked on my phone about 10-15mins. Sometimes even 5 mins!NOKIA, maybe some of their phones look chunky, not so cool as motorola, not-so-stylish kind of phones, but they DO HAVE the best quality of cell phones. Not mention the battery life, humanize functions, and of course, keeping stable while being used. I'll highly recommend NOKIA to anyone who are looking for a well made, great quality cell phone.And what is so good about Nokia  6682? Well, check out a lot reviews here and you'll see. They've got everything!
