I've had this phone for 2 weeks now. I upgraded from Motorola V60 and I have to say that this phone is far superior. The reception quality is quite good and so far sound quality is good also. There are some great features to the phone such as the huge 64000 color display and polyphonic ringtones. It is small, (smaller then the v60) very light and sleek. The battery life however is mediocre. I usually have to recharge after about 2-3 days especially when writing text messages since the display is a power hog. The phone sometimes seems to be slow while going into menus from the main screen and there are no sound profiles other than the main one and silent mode. If you don't use predictive text writing then writing can a bit clumsy because of having to constantly switch from predictive mode which can not be disabled as the default. So far the phone is one of the best I have yet used and I highly recommend it. If the size, style and display quality are not that important to you then I would instead recommend the Nokia 6610. For me however, this phone is great!!!
