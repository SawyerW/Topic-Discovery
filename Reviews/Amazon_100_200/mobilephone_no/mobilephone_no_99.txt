This phone is absolutely superb, I bought it this christmas because I needed a way to communicate with my friends and family because I am on the go a lot, and this phone is perfect for it! It's size is amazing, much smaller than it seems in the pictures, and extremely lightweight, fits in my pocket and is not a bother. It features a full color main screen, and a black and white screen on the front that displays the time, signal strength, battery life, caller ID etc...The features on it are also amazing, and t-zones is great, a service from t-mobile which allows unlimited wireless WAP access for only 5$ a month. AOL instant Messenger is also very handy for talking with friends, but it does cost 5 cents for every message sent or received so you have to be careful because the messages add up.  There are some oddities with the WAP browser, and the games are somewhat low-level but otherwise a great phone!
