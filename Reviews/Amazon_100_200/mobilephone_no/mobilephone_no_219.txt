I recently upgraded to this phone after having a Samsung A500 (which was a great phone) for 2 years.Obviously, the main reason I wanted this phone was the camera.However, the reception is better than my A500, the external color display is awesome.I like the speakerphone feature because now I don't have to pay $20 for a hands-free device.Some of the ringers really need to be replaced. That was the only thing that was disappointing to me. The A500 had some great ringtones. If you like to give your friends distinct ringtones, you're going to want to either buy some from Sprint or download some from the Internet.I also have a little polar bear animation on mine that I think is just adorable.And when I called Sprint to change over from my old phone to my new phone, the customer service rep even helped me change plans to save me about $15 a month in overcharges!
