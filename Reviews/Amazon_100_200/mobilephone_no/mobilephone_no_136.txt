I bought this phone from Cingular about 3 months ago.  I still have not been able to use all of its features, because I do not understand what they are talking about, and Cingular is too busy to help (but they were not too busy to sell it to me).  My son's contract with Cingular is up in February, and he will take this phone.  I am going to find a simpler phone with a different company.  Some of the problems I have had are the volume and the phone's features.  It waivers among too loud, scratchy, and non-existent.  Also, the instruction book is NOT specific enough for me, and this limits my usage of the phone.  And this is a very tiny phone--in the beginning I lost it frequently, and I had to dial the number to find it.  The battery life is OK.  And I LOVE that I can call people all over the United States for FREE.
