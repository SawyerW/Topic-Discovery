After downloading all the latest firmware I find this phone to have stunning capabilities but it is oh so complicated to use!! I believe an entire one semester class would be required to learn how to effectively use ALL this phone is capable of. I finally had to shuffle most apps to hidden folders and remove the SIM card so it would be usable as a mere gps trip planner/mp3 player/wifi information/and streaming entertainment gizmo. One tap on the wrong key and you'll end up streaming data off the cell tower and the meter will spin wildly until your prepaid account is empty! Best to buy a separate basic cell phone, preferably a net10, and use the E52 for everyting else. It's kind of like having a fabulously complex watch that tells everything but the time!!! Even so it's still an amazing device and a better music player than any I've ever seen or heard, with proper ear buds.
