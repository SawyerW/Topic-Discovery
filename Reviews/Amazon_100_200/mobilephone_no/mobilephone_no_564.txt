I've had this phone for a whopping 2 months now.Initially, the only problem I had was the typical 'sim card not lining up properly' once in a while issue, but that's pretty classic for most Razr's from what I understand.Now, for the last month, it's stopped ringing, and sometimes stops vibrating as well....Did I forget to mention that there's apparently no way to assign it to accept or send picture messages, because the server settings do not have a "SAVE" button?I know you're thinking, "But the phone's cute, it's pink! and it's SO affordable!"Please don't waste your time or money. Move along. Nothing to see here.
