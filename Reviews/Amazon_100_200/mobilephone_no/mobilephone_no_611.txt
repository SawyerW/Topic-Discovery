I have owned this device for one week and I finally put it on ebay. This is the most beautiful phone I have ever seen, but it is also the slowest one. The touchflow interface is not very reactive, it is not uncommon to have to wait for the scrolling to happen; sometimes the slow speed causes unwanted selections to be made.Loading any decent size application takes forever (e.g., flexmail).I had serious problems connecting to the local EDGE network (T-mobile) - it would just hang forever (my T-mobile dash zips on EDGE in comparison).A very nicely designed device but with serious problems.
