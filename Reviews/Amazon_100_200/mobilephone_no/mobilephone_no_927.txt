I love my windows 7.8 phone.  I have been using it for about 8 months now and wouldn't trade it for anything except a windows 8 phone.I have a couple of complaints.You can't cut and paste in Excel in Office for some reason.The battery life is not great, so I bought 2 extra batteries so that it would not be a problem.You can't send file attachments via email.The camera is mediocre in low light.Umm.... that is it.For the rest, this is the best phone I have ever owned.  I use it in teaching (attendance, checking and recording grades, writing documents, etc.), fun, travel, and just about everything else.  It's light, sharp looking, great screen, and the live tiles are tremendous.If you want a good camera, however, get a different phone.I would buy this phone again and would recommend it to anyone who does not want to buy a Windows 8 phone because of the cost.
