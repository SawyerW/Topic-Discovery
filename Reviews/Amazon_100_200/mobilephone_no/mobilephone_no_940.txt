Bought the prouduct expecting to have a plug and play, easy to use device.First deception - product did not neither with ship with connection cable to the computer, nor with the micro SD card, which I do not know if it is a vendor or manufacturer problem.Second deception - From day 1, after installing the SIM Card, the phone started to  randomly go into a reboot loop, and become very warm at the bottom under the battery door. Every time I use some application that requires more processing memory from the phone this will happen, be it browsing the internet, using the camera, or trying to do OTA system update.for more, see Josiah's review (Nairobi, Kenya). My situation is pretty similar.This a great product to recommend to my enemies...
