Upgrading from the simplistic Nokia phone to the more complex Sony Erricson was the best thing that I ever experienced...phone wise. This phone has many features, some take a bit getting used to, but once mastered this phone can be a powerful tool that nobody will know what they did without it. Bluetooth, one of my favorite features connect right up to my Apple iBook through a Bluetooth USB adapter. Surfing the net from anywhere while my phone is in my pocket is great. Poly-phonic rings tones are sweet! Pictures do need significant lighting, but can be great fun. Actually talking on this phone let my ears expierence clear calls from friends and family, even better quality with the included headset. The two not so major con's are a small lack of processor speed, and picture memory which again is again fixable by sending pictures to my laptop via bluetooth. But overall this dense, however not heavy phone is a great companion to one's day to day activities.
