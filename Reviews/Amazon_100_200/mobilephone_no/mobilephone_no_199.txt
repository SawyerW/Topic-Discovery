Yeah the phone itself is ok, but the real problem with this whole offer is ordering through Amazon.com, as noted by another review already. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application....so when you try to "Revise the order" the operation times out when attempting to contact Amazon servers. In short, you can't update the order with whatever credit info that they claim is needed. I contacted Cingular directly and was approved in about 2 minutes, and after placing another order with Amazon I actually got the phone. But the other funny thing is, you can't cancel the original order because the operation keeps timing out when contacting Amazon's servers again. So I emailed them and have gotten no response as of yet. We'll see what happens on that, so caveat emptor for all ya'll.
