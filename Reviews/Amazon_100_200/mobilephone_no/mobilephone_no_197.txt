I brought my phone October of last year from the Cingular website..This is my very 1st flip phone & only reason I picked this phone was because it had really good features, its cute & it has mobile IM which is AIM & YIM..I was happy it had both of those on this phone because I love chattin with my friends soo I could be on both even when I'm on the go..However it has very bad reception..I give it 4 stars tho because it does not work inside buildings you have to talk outside & thats something I hate, but they have antennas for that, that can boost up your reception which I brought soo now I have no problems I can talk on my phone in buildings soo really I have no complaints..Its a good phone has great volume & a good camera just gotta constantly keep the lens clean otherwise your pictures won't turn out clear..I can't speak for others but I'm very pleased with my cell phone those are the only problems I had but I fixed it sooo overall I'm happy
