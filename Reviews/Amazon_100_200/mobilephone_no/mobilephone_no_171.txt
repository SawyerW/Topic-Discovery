I love nextel. I know they dont have the best overall coverage area but in the area I am in (and throughout the state) I have found to have had 2-4 bars (service bars) 90% of the time. I have the i730 and love it. The main thing I do not like (that my last nextel phone had) was that it no longer (that I have found) has the loud ring and vibrate capability (as in ringing and vibrating at the same time) The only service draw back is that is that all the plans are between 20-50 percent higher then other wireless providers.
