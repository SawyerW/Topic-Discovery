This is a very good phone for basic functions such as emailing, browsing and chatting. But If you are a hardcore user (tons of apps) then look something else, because you will notice the lagging after a while (I am a hardcore user and it is getting pretty slow after 6 months of use. I have a lot of apps).My only complaint would be that it is a little bulky and battery life is short (around 6-7 hours, normal use, low brightness).Why the five stars? because for the price, the phone is beautiful, doesnt feel cheap and it performs well as long as you use it only for the basics. Also, Sony Ericsson will upgrade it to Ice Cream Sandwich.
