I got my 6682 as an insurance replacement after my other phone went sliding down the highway at 75 mph.... :(  The increase in size took a while to get used to, but now I like the solid feel of a palm size phone.  The screen is very high resolution and the 1 meg pics look good once they are on the computer.  As long as you have a newer computer and good internet, loading the drivers and synching software - while tedious - works well.  This phone has replaced my Palm Tungsten for all practical purposes... it is my alarm, date/appointment minder and throw down picture taker.The web based stuff is slow, but adequate for getting information on a cell phone... news, weather, e-mail in an emergency.I have not tried blackberry products, but on what phone knowledge, I do have, I recommend this product.  If you are a music buff, I would recommend a higher capacity card.  If the card is loaded to the gills, the phone tends to hang and all the good things I just said go out the window... :)All the best,Jay
