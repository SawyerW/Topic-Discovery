I bought this unlocked phone for use in South America.When it arrived I charged it up, inserted my existing SIM card & powered it up.Worked perfectly & connected with my carrier.It takes a little getting used to but once you know your way around it it's easy to use & operate.It doesn't have Google chat which I understand they are working on.Another need is a button to reopen pages you are surfing rather than having to try & tap them open which can be frustrating.One great benefit is that you can see Gmail in HTML mode rather than mobile mode.This opens all your folder links & helps to permanently delete SPAM.The camera & video is out of this world for a phone.We had flooding over the last week & I was able to take high quality photos & video. No need for another digital camera.All in all a great job from Nokia.Just fix the 2 small problems & I'll be even happier
