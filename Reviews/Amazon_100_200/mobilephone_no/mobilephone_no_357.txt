If you don't want to re-up your contract or if you are just looking to replace your current phone, this phone is great for messaging, gets great reception and has lots of fun features to play around with. I use this phone mainly for messaging and email and find that the keyboard is very easy to use and the screen is a good size for reading messages you receive. The only complaint that I have is that there isn't a way to adjust the volume easily while you are talking on the phone because they removed the side volume bar. Other than that, this phone is wonderful!!
