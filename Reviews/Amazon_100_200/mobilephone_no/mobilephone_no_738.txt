When I just got the phone about in february I still was not very sure about it.  The design and feel was great, but I seemed to be very short on applications for symbian 3.But NOW... a lot of great applications are available and its a sure 5 star phone for me.With Nokia I have been able to do so many geeky things since long 8 years ago...  the kind of things iphone and android fans feel so "new" and avant-garde.but yes... you had to be a bit of a geek to know the capabilities of a smartphone in those years  :-)N96 and N97 were big dissapointments... I was about to nothing to lose my faith in Nokia but this phone puts me back on the track.Now let's wait for the N9 with Meego,  and pray that the Nokia guys still offer the option for the customers to choose a phone with WP7 or Symbian or Meego.Symbian may not be as much eyecandy as the popular android or iphone,  but its incrediby stable and efficient,  and yes... with REAL multitasking capabilities.This has been their best phone since the N95-8Gb.
