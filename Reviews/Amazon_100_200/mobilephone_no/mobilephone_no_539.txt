I live in an area where phone reception is horrible.  Although there are pros and cons with this phone, the majority are pros:Pros:1. Out of all the cell phones my family and I have used, this one takes the shortest time to connect as well2. Clarity with every conversation3. Numerous amount of features.4. aesthetics5. battery life is longCons:1. like most phones and services, accessories and fees for extra services (i.e. for verizon the V-cast feature is aprox $15)2. The camera is good for about a 1.0MP but the zoom blurs once you reach the max 4x.3.  It is rumored that after a few years, the screen blinks.  This is TBD and I personally have not heard of any other technical error(s).In general if you take good care of the phone, the phone should work.
