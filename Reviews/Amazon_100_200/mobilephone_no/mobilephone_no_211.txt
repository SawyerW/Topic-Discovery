Had Samsung phone for several years, and recently replaced with Sanyo PM-8200, which has superb speaker phone ability, easy to use web navigation, pretty darn good camera capability.  The weak point is that it's got the poor signal reception (slightly better than Samsung).  Only area where I have a problem with reception is in my house.  ^^Just added this Nokia to my plan, and this thing has an exellent reception.  As far as other web, camera and speaker capability are concerned, this phone doesn't seem to be made for that.  And I agree that turning on the phone has been the biggest flaw, as I don't have a long nail.  :-(
