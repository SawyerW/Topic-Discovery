This Phone with Belle update is an excellent device.Screen is vibrant and responsive, Call quality is excellent.Arguably the best GPS and camera in the smartphone business, great maps that don't need data plan, and pictures that rival a quality point and shoot camera.Nokia N8 build quality is exquisite.This phone hardware and features was years ahead of the competition, too bad it took such a long time for software to catch up...leaving Nokia in a pitiful competitive position.I don't care much about apps, but the phone and app world have the necessities.Obviously not the variety of A$$LE or Android, but still adequate.If you are looking for a great unlocked global phone, this one may be just the ticket.
