The Moto Razr V3 is the best cell phone I've owned. I have the  Magenta color and its a beautiful shade of pink None of the cell companies in my town even carry this color Razr. It's smooth, and has a nice key pad with a blue back lite. Takes pictures and video's.  It has picture ID so you can see who is calling on the outter smaller screen and the inside larger screenIt also has the ringer assigning feature Has a nice feel to it. All in all this is a classy, smooth, compact phone. Does pretty much everything a phone needs to do and more..  I love mine, and am glad I chose it.
