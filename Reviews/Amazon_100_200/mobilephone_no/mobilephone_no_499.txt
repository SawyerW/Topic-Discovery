I've had this phone before.  I'm a construction worker and I have to carry my phone at work.  It had been dropped MANY times, not to mention fingered up with caulk, stucco, grout etc, but worked great for over a year until it got dropped in water.  It doesn't have speaker phone that I've been able to find but it has recordable voice notes which is cool as I can record anything I want to identify my contacts without hands.  The new one that I ordered was shipped/received promptly and so far has been just as great as the last one.
