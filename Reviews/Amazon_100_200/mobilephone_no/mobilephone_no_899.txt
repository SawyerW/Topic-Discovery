I was looking for a phone with a slide keyboard and decided to purchase this one after browsing through the many products on Amazon. The phone arrived in mint condition and it looked great. So far the service has been good (ATT customer) and the battery life is great. My only problem with the phone is the keyboard. The space bar is hard to press and it's giving me trouble because at times i need to press on it hard to get it working. I thought it would have been easier to use since the keyboard gives you a lot of space for your fingers but i was wrong. The keys aren't very sensitive and my other pantech phone could type much better. So overall i give this phone a 4/5, looks great and it has a pretty long battery life. If you love to text and do so frequently this is probably not the right choice for you. Again the keyboard keys aren't soft, you must press hard to make them work. For $80 and free shipping, its a great deal, at least to me.
