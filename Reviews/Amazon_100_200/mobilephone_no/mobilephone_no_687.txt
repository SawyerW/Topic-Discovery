I'm told this phone has been discontinued.  The company I purchased from is AMillo Inc. the phones they sell are not made to be used or warrantied in the U.S.A. Phones are made for use in China. They will tell you there is a one year warranty.  Be sure to get that in writing.  Also their standard shipping method is very slow.  I am 250 miles away from them and it took over a week to receive my phone.  The first phone they sent was not even labelled and the battery would not hold a charge.  The replacement phone is also giving me problems.
