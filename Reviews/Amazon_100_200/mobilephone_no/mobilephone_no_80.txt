This phone sucks. If I could give it negative stars I would. The color screen is great indoors but once you get in the sun you can't see it at all. It looks cool and it has a lot of features and is easy to navigate but where it counts it really sucks. It gets no signal, and trust me, it's not the service because I returned the phone and got a more expensive Motorola that gets a better signal, you can see the color screen in the sunlight and I can hear the person I'm calling. I tried to give this phone a chance but when I made a few calls on it I could not hear the person on the other end at all. So unless you plan on using this phone under a tree shaded from the sun on top of a hill on a very quiet day, don't get it. Once again Sony dissapoints, they need to stick to games.
