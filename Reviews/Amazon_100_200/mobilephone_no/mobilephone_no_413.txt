This is an okay phone, sometimes when you scroll to find something it scrolls past what you want, still trying to learn it after two weeks. The phone came to me in German! I had to search and search to find out how to change the language since I could not read a thing on it. The main thing I do not like is the locking feature, even though I saved the unlock feature on everything I could find the thing still locks and I have to hold down the side button to do anything, this to me is extremely annoying. I miss almost every call because I am holding down the unlock button and it takes so long I lose my call! I hate that!I have looked everywhere to find out how to disable this feature, apparently you can't.
