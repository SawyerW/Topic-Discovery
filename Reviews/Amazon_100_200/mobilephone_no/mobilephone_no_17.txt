I got this phone by signing up with Working Assets (Sprint network) last August.  The phone does well for basic features like address book, calling, and calendar.  It has a nice monochrome display and the caller ID line can be read with the phone closed.  Additionally, you can turn off the ringer with the exterior volume button, allowing you to easily cut off a call you don't want to take.  It doesn't have any fancy screen or internet stuff, but that wasn't an issue for me.My original phone did break because the D-pad got jammed.  It was replaced for free and I've had no problems since.  The reception hasn't been great, particularly indoors, but when I'm inside I usually have a land line around anyway.  There does seem to be this weird 1-second delay in speaking, a problem I've had with both phones, so I'm not sure if it's a Sprint issue or the phone itself.  You kind of adjust after a while.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the phone.
