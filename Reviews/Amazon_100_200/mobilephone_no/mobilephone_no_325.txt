Save yourself the time and money by not buying an Apple IPHONE. One real good reason is ITUNES wants to update all the time, you can not put music on your phone. You have to buy music from ITUNE. Updates to my phone eventually locked it up to the point of no more worky. Could not get on the internet without going to Apple's website and downloading a file for the phone to work with my phone carrier. Touchscreen no adjustment. volume control lousy, not at all pleased with Apple at all. I have had Nokia, LG, and Samsung phones and have been pleased with them Thought I would try a IPHONE. What a joke. They want you to pay for everything. I am used to a sd dick plugged into the phone to play music. Not with Apple. So just save yourself the time and trouble of not buying any Apple IPHONES.
