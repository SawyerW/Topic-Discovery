I bought an Nokia E6 unlocked GSM phone with touch screen, QWERTY keyboard (black)....  I asked the seller if this is an original manufactured product by Nokia , they said it was, but is not, the product they sold to me is made in china, the original product manufactured by Nokia is Finland made, also the included headset does not match the phone, so is useless, does not work, among other things, the phone this company sold to me is a FAKE ONE.Battery last only a few hours, even when is on standby, this comfirm that this  is a FAKE PRODUCTI can not make the claim, because the phone is in Peru (south america) the place that I live, will be cheaper to me throw away the phone and buy an original onePLEASE DO NOT BUY CELLPHONES FROM THIS SUPPLIER
