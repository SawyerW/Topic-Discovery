Bought this a few months ago, no problems so far.I don't use my phone for anything other than: calls, texts, photos, gmail, facebook, internet and the occasional gps.  It does the job for my purposes and the battery life is excellent, which is very important to me. The camera is very good, especially in low light.  I bought it in part because it is supposed to have good global gps, and I am anticipating travel to Europe this year for work, so hopefully it lives up to my expectations.My last phone was an n97 that threw up all over itself and died one day after 3 years of faithful service.  I appreciated the similarities this phone has to the n97 in terms of user interface, I was able to learn it very quickly.  If it lasts me 3 years I will be very happy.
