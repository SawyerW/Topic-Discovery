This phone has worked well for me.  The sound is clear and reception is fantastic.  The sound of the music is pretty good with the supplied headphones and the microphone/headset is crystal clear.  I have not been lucky trying to find a case or other accessories for this phone.  The only accessories that seem available mostly all came with the phone.  I have not found a case that fits it right to date.The music software seems to work well.  And the recording capability of the phone is also pretty good.  I like the full keypad for entering contact info.  It is a lot easier than with other cell phones.One final note - I wish they had a phone disabling option in order that the music player on the phone could be used in an airplane.If you're looking for a phone that is a little different, offers a little more than a standard phone and is easy to program and add contact info to, this is a great phone.
