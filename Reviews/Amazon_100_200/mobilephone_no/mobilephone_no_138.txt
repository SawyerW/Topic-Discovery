Over all I'd say it's a good phone. When I got it I wanted a camera phone but could not afford one so got this one instead. I have not had any problems with it other than it lacks some of the things I look for in a ceel phone such as*Camera*Speaker Phone*Being able to change the face plate w/o a screw driverAlthough I can change the faceplate myself it's a hugh hassle and I have to fight w/ it everytime.I love the it has the HIFI ringers and tha you can change the "service light". Another thing that sucks about it, is that it is so easy to scratch. I drop my phone quite a bit.. and it looks horrible. It still works great though. I've had it since November and will most likly keep it for around another month and than upgrade to the Motorola V300 since it has a camera and speakerphone.
