I order two of these Tracfone cards each year - one for each our two phones.  Sometimes I get a piece of paper with the info written on it as others have mentioned.  This past week I received an actual card that looks like the one pictured above.  Both work fine as they have all the info needed to add minutes and time.The reason I am rating this particular purchase 4 stars is that the tiny little card sent priority mail last week came with Postage Due!  The 'postage' on the envelope was some sort of prestamped thing that I assume the sender put through their own postage meter as there was no actual amount written on the envelope that I could see.  However somewhere along the line the package got scanned and was determined that it was $.95 short.  When I pay an additional $4.99 for postage in addition to the item, it absolutely should not come with Postage Due.
