I wanted to upgrade my old battle worn Motorola that runs the windows operating system with a 'newer' technoloy(only 2 years old)so i picked this phone which runs a newer version on the operating system, etc. the good is that the phone has a nice display and feel to it. the bad is that it would not work as well and allow much ability to confiure it with Activesync...example-it downloaded all 400 of my contats from outlook and would not allow me to filter what went on the phone..old phone did this. same for tasks. the signal would barely 'lock on' in my house, the old phone does much better. the driver in the phone is older than what is availabe from HTC but since it's an IMATE device they will not download new software to this phone. IMATE support is @#$#@. even after escalating to 'engineering' they claimed they made the phone(rather than rebranding it). i think you get the picture. Upgrades to the phone are available if phone is the Cingular version, which MAY solve the problems i had. i returned the phone and got the usual great Amazon support.
