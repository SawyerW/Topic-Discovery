Be very-very carefull when you purchase the quad band dual simm card unlocked phones, even the ones made by Motorola and sold by the unlocked phones KIng, because no one can provide you with tech support assistance how to configure the phones. Not Motorola, nor your mobile service provider or the seller who will direct you to call Motorola Tech Support and the Motorola tech support will direct you to call Motorola tech support in India!!!!! Actually you paid all these money to buy a phone that its only function is to make calls, forget all about the things that you can do with a smart phone.
