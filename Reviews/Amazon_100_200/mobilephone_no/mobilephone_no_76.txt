If you want the best of the phones in the market now and you are also looking for one at a good deal.. go for this.. it has got everything u can ask for.. blue tooth, camera, triband.. I heard the  AT&T GSM network is not that good.. but my phone T616 seems to picking up the signal well. I really didn't have any major call complaints with this phone at all.. The reception is really good .. I wonder why somone has blamed the reception.. I got this phone so that I can use it in India as well.. but I heard that AT&T don't unlock the phone even after the contract is over. I just hope this isn't true.. If they dont unlock, whats the point in going for a triband phone..
