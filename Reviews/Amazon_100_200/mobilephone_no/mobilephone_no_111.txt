pros:-cheap-good rf-good battery lifecons:-no bluetooth (cars will have bluetooth options now where your phone call rings in thru your car's speakers and the caller id shows up on a display in your dash and you can dial from your steering wheel, all while the phone is still in your pocket, ie, the 2004 Acura TL)-no voice dialing (if you're not going to have bluetooth, at least have this??!)-styling looks cheaper than its predecessor, the s105-text input is cumbersome, very non-intuitive-not a TFT display, horrible to read in sunlight-phone will *NOT* vibrate and ring at the same time! uhh duh?Overall, this would be a great phone for teenagers and young people but not for working professionals.
