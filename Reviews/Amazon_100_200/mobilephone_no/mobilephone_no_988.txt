Right out the box I was grateful to see that nokia kept with the stainless steel case and the one touch navigation. There were significant improvements in the camera, video and office capability. As the days to come I found that it wasn't a minor jump in improvements. It seems that Nokia totally cannabises the E71, E72 versions and built the E6 from the ground up. They created significant memory space and room to upgrade, they allow individual to go all day on a single charge. Also the diversity is incredible in creating multiple home screens that can be access at a touch; this makes it easier for someone who has a active lifestyle. I personally like the flexibility on communication in just using the wifi access instead of paying for unnecessary media package this allows me to have full access to the E6 venue without paying unnecessary fees. In short do your homework on features so you can cut any disappointment, this is a well built phone that works very well Nokia give the customer all what they adverise and more.
