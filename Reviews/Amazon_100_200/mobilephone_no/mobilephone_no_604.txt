I BOUGHT THIS PHONE THINKING IT WAS NEW, HAD TROUBLE RIGHT AWAY, WOULDN'T COME ON, WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT AND RESET IT ALMOST EVERY TIME I USED IT, FINALLY THE SCREEN WENT OUT AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS, I HAD A RAZOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND LOVED IT,AMAZON YOU SHOULD QUIT THIS COMPANY, THEY ARE SELLING BAD QUAILTY PRODUCTS, I AM A VERY DISSAPOINTED COUSTMER!!!I just tried to send this piece of s--t back and amazon says its to late, bought it on sept. 19, I have bought a lot of things on amazon but this will be my last, I can't believe there still selling this phone knowing its a piece of junk, so long amazon, as poe would say, nevermore, nevermore
