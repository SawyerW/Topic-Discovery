I have been wanting this phone for quite some time. Finally, with this year's tax return, I bought it. After taking 2 weeks to get here, I was very exited to start playing with my new phone. However, the excitement soon ended. Upon opening the phone, I promptly plugged it in. Once the phone said it was fully charged, I unplugged it. Within 20 minutes the phone cut off. When I plugged it back in, it said 100% battery again. I have been in possession of this phone for about four hours, and it has cut itself off at least five times. If you're willing to leave your phone constantly plugged in, then by no means let me deter you from purchasing the Motorola Flipout. However, if you would like to actually be able to get up and walk around with your phone, I would highly recommend picking something else!
