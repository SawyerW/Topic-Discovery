I setup a family plan with 3 people and we all got sony w580is every one of them was great lots of features good sound and service everything seemed perfect. 2 weeks down the road the first phone screen cracked from just stepping up into a truck and tension forming in the pocket of the pants. wow thats ridiculous then one week after that the next phone screen cracked from sitting with a seat belt on and the pressure from the belt against it. this is getting awesome the other phone was owned by my gf and she babied it like it was her child and from texting all of her keys cracked in half and the phone started shutting off when slid open or shut. I loved my phone i thought it was awesome but it was not durable at all hope this helped someone from having future frustration.
