As you can see, Amazon has stopped selling this phone (though you can purchase through other sellers) because of a flaw with this product.  The description of this phone states that it is the US version, but when my order arrived, and I turned the phone on, the menu was in Spanish.  Similar to what a lot of other reviewers are saying, when you get a voice message, you also randomly get a text with a symbol in it, and the voice message icon does not go away even after deleting the message.  Also, I was under the impression that this was a QWERTY keypad, it is not...it is a touch screen that has the usual number key pad, and if you don't mind hitting a button multiple times to send text messages, then you may like this phone, but it is not for me.  I will be returning it immediately and looking for a phone that's worth my $100.
