Do not buy!  The description said a manual would be included and it was not.  Motorola says my phone was manufactured in Spain and is not the US version.  I have to go to the UK for any support on the phone.  I assume that is why I didn't get a manual.... the stupid phone is not the advertised US version.  However, I gave it two stars because the phone seems to work, but I am unable to transfer/store pictures on my computer.  What a PIA!  Do not buy!UPDATE:  I just got off a chat session with the UK support group.  No CD available, no drivers available from Motorola.....DO NOT BUY.  THIS IS A RIP OFF.  Thank heavens it makes phone calls..... so far.
