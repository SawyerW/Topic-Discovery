Seriously, this phone lasted me two years through tons of crap.  I broke the screen and insurance replaced it with one of their newer versions.  The light on the phone "for the camera" doubles as an amazing flashlight, which I believe they have a feature to just turn on the light without the camera mode.  Most phones do not have lights so taking pictures at night never works out and trying to find things in the dark with that dim cell phone screen light "even if it's an app that turns your screen white," is never as good as a real light.  Sony is a reliable company that I have loved ever since PS1.I never had a problem with this phone till it broke, which was purely my fault climbing over a wrought iron fence whilst inebriated and trying to sneak into a community jacuzzi.I recommend this phone to anyone any day.  loved it and I miss it.
