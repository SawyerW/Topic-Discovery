you might think that you get the phone and you got a great deal, but the fact is that you don't, what will you do with a phone and a service that basically SUCKS...!!! REALLY, att wireless is the worst service you can ever get, you might think that I am just another reviewer but as someone who has reviewed att and trying to give it a benefit of doubt, NEVER EVER EVER TAKE ATT WIRELESS, ITS THE WORST SERVICE EVER, CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO HELP, BUT TO FRUSTRATE YOU TILL YOU HANG UP..THEY ARE THE WORST IN BUSINESS..Don't take a cellphone if ATT is your only choice
