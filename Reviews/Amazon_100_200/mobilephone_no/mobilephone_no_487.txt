Kyocera Jax is a great phone, especially at the price.  It's small, compact, and slips into your shirt pocket.  It has some great features for a phone of it's size.  If this phone is available with any other service I would recommend it without hesitation!  Virgin Mobile has the worst customer service, and coverage.  When I needed it, I couldn't get a signal.  I lost 160 minutes of air time that I purchased, because I didn't have the money to add additional minutes.  Nothing any worse than being a customer who is being told when to buy minutes for a phone.  200 minutes for $20 isn't a good deal either.  How long does 200 minutes last if you actually use the phone?  It won't work for just emergencies, because you lose what minutes you don't use if you can't afford to sign up for the auto roll over plan.  If a person is looking for an emergency cell phone only.  I recommend Tracfone, because they at least have some coverage!
