Here's a quick comparison if you are deciding between the E63 or the E71.E63 has- the slower incarnation of 3G (384kbps)- no GPS- fixed focus 2 megapixel camera- 3.5mm audio jack so you can use your favorite headphones  E71 has the 2.5mm, so you need an adapter of some sortAnd these are what I installed/added in the E63 and they all work beautifully.- Opera Mini Mobile 10 browser. Go to the Opera website, select the model and it picks the version of Opera Mini to load onto your phone.The Opera browser offers a richer web experience than the default Nokia browser- 8GB A-Data Class 6 microSD cardStored all my music, video and document files in it as the phone memory is only 110MB- Mobile Divx Player to play AVI video files as the build-in Real Player only plays mp4 files)- Paired easily with a Motorola H390 Bluetooth headsetA great Smartphone for under $180 if you don't care for GPS or a better camera.
