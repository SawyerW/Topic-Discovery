I have own the Sanyo cellphone for a month now, and it has been a horrible month for me to use this cellphone.  Voice transmitted is distorted and therefore whenever somebody calls me, I have to put the cellphone very close to my ear, listen to the mumbling voice and make a guess on each word, and it hurts my ear after I make a five minutes short conversation.  I have adjusted the receiver level to the highest level, but it does not help.I will not buy a Sanyo cellphone anymore and I will try to sell this cellphone as soon as possible.
