I've been a hard-core Nokia-only user for years (my last 4 or 5 phones.) My old candy-bar style Nokia with a tiny screen was getting old, so when I heard about this hot new flip phone from Nokia that was the same size, I wanted it.  Well, I got it and it isn't that great.  The 320x240 QVGA screen is nice and clear, but the software and services for it are not up to par with the latest from Sony, etc. that my friends at work show me.The USB connector is "micro-USB" so I had to order a new cable since all my cables are "mini-USB" which is only about 1mm larger.  Also, it has the narrow charging port, so all my old Nokia chargers are worthless.  The headphone jack is also micro-sized.  Who has micro-headphones?I'm pretty technically inclined, but I can't figure out how to wirelessly transfer my pictures off this camera.  So the 2 ways to get pics off are to buy the micro-USB cable, or yank out the micro-SD-RAM chip.  I say yank because it is behind the battery, next to the SIM card.
