I purchased the Iphone for my 13 year old son as a birthday gift. I currently have Tmobile as a my cell phone provider and didn't want to go thru the process of going into a new 2 yr contract or purchase an expensive phone thru the plan, so I searched because he always wanted an Iphone. The phone was delivered within 3-4 days I believe which was very fast and it was unlocked as it stated and it was in very good condition. I called my cell provider and updated my data plan for his line and they were very helpful and the phone is working without any problems. I may purchase another one for my mother from the same company. Very happy with the phone.
