This is a great "basic" phone - Other basic flip phones always broke at the hinge after about a year and were made of cheap plastic. This phone is made of substantial materials and the slide design is very sturdy, plus helps protect the keyboard. I also like how the slide feature elongates the phone, so the mouthpiece is down by my mouth - don't feel like I need to remove the phone from my ear in order to talk into the microphone.  And even though it's "basic" by today's standards, it has a GPS feature that serves as a 411 or map directions. Nice big screen, easy to view, has the basic camera... Sound is great and speaker feature very loud and clear. Great product, especially for the price. I took it for a swim with me, so I'm having to replace it and thankful I found it on Amazon, because the stores claim these basic phones aren't available anymore.
