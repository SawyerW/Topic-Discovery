I just recieved a Orange N8 (3/31/2011) that was victim to the AMOLED "Purple" screen issue, this may mean there is a bad batch in the Amazon warehouse. Google "N8 Screen Problem" to learn more. But just be cautious.  On a lighter note, this was to be my second N8, it may not be the pretiest UI but is definatley does the most of any smart phone I have owned, and i have had my fare share (2.2 Froyo, iOS4, S60, S40) If you are looking for a dependable "Do anything" device this is it, If you are loking for constant fun, look elseware. If it is photo and video that you love, look no further and hit the "add to cart" button.
