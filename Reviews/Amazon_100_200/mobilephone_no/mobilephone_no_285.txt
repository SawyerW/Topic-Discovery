I bought this product from Hasselfree. It is not working anymore. I have just stopped using it.I am currently using my old nokia 6600. This phone is biggest mistakes I have made. They touch screen goes blank and you have to remove the battery to get it back. You can not attend the call. The voice quality sucks. Battery life is very short. I will just not to buy electronic items online because you never know if they are new one. I believe my item was defective from the begining. I just realized it a little late. But I have decided not to buy anything from this vendor. This is cruel that you spend some good money to buy junk.
