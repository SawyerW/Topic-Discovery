I bought a Motorola Razr V3 phone through Amazon, though the actual seller is another company. It was supposed to be an unlocked phone, but is currently locked to T-Mobile. My phone provider is AT&T; so i am unable to use the phone. I spent hours on the phone with my provider and Motorola and T-Mobile, but was unable to unlock it. T-Mobile said i was never with their service, so they could not give me the code for it. My provider even talked to them, to no avail. The phone remains a hostage of T-Mobile. I even contacted the company that sold the product through Amazon, still wonder why they would sell a product to anyone that can only be used by one certain provider's customers, they never responded. I am currently out the money and have a phone i cannot use unless i switch service providers. Though i have ordered other products through Amazon and have no complaints with them, this experience has made me think twice about buying products from a company online, instead of going to a store to get them.
