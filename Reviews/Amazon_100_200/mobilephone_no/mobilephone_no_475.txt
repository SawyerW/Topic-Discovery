Every step of the way was a hassle:  Tracfone needed all kinds of information to use the phone number from my old company; it did not activate according to directions and I was on the phone for an hour trying to get some help, then I was unable to purchase time for it on line and on the phone itself, so I was forced to call again.  Sad to say, the reps were all nice, but I cannot understand their accented English, mostly because I am elderly and I need to hear the end of every word in human speech to understand it and none of these reps say the endings of the words. I was able at last to obtain some minutes and I hope I will be able to use this phone for the  purpose for which it was intended. Price seems good, but I beleive it has been about 6 - 7 hours on the phone and online trying to get this thing going and even for the good price I am not sure it is worth the hassle.
