I received this phone after a day, which is a day earlier since I used Prime and it usually takes about 2 business days to arrive. The phone is new, clean, and well put in the box. It works perfectly well, no complaints. Some people mentioned that the ball controller in the middle is a bit weird, but once you get used to it it's perfectly fine.Two things to specifically mention though.1) Ringtone has to be smaller than 300kb? I never knew this, but apparently the new LG CU720 models produced has a limit on ringtone size. It has to be under 300kb and it cannot be longer than 25 seconds.2) the buttons are hard to push. Especially the last row. But it's not a big problem.Overall, very nice phone.
