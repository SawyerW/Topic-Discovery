I have been a Nokia fan for years. This phone is more like a Blackberry in that is designed for business use rather than personal social media applications. I meets all my business needs. I have owned Nokia phones before and dreaded setting this one up. It turns out it is automatic. Just insert the SIM card, answer a few questions like where in what country and city the phone is going to be used. In a flash the phone configures itself. Then it asks some basic questions about your email service. Again it sets this up quickly as well. Had I known that I would of bought on a year earlier. So if it a business phone you want consider Nokia.
