The phone is great, but order the service through Amazon is terrible. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application...., just like the other two reviewers, although the email from Amazon indicated that they had automatically canceled the order due to insufficient information. They DID NOT refund my money to my credit card. I have contacted Amazon but gotten no response yet....Be aware to order the service through Amazon, you might end up giving ALL your information through internet for a credit check but get hassle in return.
