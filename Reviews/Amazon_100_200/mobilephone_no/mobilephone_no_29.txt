While you shouldn't expect this phone to replace your digital camera, there is something great about having the ability to send someone a picture on a whim.  The Sanyo SCP-8100 would be a great phone even without the camera!  The menus are very easily laid out, and very easy to read.  The screen is large enough to read 9 - 10 lines of text off the web (I love reading SI.com's writers' columns).  Adding the ability to take pictures just makes it better!  I travel some with my work, so I enjoy getting pictures of my children while I'm on the road. Photos can be sent to up to 10 e-mail or phone addresses at a time.  Voice messages can be sent along with the photo.  Sprint's service even allows people to reply to the photo, so I can get comments attached to the photos.The only reason I don't give this phone 5 stars is due to resolution for pictures.  It would be nice if the resolution was a little larger, so you could print off small photos.In spite of that, I'd certainly recommend this, along with the plans provided by Sprint.  Great plans...great phone!
