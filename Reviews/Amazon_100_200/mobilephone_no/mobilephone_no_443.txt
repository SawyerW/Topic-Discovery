I ordered this card as part of a three-component deal from the seller - a phone, a microSD card and this airtime card. I received this item three days in advance of the other two because it was shipped directly from the seller and the phone and SD card were shipped from Amazon.The phone activated on the first try and the minutes from this purchase were credited, so I can report no problems. However, it's worth pointing out that what I got for my $5.00 shipping was a piece of paper with some instructions, and a sticker with the airtime code. No seller name, contact info, anything. I would have much preferred to get the physical card, which acts as its own proof of purchase, provides backup codes should there be any issue with the airtime code, etc. And while I accept the shipping cost as part of the deal, I think it is excessive when a simple numeric code - or plain piece of paper - could have been sent much more cheaply.Good deal, questionable delivery, potential problems if the code is in any way questioned by TracFone.
