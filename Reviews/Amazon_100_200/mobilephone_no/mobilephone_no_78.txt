This may be a decent phone, but with its upgraded sibling SonyEricson T637 on the market, which has a much better camera at more than 65,000 colors, a slick appearance and much beefed-up features, this phone at $200 with a plan seemed a **RIP OFF**!Last week I've just upgraded to the T637 for $100 with an on-going promotion w/ a 2-year contract with Cingular. Right now I thoroughly enjoyed my T637. BTW, T610 is being given away for free with a contract at Cingular.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a great fan of amazon, but this is got to be the most ridiculous deal I've seen in a long time. AT&T might as well just rob me!I rate it one star for poor value, which really is an understatement.
