people, this phone is the best phone ever created. i simply love it. i didnt really plan to get this phone but one night i lost my i95 (which was a great phone) and decided to buy the i730 since it was the newest. The features i love about this phone is the slim size, the 65k color screen, the disco lights that light up when you recieve a call, the gps feature, the arrangement of the buttons, the 600 number phonebook, assignable ringtones, the arrangement of the menus, the style of the phone and also the talk time. the phone is the best phone on the market and its on the best network in the country which is of course nextel. with the nationwide walkie talkie you cant go wrong. i also have one of the best plans that they have ever offered which includes 1000 mins, unlimited night and weekends,and unlimitied walkie talkie for $54.99. so basically im nextel for life, holla!!!!!!!
