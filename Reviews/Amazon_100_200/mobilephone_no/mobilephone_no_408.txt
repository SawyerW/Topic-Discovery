Now that I figured out how to use it properly, I really like it!  I'm a "go-by-the-manual" sort of woman and the users-manual that came with it wasn't extremely helpful.  It didn't explain anything about how to get to the virtual qwerty keyboard (this is my first) or how to retrieve your voice mail messages.  When I call for my messages I'm directed to enter my password but when I press the "keypad" button, it doesn't work.  Maybe I'm missing something. So, I had to figure out a different way to retrieve my messages...a 3-step function instead of the one-step. However, for all the initial frustration, the phone is perfect for me and I'm very satisfied. I love the FM radio and the whole "touch" thing is excellent, not sensitive at all.  No dropped calls, easy "lock" function and a lot of little extras.
