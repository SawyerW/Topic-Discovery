After many positive experiences with Amazon, I am not totally satisfied, but will keep this phone anyway.  First, it is not a U.S. version.  Came with default language in Spanish, and it took time to get it into English.  Did not come with a 1 gb micro card as described in the listing. There is no real user manual, only on the cd, and it really isn't very clear on functions and difficult to download onto Windows 7. Cant say how good phone is until I get a micro card. My AT&T; sim card had the phone up and running in no time.  Overall, phone seems to be OK, but Amazon dropped the ball on what you're getting by their item description.  That being said, the s5230 seems to be a good deal for the money, just remember, it's not an iPhone.
