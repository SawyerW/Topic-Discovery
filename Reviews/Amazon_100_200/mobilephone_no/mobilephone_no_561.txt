I had to replace my other razr because it fell in the toilet.  so i ordered this unlocked phone, it came in a few days, which was really great.  the phone does the job, unfortunately, it didn't take the previous SIM card, but that may have been my fault mishandling the sim card, or the sim card was damaged anyway, what with getting in the toilet.  the only complaint i have about this phone is that it doesn't really accept text messages, maybe that is an issue with the plan i have.  the battery life isn't great, it starts beeping low battery after about 2.5 hours of talk time.the color is briliant.
