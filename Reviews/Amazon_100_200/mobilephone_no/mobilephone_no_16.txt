This phone is really easy to use.  Like listed above, it is simple with not alot of features.  It is my second LG phone and I am happy with it so far.  The sound is good quality (loud enough), signal strength is good, buttons are slightly larger than on the LG TM-510, small and compact phone, very lightweight, silver finish makes it look very professional, might not have along of ringtones to choose from but it gets the job done.The only drawback on it is features.  If you are looking to be able to send text messages, have various ringers, large screen (meaning the size of the font on the screen), and a very well featured phone-then, as stated before, this phone is not for you.  If you are looking for a good phone that will serve your basic operations of simply sending and receiving phonecalls, then this phone is what you want.
