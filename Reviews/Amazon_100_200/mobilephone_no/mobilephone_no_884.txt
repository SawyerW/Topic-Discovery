Phone didnt come in the advertised T-Mobile Retail box but I dont really care about that.  The phone worked right out of the box turned it on and checked it out everything was good was listed as brand new and it was!Its not a T-mobile phone though it has no T-Mobile Branding! I dont mind that at all either took it to T-Mobile the same day and got it connected....or course internet doesnt work but that doesnt matter still a great phone for calls and texts.  Calls are clear and crisp and texting is a breeze on the large keyboard.  Very good buy I will definitely be buying more phones from this supplier!
