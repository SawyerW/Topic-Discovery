I was looking for a flip-phone that had good call and sound quality and would be easy to text with. This phone is perfect for both, without any extra features or apps (which I didn't want to spend money on to begin with).I have owned and used this phone for about a week now, with T-mobile.It's speaker volume and clarity as well as when you hold it up to ear are both excellent. This is a great simple phone if you are looking for basic functions only. It's nicely sized, not too bulky to fit in a small pocket, and is very light. Connected to my bluetooth ear-piece easily, and worked well. The only thing is the phone is made of plastic which makes me want to get a rubberized cover for it in case it falls or gets scratched. Over all I am very pleased with this phone!
