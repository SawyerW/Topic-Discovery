Unlike other reviewers, I did get a card, not a piece of paper.  Although, that doesn't matter to me.  All I need is the PIN to enter online and get my minutes.Money does matter to me, and for fifteen dollars less, as long as I can wait a few days, I can get the same amount of minutes as I can on Tracfone's website.  A fifteen dollar saving is worth five stars, but, since they charge five bucks to mail a card, a ten dollar saving is only worth four stars.Do yourself a favor, too, and check Tracphone's website for promotions before you redeem the minutes online.  I got a code from Tracfone for an extra 250 minutes.  The code was 56036, and is good until May 31, 2013.  They'll only double or triple the 400 minutes, and added the 250 on top.
