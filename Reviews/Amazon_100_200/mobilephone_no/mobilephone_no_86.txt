After I placed the order from Amazon, I called the ATT customer service to work with the phone plan. As I haven't got enough amount ($800) in my debit card account, the guy told me to go to a ATT direct store to pay the phone service deposit of $800. When I got to the store, the representative told me that I cannot pay the deposit without a phone number. And they seems do not know anything about the connection of Amazon with ATT about this phone + service plan. After several visits to that shop, I still cannot get a phone number. I finally cancelled the order from Amazon. I think the representatives in ATT do not know much about the system of their company and they really need more training before they can serve customers.
