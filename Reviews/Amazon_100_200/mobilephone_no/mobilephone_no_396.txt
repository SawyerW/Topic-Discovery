Ok.  Let's face it -- there is a generational difference here.  So this is going to bought by a higher percent of older persons than young.  (Of course, there will be many, many exceptions.)Anyway, from my older person's perspective this phone is great in many respects.The clamshell: I don't change settings or call several people by carrying it my pocket.  Great.But I can still turn off the ring -- why don't they change it?Rugged construction and I hope LG durability.  Super Great.And I give up a bunch of stuff that I don't want, won't use, and that can cost money every month anyway --  great.The buttons are BIG.  I don't have to carefully stick the tippy-top of my little finger in there to dial a number or access menu items.  Fantastic.But don't they know a few of us with imperfect eyesight (not iSight) will be using it. Why do they make the date and time so small?So the virtues of a clam shell LG -- but somebody went to sleep on a couple of aspects.  Maybe next model.  I'd be happy to be a beta tester. No charge.
