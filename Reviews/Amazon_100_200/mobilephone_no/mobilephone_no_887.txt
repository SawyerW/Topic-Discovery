I agree with the majority of what Madinventor noted in his review. However, some of the things you will find out later are that, although the phone is unlocked, its apps are built for T-mobile. That is, if your carrier is AT&T;, you'll easily be able to use your AT&T; SIM card for phone calls and texting. You will not, however, be able to connect using the web browser, IM or email apps. The phone will automatically attempt to connect to T-Mobile's services.If it's possible to reconfigure the apps to work on AT&T;, I haven't found a way. Admittedly, I didn't use these features very often on my old phone, but it was nice knowing that I could. Several prospective buyers also asked Madinventor questions, and I believe that I've also answered most. I should note that, yes, it's supposed to be a "new" phone, but mine was missing the SD MicroCard which was listed under "What's in the box?".Other than what's noted above, it's a nice phone. Just wish I could take advantage of all of its other features.
