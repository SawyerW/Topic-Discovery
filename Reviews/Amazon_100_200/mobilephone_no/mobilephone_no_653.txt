I played a few days with the camera of the N8. It's just plain excellent, macro imaging, panoramas and so on all function very well (and new apps seem to be coming to further improve the usages of the camera!). It's also easy to launch as there is as separate button for the camera. I'd strongly recommend for anyone looking for a backup for SLR  or just looking for a compact camera. N8 fits your pocket very easily, the lens is quite well protected and you can buy extra cover if needed. And there is enough space + networking + apps to easily get the images to photoshop, flickr etc.I was also pleasantly surprised by the media player and other features of the phone. The only thing I don't really like is the swiping "feature" of lagging switching of the home screen. Also, I'm expecting an improvement for the basic web browser - however this is easy to come by by switching the default browser to Opera which you can find from Ovi store.
