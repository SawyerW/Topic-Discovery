I bought this phone about a month ago, i love this phone all the features are easy to manage, the email service is good and i get all the mails from yahoo,gmail,hotmail. The touch flow is good and the rest of the touch items are real easy to use.. The only thing that i really dont like an is real frustrating is the battery life, its get to a point that i am not sure how long is the battery life... The battery life is so short that i need to check it every hour, is so irritating is no joke...The battery life is SO SHORT... The phone its self is a good phone.. but the problem is the battery other then that the phone is nice...
