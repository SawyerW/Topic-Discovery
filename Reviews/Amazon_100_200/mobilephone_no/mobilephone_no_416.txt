This is a great phone, Ordered it on the 4th of March, in 5 days it was at my USA address and in another 5 days I received it here in Barbados.My organisation gave away one of these phones for a cruise we had, and I fell in love with it since then, so I decided to order it from Amazon (My first item ordered online YEAHHH!!!). I have not been disappointed since. Came with everything it said it was going to come with (1 GB Memory Card) along with a surprise: 1 Stylus for use with the Screen.Great job Amazon. I will be ordering more stuff again soon. :DP.SI bought it to use on the Digicel Network (Barbados Ltd.) and it was simple to configure for the local network.
