The original phone at full charge would run out of juice on "standby" in around 3 days. I replaced the battery with a newly purchased one and still the same. Don't know what part of this phone sucks the juice up like that.And you would never want to turn off the phone to conserve battery, because when you actually want to use it you would have to wait 1-2 min just for it to turn on and "search for network."Camera works decently, but there's no direct way to transfer the pictures to your computer except by email/mms.The phone is only worth getting if it is free.
