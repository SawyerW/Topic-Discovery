I bought this phone couple of months back and till date I am extremely happy with it. It's a bit bulky but somehow I do not like the sleek ones. I do feel good about it's weight. It has a wonderful camera @1.3 MP with a slot for memory stick. A 8MB stick also comes with the original box. So if you are photo freak then you can consider a bigger stick. But for casual photography the stick is sufficient.Being a Nokia, there is no doubt about navigation and ease of use. The software is good and does most the task with ease. I did have some problem installing the software but when installed, there was no problem at all. I do use it only occasionally.Just a reminder for those people who try to compare this with PDAs....this is not a PDA...its a smart phone.With holux GPS receiver and software you can actually make this phone a full fledged navigation system with voice, if you want.
