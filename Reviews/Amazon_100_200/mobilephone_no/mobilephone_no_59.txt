PROs: It is small, and it is useful for making and receiving 'phone calls.  You can customize the background picture and the ring tones (but can't use tones in mp3 or AAC formats).  The Bluetooth is great.CONs: Camera function is pitifully low in quality, really a joke, so you may wish to load good quality pictures from your Mac.  The Sync for addresses works, but unfortunately the formatting of the files means that businesses are listed separately from individuals, and many entries do not end up in proper alphabetical order.  Advanced features like email and Internet access are essentially worthless, and cost extra; in no way can they compare with a laptop computer.  Needs much more memory and reliable address-formatting.  Code for making custom ring-tones is cumbersome and impractical to do on the 'phone: needs mp3 and AAC compatibility to be any real fun.
