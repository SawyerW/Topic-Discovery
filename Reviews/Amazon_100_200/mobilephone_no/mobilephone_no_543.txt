The  telephone was in good condition, it was suppose to be new, not sure about that, the battery was weak, and would not hold a charge for more than an hour or two, less if you used the telephone. I replaced the battery and it is working great now. The plug-in charger sent with the telphone does not work. But Because I have had a few RAXR's, in the past, I was  able to loccate a plug-in that worked, still I was disapointed that the one I recieved with the telephone was defective. I was not sure who to complain to, so I left it alone, but would greatly appreciate a replacement plug-in charger.
