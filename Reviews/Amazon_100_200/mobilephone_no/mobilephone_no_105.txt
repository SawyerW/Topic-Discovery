I have had this phone for a month and have been happy overall with it so far (although not nearly as much as the S105 that i had before).  The one main advantage is that it is small and fits in my pocket very nicely.  The screen is a crisp color display and the reception (in NYC) is fairly good.  The one main problem that I have with it is the speaker quality.  I am often not able to hear people clearly through the phone, especially when there is noise on the street.  The battery lasts about 2-3 days without a charge (at a moderate amount of talk time) and for the most part is laid out very well.  For $125 bucks back, you really cant beat it.  Samsung is the best cell phone brand on the market today.
