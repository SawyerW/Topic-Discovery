I have had this phone for about 5 months now and I'm getting rid of it as soon as possible.It drops calls when I have full service.It randomly just won't ring when I have service, just beeps when someone leaves me a voicemail.On a clear day, if I stand in the exact same spot the service will go from 5 bars to 0 bars and then back up to 5.I have the media text messaging and that randomly won't work.After I've fully charged the battery I'll receive a 10 min. phone call and all of the sudden the battery will go dead.My husband is on the same plan as I am and has a Nokia phone.  He has never had any problems, so we know that it's not the service.My advice to you is not the buy this phone...my husband has had 2 different Nokia phones in the past few years and has never had a problem with any of them.  I have had 2 Motorola phones and have had continuous problems with them.
