Old or young will Love this Phone.. The numbers are big and clear when you are making a call, the Prices are comparable with other phones, but you dont have to sign a contract, which is something I love. I finally can text too, alittle slow, but at least I can do it.. Was afraid I couldnt figure out the phone features, but they have it set up to find out anything you need to know, by dialing one number or they give you enough pamphlets to read so you can figure it out by yourself.So if you want a really nice phone, with really nice features, then Buy a JITTERBUG!!
