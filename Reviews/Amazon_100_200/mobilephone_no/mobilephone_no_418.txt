I bought this phone because I liked the look and it had a decent price. After having the phone for about a week, the touch screen started shaking and would sometimes freeze altogether. When I tried to get it to stop its what I referred to as "seizures", it would text and call people or freeze the entire phone. I got so frustrated with this thing that ended up throwing it away after a few months of its ongoing screen shaking episodes. All I can say is that this phone is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money! Plus the features it has aren't really all that great. :\
