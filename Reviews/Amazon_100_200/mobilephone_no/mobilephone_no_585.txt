I was expecting this to be a new phone, not branded by any carrier. It came packaged with plastic stickers like a new phone, but looked dirty inside like a used phone would.  It shows the AT&T; logo on power-up and shut-down, and has "AT&T; Mall" apparently permanently installed on the menu. (Which would be okay if I was going to use this with AT&T;, but I'm not)The enclosed warranty card is from "Consumer Certified Repairs" in Miami, FL.The phone seems to work fine, but it's sure not what I thought I was buying.  If I had it to do over again, I'd go for a used one on Craigslist instead.
