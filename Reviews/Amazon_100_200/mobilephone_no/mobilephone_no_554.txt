My wife needed a new phone to replace a crappy Cingular phone and we were still under plan, so rather than paying $200 for another crappy phone at the store, she wanted this one.  I actually saved $40 on ebay, but the phone that I received was either a knock off or a cheaply manufactured piece of garbage.  I sent it back and bit the bullet on this one.  My wife loves it, she can hear the person that she's calling and they can hear her clearly.  I don't like spending the $ when most phones are heavily subsidized, but in this case it was worth it.  Easy to use, put in her SIM card, charged the battery and that was it.
