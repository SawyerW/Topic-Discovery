I think this phone is ok and pretty decent. I mean, you cant get online or do anything besides text, take pics, and make calls so its pretty boring if your sitting and want games and stuff to play. The text and pic msgs fill up so fast that your always clearing your phone for space. Also, if you are a 'texter' like I am, then this key pad WILL become worn out. I ordered this phone back in April this year and it is now October and my keypad is so worn out, I can hardly press a few keys....it looks like its been filed down or something. But this phone is ok....it still works great like the day it arrived and never caused any real problems for me. Decent and reliable phone!
