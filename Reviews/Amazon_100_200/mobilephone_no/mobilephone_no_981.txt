I got this phone used from a freind of mine for USD 190. I use it mainly for phone calls and sms and occasionally for wifi. The phone is excellent and has the best BATT life. Screen is clear and the shortcuts are great and can be customized in any way you want. Phone quality is great and signal excellent. No random startups or similar problems as mentioned by other users. The only negative thing is the dim light for notification and sometimes the phone shows a rather slow pace but not big deal at all. Email setup is easy and fast and I got all my email uploaded within seconds. Voice clarity and audio are both good and clear. The best part is the combination of both touch and QWERTY keyboard very handy and useful.I would recommend to anyone not intersted in buying those highly expensive Iphones which are loaded with APPS that you might never use..A phone was created for phone calls basically in the first place...If excellent long time phone calls is what you want with high voice calarity..then this phone is for you!!
