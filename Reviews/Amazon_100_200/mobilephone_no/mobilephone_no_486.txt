Very annoying phone.  Doesn't hold settings (and yes, I'm sure I'm following manual instructions properly).  Will re-set things such as turning off airplane mode, system sounds shut-off, volume, shut-off delay, etc.  Phone is so light that vibrate will cause it to go flying off a surface.  It's like it's designed to try to self-destruct.  Screen is difficult to read and unpleasant to look at.  Sound quality is hideous.  Very hard to hear callers especially if there is any ambient noise whatsoever.  To do anything you have to press lots of little buttons over and over.  The set-up is not intuitive and some features are placed in weirdly irrational menus that you have to basically stumble upon to find them.  Entire construction of phone is very cheap and feels like it will fall to pieces easily; feels like a cheap child's toy you might buy at a dollar store.  I absolutely don't recommend especially if you were previously using a high end smart phone and tried downgrading to save money; you will go crazy with this piece of junk.
