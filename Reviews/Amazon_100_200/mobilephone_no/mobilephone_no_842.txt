I bought this phone just over a year ago at a bargain basement price of .01 (yes, 1 penny) so I cannot complain about the price, especially since it was a pretty new model at the time.  I wanted the QWERTY keyboard and thought this would be a good starting place for me before investing in a smart phone.However, I found that there were never any software updates done to get rid of the bug that would cause the phone to freeze up while sending texts.Three weeks ago, my screen went dead everytime I slid open the keyboard so I couldn't see what I was typing.  Eventually it came on again for two days, then went back off again.I finally got a new phone today and it is not a Samsung brand.  I was told at the cell store that this is a frequent problem with this phone and it's been happening to a lot of people.  I'd avoid this phone if you want it to work long term.Overall, I liked the phone when it worked right but I wouldn't buy one again and the phone I had made me shy away from investing in another Samsung phone.
