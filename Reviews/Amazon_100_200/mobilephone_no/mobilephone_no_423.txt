I had to rate this piece only one star only because of Amazon's screwup. I am sure the phone is an excellent value for the money and a good international phone, but unless you can read its manual in French (right!) this purchase is useless. One of the other commentators mentioned that they were shipped a manual in Portuguese, but their order was from UnlockedCellPhoneKings. Mine was from Amazon directly. So BUYER beware. Added to that Amazon's customer support on this one is simply a waste of your time. One of the reps told me quite nonchalantly, it is an international phone, and the product page doesn't mention anything about a manual! Sure. There are better ways (and purposes) of learning french. You sell it here in the USA, why would someone expect you to provide a manual in French or Portuguese. I am on the phone with them right now, and I think I will ask them for a manual in Zulu.
