I just bought my fourth Motorola RAZR (April 2013) ...(this one was the RAZR V3i) since 2004.  I needed a quad band international unlocked version since I do a lot of travel overseas.  Once again for a great phone, yes without all smart phone capabilities that some might desire, this one still packs a great punch for the price. It does everything that you need in a basic phone for a great price and without all the hassle of buying into a Verison or T-Mobile plan !! I am glad that I bought a RAZR again.  Also, The texting capabilities were an improvement over the Motorola RAZR 3 that I still use.....but it will be my back up,if needed.
