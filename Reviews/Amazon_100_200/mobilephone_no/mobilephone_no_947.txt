Bought this phone sight unseen, relying solely upon reviews elsewhere and some assorted YouTube videos.This phone is quite simply incredible. Its not built for the gadget head, but for someone who needs a phone thats going to work under any condition. Dont expect this to be a surf the web, play a game, slide gently into your suit pocket sort of phone its not. Its bulky, but light...its solid.The first thing I did after unboxing it and installing the battery was to forcibly throw it from the 5th story balcony straight out to the concrete roadway below. Then I called it from the house phone, it rang. I then left it in a tupperware filled with water in the freezer overnight, then called it from the house phone...it rang. I'm satisfied.Setup and config was easy, (AT&T;)6 star phone
