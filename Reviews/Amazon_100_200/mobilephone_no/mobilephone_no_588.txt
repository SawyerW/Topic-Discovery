I bought this cell phone as a replacement for the one I had which was generally used as a backup or extra phone should any of my kids would be going on a field trip. The cell phone look and features was quite different from the earlier one I had from AT&T.; Up to this time, I can not set the clock on the phone. It doesn't have a day light saving feature. Right now, it is showing an hour ahead of the real time, and I cannot set the time.The manual that accompanied the phone looked water-colored. It looks so fake that I did not even bother to read anything from it.As long as the phone can still dial and make calls, I am just hanging on to it hoping to return it if it ceases to work because it has warranty on it.
