As an Android developer, I picked this up to test apps on Android 2.1 at the smallest supported screen size, 2.5".  So far it performs exactly as expected.It's worth noting that other reviews may be correct in that the phone does prompt you to create or sign into a Motorola Blur account.  I don't know if it's possible to subvert this requirement; I didn't try and went ahead with it, using an active SIM.  Once registered, I removed the SIM, and can still use the phone normally, as with non-Blur phones.I love the form factor of this phone, and I think it was underrated for casual users.  At this point, though, I think its only real use is for developers who want the lowest common denominator, and for that purpose I would call this a smart and economical buy.
