This phone is not only feature-loaded, have the latest Wireless-Web features, a full color-display and a push-to-talk button, but it looks like a 'sports car' the finish on this phone is very smooth, and the colors on the front-flip look incredible. Its not as rugged as some of the other phones, but its added-bulky-size will help it sustain damage from drops and shocks. This is probably the best Nextel phone to date, Look for it on Ebay if you cant find it anywhere else, its worth the money. On the other hand, it can be a bit bulky, however the extra size makes it so you can easily use it in one hand, which is nice, and there is no Camera on it. (Which is a shame, because it already has the beautiful LCD Screen) However, these are no biggies, and if your looking for a Nextel phone, im confident this is 'the phone' to have.
