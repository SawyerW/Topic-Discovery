I do not really need all the features of an expensive smartphone, but do a fair amount of texting and was looking for a phone with a QWERTY keypad. This phone absolutely fills the bill. T-Mobile no longer supports Internet access for this phone, but I wasn't looking for that anyway. It took a little time to get used to the interface, but it now seems well thought out and intuitive to me. I think they over-sized the battery for heavy Internet use, and since I just use it for voice and text, I can go for days without charging. The "flip-up" screen is bright, easy to read, and the resolution is excellent. It's a relatively large phone (still smaller than most current "smartphones"), but will still fit into a pocket. The flip-up screen and keypad are perfect for texting, and the trackball and navigation keys make it easy and quick to move the cursor to where you need it. If you only use voice and text, and don't care about Internet access, this phone is fantastic -- and a super bargain.
