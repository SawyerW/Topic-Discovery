Great phone by Motorola - leaps and bounds over the previous user interfaces.  I use the speakerphone all the time, along with the two-way text messaging.  I also like the different profiles, which enable you to quickly switch profiles for meetings (i.e. vibe only).  Believe it or not, I don't even use the direct connect features, as no one I know really uses that feature for personal use.  We just use text messages most of the time.  More than anything, I recommend buying the body glove cover/clip ... search for "Body Glove Scuba, i730".  It's like a tuxedo for your i730.
