Had this phone now for about 3-4weeks. Very excited to take it out the box. Turned it on and its in somke other language. Called Amazon-had to call Samsung. Was told to call Samsung in GERMANY. Apparently the phone was configured for that country. Long stor short, my boyfriend figured it out. At&t; was very patient wiht me. They had to find a similar phone to configure my network settings...THANK GOD IT WORKED. I still have to call them back b/c I can receive picture txt but cant send them...IDK y. Still learning the querks. Wish there was a speaker button to turn the speaker on (too many steps to get the speaker on. So we'll see as time goes on. I do love the fact that I can put music on there.
