I've used this phone for  a few months now and because it is so expensive, I have not changed it.  If it was a cheaper phone, I would have changed it a long time ago.  Symbian does not hold a candle to Windows Mobile (which was the OS in my previous phone).  Strengths are good signal strength and many features which one has to figure out and use.  I have been unable to figure how to set up the email and VOIP calling.  I don't think it works on this phone.  I set up email on my Itouch much more easily.  Weakness is the speed of the processor.  It takes a while for any of the apps to load, including the contacts list.  If I need to find a phone number, it is soo,soo slow.  Battery life is terrible.  Videos are jerky and everything is just slow.  I don't use the phone much (less than five minutes of calling per day) and yet I have to charge the phone every other day.  If I knew all this, I would never have bough this phone.
