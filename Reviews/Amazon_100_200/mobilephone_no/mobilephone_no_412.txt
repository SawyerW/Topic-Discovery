Overall, I liked this phone.  Set up for AT&T; was pretty easy.  Two things I didn't like - 1) the voicemail indicator never went away.  Even after listening to messages, powering off/on.  Every time I got a voicemail and deleted it, also got a non-nondescript SMS message, but the indicator stayed on.  Tried different settings, but it appeared to never receive the 'no more messages' signal to clear the indicator.  2) Like the widgets and being able to customize the screens.  The bad thing about it was that they were never 'fixed' on the screen.  So every time you scroll between the 3 available screens, if you happened to touch a widget, it would move - sometimes off the screen.  Was not very easy to move between screens and not touch a widget.  Surprised that they overlooked this in their design.The touchscreen was pretty responsive, but texting was not as easy as I thought it would be.  Spent a lot of time correcting spelling, because I touched the wrong keys (and I don't have fat fingers).  Ended up getting an LGXpression which is great.  But will keep this phone as a backup.
