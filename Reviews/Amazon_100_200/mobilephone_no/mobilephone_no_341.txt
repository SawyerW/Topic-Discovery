My teenage son found this phone and had to have it. He read about it online and liked the reviews, especially about the 3.2 MP camera. The first model one he wanted was not the C510a but a different letter model of the same phone. I called AT&T; and they said to look for one with all four of the bandwidths that this model has, so we found this one on Amazon, checked for the bandwidths and bought it. It took more than a week to arrive but it was a good purchase because my son enjoys it. No one else has this phone in his group of friends and it was easy to just swap sim cards from his Krazr and call AT&T; to register it. Of course now he's on facebook with his phone and we had to add internet to our bill but he paid for the phone himself and he's happy with it and it's only an additional $10 a month for unlimited internet.
