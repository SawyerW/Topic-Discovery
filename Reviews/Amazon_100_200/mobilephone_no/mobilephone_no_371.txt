I bought this one after my wife had already used Nokia E71 for good 6 months. I was planning to buy the same one for my self when I saw this deal and after reading reviews and going through its specs at various websites, ordered it. Needless to say I was not disappointed. It is a great business phone. My emails work like magic and I do not have to bother connecting to internet everytime I need to check mail. The keys are better than the ones on E71. It has the looks as well as the functionality of E71 but costs much less. Highly recommended. The best upgrade for any basic phone user. CHEERS!!
