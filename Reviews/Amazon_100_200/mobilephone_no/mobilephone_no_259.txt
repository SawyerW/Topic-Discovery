I love this phone, but this product discrption is missing a few more key details. This phone supports bluetooth, and has an external memory slot under the battery for microSD cards. It looks cool, a good combination of silver and chrome effects. The display is huge and it utilizes a huge number of pixels. So far I have over 500 mp3's on my phone, and can listen to them on bluetooth headphones, over the internal speaker, or use the headphones it comes with, that when connected also pick up FM radio signals. Has built in 2.0 mp camera with zoom, and flash for still pictures and even records video. I highly recommend this phone, for value, quality, features, and its great looking!
