Looks amazing, great button response, the only bad thing (which actually is a pretty big deal for me) is how the text messaging inbox/outbox are set up - you can only store 30 messages in the inbox, and there is a setting for it to automatically delete messages after you have a certain number, but it doesn't work on the phone I received. Apparently you can alter the programming in the phone to up the inbox capacity to 100 messages with a computer, but I'm not daring enough to mess with the codes. The instruction manual also says there is a space in the battery compartment for a micro SD card, but there is no such space. A good phone that performs well, but some features are a little ridiculous.
