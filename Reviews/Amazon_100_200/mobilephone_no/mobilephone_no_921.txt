I purchased this phone when I came to US and realised my own phone will not work on the available networks. Since I had an international sim and was hard pressed for cash, I decided on this phone primarily because of the looks when compared with the other phones in this price range.The phone is easy to use and has a quite sturdy build. The flip cover has not loosened after 2 months of rough usage and the surface does not attract dust or scratches.The buttons on this phone are bigger than the average cellphones. I did have some trouble while trying to message on this phone. People who are used to message more patiently might not have any problems. Software is simple enough for anyone to get by.All in all, a good phone for people who need it for what it is supposed to be - a phone for calls and messages.
