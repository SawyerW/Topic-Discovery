This phone is great! Especially if you upgraded from an ancient model like the v180 and v188. I am such a girls girl and this color of pink actually doesn't make me sick unlike the lighter pink version from verizon out now. I feel alive when I hold this phone. I saw this phone online and fell in love. My phone was delivered and no problems whatsoever! The features are exceptionally great and the screen is very bright and clear. My husband has the pebl and trust me that phone is not that much smaller in size and the features aren't greatly different for the price. I only paid 174.99 for an upgrade and I'm completley satisfied. My phone didn't come with any usb cable for my pc or a belt clip but that's ok with me anyway. My only gripe so far is that the directional button is so flat if you're not paying attention you will hit the wrong thing. Anyway, don't miss out on this phone. It's a limited edition! Perfect gift for any female for any reason at all.
