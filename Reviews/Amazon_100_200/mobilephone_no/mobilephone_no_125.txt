I got the E105 last Christmas, (free) through an online deal. I upgraded from an old school Nokia and just wanted a cute little flip phone that wasn't so obsolete. Sure, there aren't as many features on this phone as there are on others, but the basics the phone DOES have (such as receiving and making calls) work just fine. I like that this phone has a larger color screen than some Motorolas or Ericsons. The ringtones are a bit tedious and off the wall, but I've downloaded other ringtones that sound great. I've read other reviews where people are upset and irritated because this phone doesn't have the features they want, or it's so time consuming to get to the screen they need to get to, etc. I honestly don't have this problem. Reading the manual helps. I also read a review that said the phone will not charge unless it's off. NOT true. It's a good basic phone, light weight, and hey, I got it for free. I like it.
