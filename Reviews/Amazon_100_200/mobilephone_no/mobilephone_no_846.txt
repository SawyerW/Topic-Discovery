IF YOU HAVE THE EARS OF A DOG NO PROBLEM. IF YOU ONLY USE IT FOR TEXTING AND NEVER CALLS, NO PROBLEM!IF NOT, THIS PHONE IS TRASH!DON'T BUY IT!!!!YOU CAN'T HEAR WITHOUT THE SPEAKER WHICH IS WHAT THE MAIN VOLUME SHOULD BE, AND IS NOT. IT IS NOT DEFECTIVE CIRCUITY, IT WAS DESIGNED CHEAPER, WITH A LOWER MOUTH PIECE & EAR PIECE VOLUME!THE DESIGNER SHOULD BE FIRED. THIS PHONE SHOULD HAVE A STICKER, "FOR TEEN'S ONLY!HE DESIGNED IT FOR DOG OR TEENAGER, ONLY EARS!THREE OF MINE WERE TESTED--ITS JUST A BAD PHONE. I REPLACED 4-TO FINALLY SAY IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK. IT WAS HALF THE VOLUME OF MY MOTOROLA 690.  I HAVE HAD 20-DIFFERENT CELL PHONES OVER THE YEARS AND THIS IS TRASH! 40% LESS VOLUME THAN MY BLACKBERRY.THE GRAVITY 1 DOES HAVE A BETTER SOUND BOARD, AND I SWITCHED BACK TO IT FOR A NON-INTERNET, TEXT BOARD PHONE! IF YOU CAN'T HEAR BOTH WAYS, IT'S TRASH!
