I was having problems with a phone that was also samsung. It is the only brand I buy because of satisfaction with the phones. I have prepaid thru tmobile and found that any gsm phone will work. This phone is great. I wish the directions were better but the paperwork does give a website to go to and that does tell you what you need to know. I love my phone. It works great and I think it is a good choice for someone who has never had a touch screen before. I do not know what happened with other customers but I swear by Samsung phones. I need the qwerty keyboard because for me the keyboard on the touch screen isn't a good idea because I have tremors. I prefer the qwerty keyboard. I just can't say enough about this phone.
