Before buying this phone, I read much negative feedback about it. The battery life is reported to be very bad. To some extent, much of the bad reviews are justified, but for those who have used the middle range E series such as E60 and E63, this phone is a logical continuation. True, battery is not that great but with such a virtuous screen, what else to expect? You can customize the phone so as to disable functions that use up the battery. When you use 3.5G, it is normal for the battery to be drained. Furthermore, if you are in a place when the 3.5G is weak the phone will use up its energy trying to get connected. So I advise you to switch to 2G/EDGE if if your region 3.5G signal is weak.I gave this phone a 4 star rating because as a long time E series user, I believe that the 2 keys on the top bottom and right of the screen should have remained physical and not touch-screen type.Also I regret that there is no in-screen keyboard.Otherwise as a long term E series user, this is indeed the best Nokia I have used so far.
