This phone is a nice and cheap option if you want a Windows Phone 7 headset.Features 16GB of storage, which I think is a standard, and is way better than the 8 GB alternatives that most of the time are more expensive.The body of the phone is nice. The hardware buttons are way better then the touch buttos that you find in phones like HD7. I've had a HD7 and I used to touch accidentaly those touch buttons, a lot of times.By the way, the rest of the phone items are regular, like the Screen and Camera.If you like the Windows Phone 7 Operating System and don't want to expend to much on a headset, I think this is the best option!
