i wanted a camera-phone that would enable me to take decent pictures,so i don't have to carry a camera.this phone's camera is awesome!!!in fact this is probably the best phone i've ever had, and i've had about 15 different ones.i wanted to find some drawbacks to post here, so i found a couple: 1.sony-ericsson's menu- not very intuitive (actually, not the menu itself, but the key setup- no dedicated "answer/call" or "hang up" key, it's all softkeys), takes some getting-used-to  2.if you text a lot you  won't like the tiny keys. i have good dexterity(being a guitar player :) and i still find them very small
