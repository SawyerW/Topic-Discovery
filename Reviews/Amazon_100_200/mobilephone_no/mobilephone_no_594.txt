I bought this phone as a gift to replace my father's Razr. Long story short, technology has passed him up and is still holding on to the simplicity of flip phone. When first opened the box and took out the phone, I noticed that the keypad had dents and that the plastic that covered parts of the phone has dirt underneath it. Then I noticed that the back cover didn't even match the same color as the rest of the phone. The screen however, looked new. Then I realized that this phone seemed to be pieced together from different parts! Very disappointing and probably why the word "New" isn't front and center on this item. I've learned by lesson.
