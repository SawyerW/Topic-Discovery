I too have put off buying a cell phone but let me tell you that I absolutely love the Samsung e105!  I get a strong signal (T-Mobile) everywhere I go without it dropping a line.  Regarding the slow response when you open the phone does not exist on my phone.  It's on before the screen opens all the way, no delay what so ever.  It's very small and light which is what I was looking for in a phone since I carry an iPAQ also.  The only bad thing that I can say about this phone is that I can't transfer backgrounds or rings tones from my Windows XP box via IR.  My computer will recognize the phone but the phone won't accept any files.  But I can also download them from my service provider for a fee.One thing I love about my service plan (T-Mobile) is that it's free to talk to my girlfriend when ever and where ever unlimited!  I think of the people that use the Nextel one-way walky talky feature and I glad that I can call my other T-Mobile friends and family for free.
