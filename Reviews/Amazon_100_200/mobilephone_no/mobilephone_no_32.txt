I have had my SCP-8100 for 3 years now.  It has been a great phone till the last 2 months.  One of the hinges finally broke after the millionth time I have dropped it.  This thing has been laying in 7 inchs of snow for about 5 mins before I realized it wasn't in my pocket, and it never stopped working.  The only other complaint other than the hinge is the battery.  I had it for about 2 years and I had to replace the battery.  The life went from 30hrs too about 6hrs, on... not talking... I had to charge my phone while I was a work as so the battery would be good for my drive home.  But, I went to [...] and found my battery for $12.90, when the same battery at my local Sprint Store was $69.99.  Since I recieved the new battery nothing has gone wrong with my phone.  I love it and I would recommend it too anyone else who is wanting a good camera/media phone.
