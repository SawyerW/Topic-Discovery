Never drop this phone, sit on it, lean on it, or put your keys in the same pocket. Seems obvious, but this phone is fragile. Ive dropped my plastic Nokia phone dozens of times in the past 3 years and never a problem. But the externeal screen on the RAZR Phone will easily crack, and may kill the phone or fry the battery. Both myself and a friends killed our phones. I broke the Razar with my keys in the same pocket. I thought the phone would be fine with just a cracked screen, however this killed the whole phone. The next day I noticed the battery would no longer hold a charge. If I remember crrectly my friend dropped his which also cracked the outer screen which also killed his phone, but via a failure of the of the internal screen which was undamaged. Other then it being so fragile, it was an Ok phone. Quite thin which is nice in your pocket and a decent touch pad too.
