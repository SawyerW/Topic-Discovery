I got this to put on my Triple Minutes for life Tracfone. It arrived fast (although shipping was way overpriced!) I got my 1200 minutes plus I had a bonus code for 200 minutes so I got 1400 minutes total. Pretty good deal since this card is $99.99 everywhere else. (at the time of this writing this card was $79.99)Added the minutes on line at Tracfone so I could be sure the code worked. Easy as can be, put in the PIN number, bonus code and my phone number and in about 5 seconds my phone buzzed with an instant message that I got "400 minutes with 1000 bonus minutes" and 365 days service.At the rate I use minutes I am probably set for a full year all the way around. Great deal.
