refurbished and 1 yr warrantyvolume could not be adjusted, as if it were disabled. Callers could not be heard and nothing could be done to increase the volume from zero. This is a great phone, but the refurbishment was not. Returned phone immediately as replacement was not an option given. I will update regarding refund process.UPDATE: Amazon, as always, made this a simple, fast return and I was refunded within days. I did not find another replacement. This was a very durable phone with fine features. I owned two and enjoyed them each over a year before they decided to play in the street and go swimming, respectively. They rest in pieces and I've moved on to smarter phones.
