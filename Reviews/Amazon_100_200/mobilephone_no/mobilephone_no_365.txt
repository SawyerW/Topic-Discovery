It's a smart phone, but I don't really use those SMART features. I only play around those cool internet features a little bit, such as web browsing, Facebook, Youtube application using wi-fi, they work very well.So the only thing that matters to me is the voice quality. My carrier is AT&T.; The reception all of the sudden becomes much better after I started using this phone. Even moving on the freeway, I still can clearly hear the other side, no too much drop on sound. The battery is also not bad, but this depends on how intensively you use the phone.It's a good phone.
