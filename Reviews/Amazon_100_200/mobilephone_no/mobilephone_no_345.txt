I bought it on friday afternoon, with free two-day shipping, it arrived on monday.I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and it works great, It is a multimedia computer, with all kinds of functions that you discover day after day. Definetly the nokia N series is the best, and this phone is on the top 5 of this series, Works excellent, and I'm happy with the option I've made, I was not sure about getting this one or the nokia 5800 Xpress Music, but I've finally decided for this one because of the ngage service. I totally recomended it....
