I had this phone for 4 days and I am pretty satisfied with this product so far. I feel that I should break down the product:Look and feel: The look and feel is wonderful. This phone has a hard plastic body that is not prone to finger prints.  Nokia has done a great job with the weight and design.Battery life: The battery is okay, I have expected better because within a day of usage (internet browsing, calling, and texting) the battery life drained to half its capacity.Organization: Although the first time I used the phone the calendar is pretty confusing because of the different categories of organization. After I got the hang of the calender, saving events were pretty easy.Camera: Not the best, I have seen better but I have anticipated that because of many reviews I've read.Media: Switching the memory card from one phone to another also transfered my songs and pictures. Also, with this phone I can set my own ringtones.
