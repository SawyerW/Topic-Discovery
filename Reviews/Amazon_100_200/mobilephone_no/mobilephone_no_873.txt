Screen is very scratched, touch screen doesn't work properly, bought to give as a gift for Christmas, not satisfied, person I bought it from said only had 14 days to return and it was an older phone, so I shouldn't expect it to be that good. Said it was one of their old phones and he wasn't surprised the screen didn't work that well. He said I could return it if I decided to, but his 1st. message to me was, I had had it too long. I guess Im stuck with it, but I wont order from him anymore, plus you know on a phone, it takes some getting used to to see if they work properly. I would gladly take another phone in better condition, but guess I learnt my lesson. No, Im not very satisfied.
