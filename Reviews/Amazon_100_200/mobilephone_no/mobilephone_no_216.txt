This represents a mid-end phone.  But it has everything I was looking for in a cell phone:* Great reception and voice clarity.  I had Verizon Wireless before and wasn't happy with voice clarity as people always sounded robotic.  The Sanyo phone gives good, crisp clarity on the Sprint network.* Camera with flash.  OK the flash is a bit of a joke, but it does help a bit when you are in a bar.* Speakerphone.  Finally I have a cell phone with speakerphone!  It's just so cool.* Color LCD inside and out.  I love having a "sub LCD" on the flip cover so I can see who's calling, esp. when I have a picture ID for the caller.* Can play streaming videos from Sprint.  I tried the free Vision service for two months.  It was fun, but for me, not really worth the extra cost.  Streaming video was a lot of fun, though.* For those who care, you get walkie talkie service called Ready Link.  Expensive monthly fee, though.Here you have it, a high quality, high fun factor phone for a great price.  I love it.  I'm getting another one for my family.
