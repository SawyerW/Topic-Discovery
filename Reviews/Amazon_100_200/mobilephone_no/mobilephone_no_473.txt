Bought their newest and best phone, the LG 840G. It would not send photos anywhere. Spoke to FOUR separate tech support people. They offered zero help; while courteous, they did absolutely nothing by way of guidance, suggestions or whatever. They simply listened to me state---and restate---the problem. When I sent a detailed e-mail to them asking for a refund on my phone, all they did was tell me to call tech support again. I replied that I had already spoken to FOUR different tech people, was tired of spending so much time stating and restating my problem, and I wanted a refund. Why should I believe that a FIFTH tech person would be able to solve my problem when all the first four did was listen to what the problem was? Their response, call tech support. Moral: sign up with a carrier which has brick and mortar stores that you can actually GO TO when something like this happens.
