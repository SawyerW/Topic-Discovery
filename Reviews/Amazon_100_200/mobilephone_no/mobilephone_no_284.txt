I too (along with several other reviewers) have noticed that this phone has received a lot of hate.  After about a month of searching I specifically choose this phone as it fulfills a number of roles that others just (surprisingly) don't.1.  Brand-new, unlocked GSM models are floating around at rock bottom prices (I picked mine up for $100 USD).2.  The Treo 750 remains one of the only affordable, unlocked GSM models that has both a manual QWERTY keyboard and a touch-screen.3.  It's international.  The GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz bands will provide you with 3G capability in most countries.  Most people don't bother to check their band options...such capabilities are extremely important if you travel internationally in order for you to enjoy all aspects of your phone.Yeah, it's a bit big compared to the latest stuff and even with WindowsMobile 6.1 installed, it runs slower.  But come on...the latest unlocked GSM phones run upwards of $800-1000USD!  This bad boy is affordable and gets the job done in any country (I travel a lot).
