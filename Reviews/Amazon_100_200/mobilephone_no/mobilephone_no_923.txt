Not sure if the dropped calls are a phone issue or a Straightalk issue...I just know they are an issue.  I been using the phone for over 3 months and drop about 1 in 5 calls.  When I contacted provider they felt it was the phone and sent a new one out.  Same problem.  I feel like I've gone back in time 10 years.  The Nokia 6790 is an okay phone if you're not a person that has to have the newest gadget.  However, pairing it  with StraightTalk means dropped calls to the point of embarrassment.  I'm saving money, but there is a cost.
