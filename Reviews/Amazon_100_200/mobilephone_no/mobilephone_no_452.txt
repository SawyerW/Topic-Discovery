I just bought this as a spare phone for my parents and it's amazing that you can literally get a phone and a full year of service for ~$110. There are no contracts, no bills, nothing. My parents love the phone in that it's a basic phone and they get service everywhere they seem to be in the US. The set is incredibly easy and it's really convenient that you can buy recharge cards online or in stores like Ralphs, gas stations, etc. I actually am so impressed with the service that I might consider switching to Tracfone to save money!
