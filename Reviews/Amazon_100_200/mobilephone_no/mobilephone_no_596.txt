I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE I HAD A RAZOR PHONE I HAD TO REPLACE. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE HAD BEEN SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS, SO THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN THE ONE I HAD. I CAN HANDLE THE CHANGES, BUT IT SEEMS THE QUALITY HAS SUFFERED TOO. DOESN'T RING LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR WHEN IT'S IN MY POCKET, AND THE AUDIO CUTS IN & OUT DURING A CONVERSATION. ALSO, THE RING TONES SUCK, BUT THAT COULD JUST BE THE CHOICES ON THE NEW PHONE COMPANY I'M WITH. STILL GLAD I GOT THIS ONE THOUGH, AS THE FEATURES ARE FAMILIAR TO ME ( BEING THE OLD DINOSAUR I AM)
