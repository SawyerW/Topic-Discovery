GOOD:-Attractive-Durable-Battery Life-Great inovative 'Profiles'BAD:-Scratches Easily-GPS Supported - However, does not work well at all-Most Useful Java Apps require additional Nextel Net Access Plan (expect to pay 10+/mo at the LEAST) ontop of your monthly rate planok so you have nextel service, your new sex looking motorola i730 (specific to nextel only), & an affordable plan (well somewhat).... and like every person out there, you want your shiny new nextel phone to be customized with ringtones for each contact and wallpaper for each profile (standard, car, sleep, morning, office, etc) - "CHA-CHING!", shouts nextel. At 1.99 per ringtone or wallpaper, this phone is hardly worth the idea of customizing.For the price of monthly WAP Access, you'd think they would throw in unlimited ringtone and wallpaper downloads. I mean, come on, $10/mo ONTOP of your monthly plan of $49.99 of 500/minutes a month, is pretty steep already. Not only that, but just to afford the phone - you'll most likely be signing in for a year contract or two.
