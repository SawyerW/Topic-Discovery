the customer who wrote the negative review on her terrible experience with charging the phone is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!  She is not lying...this experience is what has led me to the Amazon website today to try and purchase alternate charging accessories since my phone will not hold a charge and reflects "charge complete".Another issue is the purchase of a warranty for the said phone...because Sprint's customer care is so disgusting one should ALWAYS get maintenance...I had my phone for 2 days beyond their 14 day requirement and Sprint would not allow me to add maintenance, so I am a VERY disgruntled customer!
