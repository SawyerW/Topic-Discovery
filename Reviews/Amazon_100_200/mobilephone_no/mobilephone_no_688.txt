I bought this phone for my wife and I'm sorry to say that I had to return it. She just purchased a 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe and she needed a smart phone to access the car's bluetooth capabilities (such as remote start from ANYWHERE). However,we eventually found out that the phones bluetooth function was not compatible with the Hyundai's system. (there's only one Nokia phone that is).  There are only 2 other aspects of the phone that I didn't like. The first involves the "LOCK" feature. You can set it to lock  anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes....but believe it or not, you can't turn it off. The other thing is with regards to the phones "Symbian Operating System" (which I believe that Nokia has since abandoned. If you buy this phone you're not going to be going to GOOGLE PLAY to choose from thousands of Android Apps....the phone is NOT an Android. You're going to the NOKIA Store....and believe me....there's a lot less apps to choose from.  Other than that everything else is great....build quality, Wi-FI, bluetooth, browser, camera...so, I give it 4 stars....it's the right phone for somebody.
