This phone is great,you will not be disapointed. It comes preloaded with youtube and facebook on the home page. Nokia has there own app store with great stuff. I think it takes great pictures, the flash is so bright you can take pictures in complete darkness and they come out good. The flash works like a flashlight and its very bright too. If you are on att you can get the 15 dollar unlimited data plan for this phone because it is unlocked. If you buy a phone like this from your carrier they are going to charge you 30 for the data plan, so this will save you $180 a year on data costs. You can also use this phone as a modem to put internet on your pc, and you will still be able to talk on the phone while using the internet if your on att. The email works great if you use the ovi mail, its a free nokia service. The battery life is realy great too. This phone does every thing that you could want out of a phone, if you do a lot of typing the keyboard is great.You will not be disapointed!
