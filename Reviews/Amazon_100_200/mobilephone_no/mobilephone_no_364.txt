I bought this phone as a replacement for my wife's ailing AT&T; phone. We do not want a data plan, and the WiFi works flawlessly. The Nokia applications for Facebook and Twitter work well, and popping in a 8Gb MicroSD will just be icing on the cake. As stated in other reviews, the camera quality is a little lacking, but hey, that is why you have a digital camera, right?The call quality is stellar, and we both have confidence we did not previously have with other phones.The features we are most interested are the facts that it is unlocked and it is quad band. We will use the phone here in the USA with AT&T; as the provider, and when we travel to Europe using a pre pay SIM card via Car Phone Warehouse.My wife is a geek, and has not put the phone down in over 48 hours of owning it. Nuff said!
