The Palm Treo 750 is the worst phone I have ever owned...I had the Treo 680 which I loved and assumed the 750 would be a step up...not so.1. You cannot personalize the desktop with icons, or I haven't figured it out yet.2.  I haven't been able to figure out how to get the call log on the desktop menu.3.  There seems to be buttons with no real purpose unless you program them.4.  It doesn't sync with the old operating system, so all the information, call logs, etc are lost.5.  I see no advantage over the Palm OS...windows for mobile doesn't load any faster, pick up email any faster.6.  The OS is larger, leaving less space on the HD and is prone to freezing.I would not recommend this device to anyone who likes the Palm OS...this system, device is awkward to use, not user friendly, is hard to dial..
