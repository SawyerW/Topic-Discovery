Well I rescently switched from Nextle to Sprint. I switched because of the price and the hardware. The price, you get what you pay for. I live an area that is very affulient and about an hour from Boston, Ma. I never had many issues with connectivity to Nextel. And I did not assume I would have any issues with Sprint either boy was I wrong. There is a stop on my way to work where I have full signal strength and my call gets dropped every time. Sprint is bad in my area.The phone however ROCKS, Nextel has crappy phones for gadget freaks like me. This phone you can download songs to the ringer not just midi's. The screen is big and bright, unlike the new i730's tiny screen. The camera is easy and fun to use, and with the color display on the outside of the phone you can even take pictures of yourself if you are that vain. The battery last well.If Nextel could get some cool phones I would switch back... Oh wait I have a 2 year contract. I guess I will have to wait.I hope this helps
