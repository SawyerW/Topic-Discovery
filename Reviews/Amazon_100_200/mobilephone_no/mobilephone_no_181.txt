This is an ok phone, but needs to have more ringtones available, with a louder setting for use in noisy areas. I signed up for the Family Talk plan through Cingular, and so far it's been ok. I do have some issues with Cingular's customer service though. In short, it stinks!(unless you're lucky enough to talk to someone who actually knows what they're doing). Overall, the phone itself serves its purpose pretty well.  One more thing...I tried to speak to the manufacturer (Motorola) about some of the features--bad idea. I was connected to someone in ARGENTINA!! Of course he was unable to help me. SO, it was back to Cingular. No real issues with the phone except the ringtones and the volume.
