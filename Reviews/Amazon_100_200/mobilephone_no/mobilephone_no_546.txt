I do not recommend this phone due to the fact that it is about 5 years old. I bought this phone around March 4th, 2013. I bought it Brand new, factory sealed, everything was there. The phone was crud. It malfunctioned, would turn off/on all by itself, the screen wouldn't come on half the time, and the service it got was horrible. Maybe it was just who I ordered it from, but a brand-new phone should not behave this way. Not worth it. 2/5 stars. Only 2/5 because this is a great phone, if you can find one that still works perfect.
