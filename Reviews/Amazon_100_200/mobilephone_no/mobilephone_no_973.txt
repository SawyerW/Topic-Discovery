This phone isn't your dual core powerhouse, but it is without a doubt the best low-tier high end Android phone on the market.  It's got everything you need (WiFi, Bluetooth, DLNA build in, Front facing video camera, fast processor, plenty of ram - 512mb, and a perfect size screen for multimedia viewing/games/browsing.  Not to mention, this phone has style and isn't the traditional large screened black brick.  It fits comfortably in the hand with it's unique curvature and it easy to operate with one hand (you can reach each corner of the screen with ease).  The phone ships with Android 2.3.3 (gingerbread) with an upgrade available now to 2.3.4 (gingerbread) and Sony Ericsson has confirmed that Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) will be hitting all of their 2011 phones (including this one).  So it's future-proof for the immediate future.  It's also not loaded with a bunch of bloatware and can have the boot loader unlocked with ease.  All in all it's a great phone, fully featured, light on price!  I have enjoyed it so far!
