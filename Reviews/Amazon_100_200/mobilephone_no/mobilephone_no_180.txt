I too have had my V400 from Cingular for about 6 months.  I absolutely love the features - the variety of menu options, the phone book, and especially the high resolution screen (it definitely has a "WOW" effect with an American flag as the background.  It's also extremely rugged, given that it's dropped to the sidewalk in the park multiple times.What I don't like is the software that runs the phone.  Either it is extremely buggy or the phone's processor needs to be faster.  More often than not, disconnecting from a phone call will be delayed 2-3 seconds after hitting the "End" key.  The scroll rate through the phone book is extremely slow as well.  Even though it is seldom, the phone "freezes" and nothing but taking out the battery solves the problem.
