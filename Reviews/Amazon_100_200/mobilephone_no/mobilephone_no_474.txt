My Tracfone quit working and they quickly replaced it and activated the new one; however, it had none of my contacts, etc. on it.  When I pointed this out to their customer service, they advised me there was no way they could transfer that information to the new phone.  They explained that the old SIM card would not work in the new phone (same identical phone); therefore, all that information was lost.  I advised customer service that I would send the old phone back and keep the new phone; however, when my minutes run out, I will not be purchasing any more from Tracfone and will cancel my account.  It seems incredible to me that this could happen in today's more sophisticated electronic world.  This is the first problem I have had with Tracfone; but I think it is significant, and I do not want to deal with this problem again.
