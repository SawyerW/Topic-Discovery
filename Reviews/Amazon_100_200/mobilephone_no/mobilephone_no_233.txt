Well, with sprint there are 2 phones to go with, sanyo and the others.  Sanyo gets better reception, works better, and has better features hands down and that is true to their new kick butt upgrade from the 9100.I just got my 9200 and it is flawless.  Actually much better than the 9100 in the fact that they moved some of the buttons from annoying spots and made the antena a little less anoying.For those who give the phone a low rating because they are having reception problems in there area, get a clue.  This is to review the phone not the provider.If you are in the market you cant go wrong with this choice.  It is a great phone and I would not own any other brand from sprint.
