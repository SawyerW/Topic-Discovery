I love the Pink RAZR.  It definitely is flashy and catches the eye, and what else is the point for getting the RAZR.However, being inept with technology, it's a little bit more complicated to get it working the right way than I was led to believe.  With Cingular, I am always roaming.  I don't always get a powerful signal if at all because it's finding the nearest tower, any tower and not Cingular.The signal strength is really the only issue that I have but it's a big one.  Other than that, the phone is really easy to use, a real user friendly phone and works well.
