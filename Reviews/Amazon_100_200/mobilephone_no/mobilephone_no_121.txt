I got this phone in the end of December.  My previous phone was the similarly-sized Motorola v66.  All in all, this phone is about the same as that one.  Reception seems to be good and the ring and voice volumes are superb.  the color screen is a very welcome change.  The only gripe that I have is that it doesn't have all the nice features of some of the other phones (voice dialing, camera, bluetooth).  I was seriously considering the SE T610, but decided against it becuase it was not a flip phone.  Also, I can't seem to get the infrared port working.  I got my computer to detect it, but I was not able to send any images or files to it.  I agree with earlier reviews that the ring tones are a bit annoying.
