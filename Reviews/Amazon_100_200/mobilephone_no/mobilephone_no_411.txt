Phone is working fine. It is true that this appears to have been an international model and you will not find any mention of it on Samsung USA or any of the phone company websites. In any event I signed up with T-Mobile and entered all of the codes so that texts(including pics) and internet access works. Did not like the Samsung lock on the phone that prevents you from putting your own java apps on the phone (so you have to buy it from them) so I took care of that by going to the appropriate websites to "update" my phone. So far I am happy with the purchase.
