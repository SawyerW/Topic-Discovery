I recently ordered two 1 year 400 minute cards, one for myself and one for my husband. I was somewhat leery about ordering the cards, but I figured it was backed by Amazon whom I trust when making purchases.  The cards arrived sooner than I expected. The price is great and I would recommend this to my closest friends, family, and to anyone wondering about it. Be sure to look for promo codes as this will give you bonus minutes.  I found a code for 300 bonus minutes, for a total of 1500 minutes.  I have a triple minute Tracfone, LG800G, in which I recently purchased, and so far I am very pleased with it.  I added 365 service days, and I'm set for a full year of service.  I purchased the cards for $74.99 each, which comes to 6.67 a month for a cell phone service. We have been with Tracfone for several years, and are very happy with the service.  Thank you Amazon for saving me a lot of money.
