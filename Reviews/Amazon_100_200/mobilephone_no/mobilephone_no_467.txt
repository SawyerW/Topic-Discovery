I thought this would set me up for a year. Au contraire! The minutes disappeared. My little LG bar phone recorded how much time I *actually* used, but Tracfone has its own minute tracking system. To be fair, you can call in and get the actual info. directly from Tracfone. What you see on the main page is not even close to accurate. When I called Tracfone this did not seem to be a concern for them -- perhaps they see it as LG's problem. The upshot is this: I started w/700 minutes in April (which included this "1 Year" product) and by July was down to ~30min. Why? Not because I talk on the phone. Not because I text. Not because I'm using data. I hardly do any of that. Anyway, it didn't work for me and I'm going back to Verizon.
