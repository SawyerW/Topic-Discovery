Lousy phones, lousy service. Had 2 phones with them and they both were junk.  The worst thing however is their lack of customer service.  When you call be prepared to talk with "Debbie" or "Mike" or some other made up name for a person in INDIA!  I think they hired the dumbest ones they could find.  The website of theirs is the worst also.  You cannot do anything on it.  I tried to renew my service for 3 days between the website and India.  All I got was a headache.  I canceled my service and they would not reimburse me for the 1184 minutes that I had paid for because I was no longer a customer.  Last week my wife's phone, with 128 days of service left, lost all 1800 plus minutes that she had.  They blamed it on the phone.  They would not help me unless I had the phone with me.  Initially I thought this was a great provider but since the corporate neckties in the company decided that greed was better they went downhill fast.  I will never recommend them for anything.
