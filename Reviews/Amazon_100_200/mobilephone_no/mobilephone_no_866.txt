I got my phone at around 1p, read the directions, made sure it was fully charged.  It is now almost 5p and I'm having to charge it for the second time!  If you don't have a Google account, you can't use the calendar feature which is complete crap!  The predictive text only works with the Android touchscreen keyboard, and trying to figure out how to change the ringtone is a nightmare!  The User Guide was in Spanish, so I had to go online to find it.  I'm gonna give this phone a couple days to see if the battery died so quickly because it was the first day.  If the battery life of this phone doesn't get any better, then I'm returning it asap!  This is the first phone by Motorola that I've been disappointed in, and Motorola is my phone of choice!  Ugh...
