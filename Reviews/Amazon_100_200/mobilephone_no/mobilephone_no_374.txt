A very capable phone for office and personal use. I like that you can set up emails for both work and personal use,a nice feature. The phone itself is similar aesthetically to the costlier E71 minus the gps and a lower resolution camera, I can live with that for the price difference. I have a good gps and I have a good camera, so if you don't have either of these then you should look at the E71. Love the voice announcement that tells the name of the person when you get a call, great for when you have the phone in your pocket. Battery life is good, size and weight are good, screen is a good size, full keyboard is nice, even has a handy flashlight! (which doubles as the camera flash). Overall a very good phone, I highly recommend it. Nice that it comes unlocked too.
