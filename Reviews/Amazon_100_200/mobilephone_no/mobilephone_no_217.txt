I've had this phone for about a year and I haven't had the slightest of problems with it.  I've just read several reviews about it and I was shocked to see that a couple people said they couldn't hear during their conversations.  For me it's quite the opposite.The ear volume is very high and the speakerphone is almost deafening.  Also the durability of this phone is terrific, so far anyway.  I've made a habit of dropping this phone on the concrete after getting out of the car with it on my lap, but no problems at all so far.This is a great phone in my experiences, great features, speakerphone, easy internet use, downloading, and great reception. The only downside I see in this phone is Sprint's "taxes, surcharges, and fees," which can add up pretty fast(I have no idea how), but I think every phone company finds extra ways to charge you.  As far as the phone goes, Excellent!
