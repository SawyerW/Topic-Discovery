I have had three phones in my life and this was, by far the most sophisticated and, by far, the worst.  The camera is worthless, even in the daylight.  It kept saying that I had no memory so I deleted the bad pictures that came with it.  That did not help.  So basically I can't receive text messages. My roommate and I both have the same service but always has a much better signal.  The worst feature is the loud cracking sound that happens about once every minute.  It is much louder than the voice on the other end and acturally hurts when it happens.  The internet takes forever to load...when it works.  The sim card dislodges in the middle of a conversation.  I'm buying a new phone tomarrow after having this one for much too long.
