This is a good phone, no joke. I've been with Cingular for ages and completely love their service. I must say thought that while the Nokia is much more unattractive, I did recieve better reception on it. I love this phone though! The reception is ok. But all the other features are completely incredible. Battery life is great. I charged my phone on Sunday and it lasted me until Wendnesday. The phone looks classy and professional. And the blue display screen is nice as well. I like the internal display screen as well (very colorful and crisp).This is the best camera phone on the market for this price. The resolution ROCKS!! And the phone has a bunch of storage.My favorite features are the MP3 ringtones and the picture caller ID!! Over all I love the phone! If I gotjust a little better reception it would be perfect.
