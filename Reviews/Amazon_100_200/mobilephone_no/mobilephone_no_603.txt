One star is too much of a rating for this seller.  This item is not new and it has defects, but it does work.  The battery cover and front face are different tone of silver than rest of phone.  The battery cover does not seat properly; the power port is dirty.  The small, front displayed pulled off when removing tape.  All the sticky tape used is simply a ruse by the seller to display this item as new.  This is not original packaging by Motorola.  I do not believe the seller is being truthful about this item:  it is refurbished using parts from other Razr phones, not NEW.  I was not able to register it with Motorola for warranty.  As a used, refurbished V3 Razr, this item is not worth more than $30.  I should have paid attention to all the negative reviews given by other customers.  Amazon should not allow this seller to continue selling items as NEW when they are not. I am returning for full credit.
