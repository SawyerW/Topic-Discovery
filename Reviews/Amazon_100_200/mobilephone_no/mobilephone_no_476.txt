I bought a picture/text messaging phone (Samsung T404G) through Straight Talk over a week ago.  Tech Support is a joke...worse than anything out there.  My picture messaging has never worked.  I like the phone if it could do what it is supposed to do.  I'm ticked off because I've wasted over 3 hours of my personal ATT cell phone on hold or talking to idiots who sold me the Tracfone.  Either it works or it doesn't...and they keep coming up with excuses and finally told me that the Engineering dept. they filed my ticket under DIDN'T REALLY EXIST.Who are these people????  Trash!!!
