I brought this phone about a week ago off of Amazon's Warehouse deals in a Like New condition and you would have never guessed that anybody even touched the phone. Overall, the phone is amazing for the price that I brought it. I love the WIFI feature that it has on there, the quality of the sound during calls is amazing, and it holds a pretty big number of text messages.  The camera quality is not all that great, but it is a function on the phone, if you do need it.  The phone has a great feel to the plastic covering around it and the keys to type on are AMAZING. Overall, a great phone for a great price!
