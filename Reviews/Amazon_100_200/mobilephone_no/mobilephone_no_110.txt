Overall, I'm thrilled with this phone, because it excels at the 2 criteria that are by far the most important to me: pocketability, and reception/voice quality. I've been very happy with T-Mobile, too,Worst drawbacks to me:- Clock isn't automatically synched to cell towers, and loses ~3 minutes/month.- Lack of easy porting of Outlook contact info- Inability to store notes on the phone. Only way to do this is to text message yourself, but can't put a subject on the text message, just an automatically assigned 3-digit number.I like the vibrate before ring mode, but would prefer vibrate, then vibrate & ring. WAP's too slow, small and cumbersome for me to bother with. Voice activated dialling would be nice, but speed dial does the job. A non-fancy (ring-ring) ring tone would have been nice, too.YMMV depending on your needs, but for me, I'd buy it again in a flash.
