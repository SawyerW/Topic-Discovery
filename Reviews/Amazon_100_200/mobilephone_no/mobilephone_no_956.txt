My blackberry ate the dust so I decided to buy this phone because I did not have an upgrade available. I really like the features and the price is second to none. The weakest part of this phone is the camera and the lack of video camera. The internet is sufficient for my needs. Call quality is very good and there is an external memory slot which is really handy. I would recommend get a silicone skin, amazon has good deals on them.For anyone who needs an att phone and doesn't have an upgrade the a187 is a great choice, highly recommended.
