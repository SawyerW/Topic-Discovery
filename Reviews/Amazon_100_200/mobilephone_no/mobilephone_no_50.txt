What ever you do - do not order ATT online.  I did and even ATT customer service has been unable to help me.  The first phone I got did not work - after many calls and twice as many hours I got a replacement phone, I also got a bill for the replacement phone but I am still waiting on a credit for the one that I sent back - it has been four months now.  Their problems resolution department acknowledged that they owed me a credit but said that they were getting the same run around from the online division and were powerless to do anything about it!  So I am out an extra $142 with no recourse.  They are scum - don't waste your money.
