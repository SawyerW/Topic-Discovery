ok, i bought this phone in may and i already hate it. The reception is good but thats about it. The menus on this phone are very confusing and it only comes with one wallpaper:flowers. Now i am a boy and i dont want flowers on my phone.I dont like how it is so hard to open either, and its really ugly. The Keys are poorly backlit and pre-loaeded ringtones sound like they were made for old people. And the music ringtones sound awful and they are distorted. I am going with t-mobile and thier motorola v300 as soon as i get my money back for this peice.
