Normally I'd only rate this phone about a 4/5, because some things (like the internal 5mb of memory) could be alot better. Nonetheless, a couple people have rated the phone really low because of errors on their part! Either way, the phone's amazing. I get ok (40%) reception with it even in the subway system of Toronto, that's good considering it's the first phone to sense any network. It's sleek, sexy, has great battery life and uses USB mini jack for accessories, great for cheap DIY projects (led lights, laser pointers, headphones, chargers, battery packs etc.)If you can get this for a great deal (99 dollars w/ a 3 yr plan from Rogers) then go for the phone, but don't buy it alone, the pricetag just doesn't match the features.
