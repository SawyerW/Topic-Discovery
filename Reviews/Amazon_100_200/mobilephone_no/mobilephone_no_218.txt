I have been with Sprint for almost 2 years now and have had 3 different phones.  Out of the 3 I have to say that the Sanyo 8200 is the best.  I love the screen call feature.  I've read the other reviews and alot of people complained about the audio quality.  I haven't had that problem.  Now, I just recently had to get a replacement under the warranty because the vibrate did not work but other than that, I think the phone is great. I love the design of the phone, its compact and light and comes in 4 different colors.  I orginally wanted the red but went with silver only because at the time the Sprint store that I purchased the phone from did not have the red one in stock. Im thinking about upgrading though.  I never keep cells phone for a really long time.  If something new comes out and I like it, I usually buy it.  I like the new Sanyo 5600 but Im not keen on spending $500 for a cell phone.  I think I may just settle for the Sanyo MM 7400.
