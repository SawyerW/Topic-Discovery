The compact size and full keyboard were definitely draws for me.  Plus the promise of Android apps.Drops calls and texts constantly (didn't have this problem with a Blackberry on the exact same network).  Battery life is 24 hours only if the phone is in standby mode.  Using the phone, the battery lasts an hour max.  This was the same result with 2 new batteries.  Most Android apps are not compatible with this model.  Navigating your files is a nightmare and not intuitive in the least even with the MotoCast software (though iTunes isn't much better).  I've returned it to the AT&T; store once and all they would do is change the battery and change the SIM card.  They said if there is still a problem, I can bring it back for a replacement of the same model, but the 2-year contract won't allow me to change to another model except at the full price.  Who wants to keep a phone that doesn't work most of the time?  Epic fail.
