This phone is stellar. Look around. All you see are RAZRs. RAZRs everywhere.Then my buddy bought one of these. A Nokia 6682. Candybar cool. I had to have one. I even jumped providers to have one!NOW I can REALLY personalize my phone the way I WANT IT and I can do it EASILY!  Pop the Micro-MMC card into my laptops's reader and I can transfer any theme or ringtone as I choose. I am no longer victim to my former carrier's proprietary services. My phone is now MY phone!It is simplisticly elegant. Very powerful and contrary to what others say, extremely easy to use if you just read the instructions!Get one while you can because these won't be around for long. Don't be a RAZR clone!
