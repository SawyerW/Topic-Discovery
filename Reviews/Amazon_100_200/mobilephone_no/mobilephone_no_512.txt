The Palm Treo 600 has worked flawlessly since day one - if it would work with the CDMA system Verizon is on (the only service I get at our new house) I would definitely keep it, but its on GSM with Cingular/ATT which has incredibly poor service in my new area. If there is any service available this phone will pick it up where others wont. Add to it all the features this smartphone adds and its a great piece of equipment at a now killer price since the new models have emerged (& are having problems this older model doesnt). IMO you cant go wrong with this phone, and I have 3 other friends with the sale model that love it just as much.
