i do not own this phone but my best friend does and i use it alllll the time. the big prb. is that she has a LOT of droped calls, i will be talking to her and then she will not be there!! It gets really anoying! We take pics of EVERYTHING, the camera is really good, does not have a light, witch is bad sometimes because u can not take pics in low light. Allso if u move to fast after taking the pic it will show up dif.,like when you are loking at it in the pic menu and then close up on it it is two dif. pics. My friend has had to take her phone to get fixed a lot because the pic ID was not working(it still is not working). But besides the droped calls and the problems with the camera it is a great phone!!
