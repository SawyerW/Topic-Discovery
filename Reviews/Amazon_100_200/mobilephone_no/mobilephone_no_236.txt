The features on this phone are awesome and certainly this phone is easy to use. The speakerphone is also by far the best I have encountered. However, the clarity of calls is a slight issue. The volume control does not seem to do a whole lot for the clarity as people sound too loud or not loud enough, and even when not on speaker sometimes it feels like they are because of the way the phone sounds. Even when I have perfect reception and am in an area where I know others Sprint phones are working just fine. Have not decided yet whether or not to switch phones or just stick it out, but two years is a long time. I also do not know what other phone I would go with as there is not a consensus on one excellent phone all around.Hope this helps.
