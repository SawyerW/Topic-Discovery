I bought this phone a month ago and one day it turn off automatically and when I reset it the phone was on vibrate and the speakers went dead. I complained when I purchase it that this phone was not 100% new as thd screen was not really shiny and the lock button on thd top was kind off press down and not fully functional.I complained to Ross cellular where I bought the phone from and they told me to delete my comment and they will refund 30$ to my credit card.I did not have a choice but to accept this offer as returning it on my cost would cost me 100$ from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Very very disappointed and will never buy online from amazon again or other sellers listed on amazon.
