I have had this phone for a week and I have not been disappointed.  To save space I will just add my endorsement to M. Nitouche's and Dirk's recent reviews.  I replaced my N82 with the gray N8.  I can only hope Nokia's Symbian house cleaning (as they go to Windows) will not keep them from fulfilling their promised PR2.0 OS upgrade.  The phone is stable, but the many reviewers have pointed out a few things the next OS release needs to do.  I will repeat one thing many others have said:  Don't get this phone if you don't want to learn something in order to adjust it to be the way YOU want.  This is great a great phone.
