Pros:  Touch screen with QWERTY keyboardCons:  No spell checkI've had this phone now for three years.  I've dropped it, kicked it, and splashed it with a bottle of water.  I have fat fingers so I love the QWERTY instead of the touch screen keypad.  I dread knowing that almost all smartphones have gone to touchscreen only.  I was disappointed in knowing that it doesn't have a spell check and yes I've checked and called Samsung.  I just had to make sure of what I had typed out before hitting send.  The original battery finally died and wont hold a charge for longer then a few hours this last week.  I'll be replacing the battery instead of replacing the phone.
