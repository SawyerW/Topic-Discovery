Cheap Chinese knock off.  It even says China Mobile on the back.  It does work, but all the features are just a little bit different and it definitely does not have the heft of a true Motorola.  Don't get me wrong it works fine, but it is not an original Motorola V3 Razor.  I love Razors, because I'm not a tech geek and don't want a smart phone.  I just want a small, slim simple phone for emergencies, that fits in my pocket, without making me feel like I'm carrying a rock around.  No other phone meets my needs like a V3 Razor, so I keep looking for them when my old one dies.It is really too bad that Motorola doesn't keep making this particular phone for those of us who do not want all the crap.
