I got this for my dad because he is old school and wanted a slide phone with a keyboard rather than the HTC One phone I got him for Christmas. He loved the Motorola Z9 in the beginning because it was so simple and had great speakers. But then he started to have issues with the reception. It also started to annoy him that the battery needed recharging every single day - even when he hadn't used the phone.This phone looks beautiful and feels wonderful in the hand but it is too heavy and high maintenance because of the constant battery drain and reception issues..
