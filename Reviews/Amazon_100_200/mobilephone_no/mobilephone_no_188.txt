This phone would fool anyone, with it's great look and sleek design, but have it for just one week and you'll see the true side of it. Along with the buttons getting pressed mistakenly in my pocket, and POOR battery life, the phone drops calls.. ALOT!The phone drops calls worst that any phone I've ever had. Then I came to realize that Motorola knew about this problem so they decided to recall it. I called my phone carrier and they said thay couldn't do anything about it.. and they said I should give motorola a call. OK so I did, and yes you guessed it. They said that they might be able to fix the problem, but I'd have to send it to them for about two to three weeks without a loaner. What great customer service eh?I've since switched to the V360 and it's 110% better.
