Easily one of the worst Sony Ericsson phone I have ever used.The battery is nowhere close to the estimates provided in the specs, even in standby mode .I have turned the phone practically into a paper weight by turning every power consuming feature like blue tooth,wi-fi etc.,and yet the battery life has never lasted me more than a day. Secondly and even worse is that the phone has an extremely slow processor and you have to wait for eternity after pressing any function. Thirdly the phone freezes for no apparent reasons and you have to take out the battery and restart the phone, which is extremely irritating if you are trying to make a phone call in a hurry. In short, if you are shopping around for a phone I would suggest you look elsewhere like maybe a Samsung or even an Iphone.
