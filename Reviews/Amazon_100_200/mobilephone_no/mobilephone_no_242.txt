I had this phone a while back. I had to return it. Everybody I called complained about the sound of my voice. I also thought they sounded funny too. I even switched back to my old phone to confirm that it wasn't the surrounding noise, my voice, their surrounding noise. It is also plastic case and very thin. I was concerned about breaking it in my pocket. Further, I found the operation full of options and not very clear. Every time I took a picture, it would try to send it to some website online (for which there is a charge). I didn't like it and returned it a week later.
