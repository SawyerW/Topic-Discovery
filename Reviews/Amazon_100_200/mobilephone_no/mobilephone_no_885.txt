I have owned every Generation of "The Sidekick" by T-Mobile. This one's my favorite. The camera is AMAZING. Fantastic keyboard, If your a texter you'll LOVE this phone. It as an MP3 player that will hold over 100 songs, love that. Screen size is huge. Speaker is surprisingly loud when you play music on it as well. I have never once had a problem with it. I have dropped it a few times, and it has taken the blows no problem. The body of the phone is pretty solid. Battery life is one of the best quality's about it, It lasts all day even with heavy usage. I've gotten almost 3 days of out the battery before I need to plug it in.The only down fall has nothing to do with the phone, but with the phone companies. Because it is a 3G phone instead of 4G, The phone no longer can receive an internet signal because all companies have switched to 4G.I still use the phone to this day & will continue to use it. No internet & all. I love this phone.
