I have had this phone for about a month and I really like it for all of its fun features but I find the screen hard to read.  Maybe I need glasses but I can hardly see the battery strength in the right corner and I REALLY have a hard time reading the signal strength in the top left corner.  I do regret getting this phone but not because of the phone itself but for the coverage in my area.  The signal stinks in my area and probably 85% of the time when I go to use my phone I have no signal or I get the call failed message.
