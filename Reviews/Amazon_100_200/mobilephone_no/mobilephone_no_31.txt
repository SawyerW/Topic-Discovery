The 8100 is still a great little phone but it's been out for over a year here in the States.  Sprint just rolled out the newer VM4500 (aka, Sanyo 5500) super-phone, with video recording, VGA-resolution (640x480) digital camera, nation-wide walkie-talkie (!!!), and speakerphone, plus all the other bells and whistles.  Check it out.  If you want a free Sprint PCS phone, get the SCP-8100.  If you are willing to spend money, get the VM4500.BTW, to address the customer service complaint, I've been a Verizon Wireless customer for 6 years, a Sprint PCS customer for almost 4 years, and have also used T-Mobile/Voicestream and AT&T; and Cingular, and let me tell you Sprint has the best service by far.  Only one slight billing error in 4 years, and they corrected it right away after I called.  Verizon over-bills me almost every six months and takes forever to credit me back.  T-Mobile's coverage and service are complete jokes; their only "virtue" is payback-after-rebate dirt-cheap phones.  Sprint PCS also has the best voice clarity by far; Verizon is the worst even though they do have the widest CDMA coverage.
