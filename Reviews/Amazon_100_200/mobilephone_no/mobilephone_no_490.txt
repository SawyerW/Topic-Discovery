I have the International Version of this watch, which did not come with an english version of the instruction book.... I emailed the company and asked for one and they gladly provided it.  My product also did not come with the bluetooth headset, I guess that's why it only cost me $800.00 vice $1,000.00.  Everything works as advertised and it's a really well made product.  I don't use the cell phone very much because I have an iphone 4 which I love and use often, but I use the LG GD910 as a wrist watch almost everyday.  When I tested out the cell phone function, all I had to do was to remove the sim card from my iphone and insert it into the watch and everything worked great!!!!
