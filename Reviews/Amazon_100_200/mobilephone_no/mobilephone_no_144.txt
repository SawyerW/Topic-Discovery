The Good.1. Good reception in the greater L.A area (actually Nextel is overall pretty good service provider anywhere from what i hear).  But what you do get is signal everywhere. The great thing is I'll be talking2. Sturdy construction. It simply feels like a solid phone. This phone is however not tiny like many of the phones offered by Sprint or T-Mobile.3. Speakerphone option is great. Also digital 2-way with Nextel.Bad (not so bad)1. Battery Life. I had the Sony-Ericsson T68i before this phone and that thing would go days before dying. This phone is about 1.5 days of standby with moderate use. You just have to charge it more often I suppose2. Small screen size. But then again, I don't use a phone for games or taking pictures. For me, those are for PS/2 and digital cams repectively.3. No vibrate and ringer at the same time.
