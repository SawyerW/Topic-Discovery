I bought this phone and plan, paid list price for the phone and it was defective right out of the box. Okay not their fault but when they sent me a RECONDITIONED PHONE to replace the defective phone I was not going to except it. I mean I paid their price and got a bad phone right out of the box. I called and they sent another phone and still after I told them it was defective right out of the box NEW they still sent another RECONDITIONED PHONE. This company is the biggest rip off out their. This company also owns Straight Talk so be very careful what you are dealing with. As for me I am going to Verizon and using their prepaid phones with more data at the same price as Straight Talk. I WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF IT WAS AN OPTION.
