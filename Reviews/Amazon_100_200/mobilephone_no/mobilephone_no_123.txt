The title says it all. If you are looking for a small phone to use as a phone, then this Samsung will do you good. If you're looking for a smartphone/pda, you might want to look elsewhere.I've had my E105 for about a month and it has worked like a charm. My reception has been great (T-mobile) and battery life good. The flip phone design is sleek and saves on space. It's a pretty slim phone and will fit into any pocket.BUT the handset volume is low overall, so it should be avoided by those with hearing impairments. People seem to complain that you can't see the screen in direct sunlight, but for the most part all color screens have this same behavior. The outside display though is black and white and can be seen fine in the sunlight.As far as being a good PDA with PIM features, this phone lacks. But it does have a calendar with useful alarm features. It has infrared but no easy way to sync your phonebook with a PC without purchasing software.
