Physically this phone looks good but it has some flaws that will make a normal person freak and want to smash the phone to bits. First, it has the habit of going to the sleep mode i.e. the phone shuts down and you have to press the power button to wake it up. The problem is that pressing the button does not work and you usually have to take out the battery or call the cellphone from another phone.  Secondly, the phone freezes some times and/or there is a slight delay when texting.Finally tech support from both AT&T; and HTC are worthless. THere solution is always a hard reset. I even had the phone replaced twice by AT&T; and both phones had the same defect. Please save your money and get the newest phone where they actually have tech support to help you.
