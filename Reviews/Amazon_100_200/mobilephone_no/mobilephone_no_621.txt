What can I say about this cell phone? That it has the best camera Ive seen, incredible battery and sweet FM trasmiter? Well, maybe. All I can say is that this is the best phone Ive had myself. Outstanding features in an outstanding prduct. For sure it has things to improve (like it could use some more processing speed), but its nothig that takes its winner position.I Love itA bit more detail.Things that are very good or perfect- FM Transmitter- TV connection- WIFI- Camera at "normal" light- Built in SW set- Picture edition built-in- GPS mapsThings that could use some improvement, but are still good- Camera Flash (or night shots)- the plastics arround the NaviWhell(r)- Processor speed in some operations- GPS navigation
