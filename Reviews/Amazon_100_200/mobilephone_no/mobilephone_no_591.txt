I had an LG that I really liked but the battery would only last about two days between charges, max. I replaced the battery twice and that did not help.I bought the RAZR, as I have one I used at work and I really liked it. It has an exceptional battery life between charges and the sensitivity and range are better than the LG. It is thin enough that I carry it in my front pocket so it dosn't need a holster of any kind. Takes great pictures also!The only thing that I see as a negative is you cannot see the screen very well in sunlight. But all other cell phones I have used in the past had this same problem. In a nutshell: Great phone at a great price!
