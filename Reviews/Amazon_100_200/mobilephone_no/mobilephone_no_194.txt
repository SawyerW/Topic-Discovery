I have owned two of these and had the same problem on both: the inner speaker will stop working. Over 10 months, both phones failed, and eventually Cingular gave me a V551 (which also sucks for the same reasons).Other complaints:Takes too long to load new menus or change characters when text messaging.Cheap flip hinge will make noises that makes the phone sound like it will come in two.Port on bottom will not work after you carry the phone around for a couple of weeks. Charging portion still good, but transfer port goes bad.Cliffnotes: I am done with Motorola V series phones.
