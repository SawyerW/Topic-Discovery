I was in need of a new phone, as my old dumb phone was falling into pieces.  I researched online and looked for something with a great camera, touch screen, and something that doesn't require a data plan.  My search led me to the Nokia N8.  It gave me what I wanted.  The 12MP is killer.  I've been taking lots of pictures with it and the quality is phenomenizzle.  I love how I can turn of 3G and just use wifi to do online things on the phone and I don't have to pay a penny for data.  I love the touch screen and all the useful apps I've downloaded so far.  Nokia N8 is the perfect phone for my needs.
