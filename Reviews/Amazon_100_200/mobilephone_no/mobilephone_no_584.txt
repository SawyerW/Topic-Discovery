I purchased this cell phone from Amazon and it was sold as new. This cell phone purchase was to replace a cherished RAZR that an elderly parent had and absolutely loved. I wanted a new phone and so I purchased it from Amazon LLC and not from one of the hundreds of other sellers on Amazon. The first time my Mom called me it had a loud screeching sound in the background and that never went away. It also wasn't "new" as it had it five quick notes written in Spanish on the phone. Someone at Amazon didn't bother to check these phones or they would have found mine and many others here weren't new but probably refurbished phones. Phone never worked properly and Mom took it into an AT&T; store and the rep was nice enough to check it out. He found the phone was defective and advised returning it for a refund which we did. So the lesson I learned was even Amazon doesn't guarantee you a "new" cell phone even if the listing says it's new.
