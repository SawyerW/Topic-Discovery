Camera takes pictures in one of 2 modes(low-res or hi-res) and quickly becomes an addictive little feature. Bluetooth compatibility is a BIG plus I love using the jabra headset with this little number. As a technophile, I'm looking forward to the virtual infrared keyboard the "chatboard" just doesn't cut it. The 2meg memory really isnt a big deal when you can email the pictures to your primary email address.. The organizer features are spartan but easy to use (even my mother can figure this out). The best feature is text messaging of course. Did I mention you can transfer your own notes, pictures, and songs onto this phone? =)My only complaint is that downloading games and apps for this phone is a SERIOUS pain in the arse. I've tried 3 times from different indie websites (ie: handango.com) and all to no avail except via the phone itself through cingular's wap site. Are they trying to monopolize? probably. All in all, this phone is a good alternative to expensive smart phones and makes a successful effort at bundling worthwhile features. Battery life is more than ample as well!
