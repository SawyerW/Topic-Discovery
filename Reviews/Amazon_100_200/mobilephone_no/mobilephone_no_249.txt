I've had this phone for 2 years now. I needed something light enough to clip on while at the gym. I hate carrying around my cell phone and mp3 player. The radio funtion is also pretty handy when at work. With AT&T;, I almost always get indoor reception.As a bonus, it takes great pictures! I personally love the "bursts" setting which takes 3 images in one second. It also takes great video! The external speakers work just like any other mp3 player, nano, etc. that's meant to be heard by one or two people. You wanna rock the house... invest is some external speakers.I also use it for web, texting, checking my e-mails, and playing rockband. Heavy use of these last items would be more convenient on a smartphone. Time for an upgrade and I have my eye on the iPhone, but it's hard giving up my small phone.
