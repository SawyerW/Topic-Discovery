I've got the package almost a month ago, and they sent me a european cell phoneIt doesn't work so i called the OEM shop. They don't pick up the phone. Never.so I emailed them and got reply after 3 days. I gave them serial numbers and all that.They told me a week later that they set my cell phone with RMA which means I have to ship my cell phone back to themI don't even live in a city and, I live in dorms, so it's very hard for me to ship my package.When I was in a city for a break, I called them, emailed them to visit the shop myself so it would make a faster process.However, they still give me no reply, no contact at all. I wanted to fix my cell phone at first but now, I want a Full Refund
