I had purchased a Magenta RAZR that was magenta and red/the battery wouldn't hold a charge/there was a humming noise/quick notes were in dutch?? and there were spelling errors. I contacted Ace Digital regarding these issues and they sent me an email the next business day with a prepaid shipping label to return this product for a refund. I was refunded $165.60, out of the $190 that I paid for it. I assume that I was charged a restocking fee? However, I am very pleased that they responded so quickly and gave me a refund. I was very disappointed when I received the phone, but they have redeemed themselves by honoring my return/refund. Thank you Ace Digital.
