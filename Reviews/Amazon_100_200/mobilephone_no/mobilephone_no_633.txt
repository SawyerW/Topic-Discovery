Perhaps an unlocked phone would be more useful but ATT sold me this problematic phone and didn't do anything to compensate for its problems. When texting this phone would often crash and to get it running again I had to REMOVE the battery. This would happen to me more than daily. I even brought it to the store, they replaced the device, still happened even when I removed the over priced unusable apps. The only benefits to windows is the ability to ready Office docs, but the android and iphones can do the same - ditch Windows mobie and don't look back!
