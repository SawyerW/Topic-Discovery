Looking for a decent UNLOCKED phone and not willing to pay that much, this is it! Love it when I'm asked if it's a Blackberry. Everyone needs to jump back on the Nokia bandwagon, I remember using several of their phones back in the day.Fantastic - think it's pretty smart on switching profiles for the work/home bit. Although, I haven't used it much. I have heard complaints on the camera [only 2 MP], but some photos I've taken came out GREAT! Remember it's not for professional photography. :) Buttons are easy to press, but then again, I'm a chick and have small fingers. My only regret is not purchasing the 8 Gig memory card and USB cable for the phone at the same time. Only been on the internet a few times via WiFi, so far, I like, think it's fast enough. Calendar/ActiveNotes/Office, thumbs up!What many fail to mention is call quality, I'm on AT&T; [in a metro area], and there have been several 'call disconnected' calls. Volume for speakerphone isn't that great, which I've gotten used too.
