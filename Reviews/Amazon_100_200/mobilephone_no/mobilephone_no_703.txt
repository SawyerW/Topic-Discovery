I pre-ordered a Nokia N8 when they were first put up for pre-order from Nokia USA. The phone lasted a good almost 3 years before it started giving me serious problems.I knew that I had to replace it so I came on Amazon and purchased one. This one might be slightly built better than the last one that I had. The first one that I had was made in China. This one was made in Finland, home of Nokia. I was one that believed that no matter where a phone was made, quality control would ensure that all the experiences were the same. There are slight differences in the build quality, but they are noticeable. The one from Finland doesn't feel quite as stiff. The slide button on the side is not as loose as on the one China. The body just feels a bit better.Pros: Nokia Maps and Navigation, Camera, the actual phone!, micro-SD card slot, build qualityCons: Memory, aging OSOverall though, I still like this phone. It's definitely going down in Nokia history as one of its best.
