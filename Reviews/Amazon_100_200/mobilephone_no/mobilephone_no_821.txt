Well, i was worried like anyone when i bought this cellphone (i bought it from amazon 2 weeks ago) because of the hardware problems like the purple amoled... or the dead camera or the dead nokia... Ive been using it for 2 weeks now and i just can say that this nokia is PERFECT. No problems at all... Since i bought it it has restarted just 1 time... The camera is perfect. Now i can take those special moments with my friends and my family with the quality of a high end camera!!! The apps are ok for me. I got skype, facebook chat and angry birds :D. Is a perfect multimedia phone. The messaging is ok... Landscape keyboard is not good for my fat fingers :S. Multitouching is perfect. Perfect respone when looking at photos. The web explorer is... well... crap... I recommed downloading Opera. But as far as ive been using it the phone is perfect without problems. I recommed it for symbian lovers :)
