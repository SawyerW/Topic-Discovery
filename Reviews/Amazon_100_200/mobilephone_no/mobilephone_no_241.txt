Buyer beware... do not buy Sprint. I give them zero stars! I purchased a Treo 600 for metro Atlanta. Basically the service was very bad. I called to cancelled and charged me $112 and change. As a business customer or any customer why am I being changed for poor service. I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried. But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer. If you intend to buy a phone from them get the least expensive plan first. Then will not loose as much monsy as I did for just 7 days of service.
