I got this phone as a replacement for my Motorola V557 that went kaput. These are a few of the things that have not made my life easier in the 2 weeks I've had the phone:1) The battery life IS a joke, but it improved once my husband turned off the internet browser, which apparently is on full time by default.2) The quality of the sound on calls is dismal, even though I've got it up to full volume.3) Reception is not good, even in town, and it drops calls, which my V557 never did.4) It loses my address book on a regular basis, requiring a restart (sometimes more than one).5) It also tells me my smart card isn't installed (it is), which again requires restarting.6) It won't save my ringer settings, no matter how many times I push the "save" button. It seems to be stuck on vibrate only.If there had been something else available at the store we trade with (such as another V557), I would have gotten it instead of the Nokia. As it is, I'm stuck for now. If I could have given this joke of a phone less than one star, I would!
