This phone is the perfect union of form and function. It's absolutely tiny, the screens are very clear, the camera works as well as any flashless VGA camera does, and the Bluetooth features are super useful.Some things that make it so cool:- The phonebook and calendar synch wirelessly with the addressbook and calendar on my laptop (a Mac!).- I don't pay to download fancy ringtones; I just transfer MP3s straight to my phone and use them instead.- It's got a mini-USB port for charging, hands-free wired headsets, and wired data transfer (not some proprietary connector like other phones).- It's super light.- It's pink.
