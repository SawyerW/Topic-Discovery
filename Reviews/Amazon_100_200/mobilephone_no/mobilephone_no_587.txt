This Motorola Razr phone is no where near the quality of my original Moto Razr V3 phone that I happily used for years. When I first received this phone, I noticed that even the case is cheaper with sharp edges and no decor like the original. Even though it was supposed to be a U.S. version, the wording was totally European. The graphics were very poor and it did not have predictive texting like the original. It quit working after two days, so I sent it back. The supplier was very curteous and promptly sent a replacement. Well, guess what. The replacement would not ring. I requested a refund which I promptly received.These phone are advertised like they are like the original Moto Razr phones, but in reality, they are cheap imitations.
