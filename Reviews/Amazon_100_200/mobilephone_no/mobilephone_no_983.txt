I received a Costa Rica phone, with all preset specifications of MOVISTAR.CR. The Nokia box had been opened.  The 'Nokia' seal was broken.  A red seal had been placed over the Nokia seal.  All inside seemed fine, except the instruction manual (as well as the box description) is in the local language, not English.When I turned on the phone, it said MOVISTAR, and refused to work with my U.S. sim card.I am now spending a weekend online attempting to find out how to change all the settings which need to be changed, so that I can use this 'unlocked' phone with my current U.S. sim card.Had I known I would receive an international phone with complications, I might have gone a different direction, or sought the same product on a different website.
