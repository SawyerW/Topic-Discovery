I bought this phone in June, 08. Benn working great till last week. My screen cracked all of sudden without any injury, pressure, or fall. At&T; did not cover it as it is considered physical damage. So I payed 55$ to change the LCD screen... Plus i bought the leather belt pouch to keep the phone safe from everything.  I cooked, we ate, sat down to watch TV when finished was getting ready to go to sleep and took my phone out of leather pouch - GUESS WHAT?? LCD Screen id broken again. no fall/no temperature exposure, no pressure on the pouch. What is this.. do i have to pay money again. Don;t buy this phone. it is fragile.
