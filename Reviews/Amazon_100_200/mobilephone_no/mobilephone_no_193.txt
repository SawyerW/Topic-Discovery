The Motorola v400 is a great all around phone.  It doesn't have anything too extreme but you can do some really clever things with it.  It is capable to do everything except record video.  It has a built in camera that is really good for taking photos of things that are not very far away due to its only downfall, a 4x zoom.  The clamshell design is very nice because you don't have to worry about punching numbers when the phone is in your pocket.  The display is very clear and the ability to change the ring status of your phone without opening it by the side buttons is a great feature.  Besides the obvious camera feature, the v400 has the ability to send and receive text and multimedia messages, go online and download games and mp3 quality ringtones.  The battery on the phone is good for about three days on a single charge.  Overall this phone is a very nice chioce for anyone who likes games and giving the different people on their phone different ringtones as it is compatible with just about everything you can find.
