While many people have said that they do not like this phone because of the small keys, as a female I have not found them to be too small and I have average size hands.I do text, everyday, perhaps not as often as others, but nevertheless, find the texting not to be an issue.PROSI love the camera, my phone came with a USB connector, it is so easy for me to transfer pictures.  THE FLASH is amazing!! it is so bright, i like using it as a flash lightThe mp3 player has amazing speakersI bought this phone so i would have a good camera, mp3 player all rolled into one for me.One thing i dont' like is that it won't take really big memory cards (8gb) i think its limit is 1 gb.Overall  i have been pleased i have had it for about 5 months now.  One thing i don't like is that it doesn't display the date, just the time, but that really isn't that big of a deal.
