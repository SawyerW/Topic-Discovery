I ordered this phone from Amazon and got it delivered in just 2 days, with free Super Saving Shipping. I got to tell that the phone has gone well beyond my expectations (in my first few days of use) and I've started loving it since I received it. It has got a lot of features and will still take some more time for me to get acquainted with all the properties that the phone has gotten. The Look-and-Feel is great, impeccable screen resolution, smart Social Networking features and as some of the other users said, there seems to be some drag with the Symbian OS. Otherwise, the quality of the photos/videos with the camera is really outstanding, and it's one of the prime attractions in this phone. In short, everything seems to be OK at least for the time being...
