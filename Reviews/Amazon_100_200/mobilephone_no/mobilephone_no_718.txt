first of all, I can't speak on the performance of this phone (Symbian 3) when compare to an IPhone 4 or an Android phone for that matter. What I CAN say is that the phone is bar-far way better than any of nokia previous flagship phones (i.e.N97).A few of the online reviews, particularly from US based sites, or I-phone biased websites (i.e. Engadget) give this a phone a low rating because the "UI is not as intuitive or good" as the competition. Well believe me when i say it, YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS PHONE FOR YOURSELF. It's not perfect (some software inconsistencies), but the darn thing is loaded with features and hardly ever crash (Crash or shutdown once when loaded the wrong version software from OVI store)
