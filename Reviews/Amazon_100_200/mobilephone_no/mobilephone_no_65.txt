This phone is an excellent phone.  It has a very good color screen, it is well disigned, the camera is pretty good for a phone, and it has numerous features.  For example, if you have a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC with an IR sensor, you can transfer phone numbers, to-do items, and more.  You can aslo record soound, apply themes to you background, and surf the web.  The phone has a very nicely layed out case and menu thats easy to navigate.  It also has a very quality feel when you hold it in you hand.  The only very minor problem with this phone is that the case smuges easily.  Sony includes a nice cloth to wipe it down with.  Besides that, this phone is incredibele.  I got two of them under a family plan with att and have not been dissapointed.  The price is ok, so I would give this phone a 5 out of 5.
