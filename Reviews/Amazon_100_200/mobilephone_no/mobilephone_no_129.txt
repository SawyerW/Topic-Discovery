I HATE THIS PHONE!  My husband needed a replacement phone.  He just had to have a flip phone.  OK, he instantly fell in love cause he's a gadget-a-holic.I can't believe as much as this phone was that it's T-R-A-S-H!The battery won't charge unless the telephone is OFF!  NOW what if you need to use the phone.  The screen is now all BLACK so you can't even read it.  SO now I have to purchase another cell for Hubby.  He's not even a major talker like his WIFEY so it should have lasted 4 ever!It's a cute phone, but I need something that's more durable for OUR cash flow....
