New Sony Ericsson W850i Precious Black GSM cell phone "No Locks"Sony Ericsson W580i Unlocked Quadband Phone (Black)Looks niceGood featuresGood sound...In another words - would be completely satisfactory - if it would work:1. Cannot stand any magnetic field: you cannot use holster with magnetic clip. Good luck finding another one.2. Don't get wet in rain. I don't mean don't drop in water. I mean that a light rain kills it. You can be still dry but the phone is dead already. On the second time it didn't recover at all.3. Reboot it time to time. Some times it just hangs up or refuse to connect with the handsfree unit. One will value this feature a lot once failing to answer an important call.
