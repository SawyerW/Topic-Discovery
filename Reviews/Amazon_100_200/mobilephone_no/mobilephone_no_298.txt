I love this phone. The first one that I had was the best phone that I've ever owned, but after years of tough service my original phone wore our... it survived several months of sub-Saharan heat in West African, then it died. Because I love the design i replaced it twice with the same model but Motorola's quality sucks so badly that both the second and third phones just fell apart.I don't understand how a company with such a great product can allow cheap production to turn an elegant tool into a piece of junk..This is worse than a phone model with no future; this is a company with no future.
