Well, I was very happy with the phone when i first bought in about a year back. Not anymore.. I bought 2 of these for myself and another for my family. I even recommended this phone to a couple of my friends, but now everyone of us face the same issues. But neither Sprint or Sanyo wants to acknowledge that there is a problem with the phone.- the pin type charger does not work - the battery charge indicator is one BIG lie - just after 2 minutes the battery indicators shows full charge but in about 5 mins the LOW battery alert is up.Whenever i try to charge, i hear beeps as if i am plugging and unpluging the charger.. But the phone does not charge(although the battery indicator shows full charge).
