I work as a dive instructor, and I have lost count of the cell phones that have either been 'drowned' or salt damaged in the past 6 years since I started my business.This phone is awesome, it's waterproof as long as the port that covers the battery charging access is firmly in place, so if it should 'go for a swim it's much more likely to survive. My phone has already had a couple of water encounters that would have killed lesser phones.The unit is sealed so I don't have to worry about using it with salty / dirty / oily hands as it can be rinsed off. The case fits nicely in the hand, and the keys are good size.I would recommend this phone for boating, dirty or wet out door pursuits, and even mechanics and other folks involved in jobs where your phone is likely to get mucky!The battery has a pretty good life. The phone also has a torch, the only thing that it lacks is a bottle opener!So impressed am I that I have bought additional phones for my staff / business.
