For starters is a great looking TV (on the outside), looks great in the living room, your wife will not whant to hide it in the closet and most important it looks super great with a DVD player, I just traded my old  50" for this set and on the old set there was hardly any difference  betwen the way my DSS system looked and the way my DVD looked, on the new  set there is a whole world of difference. I had some friends ask me if this  is HDTV. BUT! one thing I really hated about it was that it has a Video out  but not a tunner out, so when I hook it up to my A/V receiver, if I whant  to watch regular TV I have to use 2 remotes, one to set my A/V to TV and  the other one to set the TV to TV, can you belive that? , my old system  1989 model had a Tunner out! , some body at Sony was sleeping on the Job.  Besides this small fall back its a great TV and people will say "wasnt  projection TV supposed to looked bad! "great value buy it!
