Like everyone said before, I bought this for all the features and the great battery life.  All those have delivered except I feel like the battery doesn't last that long anymore AND the charger that they provide starts to "get loose" and stops charging the phone correctly after a while and you have to get the alternative charger for the phone.  This phone gets great reception and I get reception in places that most other people don't...ONLY ONE PROBLEM....... YOU CAN'T HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO YOU!  The speaker in the earpiece of this phone is terrible.  I thought it was me at first.  I thought that it was the OTHER person's cell phone because how could it be mine if I had full reception bars?  Well it is the phone.  The speaker is simply a piece of junk.  Hopefully Sanyo will correct it with future phones because I really do like everything else about the phone.  I gave it 2 stars though because the basic function of the phone is obviously the most important thing and that is seriously lacking.
