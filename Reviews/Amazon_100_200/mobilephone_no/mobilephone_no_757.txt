this is the fanciest phone I ever had.  it does so many things and I love the green.  I am having a ton of fun with it.  still have to learn how to text and retrieve mail but I am learning.  love the clock and that I can watch movies and play games.  love that the battery life is better than the cell phone I was using.  Nokia is a great name.  The phone was brand new when it came and I added to it a memory card and a car charger.  I take it everywhere with me and the camera is absolutely sharp.  thank you Amazon for making it available.
