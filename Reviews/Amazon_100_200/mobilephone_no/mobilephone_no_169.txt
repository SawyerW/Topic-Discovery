No holster as stated in the bottom of the "phone data" link(...)Components:Battery, Battery Door, Phone, Holster, Welcome Guide, User Documentation )To activate the phone, Nextel first transfered me about 6 to 8 times.  They could not provide a phone number that was local in my city (pop. of 40,000).  I knew of 2 cell phone number prefixes that were local in my area with Nextel, but they said that no more numbers were available in them.  After dealing with nextel on the phone (many, many phone calls) and trying over 6 phone numbers prefixes that all ended up being long distance, I went to the local Nextel dealer and they set it up right away with a phone number prefix that the 800 number people said was unavailable.Overall a major pain (...)to activate over the phone.  It is nice that the phone will be free after rebate minus the cost for another holster ~ $15.
