The i730 is okay, but it's not what i thought it would be.  I was disappointed.  It can't download real tones off of the phone like most phones, it can only download polyphonic.  That is whack!  Polyphonic tones are last year, people want tones that sound like real  songs.  This phone is whack compared to the sprint phone.  It has the walkie-talkie like the i730, but it has a camera on top of that!  If you guys haven't seen the i860 yet, look it up.  This phone gives the sprint phone competition.  It has a camera, video recorder, everything.  It makes the i730 look like a big chunk of metal.
