Stylish AND works great!  What a concept.  The clarity and reception on this phone really blows me away.  I can actually hear the conversation when driving in the car!The price is high and I recommend getting a case.  Amazon lists it as coming with a leather case, but I did not receive one. (**update: Amazon did in fact send me a case for the phone after I inquired about it.  It didn't fit though.  I ended up paying almost 30.00 for one at the Cingular store.) As of yet, they have not got back to me regarding that matter.  A little deceptive about what comes with it, (cases are expensive) but it does not take anything from the phone itself.I love it!(UPDATE*** Also, now that I have had the phone for a while, I wanted to state that some people have stated the battery life isn't good with this phone.  I have had NO problems at all and today is #5 that it hasn't been on the charger.)
