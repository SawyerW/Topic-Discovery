When I received my order from amazon I was really eager to start using my mobile after have seen several customers review. I have less than three month using the device which I qualify of good, but despite of the beautiful desing I cannot say it  does match with its functionality. The device doesn't have good reception for calls, most of the calls I have received goes directly to the voicemail without even ring on the phone and one day, suddenly, the device turned off after loading a game from Nokia web site on the internet, it didn't work anymore, the telephone is dead. I may say I have lost my moneyRegards
