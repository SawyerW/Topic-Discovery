first let me tell you the cellphone its just great i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!but what i really want say its that amazon has the greatest customer service i've ever seen, this is what happened to me, when i received the cellphone it did not turn on or do anything i was really down about that but then i contaceted customer service and they told me to sent back the cell phone so they can send me i new one i though they would wait to received the old one and then ship the new one but this was not the case, they shipped it right away and i got my new celphone that work just great 1 day after  i made the complaint and amazon will issue a refund on the money i spent to ship the celphone that did not work...how cool is that!!!!thank u amazon ur great!!!!
