I've had this phone for about 1 month now and no complaints! Everything works well on the phone and it is very easy to use. Camera quality is good, video quality and sound is good. Uploading music on the phone was very easy and it plays well in the music player. Also, surfing the web is a breeze, the picture quality is good, videos on youtube shows really clear on the real player and the sound is excellent. Quickoffice is cool everything works well on that. I don't use the email feature but I do plan too, hopefully that is no bother.Like I said before, no complaints!p.s. battery life is really good!
