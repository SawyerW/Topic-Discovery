I dont usually leave reviews, but i was disapointed with this phone. i had so much high expectations for it. I will keep this review simple.Pro:great touch screen response, great kewboard, anna software is very good.Con;-Call quality on this phone is not that great (ATT 3.5G network). Nokia are specifically good with call quality, but not on this phone (ATT network), everyone almost sound muffled, i guess nokia can blame ATT.- Vibrate mode SUCKS (excuse my language). This is the biggest deal breaker for me because i leave my phone on vibrate almost all day. I put this E6 on vibrate, and literally watch as i miss calls and alerts. Not even the slightest tickle or table vibration. For this fact alone, i will be returning this phone. Back to BB I go.
