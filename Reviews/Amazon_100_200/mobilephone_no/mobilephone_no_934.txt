If you're one of those high tech people that absolutely adores the latest technology smart phones, then this probably isn't for you. Me? I just wanted an upgrade from my regular non-smart phone. And this phone seems great. Got it yesterday; been messing with it all day. I LOVE that it has a touch screen AND a GREAT keyboard. In fact, the keyboard is exceptional. The touch screen is great too. It gets the job done without any glitches. It's a great phone, really. I'd recommend getting a memory card when you buy this if you don't already have one, otherwise you can't take pictures and save them. But really, this phone's great for those that wanted to upgrade to a smart phone, just not one of those iPhone/latest technology HD phones with all the extra goodies.
