I bought this phone to replace a Sanyo that was stolen.  Within a few months, I had to get a replacement since the display screen on the outside (the little box) had gone dead.  Within a few more weeks, the second phone's display died, and I've just left it blank, as it was too much trouble to replace - Sprint's customer service is poor.I find the sound quality, key size, and overall features to be acceptable but not great, and wish I had bought a Sanyo again.  With Sprint, you are fairly limited to phone choice - I'd recommend against LG if you are looking at several models/brands.
