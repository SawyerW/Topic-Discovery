Today in class, my crotch wanted to make a phone call. I told it, "Not yet, wait till after class, you're going to be too loud! You're going to disrupt everyone." But then, the crotch told me, "Look, this phone has silent mode! I can just turn that on." Then, my teacher called on me. He was like, "Hey, Joshua. Why are you talking to your fly." I could muster no response. I hope I passed today's pop quiz.Oh, yeah. If you guys have any questions about my phone, ask my crotch. It knows everything about it! Talk about handsfree telecommunications! (My crotch even knew what Bluetooth was! I just thought my phone was referred to that stinky guy by Wendy's!)
