I bought this phone because I travel for work to unpredictable places where you need your phone working. I am in Haiti right now and the phone is working perfectly. Back in the states I use an AT&T; sim in it and it works fine. Here, I popped a DigiCell sim in and no problemo. Phone calls and texting work without a problem.I cover multiple countries from Haiti to Sudan to Pakistan all in different time zones and their is a world clock application that let's me know the time in those places as I scroll through. It's got the other standard applications such as converter (currency, time, temp, etc...), alarm clock and timer, calendar, etc... The flashlight is strong and use it often.I am used to the Nokia set up, so the Samsung is taking a little getting used to going through the menu.I purchased all the peripherals so I can charge it on the go or when there is no wall outlet. The battery life is strong. I have been here one week and still have two bars. So far, looks good. Works well. A good travel phone.
