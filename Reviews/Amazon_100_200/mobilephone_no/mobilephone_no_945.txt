This is the second Curve 9330 I've owned.The first one I had was ultra reliable until I dropped it and the screen cracked after just over a year of heavy use. In the two months that I've had this new one, the screen has freaked out a couple of times and required a restart to clear it up.  It hasn't happened for a while now and the phone is otherwise great.  The screen issues are the only reason it gets 4 stars.  The compact size of the phone makes it easy to take anywhere.  The full keyboard is really useful if you can type and don't rely on auto correct for everything.  I use the phone once in a while as an SSH client, that is where the keyboard makes the phone more useful than any touchscreen I've tried for remote access services.  The camera on the phone is not very good, but sufficient.  For the price, the phone can't be beat.
