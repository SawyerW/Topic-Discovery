I abosolutely love my ORANGE PEBL U6 phone.  I can't seem to stop looking at it, and customising it...This phone is all I want in a cell phone..the sexy look, feel, and color and not to mention my "cat meow" ringtone, keeps heads turned and wondering where did you get that phone.  I initially bought a RAZAR...boo hoo definatly not all it is cracked up to be.  It comes in a few other colors lime green, burgandy, black, blue...If you are looking to purchase something that stands out, this is it!!!!!!!.  CONS: number pad attracts lots of smudges, constantly cleaning it and not a mega pix camera..still well worth it.Roxanne
