Not only does Nextel have far and above the BEST service in the wireless industry, but now they've unleashed the BEST phone with the new i730.  Compact, sleek and amazingly durable, the i730 is Nextel's most feature-loaded phone yet.  I've been a Nextel customer for 2 years and would never consider another carrier (used to be with AT&T, Verizon and CellularOne (now Cingular)).  Their coverage is far-superb and I've never had a dropped call!  If you loved the i90c or i95cl, the i730 is going blow your mind.  Like U2's unleashing of 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', just when you think Nextel couldn't possibly get any better, they 'brought da noise AND da funk' with the i730!
