I've had the Nokia 6680 for about a year now, and it's fantastic! I do feel sorry for the people in the States because when this phone was launched in the UK, it came with an extra integrated camera, just above the Nokia sign, to allow video calling. It's the best feature ever invented, and the 6680s picture quality is flawless,as are all its other features.The only con of the handset is that battery life reduces dramatically after bout 6 months, though this is probably true for all handsets in constant use. My advice....come to the UK and buy the handset here..sim/free.
