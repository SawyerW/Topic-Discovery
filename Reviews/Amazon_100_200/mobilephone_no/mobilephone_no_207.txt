Pros:Decent battery lifeYou can set profiles and each profile having a diffrent setting for  ringer,screensaver etcYou can group your contacts as VIP,Family etc and have the phone ring only when it is a call from family ..Cons:There is always a constant hiss on the speaker.( i am comparing this to my sanyo)Squeaky noise- looks like something is going to fall off.. whenever you press a button you hear the sqeak!Camera is absolutely useless!.. Minimal resolutionSpeakerphone is not loud.I would want to use a speakerphone when i drive, This is not loud enough for the road noise. I can hardly  hear anyone ( I live in NJ .. so you know that i would drive slow!)
