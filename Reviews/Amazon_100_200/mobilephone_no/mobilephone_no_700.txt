It is a very good phone with many features in it. I just love the HDMI connectivity to the TV....so just coz of this feature I need not connect my laptop to the TV and watch a movie if I want to. It's 12 MP camera is also amazing....dude 12MP cam means u dnt need a point n shoot camera if u r out. It also turns into a 3G WiFi hotspot which is also amazing. There are a few flaws in the OS that the phone restarts automatically sometimes, sometimes the sensors get turned off automatically so the screen stops rotating. But I mean if you are ok with such small things the it is a very good phone. A person who is anti iPhone, it is a very good choice for him.I have had some issues with Nokia N8 and amazon.com gave me a replacement and its perfectly fine....I am very happy with it. I can say that Nokia N8 is a first Nokia phone that i liked so much.
