I have owned several different Pantech phones on my family plan. Almost all run into various issues, all needed to be exchanged when under warranty, and once out of warranty, Pantech support is minimal at best. Read the other reviews. This model is no exception. It is riddled with design defects that Pantech ignores.....battery covers that won't stay on, phones that shut off by themselves.Only one Pantech model has performed well, the Pursuit/Pursuit II. Every other, most notably the Impact and the Link - AWFUL.I won't even go into the features, as this is just a bad phone and you should avoid it.We maintain our phones and keep them protected, not mistreated - this are just junk. And if you call Pantech, even willing to buy replacement parts, like battery doors, they tend to have no spare parts, probably because they get used up replacing all the defects.
