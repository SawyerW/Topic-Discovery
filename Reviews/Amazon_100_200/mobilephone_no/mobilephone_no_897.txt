A decent last hurrah for the Danger operating system, now totally phased out in favor of modified Android 2.? running on the Sidekick 4G.  Definitely a last gen phone but a good one at that.Brilliant for texting and MMS, the entire point of the phone.Good for emails and calls, battery life is fine if you remember to put it in sleep mode.  No issues with the media player.Connectivity is sometimes an issue, but YMMV. Default UI is pretty "teen-oriented".Phone bugs out on a pretty consistent basis. Will emit a high-pitched whine after removing headphones. Will freeze up occasionally when in sleep mode.Recommended for the price.  A nice alternative if you need a replacement but neither want to spring for the multiple-hundred dollar current gen phones, nor want to wallow in ancient $20 phones.  Definitely good for kids who aren't picky.
