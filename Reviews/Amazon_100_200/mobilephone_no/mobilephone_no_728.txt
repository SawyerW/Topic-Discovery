Still fiddling with this. So far, I am impressed.-I liked the phone from first glance. Looks sleek and feels good in the hand.-The operating system is intuitive and has a built in user guide.-The screen quality is clean, crisp and sharp.-Internal 14 GB of momory.-12 MP camera with a real working flash (I was sold right here)-It takes clear HD video.-Comes with connectivity cables to TV, USB, jump drives.The down-For such a recent and feature filled phone, I would have expected at least 3G connectivity. This is EDGE. (does not affect my usage of the phone, but unexpected)Excellent buy. I'm happy so far. I just hope it is as sturdy as Nokia phones of past, have not had any accidents to test this...
