I ordered the item and it was shipped in a timely mannor. Upon recieving it I put it into service immediatly and had no problems. It worked perfectly for about 3 weeks then malfuntcioned. I hesitated to contact the seller as it was very clear at purchase that there was no warrenty. As the selling price was so low I fully understood no warrenty.I did contact the seller hoping they would at least offer to repair it for a price.They ask me to send it back and they replaced it at no cost but shipping it back. I was totally knocked out, what a deal all around.I cannot say enough good things about the product and the service.
