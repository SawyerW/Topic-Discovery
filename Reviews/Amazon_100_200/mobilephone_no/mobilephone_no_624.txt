Had the phone for a month then had to return it to Amazon. Features are great. I won't get into the pros as so many ppl covered those already, I will just go over the cons. 1.)The OS seems to freeze itself up at times where it's totally irresponsive to commands. You can press select and nothing happens. Seems to correct itself after a few minutes of idling. 2.)Capturing the highest quality video is very spotty, it will capture for 3-4 seconds, freeze, then continue capturing. If it doesn't work, why offer it in the first place? 3.) battery cover started to rattle after a week, can not stay tug on the phone. It's a little fraustrating. 4.) worst of it all, the earpiece started to fail after 2 weeks. Clearly a connection problem as if you press the back of the phone hard and in different ways, it fixes the problem temp. It's not a signal strength issue because loudspeaker works fine. Seems to be a very common problem for N85 manufactured before Feb 09.
