The i95 is a great phone, it is fully equipped and has speakerphone with a color screen! It takes no longer than 5 sec. to get on the net!And it has a feature called Java Apps which is very cool!  I mainly got it because all of my friends have nextels, and because of the walkie-talkie feature which is great!Nextel has exellent service, and there are no roaming charges. It works everywhere I go. And there is great customer service.I used to have AT&T which had horrible service,bad phones,and terrible customer service.I'm so glad that I got the i95 from nextel and so would you.
