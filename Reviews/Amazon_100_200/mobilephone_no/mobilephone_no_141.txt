After years of loyalty to the Motorola Startac, I decided I needed a phone with more functionality.  At the same time I was tired of Sprint's horrible service and bad plans.  I got the I730 with the Nextel Nation 1000 Connect plan.  It's great; perfect coverage and the phone is worth whatever you pay for it.  It's less than my first Startac ($399 vs $499) and I am very happy with my Nextel Service (much more clear than Sprint).  A definate recommend for those who require a quality phone rather than something made by Samsung, LG, or Sanyo.  If I could change one thing it would be the battery life, if I forget to charge it at night and I am talking quite a bit I may get a low battery the next day.  I don't complain about that too much though because I am usually connected to AIM all day long and often use my GPS TeleNav on my phone.
