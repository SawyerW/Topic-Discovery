I've had this phone for a couple of weeks now and these are the problems that i've noticed:CONS- The page numbers in the index of the manuel don't correspond to the actual page numbers.- The index isn't detailed enough and everything is categorized with the definitions that Samsung use.- Text messaging is a pain as you constantly have to switch back and forth from T9 mode to normal mode.  When T9 brings up the wrong word they don't offer you any replacements like SonyEricsson.  The phone also has a couple of other minor writing problems - first letters aren't capitalized automatically, and you can't use non-letter characters when adding contacts in your phone book.- It doesn't look like it but it is actually a little flimsy - After about a week i noticed that my flip case was misaligned.  Now i always carry it using a belt clip.- No speaker phonePROS- It's small and comes with a handy belt clip for free- The colours and graphics are excellentOVERALLIt's a pretty good phone.  I still like it despite it's drawbacks.  However i would have preferred something that was more text message friendly.  Overall, not bad for -$100!
