I bought this phone straight from at&t; a little less than two years ago. This phone is good for texting. I like that it sorts text messages into conversations based on who you're talking to. My biggest problem with this phone is the touchscreen on the outside number pad. It locks except for when you are on the phone, so I frequently hang up on people by brushing the end key on accident, especially when I try to prop the phone against my ear so I can use both hands and still hear the person I'm talking to because the speaker phone isn't that great. Overall, the call quality of this phone is mediocre, but if you don't call much and just want to text, it's a great phone. I've never had it freeze, though the battery covers are flimsy. I've broken 2 of them since I've had this phone.
