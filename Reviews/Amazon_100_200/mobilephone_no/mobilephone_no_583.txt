I bought this as a replacement phone for my Father.  He loved the Razr phone but as new models came out he upgraded, tried 2 others but never really liked them as well as the Razr V3.  The carrier did not carry them any more so the search was on.  I found this on Amazon, good price, quick delivery and as Advertised. The phone has worked well out of the box and my Father is very happy to be using what he considers the perfect phone.  I would recomend the seller and this phone for an easy to use, dependable unit.
