The phone I received (BB 8120) appears to be  a jail-broken AT&T; unit: it has the AT&T; logo.  It came without any desktop software and a very--very!--rudimentary set of instructions. On the other hand, It was new, booted up in English and worked out of the box with my T-mobile SIM card. . The device software version is v4.5.0.182; There is an update on the AT&T; web site  (v4.5.0.306) which I did not bother with. I downloaded  the Blackberry desktop software version 610.b034 from the web, along with the full product manual and the getting started guide. .The desktop software installed on Windows 7 without any problem and runs well; my outlook calendar and address lists  synchronized w/o any trouble. This is a good back-up unit.  If you buy it avoid the Fedex SmartPost option. It should be renamed the Fedex VeryLatePost. Mine was.
