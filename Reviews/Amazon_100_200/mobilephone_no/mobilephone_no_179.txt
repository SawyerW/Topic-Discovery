as with all phones, it's got issues.- needs better ringtones, to buy some, go to [...] (of course, if you're paying a fortune for a phone, you should get some good ringtones, but not with this one)- the games... well, one is ok, and common in new phones, the other, I can't stand.  To get new ones, (if you're using Cingular), go to Cingular's website, they offer better games than Motorola's site.- also, I wish the phone was entirely constructed of metal, instead of just the part on the front cover that is.  With a 4 month old in the apartment that has recently learned to grab at everything, I would've liked a more durable phone for my money.Otherwise, the phone is great!  Great resolution, looks nice, 4x zoom on the camera, picture caller ID, and other great features.
