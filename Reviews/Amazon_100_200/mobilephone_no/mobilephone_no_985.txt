Bought this Used/Reconditioned. This looked like a good deal. WRONG! The problem is that the product was defective from the start.  I did not realize that I was suppose to have some functionality while in the middle of a call, until the phone decided to show me that functionality.  It functioned correctly with call-options, such as mute and record, on three occasions.  During the malfunctioning state (most of the time), during a call the screen goes black, hiding all the options that it suppose to show.  If you check the Nokia site you will find this is a problem (probably related to the proximity sensor).
