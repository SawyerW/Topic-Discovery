I have had this phone going on a year now and can faithfully say that I have very few complaints!! First of all the phone has NEVER and I mean NEVER failed me! This will be the 5th Sanyo I have owned, starting with the faithful 4500, and have never been let down. I have seen numerous complaints about sound quality, but short of the volume being a little low on occasion, I cannot see too much fault. The speakerphone is only half-duplex, but most cell phone speakerphones are only HD at the moment. Also you cannot expect board room sound out of a tiny micro-sized speaker! It does very well for its size. Ready link performance is top rate, as well. All in all another great Sanyo product!
