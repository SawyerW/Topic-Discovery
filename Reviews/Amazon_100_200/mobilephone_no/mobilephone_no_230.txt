This phone is great to look at, and works like a charm.  The talk time allows for long conversations before recharging, the internet and messaging capabilities are very user-friendly, and setting up the phone book, calendar and alarms were a breeze.  I hear callers clearly, and love the speakerphone option for hands-free conversations.  The standard ringers, games and backgrounds are cute, but there is also a wide variety available for download inexpensively.  The phone accepts ReadyLink calls (walkie-talkie capability) which I have yet to try.  And the phone can be linked to  one's PC for downloading the pics taken with its camera.  Did I mention the phone has a ton of memory, too?I LOVE my new phone.  I'm sure if you buy it, you'll feel the same.
