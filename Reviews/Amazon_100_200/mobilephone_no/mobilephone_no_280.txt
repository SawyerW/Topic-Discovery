I purchased the nokia 6555 just 3 days ago. The phone dies after just 1 hour of talk time, not even using the multimedia package. Also, the phone heats up to the point it is hard to touch. After reviewing the specs on the phone I find out it emits HUGE amounts of radiation compared to phones of similar caliber. The radiation is believed to drain the battery and make the phone hot to the touch. An AT&T; sales associate warned me not to use the phone when it is hot because it may EXPLODE, yet they are not willing to exchange the phone. Again, I only purchased the phone 3 days ago. I have never experienced such poor customer service. I have been with cingular for many years and now that they are AT&T; this is the first time I have ever experienced a problem.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE. It is not safe for you or anyone you love. Even if it didn't get hot, the battery life alone makes the phone pointless.
