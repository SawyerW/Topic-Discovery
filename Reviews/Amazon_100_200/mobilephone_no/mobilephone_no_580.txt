I've used the N75 phone on Cingy/AT&T; for about a year and this phone uses the same Symbian 3rd ed OS. So I still have the same gripes about that but..The differences that I like on this phone:-Awesome camera resolution. Really digital camera-like. Even the indoor night pictures w/ flash came out great! Most people think it's a camera because of the way it looks and they give you that weird look when you ask them to take a picture of you ... and you hand them a phone!-Better battery life than the N75-I thought I'd have a problem with the smaller keypad area but I can actually text quicker on this because the keys are closer together and more responsive.-the keypad and phone itself (except for the screen) doesn't attract fingerprints as much as the N75-speakers sound fuller and not teeny-more themes and ringtones than my branded N75-lighter than the N75-easier sim card accessThe Cons:-I've gotten used to the flip style so having the screen exposed made me think twice about shoving it into my pockets.-joystick not as easy to get used to.In other words, an awesome awesome phone.A little pricey but well worth it! Get it!
