This is an excellent choice if you need to do lots of email and sometimes check attachments while on the road. Also good for sms and messenger, as it is easier to input text in the screen with the stylus than with the tiny keys of regular phones. But if your needs are more about reading email (not answering it) and having calendar and contacts synchcronized with your server or PC, a smartphone or any other new generation phone is a bettter choice because of the form factor. The big size is a price you have to be willing to pay for the luxury of working confortable in a bigger screen.Agree with all the other reviews, the AT&T service is bad, but I have found that this phone has much better reception than the Orange smartphone and Motorola smartphones in the AT&T network.If you are a frequent Intl traveler, be aware this is not a tri band phone... check the networks of the places you travel more frequently before buying this.
