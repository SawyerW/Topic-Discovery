I like all the extra features on this phone...great MP3 player, love the pedometer feature for running, great screen.However, in its main role as a phone it is sub-par.  The speaker developed an anoying buzz after about a year of use.  The keyboard is tiny if you have to type in a lot of phone numbers.  Finally, the internet button is on the front so I accidentally connected several times per week.  It got so bad that I bought a $4.99 data plan because I was wasting several dollars per month on accidental connections anyway!Also, the charging/headset port fails a lot.  I have to jiggle the cord to get it to charge and it often doesn't recognize when I plug in the headset.  I usually have to un-plug and re-plug a few times before the headset works.Finally, the phone locks up a lot and sometimes won't turn on.  I often have to pop it open and re-seat the battery to get it to recover.Overall, cool phone but quirky.
