I own this Sony Ericsson T616 Phone from last 2 months.Its very cute phone with nice features,not to forget its inbuilt camera.I have zero- dropped calls until now and the voice reception in and around Arizona State University in Phoenix, Arizona is excellent(Its true to say, AT&T is the wireless carrier that America Trusts on).The another feature that dragged me towards this phone is its blue-tooth anabled feature which is very helpful and sleek.The customer service of AT&T wireless is slow as to say at peek times,mostly in evening and morning business hours.Try to contact the customer service at early mornings or late nights,which I usually do.Altogether its a nice phone and a better bet against the other models in market till now.
