I've had this phone for almost 2 years(23 months), and it's still going strong.  There is a little crack on the main body near the hinge that's been there for about 6 months.  It hasn't gotten any worse, nor does it affect the phone in any way.  Mind you this phone has been dropped at least a dozen times, thrown clear across rooms, been used as a playtoy object with my guy friend and pretty much beaten up.  If timex were to have a phone, this one would be it.Although this phone doesn't have a camera, or bluetooth, it's awesome for what it is, a phone.  I took it to europe with me for 4 months and it worked in every country I visited.  You do have to call up T-mobile and tell them to set it up though, no biggie.  Plus it's frickin tiny!
