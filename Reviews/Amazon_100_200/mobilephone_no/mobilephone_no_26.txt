Terrific phone for business folks on the go.  All the connectivity and apps you need in one hand.  let me take that back.  you actually do need 2 hands for perfect performance.  That is the only thing I do miss.  But am willing to sacrifice due to the great display.  Was lost in Jersey last week, connected to internet, found directions and phone to the location, made the call and then was able to jot down notes.  Hopefully with Cingular trying to acquire ATT it will speed up the improvement of the GSM service coverage.  As you all know ATT is spotty, when the coverage is good it is good when it ain't it is horrible.  Would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to eliminate their PDA, synch with outlook, and access email/internet while on the go.Would have been 5 stars if ATT service was better.  But let's admit it, they all stink.
