I purchased this phone for my girlfriend for x-mas.  The previous reviews have gone into depth with the features and what is possible.From both of our experiences, S60, the phone's OS, does have a learning curve, but offers up more options than any previous phone we have owned.  This phone makes me want to get rid of my iPhone because of everything it does, let alone not have to pay to add on third party apps because everything works out of the box.The camera takes excellent pictures and does well in and outdoors.File transfers are easier on a Mac, but if you have Windows, do not fret as it is not too terribly difficult.  Nokia's website is extremely helpful for trouble shooting and learning how to make things work.If you are looking a new nokia phone, purchase this one.  It will not disappoint.Because of this phone, I am patiently waiting for the N97.
