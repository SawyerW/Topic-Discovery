Some other reviewers stated that they received a piece of paper in an envelope that had a PIN on it. I received the actual Tracfone card that was sent by priority mail in a padded envelope. We have a phone with double minutes and I found a promo code at tracfonereviewer for a bonus 250 minutes so we have another year of service with 1050 minutes for $7.50 a month. Can't beat it for the occasional user. A word of advise. Be very careful when checking out and review the charges carefully. I almost paid an extra $20.00 for shipping and handling because the wording is misleading. In the shipping options it listed "Standard 2 days" and "Expedited 1 - 3 days". I wasn't in a hurry so I selected Standard....WRONG!!!!!! That will cost you $20.00. Expedited is $4.99.
