This is just a GREAT phone. It really is a shame they don't make them anymore!!! Love that you can access the features easily--don't have to push all kinds of buttons to get things done. The camera is AWESOME--sharp pics from the 2mp camera! The phone is nice and compact and make well--the slider is not flimsy. If you can find one of these phones, get it! Warning: The only place to get one of these is online, find a seller located in the US--preferably a private seller. BE CAREFUL not to get an over stock model from China!!!!! They are virtually the same but you end up having internet set up problems and there are a few other features that are not the same.
