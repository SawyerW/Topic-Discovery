Let me preface this by saying: I am hard on my phones. I often drop them, or have them dropped on the floor by my 4-year old. I use my phone all of the time for telling the time while I'm working, and often use other features like texting, consulting the calendar, writing little notes to myself, or using the calculator. It holds a charge pretty well, usually goes for days without needing to charge. Uses more battery power if you text a lot especially. They say this phone can use the internet, I don't have the plan with internet, so I cannot attest to this. But, whenever I whip my phone out in front of my hipster friends, they all fawn over it and remember when they had a phone like this- "it was the BEST!" sleek, you can stick it in your shirt pocket or bra easily, is very reliable and best of all only cost $9.99 including free shipping! Really, just try to beat it.
