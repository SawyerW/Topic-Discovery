I recently bought the Nokia N85 Unlocked Smartphone and couldn't be more pleased with it. It has almost all of the same features as the slightly more expensive bigger, and older brother, the N95. The build quality was quite excellent. It felt hefty enough in my hands that it made it seem like a sturdy and substantial smartphone. Not too much so that it was a burden on my pocket or for leisure carrying. This item should satisfy most anyone looking for a new smartphone. It will also satisy most anyone who is looking for a multimedia rich smartphone too.Have fun with yours, you won't be disappointed.Vernon
