I too am glad to tell people about this phone.The Samsung Impression is probably the single worst phone I have EVER had. The first day I bought it I had to turn in off just to send a text message. And you have to wait about a minute after every time you turn it back on before it will even let you in the messaging menu. Sounds like not that big of a deal, right? Wrong. By the end I had to turn it off after just about every message I sent, to send another one. It is terrible. The touch screen works pretty well, but the keyboard is awful. The lag on the keyboard was terrible. This phone drove me CRAZY. Soooo bad. I would NEVER EVER EVER recommend this to someone. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS PHONE. Lol. Seriously. You will definitely regret it. Trust me, I've known like five people with this phone, and ALL of them had the exact same problem. And I got online when I still had it and there were pages, and pages, and pages of people complaining of the exact same problem.
