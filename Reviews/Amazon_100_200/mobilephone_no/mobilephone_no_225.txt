I have had my 8200 for a little more than a year, and generally I liked it, but after owning it for about 6 months, I started having problems keeping it charged.  The charge wouldn't hold at all, and the phone would say the charging was complete when it couldn't even power up.  I went to Sprint for help, but after three hours of diagnostic testing, the store manager gave it back to me and said there was nothing wrong with it!  She said I was to go buy a ANOTHER charger (to the tune of $50) and that would solve the problem.  It did for a while, but after another couple of months it is happening again.  I will be heading to the Sprint store this morning on the off chance that they will care.  I went last night, but I discovered when I got there that they now close at 6:00 pm instead of 8:00 pm.  Thanks for the  @*%#$!+ support, Sprint!
