I received it within three or four days. I was pleased with he product. There were no scratches or dents. I turned it on and it worked perfectly. There are lots you can do it. It has great battery life too. The only problem I had with it was after about 7 months of having it, the some of numbers on the key pad were not working very well. Also the camera is absolutely terrible, the zoom is horrific and terrible picture quality. Although it does have a great editing system for the photos.But other than that it was great. The only other thing I would recommend is that you buy a screen protectors and a case. This phone easily gets scratches and tiny dents. But that's probably just me being reckless. I would recommend this phone for anyone.
