The i730 is the best phone on the market with the features it has. Nextel is the best carrier i have ever had. I have never gone anywhere and not had service. In fact i have had service where verizon does not. As for the idiots who say nextel is not competitive in prices. i just bought two new contracts for christmas got the i730's for 175.00 each and got 1000 anytime minutes unlimited night and weekend, direct connect, long distance and roaming for 39.99 per month. There is no phone carrier that even comes close to this deal. All anyone has to do is figure out that you buy a new contract in december when the prices are the best. if you have existing service sign up for a new contrat on your existing account and then drop the old line of service. come on people this is not rocket science
