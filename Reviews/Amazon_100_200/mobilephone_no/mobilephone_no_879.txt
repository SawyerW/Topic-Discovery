I really enjoyed the phone when I first got it! It's great, it has a spacious keyboard which is great for texts and I really like the swivel screen. I would recommend the sidekick data plan because without it the phone isn't very fun (I don't have the data plan).The problems I had with the phone was that it's a little too big which is inconvenient at times, there's no touchscreen, and you can't customize the main screen with personal photos only the themes they give you. The phone is also a little outdated, it's a 2009 model so guaranteed it's going to be a little "old". In a world where smartphones dominate, this sidekick has no touch screen and is not thin and small enough to fit in a pocket. It's a little bulky. I wish I would've looked into the size of the phone first.For the price, this is an awesome phone but if you want a phone that will last a long time I suggest a newer phone or model.No problems otherwise with the phone itself, calls are fine and quality is good.
