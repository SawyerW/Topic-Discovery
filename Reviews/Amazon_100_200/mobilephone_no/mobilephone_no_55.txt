First of all, this is a great cell phone.The best of its features is its amazing battery life.  It can be on for at least 3 days without the battery dying.  Secondly, the interfaceis very user friendly and everything is a click away.  The compact size of the phone also is a plus.  It easily fits in my pocket, but i still know its there.There's only two minor problems.  The first, which is VERY minor is that the surface is not very smudge proof.  The second of the minor problems is that sometimes reception is lacking, probably AT&T's fault, but it does happen.Overall, a great cell phone that would satisify anyone.
