okay, I've had this phone for 6 months now though T-mobile.  Thank god I bought the warranty because I've gone throught 2 replacement phones and spent probably about 5 hours at the Tmobile store trying to get the bluetooth hooked up to my G4 ibook. Bluetooth was about 1/2 the speed of a dial-up phone connection.  A cool toy, but not really practical for surfing the web.  Granted, I do live in a basement apartment, but the only way I get reception inside is to stand right next to the window.  Also, I need to keep the phone locked at all times, because otherwise it starts calling random numbers in my phone book.  I'm counting down the months until I can get a new phone.
