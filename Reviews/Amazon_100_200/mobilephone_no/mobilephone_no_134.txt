No speed-dial preview on screen... No icons on phonebook list view... Long phone book initialization wait... No voice dial... Caller ID on front but no reject button outside (open to reject...so much for open to answer)... way too many keystrokes required to be considered user friendly as a phone. Samsung makes great phones for Sprint so it must be that the fools at T-Mobile need to stop marketing to the video game playing market and get serious about making a phone! My suggestion would be to look elsewhere if you want a serious phone. I am sorry I switched phones and carriers.
