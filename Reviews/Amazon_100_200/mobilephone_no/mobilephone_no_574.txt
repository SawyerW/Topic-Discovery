I purchased the Orange PEBL (unlocked). I absolutely love the phone and always receive compliments on it. However, after 6 months of usage the handset volume just quit. I can only use the phone in speaker mode. So, basically the phone is now a glorified walkie talkie. After some online investigation, this seems to be a problem with unlocked PEBL phones. Apparently the issue can be corrected by "reflashing the firmware". Great, if you're tech savvy and don't mind downloading suspicious software.Since the unlocked phones are not covered by warranty, I'd suggest just buying the phone through the carrier. It's worth it even if you have to pay more by not upgrading your plan. The amount you'd pay through the carrier would be about the same as buying it unlocked anyway.In fact, if you're a T-mobile subscriber, phones purchased through T-mobile are still covered under a 2-year warranty, even if you don't purchase a plan. Hope this helps.
