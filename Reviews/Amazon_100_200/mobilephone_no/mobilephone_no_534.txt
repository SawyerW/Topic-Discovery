Hi guys,  Nokia 6682 the best smartphone i have ever seen till now that too its nice to know that cingular the leading wireless provider is providing this piece. The voice clarity is awesome and the size i was said that is too big but nothin like that its reasonable size. Some find it large because its not a flip phone and due to this i feel it more comfortable. So i would recommend this piece as the best one to go if goin for cingular and now they r offering it for free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont forget to upgrade the memory card to 1Gb to enjoy the features to the max!
