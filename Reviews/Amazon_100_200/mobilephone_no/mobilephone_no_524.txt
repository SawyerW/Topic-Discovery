I bought this phone because I needed something that could be used as a phone and a pda in one and you can never go wrong with a Nokia. The sound was surprisingly good and the photos were crisp and clear. The video quality is not so great. The applications that come with this phone include real player, opera, adobe acrobat and a mobile version of office. For me however, the 64MB card is not big enough and I do plan on buying a larger one. At first I thought that the phone was too big but now I look at other phones and laugh at their tiny screens and they all seem so inadequate now!
