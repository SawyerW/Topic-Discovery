This is a great TV. Whenever I think of buying something that is technology related, I buy Sony. It is the only brand that I trust, and they have never failed me. This TV has great resolution, and provides great  sound. It has an easy to understand remote and a great picture as long as  it isn't coming from cable. If you are thinking of getting a big screen and  are currently a cable subscriber ask them if you will need a signal  booster.  Although if watching a video or DVD the picture is excellent,  clear as can be. Another thing is that it is light, which makes moving it  very easy.  Go for it!
