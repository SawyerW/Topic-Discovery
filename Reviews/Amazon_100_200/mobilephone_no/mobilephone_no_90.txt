I bought this phone and within the first couple of days, I wanted to return it!Pros: The features are nice, games loaded in memory and the radio/MP3 player, I love.  The phone is small and portable.  The keyboard is great if you are writing email or text messaging.Cons: The dialpad is too small to make phone calls (especially entering pin numbers for voice mail) practical.  I'm use to using my thumb to dial; now I have to pull the phone away and use both hands (one to steady the phone and the other to push the right button).  Don't think you can just enter your contacts in memory and you won't have to use the dial pad.  You will if you have voicemail.I sold the phone and got the Nokia N-Gage!
