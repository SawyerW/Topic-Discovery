I have had this phone for about 8 months now. I purchased it through amazon which was great and I've got all of my phones through amazon.The pros:Very nice screenRingtones sound nice and clearexternal screensmall sizeeasy to usecan store 1250 numbers including sim cardNow the cons:The battery dies very quickly after about 2 hours of talking its completely dead and it doesnt give you a wanring it just shuts offIt sometimes cuts offThe screen is sometimes slow to move from screen to screen (mainly with games)no speakerphoneno voice dialingThis is a good phone, if I were to buy a new phone I would only say to try and find one with a long lasting battery because thats what Im tryin to do now.
