This is a great smartphone. It doesn't cost that much and you receive a prety good smartphone. The only complain I have so far is the 2 MP camera, but it is ok for a phone. The wi-fi connectivity is very quick. It does not come with the micro-usb cable, but it cost about $2 in amazon (plus S&H;), so it does not represent a problem. It is a dual phone (GSM and 3G) and it has a very good reception. It has applications such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, etc. and they all work fine. It's easy to setup an email account and check your email on your phone. I think this is a very good deal. I recommend it very much.
