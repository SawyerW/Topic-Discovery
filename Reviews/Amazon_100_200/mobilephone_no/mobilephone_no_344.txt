After researching for about one year and constantly changing my mind, I found it. The perfect phone. It has everything I was looking for and left me wanting nothing. The camera quality is great, and changing the settings are super simple. The screen is absolutely beautiful with rich vibrant colors. Call Quality is top notch. Music player is easy to use and video playback is superb on the OLED screen. The OS took some getting used to but I haven't purchased a new phone in about 7 years. So much power in such a small package. I haven't had any problems or glitches since turning it on. I have always heard that Nokia made great products and now I am a believer.
