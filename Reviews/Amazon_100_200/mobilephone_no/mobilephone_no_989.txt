This product is everything it is advertised to be...covers all the Global frequencies and the U.S. 2G, 3G and 4G frequencies.  Internet is fast and multiple email access is simple to set up - work, yahoo and gmail.  8 Mpixel camera takes high quality pics and the video capability is simple and easy to use.  The touch screen got a little to get used to, not having had one, but it comes easily.  I would recommend this phone over all others...the phone works great too....not a pc company trying to figure out how to make a phone. I would recommend this to anyone trying to keep up with multiple email accounts and social media that travels Internationally.
