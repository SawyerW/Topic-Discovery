I do not like the phone because it only holds a charge for about 12 hours...If you use it it holds it for less time.  I ordered two of these and it happens with both.  I also tried replacing the phone and it happened with the new one as well.  The second problem occured when I signed up with Amazon for Nextel service. I was told by Nextel that I would not have a specific length of time I would have to keep my service.  They said this was special for Amazon customers...However when I tried to cancel the service I was told I had to stay in a contract for one year.  I NEVER signed or agreed to a contract however I am told I am being held to one.  I have been going around in circles with these two companies and nobody can get their act together...Love Nextel service but not when you use Amazon to get it...Try another plan or go directly through Nextel.
