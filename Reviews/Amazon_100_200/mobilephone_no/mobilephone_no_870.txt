Another lame product from Motorola. It looks ugly and does not look like a phone. It is more like a box. There are some issues that you MUST consider before you buy it. First, the charger that comes with it is for England not for US so make sure to contact customer service BEFORE you order it so they send you the American version. Second, Skype does not work with it, i.e you can hear the other side but they cannot hear you. Another lame issue is that whenever you touch the phone(accidentally) it starts either dialing or doing something weird. It does not have lock like iphone to unlock it. Also, you have to save your Wi-Fi connection if your SSID is hidden otherwise the connection will be dropped after some seconds. Motorola could make a better phone.
