[Note: my review is not about the seller but the device]I will not repeat every comment others made but I will say this: it works on the right frequency for high speed data if you DON'T live in the US. If you live in the US this phone is not for you. In addition (and possibly not coincidentally) this phone will eventually get into a mode where it will drain all the battery as it keeps talking to the network trying and failing to receive SMS. So you get no SMS and you soon (within hours) have a dead phone. I sent it in twice to Nokia (at my own expense) to get it fixed while it was under warranty but both times the problem re-appeared within days. Needless to say Nokia doesn't care - in fact their comment over the phone was that this device seems incompatible with my carrier! So much for US version. I wish someone had pointed all of this out when I bought the phone.
