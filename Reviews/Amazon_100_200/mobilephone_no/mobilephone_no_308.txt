I am a big fan of Nokia and the Symbian Operating System.  I currently use a Nokia E71x, which is a great phone, but had used a predecessor to the E65 in the past (Communicator) and really liked the various sliding / flipp open keyboards.  Honestly, this phone is a perfect size, seems sturdily built and really I wanted to love it (I love the looks).  However, where it totally fell apart was trying to set up Mail for Exchange to synchronize my e-mail.  On every other phone that i have set up M4E on, the process has taken literally seconds...on this phone I have spent the last week looking at support forums, trying various configurations, hard resetting the phone, all to no avail.  Finally I am giving up and sending this thing back to Amazon...again, the phone looks and feels fantastic, and if you are only going to use it for POP mail or SMS/MMS, I would recommend it.  However, with the problems I had trying to get it to access my M4E account, I would be wary.
