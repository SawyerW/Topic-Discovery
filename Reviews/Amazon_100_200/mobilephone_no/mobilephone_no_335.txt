I had this phone for 2.5 years and it's very decent. I dropped it a bunch of times and it kept working just fine. Battery life is great. Good call quality. The case is solid: metallic and feels good (unlike cheap plastic style in some other phones). One of a few flip smartphones on the market.Bad: (internal) power connector breaks overtime (had to be replaced twice). I also had to change the back cover of the case with time as it started sliding (but again, I did drop it a lot and generally sloppy user so..)It's outdated by now but so is the price. If one needs a cheap windows smartphone, this one is definitely a good option.
