Well, nobody is perfect. This samsung S5230 is not perfect either, has very well touch monitor (not sensitive); The body is light, good small size, good reception, good sound, good display, ok photo, allow MicroSD with a good size of memory, quad band and unlocked, well structured display interface and button placements, very responsive lock button, etc. etc... The battery life is terrible, between 24-30 hours with very light use, i.e. 3-4 calls a day of 2-5 minutes/each. However, with the price of $130s, compared to LG Vue, or even iPhone... I think I can live with that (I have iPod touch that is pretty similar to the iPhone, just w/o 3G, GPS and GSM capability). Not recommended for those who are traveling a lot, but good for those who stay stationary a lot The features are awesome.
