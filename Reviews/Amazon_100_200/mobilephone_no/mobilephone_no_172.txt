For the money, it is a decent product.  I had my 730 for about 10 months before the stop button on top fell off.  I had my 730 for about 11 months before Airplane mode switched on by itself fairly frequently.  I had my 730 for about 14 months before it started turning off by itself.  I guess by then I had had my money's worth.  You can't expect these phones to last forever.  Not with Nextel/Motorola pushing new technology so often.  They want quicker turnaround on their newest hardware, so they offer less reliable/durable products that need to be upgraded more often.  It is pretty blatant, but they are not the only company doing so and they will continue to get away with it because consumers will continue to buy sub-par technology to stay 'hip'.  I can't wait until they release a new Blackberry the size of a business card with a fully-functioning keyboard and the masses swarm to purchase it and use a magnifying glass and fingernails to send e-mails out on it like idiots. /end rantMy i90c was so much better, and lasted much longer.
