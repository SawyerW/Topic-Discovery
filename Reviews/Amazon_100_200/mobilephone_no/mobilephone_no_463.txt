I purchased my Tracfone from Amazon one year ago and love it! After having been a customer of the "big three" national services I would highly recommend this service to anyone that isn't a "heavy" cell phone user. A year has passed, so it's time to purchase another airtime card. So again I turned to Amazon. My purchase price was much less than anywhere I could shop locally, though I will admit $4.95 for mailing a piece of paper is a bit salty. But it was sent the same day as ordered. Received it in two days. The airtime and minutes were added to my account within two minutes of entering in the code numbers. It just doesn't get any better than that. Thank you.
