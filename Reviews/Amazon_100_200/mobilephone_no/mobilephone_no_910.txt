The Samsung Sunburst was the phone I'd been looking for after being unhappy with several others.  First off, it's compact and lightweight; fits in any pocket, and at just a tad over 3 ounces, it's not an annoying pocketful. The touch screen and software are very good, and the web browser actually does OK for the occasional lookup, although heavy web users will be disappointed. I wanted a QWERTY keyboard, but I didn't want the extra bulk of a slider.  The virtual keyboard works quite well, although it is rather easy to miss a key.  Again, not a big deal if you're not a heavy texter, like me.  Call quality is excellent.  Like all phones, the Sunburst is a compromise.  But if don't really need a smartphone and you're looking for good performance in a small package, this is the way to go.
