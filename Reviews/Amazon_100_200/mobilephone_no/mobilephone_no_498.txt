I've been the type of guy who doesn't change a thing until it is completely broken or beyond repair.  When i decide to change my mobile phone it was more for the need than for style :), so after viewing some of the available ones in the market i decided to go with Motorola again.  After a couple of months using the phone i have no complains, features are great, MotoID really works!!, sound quality is good as well as the noise reduction, just took a star from the rating because the battery life is just not there, i think we sometimes expect to have more time to play around with the phone without recharging.  Overall i can suggest you all this interesting gadget.
