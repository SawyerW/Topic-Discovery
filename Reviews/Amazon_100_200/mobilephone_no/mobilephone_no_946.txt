I have this phone on a plan with Verizon. It looks good and works fine. But there is a big drawback with it.The power consumption is too high so as the battery drains so fast. You might need to re-charge it twice a day. Talk time is the crazy thing, and after less than half an hour, a fully charged battery would drain completely... I took it to a Verizon store in Charlotte. They tested and confirmed that the battery is OK. So the problem must be with the phone.I never recommend this phone to anybody. This will rive you crazy. It happened to me that some important times that I needed the connection, or was waiting for a call, the phone just died and I was totally disappointed. Even my friends are sometimes angry with me that I am not charging it. But I do charge every day...PLEASE don't buy it or you will experience the same unhappy time I did.
