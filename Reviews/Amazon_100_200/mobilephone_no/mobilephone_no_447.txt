First time I've added airtime to my phone. This card worked great. Went onto tracfone website and added card code plus 200 min bonus code, and it showed up on my phone almost instantaneously. I have triple min for life on my phone, and this 400 card plus bonus 200 came out at 1400 min with no problem. Card arrived 2 days after I ordered it. Very pleased with this purchase.* 11/2012 : Just purchased and used this card for the second time. Again, easy as eating candy. Went on tracfone website, got code for 250 bonus minutes, then used the tab to add airtime with my own purchased card. With my triple min phone, in less than 5 seconds I received a notification on my phone that 1450 min and one year was added.
