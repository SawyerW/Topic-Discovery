I have Tracfone and I'm very pleased with their service. I don't use my phone every day but it is a great way of saving on paying monthly from the other major carriers in the business. I had one of the major cell phone carriers and was paying about $50 a month and when my cell phone died I needed a new one but had to wait a few months before I was eligible for another phone. At Tracfone if your phone dies all you do is get another one. Every three months or so including this car for the new phone I'm getting it will not cost a lot for using this service. It is a great product that I would recommend to others.
