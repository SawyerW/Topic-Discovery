the Sanyo PM-8200 is a powerful business tool.  You can surf the web for map quest directions, collect your email, view your IP cameras and basically just about anything else you would do with your laptop.The camera on this phone is excellent, it has three resolution settings and even a digital zoom feature. I am an electrical contractor in Atlanta, Georgia.  All of our electricains in the field have these phones, should one of them have a question they simply take a photo and either email it to me at our office or send it to my phone.  We also use the camera feature for estimating.The "Ready Link"(Radio)feature, much like that of Nextel's "Direct Connect", is outstanding, however, unlike Nextel, you will be hard pressed to find yourself without signal.  Sprint's coverage in Atlanta is excellent. I rarely drop a call.The Sanyo PM-8200 is by far the best cell phone/tool our company has ever provided for its employees and Sprint is a very customer service minded company.  I would reccomend this phone and Sprint to anyone considering changing cell providers and/or upgrading equipment.
