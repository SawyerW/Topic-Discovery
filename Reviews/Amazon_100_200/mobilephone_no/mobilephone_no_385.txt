I had recently upgraded to the Nokia E71x via AT&T.; Per AT&T;, the $10.00 Media Basic Plan I had from Jump Street was not qualified with the phone and I was required to purchase separate Data & Message plans. Heck NO, said I. I returned the phone and fought for days to have AT&T; reactivate my Media Basic Plan since they canceled it during the activation of the E71x. I then saw the NOKIA E63 advertised at an unbelievable price...yup, I jump on it. Well, the phone was delivered and I am just freaking happy I purchased the E63. This phone is DYNOMITE and awsome as the other reviewer says. This phone came with applications that the guys at AT&T; though was unimportant. Sure there is no GPS included, the cam is 2.0. So what! Big deal. The pictures are reasonably good. Look, I have several digi cameras. There is no love lost for not getting the E71x. In fact, I think i'll wait to get the E72 within the next 18 months or so. I'm sure the price will drop then. For now, E63 rules!
