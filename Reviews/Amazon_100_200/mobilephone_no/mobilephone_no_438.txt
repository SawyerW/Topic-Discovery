Ordered another year of service from this seller and got an envelop with the serial key just a couple days later.  I popped that code in online and added a bonus code I found off the net that got not only got me triple minutes for the phone but another 250 bonus minutes and the phone is now got another year of service.  That comes to under 7 bucks a month.  Literally less than 30 seconds after submitting the code online, the phone was reprovisioned.  Short of living off tax payer entitlements for a free phone, this is probably one of the best deals per minute for a private citizen who wants to be self-reliant.
