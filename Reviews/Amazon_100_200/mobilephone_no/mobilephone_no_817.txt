I like this phone. I never liked touch screen phones and this phone seems to have the same issue of poor responsiveness as other nokia phones. I mean, unless your screen is PERFECTLY clean it won't work 100%. Also, you can't access your apps unless you login to your ovi account which is inconvenient, or maybe I just can't figure it out...I don't know. I like the wi-fi, never tried the gps, the music player is great, couldn't open attachments in my gmail with this phone. Not much of tv app variety, I have been watching al-jazeerah news tho they broadcast a lot of news you will never hear on american tv. I haven't even figured out 25% of this phone yet but I already like it.
