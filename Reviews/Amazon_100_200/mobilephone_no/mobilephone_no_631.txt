Shame on this seller for selling a shoddy product. It came fast, yes, but it didn't work. She protected herself by selling it "as is" and now she's $25 richer off of someone who was expecting a product that worked. The phone came and all it was was a white screen... didn't even turn on. Completely inoperable. Not only this, but she packaged it poorly in just an envelope with no padding or protection. When we tried to return it, she refused to accept the return, again noting that the product was "as is"... but why is sheSamsung SGH-T429 Slider Cell phone selling a phone that doesn't work? Are you kidding me? That is out right wrong.This seller is a scam and I feel dirty having done business with her. DO NOT BUY HER PRODUCTS, you won't know if what you get works and she's protected by saying "AS IS"Shame on her for taking advantage of people.
