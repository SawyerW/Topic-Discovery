I use the one year service on my tracfone.  I like to have an extra phone to use for emergencies and the tracfone service is perfect.  It is cheap and so easy to add to the phone.  The seller was excellent, I ordered the one year service card on Sunday and it was delivered the next Wednesday.  Very simple to add the airtime to my phone, just type in the 15 digit number, press ok and within seconds the minutes have been added to the phone.  Also, any minutes that the phone has left over are added to the new minutes.  Love it!!  Couldn't be easier.
