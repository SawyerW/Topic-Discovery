The good:(1) Awesome Speakerphone.(2) Bright display.(3) GPS enabled.(4) Thinner and lighter than any previous Nextel I've seen.The bad:(1) No bluetooth.(2) Only 3 polyphonic ringtones are included.(3) Only 3 wallpapers are included.(4) No games included, only demos.(5) No Alarm Clock function. (What'd they just forget?)(5) No computer connection cable. They want $30 for this cable -- Should be a $5 item! (No, should be included!)(6) No data services at all (no new ringtones, no text messages, no addressbook updating, etc) without an added monthly data fee.(7) That antennea on the corner still looks silly and snags my clothing...Given that most of us own Nextel phones for work, I can understand leaving out some of the fun features Nokia and Samsunginclude, but cutting all of the nice-to-haves on the top of the line phone seems, well, cheap, like the iDen service is design to bleed extra money from the customer.Bottom line: If you are Nextel loyal this phone *is* better than what you are carrying now. But, If you are considering picking up Nextel as a carrier, I'd pass, other carriers are more competitive on price and have a wider variety, and better phones.
