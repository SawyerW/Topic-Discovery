I've owned this phone for more than a year. It is bulky, slow-to-charge, prone to inadvertant changes in settings and finally, the keys are not easy to dial (number keys require very firm pressure, making one-hand dialing difficult). The sticky-key problem became so severe (no, it wasn't dropped in liquid)that I called Cingular while the phone was still in warranty. They sent another V400, which they claim was reconditioned. The replacement phone had no battery (you're supposed to keep the old one) and the face of the replacement was scratched and had clearly been abused. I kept the old phone and am switching service providers. Bad phone. bad service.
