I hope you read this before you buy - this phone looks pretty good but here's my problem - I have a custom MP3 text tone I like to use (George Takei saying "Oh myyy") come to find out, you can't change the text tone to anything other than the six preset beeps and bops they have programmed in! No way to do it, won't let you. Soooo sad!The menu is really At&T; heavy as well so if you're going to use this on a T-Mobile network be prepared for useless menu options and the loss of your old standby T-Mobile options.One last thing it feels really cheap in your hands. Not really worth the $50.
