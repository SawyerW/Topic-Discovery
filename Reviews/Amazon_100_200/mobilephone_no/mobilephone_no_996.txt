This is actually my 2nd review of this phone, so I will reiterate. It took me a few years to step up to the Android phone. I am 'old school', and didn't want to change. NOW, I am a fan. As I sit here listening to iHeart Radio on my Samsung Epic 4G Anroid SUPERPHONE,I truly cannot imagine how I got along before. I have transferred both my electronic libraries to my phone, so I can read where ever, when ever, even on line at the grocery or department store! I love my new phone, and might just be upgrading...in a year or two...to the iPhone. Maybe. Or maybe I'll just wait for an upgrade to the my Epic!
