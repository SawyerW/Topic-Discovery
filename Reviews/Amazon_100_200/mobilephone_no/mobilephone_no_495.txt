If you are a normal person, with normal needs I suppose they are adequate but  other wise,be very very careful. I called to establish  phoneservice  for my developmentally disabled son'. I told the operator that he was DD and even mentored her on how to  to help a separate DD adult obtain services. She knew he lived with a caretaker and that I wanted his billing to be separate because I do a lot of traveling.Upoun returning from a trip,his caretaker had  never recieved a bill and the company wouldn't-talk to me about it because  I wasn't liste on the account.! I am Blind and wanted to resolve this quickly soI mailed them a copy of his Guardianshgip papers and a check for $200i9n order to resolve the immediate problem.I could tell they weren't sure it would be found and they were correcte ashamed 0t them selves His  caretaker did help him call me when it first was recieved. I am legally blind and a littleof hard of hearing but I could hEarhim, They SHOULD BE ASHAMED OT THEMMSELVES
