The PV300GR Is actually called the Sharp Jump which is exactly like the lx09 but updated os and it is way better then the normal PV300 (sk lx 2009) do to the fact IT CAN HAVE DATA by just changing the APN in the network settings. The regular PV300 (Sidekick LX 2009) could not do this it was stuck on the original sidekick setting. Anyways such a simple setup just pop in the sim card and  your good to go and just the thought of not having to buy a data plan and just have a text and talk phone Is AWESOME for people who don't care for the internet capabilities, Very satisfied with this product don't care that its a 3 year old phone its still way better then your basic flip phone.
