Where do I start?AT&T sucks.  From next to zero coverage to TERRIBLE customer service, you will hate this phone.  I have had to wait on hold longer than an hour every time I have called "customer care".  Half the time I call I am told that AT&T is unable to answer my call at this time.  When I am finally connected the staff on the other end is neither helpfull or curteous.  In fact, they are rude and useless.  They read their script very well, but it does nothing towards solving my problems.More than that.  The fine print will be sure to more than double your plan costs.My recomendation:Anyone but AT&T
