If I were to rate this for my personal use, I would give it 4 Stars.  Mostly because I'm not watching videos or multitasking on it.  So I knew what I was getting.  But for the regular user, here are the cons: interface is slow to respond to being "awaken".  I have to slide my fingers on the Efren a few time until it moves to the next screen.  Once it's up and running, then it's cool.  The screen is tiny. I don't mind it, but it's very small.  The physical keyboard (my favorite, since I've had a blackberry for the past 9 years) is crap. One press and it types two or three times that key. Then again, it's refurbished, and it might be just my unit.  Camera Is entry level, don't expect much from it.  Battery life is decent, but like I said, I'm not a heavy user.
