Cons: (Coz i am all about cons!)1) Bad reception, compared to Nokia 6010 (same service same place, E105 fails whereas Nokia goes on)2) Only one alarm (one daily and one one time)am used to 3 alarms or atleast a snooze option3) it takes too long (at least 3 key strokes) to change the ringer volume, plus it rings as you change it, (irritating)3) Bad ring tones to start with4) is not as easy to flip open with one hand as the other models5) well ... it does look a lil girlishpros: well .. just to be fair and defend myself here ..1) nice n light2) hides in your pocket3) overall great reception when outdoors or in the city
