I have had this phone for 3 years now I would never get another phone.  Over the time I have had this phone.  I have droped it... kicked it trying to pick it up.... and have ran the battery to dead several times all for it to recharge back in no time... I recommed the extra long battery for this phone I could go days before a recharge which was great for me.  But last week I left it in my pants and threw them in the wash all to find my poor little phone dying at the bottom of the washer.  I don't think many pones could even turn on after that abuse... but this one did... and well it doesn't work some part of the circut shorted and it just blinks now... but I just ordered another one and hope for it to be as good as the last one...David
