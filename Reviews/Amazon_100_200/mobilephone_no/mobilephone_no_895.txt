This phone is completely worth the money. It's stylish and the keyboard is easy to use and the raised buttons make it easy to text. the kick-out screen is one of the coolest and most convenient things I have see a phone do. One of the best things about the phone is how loud the speakers can get. the volume is incredible, most phones I have owned had very low volume setting and for this phone it goes above and beyond. The phone is slim, and the navigation is easy and simple. worth every penny.The only cons I have for the phone is that when using an AT&T; sim card the battery will not fit so I had to file part of the battery down to make the sim card fit with the battery; not to big of a problem, and the internet is unusable as far as AT&T; goes. Also the internal storage is limited but it is an older phone so I can't complain.Great Phone
