Please take my advice and stay away from Nextel and the Motorola i730 phone. It drops calls constantly (error 841), and direct connect is always marginal on transmission. Nextel says "it's motorola's fault". I had to send a brand new phone to motorola with no loaner. Get it back and it's still won't transmit right. Now my bill is jacked up from all the dropped call re-calls and they won't credit it. STAY AWAY FROM NEXTEL AND TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS MESSAGE. It's time consumers take a stand on the BS "contracts" of carriers. They are the number one contributer to bad credit hits.
