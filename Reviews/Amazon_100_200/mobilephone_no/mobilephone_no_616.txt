I don't believe that I'm being too picky when I say that if I am going to pay 400 dollars for a cell phone I would expect it to be problem free. I have had mine for about 8 months now and I am getting sick and tired of freeze ups, and the extremely poor battery life which especially in the middle of a conversation will not warn you before turning off. By the looks of how my phone is working 8 months into the contract, I'd doubt it will last my full 2 year contract. Be wary when you buy this phone and do your research.
