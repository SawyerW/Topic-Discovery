I chose this card so that my  minutes and year were taken care of and I do not have to buy them every month in order for my account to stay active.  I had priced the same card at Walmart and it was cheaper and on sale here.  My phone triples the minutes I purchase, so this is a very good deal for me.  I text most of the time which is cheaper than talking, so these minutes will last me a long time.  But in the event they run out  I can purchase more, but my year is already activated and I do not have to worry about my phone being deactivated for another whole year.
