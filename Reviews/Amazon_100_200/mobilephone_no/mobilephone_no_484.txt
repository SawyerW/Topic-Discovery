I just needed a phone for texting and this phone gets the job done well for the price. The only thing that got me was the fact that this phone only can use the paylo plans and I was bummed that it wouldn't do the texter's delight plan but it wasn't too big of a deal, just had to pay about 10 bucks extra. Phone is also super light! It felt like a barbie phone or something but I thought it was nice because I could easily shove it in my pocket or throw it in my purse. My purse already has too much crap in it so this phone was great because it didn't make it any heavier, hahaha.
