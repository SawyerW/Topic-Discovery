I bought this and its wonderful.Particularly good battery life and if you wear it on the underside of your wrist you can make calls without a headset and it looks like you are holding thin air while making a call.The touch screen is very good as is the music player and the interfaces.I recommend using it with At&t; and Google as they have a very good email to sms and sms to email gateway and brilliant SMS notification system and sms search system respectively.There are no data services on the device, No email, no game, no apps and no browser.It is very god for voice and the speaker phone is excellent. If you must use a headset then get a jawbone to go with it as the headset it comes with is very ordinary.Beware the charging cable though, its connectors are fragile and you only get one cable with a charging clip so if you break it then you are stuck (I have a soldering iron and ended up by passing the connectors because I could not get another clip anywhere.Overall it s brilliant!
