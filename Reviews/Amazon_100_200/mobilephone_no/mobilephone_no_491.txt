I bought this for my wife as she always wanted a "Dick Tracy" style phone!The LG watchphone is a really stylish looking watch with a cell phone and other apps built in.It is a fairly basic phone without a browser, so if you want to surf the net on your watch you need to look elsewhere.The watch face does display a basic digital readout continuously although it is very dim until you press one of the buttons on the side. The fancy watch faces are only accessible when you activate the phone which is a little disappointing, but it would seem necessary to conserve battery power.It is very easy to use with an intuitive interface, comfortable to wear and has good sound quality from the loudspeaker.One gripe I have is the lack of any Bluetooth device shipping with the GD910. LG could have designed a headset to compliment the watch considering the high asking price for this watchphone!Overall we really like this device as it suits my wife's needs perfectly, giving her a watch and phone/text capabilities without the bulk of a cell phone.
