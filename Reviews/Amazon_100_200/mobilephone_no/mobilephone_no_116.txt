This is a nice little phone with a good color screen but the IR port does not work with any device other than a computer running Windows XP or 2000.  You cannot pass info from another phone or from a handheld device into the E105 thru the irda port.  And you cannot sync your phone with Outlook or any other PIM you may use, you can only copy the information into Samsung's EasyGPRS program for downloading into your phone.  And the last problem I have with it is that each number is a seperate entry.  You cannot have more than one number associated with a person without creating a seperate entry for each number.Nice phone but the functionality is very old school.  It would be nice if they could have a modern software package with the modern phone.
