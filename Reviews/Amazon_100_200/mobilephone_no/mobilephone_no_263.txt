Just got this phone on Weds, as replacement for my old Nokia - I was looking for a phone that is reliable, easy to use, has texting capabilities, sleek, has a streamlined design, a loud alarm (I rely on my phone to wake me up), and takes clear pictures. This phone is compact, and performed well when I saw it at the Cingular store.BUT today, I experienced the worst battery life that a cell phone could have. After charging this phone to the max, I texted my friends, and talked for about 3 hours when the battery indicator showed that 1/4 of its capacity. Then, my phone died. Usually, I'd have at least 1 hour left to use the phone, with an indication of 1/4 battery. BUT NO! It just died, and luckily, I wasn't in a situation where I needed a phone (I was at home all day today). Everyday since I got this phone, I've had to charge it. Usually every 2 days I'd charge my old Nokia phone.I will be calling Cingular to ask for a replacement battery.
