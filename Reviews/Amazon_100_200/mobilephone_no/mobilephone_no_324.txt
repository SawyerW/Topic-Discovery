bought this phone as a present to my sister when i went to visit her in Jordan, 1st we discovered that it has no video camera!!u can only take photos not videos!!at 1st it was a little slow then after few days it start getting slower and slower and suddenly it jammed and turned off alone! because she lives in jordan she couldn't send it back to me to return it so she send it to a phones store to fix it and they told her that this is a very bad quality phone and they couldnt fix it!! i was sooo embarrassed from her and very disappointed because i payed alot of money to buy a worthless phone, i never wrote a review before in any product i bought but because i dont want any one else got cheated by this phone and lose their money im writing this one, just be careful and dont get fooled by the cheap price, pay a little bit more and get a much better quality
