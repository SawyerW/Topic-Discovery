I have always bought tracfone cards from amazon. They have the best price. When I opened my package I was surprised to see that the card was not in it but just a paper with a code to redeem my minutes. I was not too happy about this. What if I had bought this for a gift like I have done in the past. I expect the card!! It all worked out fine though. Thankfully I was able to get my minutes and the year without any trouble but my first thought was that I was ripped off. I think Amazon should make sure the sellers send the full card from now on, not just a piece of paper saying that you bought one.
