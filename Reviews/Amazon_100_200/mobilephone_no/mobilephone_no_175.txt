I busted mine up while biking and ordered a new one from Amazon, well it's been 5 days and it still hasn't even been shipped.  I'm discovering the hard way that Amazon doesn't really care about customer service as they have not answered any of my email inquiries as to where my phone is.  I receive items like cd's via USPS, so in other words they get left at my doorstep and stolen by the first dishonest person to walk by.  I wish there was an alternative to Amazon with the same selection but used more secure means of shipping.  Oh yeah, the i730 is the greatest phone for you Nextel users!
