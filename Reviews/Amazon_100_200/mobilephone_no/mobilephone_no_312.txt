i have no purchased this phone from this specific seller, but i know this phone is not worth 200 dollars. flip phones are outdated and this phone sold for about 25 dollars 3 months ago at walmart. the price this seller is charging is the original sale price when the phone was brand new. also, there is a problem with this phones design actually two (we went through 10 of them in under a year). first problem is, the inspectors who worked these phones kind of failed at their job. they let a bunch of phones pass that were defective. as such within one or two months of using the phone the earpiece/headset sound goes faint or stops working at all. the second issue is the display itself. over time the display actually begins to loose its color and the display when opened eventually fades to 8bit color and eventually simply black and white. the end result for the display is a phone with a pure white display because all other color has faded from it. at that point you can't read nothing on the screen.again this isn't a review on the seller, but the phone itself.
