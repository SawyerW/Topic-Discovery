I've been wanting one of these phones (or other similar models) ever since it came out. Since it was pretty expensive at the beginning, I waited, when I finally had it in my hands this Christmas I was not impressed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good phone--very fast at processing, duel sliding, well finished exterior, EXCELLENT camera (something I wish to have on my iPhone), and clear calls. But the software wasn't very intuitive, sometimes difficult to find certain functions. Buttons weren't all that easy to press on, wish can be charged by USB. If you are looking for a phone for basic features like MP3, take some pictures, and excellent reception with clear speakerphone, then this is for you, but then you probably could get something much cheaper or free from your carrier.
