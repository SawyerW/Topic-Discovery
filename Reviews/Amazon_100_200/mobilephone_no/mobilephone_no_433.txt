I purchased this card at $10 less than retail for 400 minutes and 1 year of service on our new Tracfone.  The phone is a Double-Minute phone, so the 400 minutes turned into 800 minutes after I entered the code, at no extra cost.  For 1 year, that is about $7 per month, at an average of 67 minutes of talk time per month.  Of course this is 800 minutes for the whole year.  Depends on how much you talk.* Tip:  Amazon has been out of stock on the LG flip phone, that was listed around $20.  So we bought it at our local Wal-Mart for only $15, that included the accessories package of travel charger, case, and ear phones.  And the phone is double minutes!  Good deal if you only use the phone when necessary (not for phone gabbers).
