Easy to set up voicemail and all of my contacts. Ingoing and outgoing calls are great... no problems. Texting is something you have to get use to though. The keys are pretty small for my stubby fingers. I only use this phone for talking/texting, not for internet. It doesn't have wifi... don't trust that picture. You have to pay for internet.pros: easy to set up, works with t-mobile sim cardcons: no wifi---Update (9/26/12)---After 4 months this little phone is still a great basic phone. Texting has gotten easier. My stubby fingers are becoming less of a problem. Incoming and outgoing calls are easier. Phone quality is great. I drop this phone every once in a while and it still works. I recommend this phone for anyone who uses texting and voice calls. Using the PAID internet service is a hassle. It takes a while for the screen to load-- plus it absorbs a lot of battery life if you use that feature. Just stick with your basics: texting and calling.note: wifi is not available with this phone.
