I had a Motorola i90 phone that went bad, so I upgraded to the the i730 and I wished I'd never done it. I don't know exactly what it is, but the quality of service is far worse on the i730 than the older i90. I didn't have service in a lot of areas that I had service before. So I finally got an i850, and believe me that phone is a whole lot better. The call quality is better, the service is better, and the battery life is a lot better. If you are thinking of getting a nextel phone, skip this one and go for the i850. You won't regret it.
