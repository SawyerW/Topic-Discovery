Let me just say this is my first touchscreen phone and i am not disapointed. I wanted a small phone with ok graphics, wifi, apps avalible and a qwerty keyboard. And i got it! The grapics are better than i expected, and the wifi is awesome. I have AT&T; smartlimits on my phone, so i can not use the internet when the wifi is off. I recomend when not using internet to turn off the wifi to save battery power, because it is true that it drains power fast. Texting is easy and surprisingly roomy. It does freeze every once and a while; just turn it off and back on. But of course, i use so many apps at once that im sure if you are a one app at a time sort of person, you will have no problem. To change the apperance of the overall graphics, get GoLauncher. Pandora, gmail, facebook and tumblr are great apps to use. This little phone is cute and has many covers to choose from. The android market is loaded with awesome apps. I recomend this phone!
