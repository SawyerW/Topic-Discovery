I am with t-mobile prepaid, and I don't have a data plan, but I am around wi-fi most of the time, so I bought this phone. I've been using palm products for years. This phone blew me away with functionality. The keyboard is amazing to type on. I connect with my international friends through skype on this phone for free, and I get my gmail and my instant messages from various im services (get yourself fring or nimbuzz and go to skype dot com to get native skype). I read twitter. I get to open my pdf lecture files and my college papers any time I want. I can get on most any website. I also love calendar and alarms on this device. The screen is small compared to my large screen palm, but I don't care, because the device is very slim, has unbelievable battery life and features full qwerty keyboard. I am taking all these over the large screen. I prefer this keyboard to touch input by far.
