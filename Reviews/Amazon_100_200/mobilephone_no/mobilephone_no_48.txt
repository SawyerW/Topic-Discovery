This is a sleek little phone. Wonderful to the touch - smooth finish. Almost too smooth, as it tends to slip out of your hand or pocket if you're not careful.  Camera is simple to use, photos look good if there is enough light. I have the bluetooth synched with my Lexus - makes the car my phone when I'm in the car, with the phone still in my pocket.With such a big screen in such a little phone, something had to give; that would be the size of the keys, which I have to press with my fingernails (I have big hands).The menus are easy and intuitive. Everything is easy to find. The color screen is really hard to see in daylight. In a room it's great, but look for a shady spot to read it outdoors.All in all, I'd buy it again, mostly for the way it feels and fits elegantly in my pocket.
