T616 - This is my second phone after motorala v60. I wished I sticked to motorola. I wanted a cool color phone with camera and all the latest technology. Thats how I got into this AT&T and amazon offer trap. I saw this phone is free and ordered it in Amazon. Amazon charged me $100 and said I can get my money back from AT&T if I sign the contract and send them the papers. The response I got from AT&T is that they don't have any offer like that. Now I am confused as who do I contact for this mess. Please think twice before deciding on any nice deals. especially Amazon on AT&T phones suck. The phone's reception is also too bad. I am paying $30 and above a month just to make calls while i am at my home or or at office (the reception is good only in these two places for me) I dont want to go for another phone as I am kinda used to this mess. If you wanna make ur life more frustrating, come join me.. buy a T616 from AT&T (at amazon)
