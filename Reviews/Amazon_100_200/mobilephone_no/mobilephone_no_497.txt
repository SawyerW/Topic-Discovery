I originally wrote a review on this company which was censored by amazon.  No foul language or anything of the sort. Just facts of poor buisness practices that this company practices in.  Like stating they sell one thing and yet receiving somthing altogether different.  These facts however were considered to scathing, regardless of it's truth.  This is unaccepptable as I have used this customer review system to decide on purchases in the past. Well Amazon censor this one and we have concluded any future transactions going forward. Reviews are in part to help your customers receive the best service and product, also to verify the legitamacy of the companies that represent you.  So show me what holds importance to you as a company.
