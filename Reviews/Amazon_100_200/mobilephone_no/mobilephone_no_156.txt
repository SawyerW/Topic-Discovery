I'm not sure if this phone will ever be available again as it is a bit dated - I've had mine for almost 2 years - but I had to write this after the experience I had this past weekend.Before leaving for a weekend out of town, I lost this phone.  I was in a hurry to leave, so I left without it.When I got home on Sunday, I searched the last place I'd had the phone - a soccer field on Thursday.  Amazingly, the phone was still there, lying on the wet ground. It had rained over the weekend and the phone was dead and very wet.  Well, after drying the phone out and charging it up, it now works fine!  Three days of rain, mud, and cold did not effect it at all. This phone is pretty much indestructible.  I guess it will be awhile before I get a new camera phone.
