There was no problem with the phone, except the CD wouldn't download. I wrote Teczilla customer service and told them the CD wouldn't download. I received a response that did not address my concern. I wrote them back and told them to actually take the time to read my e mail and address my concerns, and not make up a lot of extra needless words. Again, they responded with all kinds of verbiage that did not address the issue. I told them I would be sending the phone back, and NOT to write me back. Again, they didn't listen. I called Amazon, and as usual SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Let's just say I was very impressed and surprised on how Amazon dealt with Teczilla and mentioned to me that they could see I am a loyal customer of Amazon. I've had a Palm for 10 years and it is still working strong, and although everyone has a smart phone, I know how to work the Palm, and not interested in having any other phone. I simply wanted a back up Palm in case my phone would stop working.
