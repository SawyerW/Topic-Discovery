This Motorola is an older model, but arrived brand-new and in the factory packaging. I was looking for a low-cost replacement phone and this fit the bill.  I'm not crazy about the limited choices (3) for ringtones and "themes" for the display but I can live with them.The wallpapers offered are dark and somewhat obscure the info being displayed. The highgloss screen also makes it impossible to read in bright sunlight so using it in the car can be troublesome. On the positive side, sound quality is great, the case is sturdy and a nice size and it hasn't dropped any calls.
