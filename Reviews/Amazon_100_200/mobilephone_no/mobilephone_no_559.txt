If you're looking for a quality phone to make phone calls and send text messages with the flexibility of choosing the GSM provider of your choice, this is a good phone.If you want a phone that plays music and videos, go elsewhere.  The box only had the phone and a charger.  There was no USB cord for connecting to a computer to transfer media.  You have to buy the program Motorola Phone Tools for ~$50.00 in order to get music and other media onto the phone.  And the only input is a micro USB jack.  There is no 1/8" headphone jack.
