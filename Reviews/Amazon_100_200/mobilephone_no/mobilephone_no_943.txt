I purchased a brand new Nexus One direct from Amazon (July 2011).  It was brand new in its original packing.  Here is my review of this phone only. My shopping experience with Amazon was excellent.First the negatives:1.  The battery life sucks.  With manual sync of my emails and wi-fi on all the time lasts about 24 hrs or less. No other updates or playing any kind of games.  My Iphone 3 GS would last for full 2 days.2.  The ringer volume is really bad.  I could barely hear It.The positives:1.  It looks really nice and classy2.  Perfect size and fit and finish3.  It automatically upgraded to version 2.3.4 when I turned It on with a wi-fi connectionI returned the phone a few days ago back to Amazon.  The battery life was a concern but not a huge one.  But the ringer volume issue proved to much for me.
