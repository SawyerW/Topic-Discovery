This phones is perfect for any kids who want to look cool with  a phone but not really flashy. One that won't say, look i want to be the coolest kid here because that just causes more of being un cool. There is only a couple down sides. It scratches kind of easily and the games are not the best unless you want to pay more money to download them. Another thing is that you have to pay more money a month to text message!!! I would say now that i have a sprint you have easier text messaging and better games. Overall, in my top five for best phone (it is the third best on the list, I LOVE PICTURE PHONES MORE.
