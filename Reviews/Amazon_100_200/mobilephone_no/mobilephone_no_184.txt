I am a person who has gone through a lot of different cell phones through different servers.  I have never had a phone that sucked as much as the motorola v400.  I had this phone for 4 months before it started acting up.  My ear piece stopped working and I would constantly have to put people on speaker phone and expose my conversation to those around.  I called Cingular and they sent me the same phone.  Two months after having the phone guess what? Yeah the ear piece stopped working again. And then my speaker phone started to have a volume control problem. Sometimes it was loud and others it wasn't.  The buttons stopped working, and the screen would go blank.  I am guessing that this phone is a real piece of crap because I called Cingular and they are sending me a different motorola because this one has been discontinued.  I swear, I will never buy a motorola cell phone again!
