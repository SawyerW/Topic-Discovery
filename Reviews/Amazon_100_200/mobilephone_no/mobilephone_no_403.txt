This phone was OK but not great. The touch screen was not very smooth or sensitive. Another problem was when calling the 800 numbers. The screen gets locked when you call a number. Then you need to unlock the screen before responding to the prompts. The unlocking needed a button to be pressed on the side and then quickly press the keypad icon. If you are not quick enough, you may be too late to respond. It was a big hassle. (I-Phone doesn't have this problem). Then one day the screen's calibration was totally lost. You press somewhere and something else gets clicked. Some numbers got dialed without dialing them. Contacted the seller. They said there was no warranty even though it was within one year! Be careful of this! Very cheap quality. Lot of features but cheap quality. What will you do with the features if the phone itself doesn't work? Hundred dollars wasted. This is the second cell phone which stopped working and both were Samsung. Never buying another Samsung phone again.
