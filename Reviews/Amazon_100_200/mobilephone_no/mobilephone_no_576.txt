This item was not at all like it was described. I do not buy anything refurbished unless it is guaranteed "like new". This telephone looked like it really had been through the ringer. Furthermore it came with a little xeroxed pamphlet that left out a whole bunch of applications that the cell has, so I have to trial and error a lot of stuff. I would say rather than buy a used cell, pay the extra $50.00 and get a brand new one. Lastly, there is no way to insert a security lock on phone and previous owners "films" are still on the phone and I can't erase them.
