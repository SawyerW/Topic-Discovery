Bought this phone to use with TMobile To-Go prepaid SIM.  Could not get it registered with Moto Blur, which is required before doing anything else on the phone.  Cannot bypass this service, which copies all your contacts to a Motorola website.  Didn't have data network so went to wifi hotspot (2 separate occasions) to register.  Tried many times, had several calls to Motorola Customer Service trying to resolve issue.  Phone would not register to Moto Blur:  different error messages, main one was Motor Blur Service not currently available.  Phone was useless without it, had to return.In addition this phone doesn't work like normal android, does not have the usual buttons to access phone settings.  Everything but wifi is locked out until you register with Moto Blur.
