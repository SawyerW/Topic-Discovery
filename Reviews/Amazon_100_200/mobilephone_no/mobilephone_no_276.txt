When I purchased the Nokia 6555b five days ago, the salesman recommended it based on my criteria that the phone have strong reception. When I buy a phone, I'm looking for...well...a phone. I don't need internet or an MP3 player.  This phone is a beautiful phone (I had the black and red version) and will slip into even a small pocket.  After purchasing the phone, I looked up the reviews.  You've probably read them....kind of disappointing and even scary. A battery charge lasted two days for me.  (Turning it on at 7:00 a.m.; off at 6:00 p.m.; with about 50 minutes of talk time/day)  I decided to take the phone back since 2 years is a long time to have a phone that begins with disappointing features.  The AT&T; service rep. took back the phone with no questions asked. Before I told the rep I was continuing with the service, she even asked if I wanted to cancel the 2-year contract. It was a pleasant exchange for a different model. I was in and out within 25 minutes.  I give AT&T; customer service 5 stars.
