Before purchasing this phone I read most of the reviews and decided it was worth getting it. I don't have any type of data plan so I particularly like the fact that the phone asks you every time what network you want to connect; it allows me to save by not connecting by mistake to my phone network. To save battery life I changed the settings so it's not scanning for wireless networks all the time, and set the phone network to GSM, it lasts me four days. Also, there are lots of free apps out there, just do some research.
