I needed a phone.  I have never owned a nokia before.  I have owned mororolas, which I have been very happy with, and a blackberry.  I thought that this phone was reasonably priced for what it said it could do.  I am disappointed with the phone.  My contacts would not come over with the sim card.  I had to use the bluetooth device and send them over individually manually.  Next, I am not into the games and synchronisation of my outlook or anything like that, but I do not find the screen userfriendly.  The phone's navigation is a nightmare and after four days' trial with the phone I still cannot get it 'personalised'.  I cannot get my home screen to display the icons that I would like it to. I was able to navigate the blackberry and motorola easily without the manual.  The motorola phone I have is still working even though the phone fell and the back came loose.In summary, I prefer the Blackberry or motorola for e-mail retrieval and synchronisation of outlook.
