I have had the phone for about 9 months and have no complaints.  Its not a smartphone but I really don't want one.  I don't want to surf the internet on a 3 inch screen for a couple of hours.  I want to quickly check the weather or a movie time.  I want clear calls and above average pictures.  This phone delivers on all counts. Plus its kinda cool that it was used in James Bond movie.  Call me old fashioned but I plan on keeping this phone for at least 2 more years.  Then.....maybe a smartphone.. will have to see.
