i ordered the phone few days ago and it arrived today.  initially i was so excited that i got the package so fast even though i took advantage of using the free shipping.  but soon:my excitement turned into suspicion, then surprise and finally angry:  (suspicion)  the box felted a bit light  (surprise)  the seal on the box was broken  (ANGRY)  NO PHONE INSIDE THE BOX!!!it has the manual and the wall charger but the phone.  this is ridiculous, not even the April Fools' day yet!i contacted Amazon immediately and another phone is on its way to my door.  i have purchased countless items from Amazon, new or used, but NEVER received empty box.  i appreciate Amazon's effort in resolving this problem quickly, but still it looks Amazon is getting too comfortable being the #1 e-retailer for too long, WAKE UP, AMAZON.COM!
