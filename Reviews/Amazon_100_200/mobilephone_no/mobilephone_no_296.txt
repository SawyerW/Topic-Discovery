I ordered this Phone because I have really good experiences with Motorola Phones before. This Phone surprised me because the body kit was already loose and it looked cheap.By that I mean that I knew that the phone won't last long and it didn't. The second thing I noticed was that the phone wouldn't charge with the charger. The only way I could charge it was with an USB cable.After 1 month the Motorola sign at the top of the phone came off too.  I also had problems hearing the caller,the call sounded muffled.I don't know if this model of phone has these problems in general or if I have been sold a bad phone. All I know is that I am very disappointed
