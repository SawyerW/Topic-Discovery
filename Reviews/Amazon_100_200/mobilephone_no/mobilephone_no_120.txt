I have da this phone for 2 months now and it works fine.  Compared to the Nokia (Cingular) and Motorola i60 (Nextel) I had previously, this phone is a winner.  Voice clearity is great unless you are in a bad spot.  T-Mobile's network is not is broad as competitor's but in major cities and along Interstates the phone and service are great.  The functionality of the phone is also good.  People with bigger hands will have trouble operating with one hand due to its size.  You can download polyphonic as well as HiFi ringtones that sound very good and are loud.  One can assign ringtones to 10 different caller groups which is neat.  T-Zones requires some practice and adaptation time to set up alerts and personal settings but it is very helpful.(...)Enjoy!
