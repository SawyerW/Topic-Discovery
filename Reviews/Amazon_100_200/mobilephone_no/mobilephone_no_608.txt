Had the impression this product was new, paid more for the phone to assure it was new and in quality condition.  The back cover appears to be a different color silver, the hinge on flip is so loose afraid to use for will break and the phone appears to be made in 1999 and I currently have a razor phone produced in 2004 and has newer options this one does not.  Also appears to have a nick on bottom of phone. What a waste of my time and my money I work extremely hard for. I have purchased razor phones from Amazon before and was very pleased, so was highly disappointed.
