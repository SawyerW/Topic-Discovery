I've had the phone for almost a year, and it's not bad at all.  The camera works well, and all the features are great.  However, my biggest complaint (and why I'm in the market for a new phone) is the volume!  The volume of the ringwer (even on loud) and especailly the volume of the speaker during the calls is HORRIBLE.  It's really hard to hear people you're speaking to and hearing incoming calls.  The speaker phone works wonders for this..except calls you don't want broadcast to everyone, and you can't connect the speaker until after the call's been connected.  So overall not a bad phone, but I've gotten to the point where I can't deal with it.  Hope this helped.
