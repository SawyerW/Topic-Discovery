I've had this phone for a week and am not disappointed.It is easy to use for a smart phone and quick to learn.Others had reviewed the e63 as a little tough to navigate but  no problems at all.Not being a tech person has not stopped my enjoyment of this phone.The battery life is amazing and quality feel of it's construction is a nice change from the others I looked at and tried.By the way the camera is an o.k. piece,hey if you wanted to be a paparazzi buy a d-slr.Now only if Nokia made a car.....hmmmm....UPDATE..I've had this phone for 2 months now and it only gets better.If my carrier's network was better it would be perfect.The wi-fi is faster and better than my carriers ability.Forget getting what everybody else has and get a phone that kicks butt.
