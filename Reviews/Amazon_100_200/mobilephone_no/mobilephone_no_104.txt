I've had this phone for a week now, and I have yet to have a single problem with it.  It comes with just the basic features (color screen, polyphonic rings, etc.) without all the frills of some phones (cameras, video recorders, radios, etc.)  This phone is great for someone who wants to upgrade from that old green screen to something a little nicer but doesn't want to be out a fourtune on a phone with features that you have to spend a fortune to even use (picture messaging ring a bell?).  The games are nice, and the rings are loud and very audible.  The reception is great, and the price simply can't be beat.  I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone with a listening ear.....I'm already trying to spread the word and get more of my friends updated into the 21st century.
