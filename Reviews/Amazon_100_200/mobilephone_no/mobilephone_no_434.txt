This was a first for me; ordering something through Amazon from another seller.  There was some confusion, as the Seller's name on the order page was "Card Art", and the Seller's name on the confirmation was "Veronica Tablet."  A call to customer service gave me assurance that everything was fine, although the explanation seemed a bit nebulous.Ordered: 02-27-11.New credit card supplied: 02-28-11.  (The system wouldn't accept my 'one use' credit card number the first time.)Shipped: 03-03-11.Received: 03-08-11.I don't know how they were able to sell a Tracfone 1 Year of Service & 400 Minutes card at such a discount, and I was skeptical until I activated the card, but everything was fine.  The card was well packaged, including a card from the seller providing a direct e-mail in case there were any issues.This was a GREAT deal!
