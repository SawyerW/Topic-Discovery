I bought an unlocked refurbished Iphone because I will be using it overseas and I wanted something almost as good as new but without the pricetage.  For the most part, this phone has worked well but has a slightly faulty SIM chip insert.  At times I will get a no SIM card installed reading.  This usually corrects itself, but it is annoying because it has led to some missed calls and if I ever needed to make a call urgently and ran in to this problem, then it really would be a problem!Bottom line, you're probably better off going with a new phone.  If you want to save some money and are prepared for a truly used product, then better to go with a used phone vice a refurbished one, which is still pretty pricey.
