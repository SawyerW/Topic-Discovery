The i95cl brings phones to a new level. It has so many ways to personalize the phone for yourself. It is ideal for people who want a serious phone that is very productive and avoids the frills of other phones. I have used many phones and this one has the best reception hands down. There is plenty of room for Java-apps and ringtones to personalize the phone. It is a little larger then alot of cell phones, but not unbearable. Compare it to buying a different phone and a different walkie-talkie and then carry both of those in your pocket. Overall, great phone...there is plenty to keep you intereted as you personalize the phone for yourself.
