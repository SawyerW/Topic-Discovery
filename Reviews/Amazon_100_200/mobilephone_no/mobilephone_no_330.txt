Phone was received on time but did not function right it freezes most of the time and the charge did not work and when I contacted the company they told me to sent it back less 20% restocking fee. But I told them I should not be charged because they sent me a malfunctioning product and I complained to Amazon then they came back to me and said that phone did not have their inventory sticker. I had to talk to their customer service and they agreed on the full refund but they still insist on not recognizing the inventory sticker and that got me mad and felt indirectly accusing me in wrong doing so I demand to talk to the owner which was very nice and apologetic, she promised things like this will never happen again in the future. It was such a bad experience and waist of time and lack of professionalism from their part. I would not recommend buying product from PUT Group USA.
