This phone was recommended to me by friends.  I travel to Europe and the Caribbean and really felt the need for a worldwide phone.  This one really fills the bill.  Set up is easy and it works everywhere that I need it.  The company has a good reputation and I feel confident that all will be well.  I'm not the kind of person who needs all the "bells and whistles" on their phone.  I need to make and receive calls, period.  So this is more than adequate for my purposes.  What really surprised me was how fast the shipping turned out to be.  Using regular FedEx shipping I had the phone in a day.  That's great!The ease of use is great for a non-technophile like me.  I really like that you pay only for what you use.  You're not saddled to a monthly plan that you feel compelled to use to get your money's worth.  All in all, I'm very satisfied with the product and look forward to a long association with the company.
