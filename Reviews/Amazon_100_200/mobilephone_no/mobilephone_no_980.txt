After being a user of Nokia E71, E52 and E72, i was looking for a replacement of my Nokia E72.This is a good option, since i tested a Motorola Milestone with Android to see if Milestone 2 could be a winner. And it didn't seduce me.So, i bought this Nokia E6, installed the Lotus Traveler PushMail client, Nokia own client with HTML support, and went to the road. :)- Excellent battery life!- Excellent quality of audio over bluetooth (i have an A2DP car stereo).- Awesome screen quality. Resolution could be challenging at first, but it's great with very good legibility.- The same excellent quality of audio in phone calls, and great signal reception.The only not so good point is the notification light... It's VERY weak... But, with Remind Me for Symbian i solved the problem.RegardsMac
