ive had this phone for almost a year and it was good at the time when there were only lower quality apps but now the phone cant handle the new apps the phone itself restarts at least twice a day and the home menue and back button does not work anymore when the phone is open. Also the right side of the screen does not respond anymore to touch. This phone just comes with to many bugs to deal with and although the phone looks nice it gets really slow really quick. the camera is really nice along with the keyboard though. this phone has made me not want a smart phone anymore i will definitly go back to simple phones for a while
