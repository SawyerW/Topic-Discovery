I needed a phone fast and thought I was getting a pretty good deal.  I do not think this phone was worth the price I paid for it ($70.44), I am using it and getting by, but I now feel I should have spent the extra money and bought a new one.I was somewhat disappointed for a number of reasons; 1)the phone has had water damage, 2) the battery also had water damage; 3)the charging cord that came with the phone is not the original cord, it works, but not as well as the original cord would; 4)and the screen was scratched as well as the casing.I will be more careful the next time I make a purchase.
