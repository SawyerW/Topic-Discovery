Phone works great for me, haven't experienced the constant hanging up etc that there have been complaints about. Also looking forward to the software update that is supposed to come out late August to make the phone even better. It is organized and built differently from iPhones or Androids, but it is a Symbian. Having not used those devices as primary for myself but just friends and family who had android/iphones I can say that I still like the N8 for what it is with symbian. Partly probably because I have been using Symbian phones for the past 5-6 years and the way they work is like second nature already. That said it would be something to get used to if, if you haven't used them before but once you do get used to it then you will find that it is a good phone.
