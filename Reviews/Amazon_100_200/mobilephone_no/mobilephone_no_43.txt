The phone itself is a 5-star. The user interface is easy to use. The screen is bright. Battery prolongs several days on one charge. It receives better signal.The customer service is pretty bad, though. In fact, my wife is talking to their customer service when I write this review and it's been 2.5 hours on the phone and 1.5 hours in the SprintPCS store, let alone the time to get to the store. It was the technical support department that shed light on the issue which was customer service department's responsibility. Probably you want to call technical support department instead of customer service department when you have issues.Overall, a great phone with poor customer service.
