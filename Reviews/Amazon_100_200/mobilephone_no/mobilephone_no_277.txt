Bought this from AT&T; store and noticed that the battery life is way too short. Even with very moderate use the battery runs out quickly. I have to charge it every night, as it dies quickly.This is my first Nokia. I liked its other features such as the buttons and ease of navigation menus and browsing in general. Voice is loud and clear. It has a good display, bright even in daylight. It is light and just small enough for a phone. Doesn't drop calls.Well, inspite of al the above positive aspects, I will not recommend this to a friend because of the low battery life.Thanks
