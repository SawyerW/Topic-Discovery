I got this replacing a samsung a460..and my faith in samsung has been made stronger...Almost the same functionality as the a460, with a lil bit more, and of course, a color screen added. Got wot i expected and am very happy with the phone. Ppl i spoke to said my voice comes across very clear...probably clearer than my earlier device. All in all, very happy with this buy. And forgot to mention the parameter, which was the USP for me - the weight. The thing comes at a mere 2.8 oz and thats real neat. Probably one of the lightest devices on show today. It doesnt come with a camera and all that jazz, but if you dont need those, very nice phone.CONS****It seems to have a few delays in operation. Sometimes very slow to respond to keys, and at times, the Phonebook tells me it is "Initialising", when I try to use, and keeps shwing that message fopr quite some time.
