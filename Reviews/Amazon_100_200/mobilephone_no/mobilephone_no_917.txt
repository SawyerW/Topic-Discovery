One of the phone in our contract was broken a few months before AT&T; contract was over. So we were looking for cheap unlocked phones. Finally we bought this phone just for few months. Unfortunately this was not good even for 3-4 months. Within weeks we had to order another unlocked phone. (We bought Xperia X8 which sucked but lasted for few months then we got iPhone4s).THE PROBLEM, with this phone is that the voice quality of the calls were not good. The voice was breaking. It wasn't the network because the other phone in our contract was fine and we live in the area where we have good reception.Giving it 2 stars, just to let others know that it is "working" phone. You can make calls, receive calls, set alarm etc. So if call quality is not of utmost importance for you then you can think of buying this because it's not that costly compared to other unlocked phones
