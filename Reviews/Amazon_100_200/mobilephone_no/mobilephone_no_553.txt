Well, It arrived in a timely matter, Faster than I anticipated, which is Outstanding and the 1 main reason why it's a 5 star so far. Put the battery in and it turns on, which is the other reason. The phone is for my Mom and I will update it after a month to report on how it holds up. So far I am happy, which is about all you can ask for.**Update**After getting to my Mom and putting in the T-Mobile Sim card, all is working well for right now. Works like a charm my Mom says and if Mom is happy then so am I. Will update again in Feb. Thanks...***Update*** 2-4-13Still working and call clarity is excellent. No complaints as of yet.
