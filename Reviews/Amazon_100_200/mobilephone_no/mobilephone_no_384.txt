This product has been great so far.  It has crashed only twice in the two months that I've had it so far.  Navigation is a bit annoying with the smaller screen but this only happens when the site does not have a mobile version.  I fell about from a 1.5 feet to the ground one day and it affected the sound on the touchpad a little but no further damages have been noted.  The keyboard has been my greatest liking of this product. Dislike the fact that the radio only works with headphones as I have wanted to put it on loudspeakers because it has great reception quality.All in all a good device.
