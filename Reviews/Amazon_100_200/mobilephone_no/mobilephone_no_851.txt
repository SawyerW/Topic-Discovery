I didn't liek the fact that everything in the Operating system (Android 2.2) is connected to AT&T.; In order to listen to the radio you need an AT&T; account. I don't know how to erase AT&T; from the cellphone. Some people told me to reinstall the operating system, but I was told that I was going to need an aunlock code from AT&T...;So if you are not going to use this cellphone with AT&T; it is better not to buy it...that's what I think. Sorry.The cellphone works very well. It flips the beybeard very well. The keys have a nice feeling in your fingers when you use them. If you use the touch QWERTY keyboard it is easy too.The cellphone works very well with Social networks, WIFI, etc.
