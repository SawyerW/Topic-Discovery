The device was in great condition, but if you are an internet user, there is absolutely no ability to access the internet with this device because according to T-Mobile " any sidekick that was made before the most current one (Sidekick 4G) was on a different internet operating system called the sidekick system, but now for the Sidekick 4G it is operating on the Android Market and the Sidekick operating system no longer exists. Again it is a great device for the money, but has NO INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY!!!!! (BTW we are also paying $30 a month for data and they refuse to remove it from our phone plan.)
