I bought this a month back.  This phone is having pretty much everything you wanted including the MP3 player, camera, video, and lot more custom applications.Pros:- This is pretty good in all aspect and reception is great- Battery life is above average- Having all the features in it that you like to have- PC synchronization is very easy once you install the given software- Bigger display with 256K colorCons:- Somewhat bigger- Once the camera cover opens, it starts the camera application even when the keypad is locked.  Thank GOD after a while, the camera goes to standby (may prevent the rapid battery discharge a little)Over all it is great phone to have in the Nokia brand!
