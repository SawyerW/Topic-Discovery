Nokia-mania, I wanted a phone Blackberry-like, but from Nokia. A phone with Internet capability. A phone with dictionaries. A phone to make my office with (I was accustommed with the Nokia communicators with MS Office and so on). A phone with wide keyboard. A compact phone you can easily handle. A phone with GPS. And a phone which simply phones and eventually take pictures. Nokia E75 is all that. I have replaced the micro SD card by a microSDHC card (8GB): so I can even use my phone as a flash disk... My only question: why not a 5 megapixels camera? E75 is the phone for your various situations...
