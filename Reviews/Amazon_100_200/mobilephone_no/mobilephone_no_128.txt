this a great phone, i works very good and it has easy ( and I mean Easy) Menu. Also that it very lightwight sometimes i have to check my pockets to see if i have it. I got mine for my b-day and it is was free with a 100.00 off cupon from samsung and 50.00 becasue it was a one-year agreement. This is the best phone ever and also it is a great small, lightwieght phone that is under 200.00. T-Moblie also has great serive you can get 0.99 cent ringtones (so many to chose from) from T-Moblie's websire  coverage area i have never called T-Moblie about anything. But this phone has some drawbacks the buttons are to small for big people hands. That is the only bad thing about this phone. If you are interested about getting you should get this phone !!!!!!! trust me !!!!!!
