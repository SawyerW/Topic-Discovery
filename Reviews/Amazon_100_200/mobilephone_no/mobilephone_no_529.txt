I'm pretty disappointed in this phone. It's got poor battery life, and a complicated and buggy interface. It's also very large and bulky. Beyond that, the thing that annoys me most is that there doesn't seem to be any way to have it lock the keypad automatically after some idle period. The end result of that is that I forget to manually lock the keypad and it sits there beeping quietly in my pocket until the battery runs out or it calls a random person from my address book.Unless you want all the whiz-bang extra features for people with a data plan, I'd suggest sticking with a simpler phone that has a good battery life and basic phone features like keypad lock.
