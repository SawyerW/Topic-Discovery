I bought this phone online from AT&T which was a BIG mistake. I had questions about a few things before the phone is shipped and I was put onhold for 3 hours! I tried several days calling their customer support and was put onhold for hours every time. When I did get to a person, I would be given many other phone #s to try and I ended up running in circles for nothing. So, I decided that I don't want to deal with this and just return the phone. It took me yet another few hours of calling before I can finally get the return label shipped to me!! The experience is horrific and I will NEVER buy anything from AT&T online.
