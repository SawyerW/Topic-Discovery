I've owned this phone for several months now, and I really have no complaints. I know there are camera phones out there, and phones with better graphics that are thinner, but none of them have the great service that Nextel offers. I've tried all the major providers that are available here and they just don't compare. There are so many ways you can personalize this phone. But one of the relatively few drawbacks is that you can't assign a ringtone to certain people. Although you can with the new phones that just came out. But overall, this is a great phone with many features and you can add ringtones, wallpapers, java programs... I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a bit bulky, and you are limited compared to the newer phones out there. But you really can't go wrong with the i95cl.
