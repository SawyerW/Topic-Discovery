This is my first flip phone (with Cingular) and overall, it's pretty good. It's light and fits well in any pocket. However, the buttons (or software) don't respond quickly when pressed. My friend has an older Motorola flip phone and any time you pressed a button, it responded quickly. Not so with the V400. Sometimes it takes almost 2 full seconds before your button press gets a response. For example, to pull up the list of previously-called numbers, you press the SEND button once. That always takes over 1 second before the list is displayed. It gets annoying after a while. I'm still used to my old Nokia 3600 (?) model that responded the instant I hit any button.Also, it's annoying that you can't just turn on speakerphone prior to making a call. You have to wait for the call to be completed.Overall a good phone with tons of great features. I think they just packed far too many features into the software.
