Iam with Nextel on the third yrs now, and i have just buy another nextel phone for my BF who live in Ohio, and i am in Chicago, so i active the phone with nextel with 2 different area code but the phone still under my name only, but nextel never  told me if i do the direct connect with my bf is cost by each min if i dont paid $10 each month more for coast to coast,(then they told me the unlimte service is only local to local area) never never offer me the service until i see my first month bill over $450, so, please becareful with nextel service plan. (who ever work for nextel customer service, if u see your custom have 2 different area code under the same account, can u be more smarter to offer your custom with any other option plan?????? )
