The pricing on this phone is out of hand particularly if you are currently a Nextel customer.  As another reviewer indicated, Nextel is unfair to current subscribers.  While every other wireless company, will simply extend your contract and give you a great deal on a new phone, Nextel only provides a price break if you are a new customer (a $150 break no less.)  The phone is selling on eBay far beyond the price that even Nextel is charging with hundreds of people vying for the i730's at auction.  If I were a current Nextel subscriber, I would simply let my current contract run out and sign up elsewhere on the sheer basis of poor customer service.  Not to mention that they are not competitive with their minutes or pricing on their plans.  If I were a business owner, I would consider switching to a better service provider with better rates because it will always cost a fortune to upgrade the phones.  The company would be stuck with the same phones for the entire length of the contract, which would make the phones outdated and unuseful.
