I bought this phone for a month-long trip to Europe. Here in US it worked great with an ATT sim card, and in Europe I bough a Vodafone card. The charger my phone came with is intended for European system, in US one needs an adapter.The phone was quite convenient, once I landed in Detroit I just replaced the Vodafone sim with the ATT sim.This handset is really sturdy and, if the port cover is in its place, waterproof ( I can vouch for that...). Setup is not a problem, the menus are simple and intuitive (wherever other people might say). There's an embedded led that serves as a flashlight, and it functional not just and added gimmick. But first you have to unlock the phone to use it, which prevent accidental battery discharge.I would recommend this handset to anyone who needs a sturdy and functional basic phone for international travel.
