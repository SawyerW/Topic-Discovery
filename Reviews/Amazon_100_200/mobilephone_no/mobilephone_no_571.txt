I give this phone 5 stars...because it is so pretty!  I am a girly girl...so I love that Motorola has made a PINK one.  I dropped in once...and the front screen cracked.  I wasn't being very careful!  I am such a klutz.  I got a case for it so that it is protected in my cute little Louis Vuitton purse.  I really enjoy this phone because it is nice and compact...and has a big screen.  I recommend this phone for all the fashionistas out there.  If you are like the girls from Sex and the City...then this phone is for you.
