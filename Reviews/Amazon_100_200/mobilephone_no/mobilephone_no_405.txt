Pros: I like the size of this phone and the touch screen.  The battery life is good.Cons: Not easy to use.  I can't get any picture text, my little $10 phone allowed me to receive picture text.  When I make a call or someone calls me the phone automatically locks and I have to unlock it to put on speaker phone.  There are too many steps you must complete to get certain options ie: speaker phone.  If I call to get my messages I have to unlock the phone in order to get to the keyboard to delete my messages.  I hate that it automatically locks when I make or receive a call-HUGE hassle.I hate the widget side screen that pops up if I accidently touch it, I end up with all these icons on my screen that I don't want- another hassle to have get rid of them.Overall I'm not impressed with this phone, it is a pain to use.
