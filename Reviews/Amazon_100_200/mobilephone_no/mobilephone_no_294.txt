I purchase this phone for my wife, close to a year ago. She called me and stated she dropped her phone in the toilet (no folks, it was before use). I told her not to turn the phone on (too late). She had done the unthinkable. I just knew I would be coughing up a few hundred dollars. So, I told her to remove the battery, leave the cover off, attempt to gently dry what you can, lay the phone on it's back, wait 3-4 days and put it back together. People the phone works. All functions are a go! Samsung G600, I'll call on you anytime.
