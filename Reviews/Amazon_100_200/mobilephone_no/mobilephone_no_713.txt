I just bought one a week ago. The main motivation was the camera. I do have already an excellent digital camera, but it's something I don't always carry with me. I hope to get more pictures of ordinary life, not just holidays. The camera appeared to be quite decent, and fits well for the purpose. However I miss optical zoom a bit. As a whole the phone is better than I expected, especially after all the bad reviews I have read. The UI is not as responsive as in iPod (iPhone I do not have) but I manage well with it.
