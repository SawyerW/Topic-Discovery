When I decided to buy my very first phone I wanted to get the best one I could buy.  Looks and capabilities were a key factor in deciding which one.  I was about to get a samsung but at cingular they try to sell you nokias because they have better reception.  I picked the 3300 because it was an mp3 player, radio, cool design, and because I saw that alicia keys used one in one of her music videos.  I have had it since January and ir hasn't failed me yet.  One thing I would change is that they would sell holsters for it at cingular and interchangable plates.  Other than that I highly recommend it.  Put if you want something really small don't get it.
