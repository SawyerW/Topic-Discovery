The good: Texting with a real keypad is great. I also like that it is nearly impossible to accidentally "butt-dial" someone with this phone.The bad: Making calls and adding contacts is awkward and illogical. The ringer, when turned up to its maximum, is still very hard to hear. I miss calls ALL the time. As well, the noise to notify you when you receive a text is almost silent and doesn't repeat.update 5/10/2013- this phone has only gotten worse with time. it constantly malfunctions. recently, without any warning, it completely erased my entire address book. because it doesn't synch with your computer I was forced to manually re-enter every contact. so frustrating. often the alarm triggers but doesn't make a sound! Don't buy this phone. i have had $20 cheapies that performed better.
