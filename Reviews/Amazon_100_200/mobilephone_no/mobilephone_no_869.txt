I bought the phone from "The OEM Shop". The phone that I received was Motorola Flipout (MB511) branded by Orange (European service provider) WCDMA 900/2100 ("3G" bands) GSM 850/900/1800/1900 ("voice service" bands) HSDPA.AT&T; uses WCDMA 850/1900, and T-Mobile uses WCDMA 1700, so neither of these can be detected by the phone that I got. Hence, the phone works just fine with voice service (although I couldn't really get EDGE to work, but I didn't care much about that anyway), but it did NOT get 3G service.Different sellers may ship different phones, so don't be completely discouraged, but I would avoid "The OEM Shop". It seems like others have had great experience with their purchases.Unlike some phones, you cannot access the service menu on this phone by typing *#*#197328640#*#*, which in some cases allows you to activate additional bands.I found one possible solution, which involves flashing the phone and may or may not work. Just in case someone is tinkering around with this problem, here is the forum thread with some info.[...]The charger that came with the phone was for US and the phone in general worked just fine.
