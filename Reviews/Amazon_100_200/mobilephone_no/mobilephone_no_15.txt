first, this phone feels huge.  I carry it in my pocket every day, but I wish it was half as thick.  That said, I've had the phone for a little more than a year and it works perfectly.  I've dropped it several times, left it in a hot car, etc and never had a problem.  I did buy a second battery when I purchased the phone, and one of the two batteries died after about a year.  I just charge it every 36 hours or so and I've usually got plenty of power.  I use the Java apps, I use their browser, mostly to check movies, and I use it with a short cable to connect to my iPaq.  Everything works great.  But it still feels like a brick -- I heard a comedian say that cell phones are the only thing men will brag about theirs being smaller...
