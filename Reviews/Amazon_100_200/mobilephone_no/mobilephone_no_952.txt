The LG Shine II that I have is great!  I really like the sleek, all silver appearance!  And, it works well, but I wish that the highest keys on the keypad, the call, cancel, and end call keys, had more space between the sliding top of the phone because they are hard to press because of where they are located.  And, I wish the calendar had more room to write events (there is just a subject line).  But, otherwise, the phone is wonderful!  I really like the camera!  It takes clear pictures!  And, it is convenient that one can send the pictures to her computer by email!  Overall, great phone!
