We're not big cell phone users but do have phones in the car for emergencies and to quickly check if anything is needed while we're out, or to discuss plans for the evening.While there is still a cheaper way to have that emergency phone available, Tracfone is certainly one of the cheaper ways to have mobile communications available.  The coverage and dependability has been very good for me in my area, and only having to remember once a year to keep things rolling along is nice.Make sure to take advantage of any discounted pricing you can find.  The card works just as good as a full retail-priced one, and you can still enter promo codes for bonus minutes too.
