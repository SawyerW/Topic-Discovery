For future references for futures buyers. Please be advised that theres a huge difference between the PV300 and the PV300GR. The GR runs on a custom os system meaning that it no longer needs to run on danger servers. Thus allowing the apn settings to be changed and to be able to connect to 3g. I called blutek to inform them about the difference because I received the PV300 yet they dont even know what they're evening selling. They told me that sharp told them its the same phone. Be advised to not to buy the PV300 GR from blutekusa. This is just sad how stupid they are to not be able to know what they're even selling.
