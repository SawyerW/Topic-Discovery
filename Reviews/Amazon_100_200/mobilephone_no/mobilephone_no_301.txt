I received my new nokia sometime after the first of June '09. I was pleasantly surprised at the "perfect size" it was.  It worked right out of the box and all the features that I tried I was able to use with just common sense and on board instructions.  I have tried most of the features (e-mail, internet, maps, videos, etc.) and have not had a problem with anything.  The battery lasts me 3 days without recharging.  I owned a touch screen phone before this, and it great getting back to keys.  Just a soft touch and you know exactly what to expect as the keys are unambiguous.  This one is definitely a "keeper"!
