I brought this after using several Nokia's. The software and the ease of use is not as great as the Nokia's but boy this phone is just great. I switched from AT&T and the service in the Silicon Valley is just great. The best way to enter the telephone #'s is to use the pc and the web and xfer it to your phone. It beats the hell out of me as to why T-Mobile sends everything as a mobile #'s but there is a way you can change it by using the "Copy" command. I have tried it and it works.The biggest problem that I have is that the ring+vibrate don't work together. Other than a few minor issues, I love this phone, it is quite compact the sound is great (a little bit of static could be heard) and the T-Mobile service is great. People complain about this phone before actually getting used to the various ways of doing things. I wish Samsung makes it a little bit more logical and intutive. This phone not a bad idea at all.
