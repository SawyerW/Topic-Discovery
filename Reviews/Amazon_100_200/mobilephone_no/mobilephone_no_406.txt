I had this phone a little under a year.  It is not the best phone out there, or anywhere close to that.  It's rather boring and all it's good for is call, text, and listen to the radio. Yes, it plays radio and like someone else said, it plays it through the speaker (which is a decent quality).  When I first got it, I went through hell setting up the settings in order to send picture messages (like someone else said, it is an international phone).  The screen lags a lot, which eventually led to its downfall.  This happens a lot.  I would touch an option, and it wouldn't go so I would tap it again, and suddenly like it realized I'm doing something it registered both of the taps.  My phone finally crapped out and the left side of the touch screen no long response.  The calibration is off and I can't recalibrate it, so I just brought another phone. Overall, it's worth it if it's free (I got mine free with the upgrade), but I wouldn't shell out money for this crap.  It's an ok phone, but there's more bad points than good points.
