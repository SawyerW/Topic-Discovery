This phone is excellent. The camera takes top-notch stills (it's become the only camera I use regularly), the phone is responsive, and the keyboard is well laid out.At first, I didn't like the track pad button on the phone because I was used to using arrow keys, but the more I use it the more I like it. Coming from the Droid 3, the keyboard took some getting used to but now that I'm comfortable with it, typing is a pleasure.I wish the "Genius" button would have just been kept as a search button (which you can long-press on other Android phones to do voice commands). I also would have liked to see the power button and the headphone jack port switched since I'm right-handed and keep the phone in my left pocket, but other than that it's hard to find fault with this phone.
