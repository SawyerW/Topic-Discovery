DON'T buy this product! I had it for less than a year and and it pooped out on me. After the first couple months I took the SD card out to use it for something else and then put it back in the phone, and the phone ran slow ever since. Near the end of it's demise, I wasn't receiving text messages until after the person called me. You can only have 3 apps (for me it was Facbook, Twitter, and Angry Birds) before the memory is overloaded and none of the memory moves over to the SD card (trust me, I tried). So in conclusion, if you want to buy a smart phone, DO NOT buy this one.
