Lots of people here are complaining about the lack of MP3 ringtone.  What they don't realize is that the T616 can also play midi files, or more specifically General Midi music files.  You know all those midi songs that people used to put on their websites? Well you can use them all on you T616, and if you have a midi editor you can pick out the chunks of the songs you like.  This is great as GM .mid files are free and occupy a legal grey area as to copyright if a person creates one from scratch and then gives it away. So you can legally download just about any song or fragment of a song into the phone for free.  This is better than mp3 or aac in many ways.However the camera is the worst ever!!!!!!!!
