I have had the w580i for 1 year, 2 months now and I have enjoyed using the phone and most of its features.  However, during that time I have experienced several quality issues.  One of them (the ear speaker died) was probably isolated to my unit.  But I also had my keypad crack twice. The cracked keypad seems to be a common issue with this model, just search online about it.  I had to send in the phone twice for warranty repairs. Now, the left soft keys (select/back) have stopped working. Another search revealed this to also be a common flaw also.  My warranty has run out, so Sony Ericsson will not fix this.  Fortunately, there is a workaround by pushing hard on the area between the navigation keys and the LCD screen (where there is either the 'W' logo or the at&t; logo), then the keys will work.The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore. I give it 2-stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software/interface.
