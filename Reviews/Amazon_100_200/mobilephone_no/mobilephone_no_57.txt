I got this phone because it has Bluetooth and is compatible with iSync (the Mac OSX synchronizing software.) I wanted to have my calendar on my phone - the rest was gravy. So I plugged in my Bluetooth adapter, clicked on one control panel, it saw my phone and added it. I opened iSync, it saw my phone, I clicked on "Sync" and in less than 5 minutes TOTAL, with NO software to download/install, my calendar and contacts were on my phone. Done. No hassle. I love it! That's how technology should work!And, for the rest - I find it intuitive to use, nice and small, and it's fun to have the camera. That was all gravy but it's good gravy!
