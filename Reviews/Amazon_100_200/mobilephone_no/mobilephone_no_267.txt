The Backlight stays on for about 6 seconds without pushing any buttons.There is no setting to make it any longer.The battery was fully charged and the phone was off that first night I had it. That morning I turned it on and the battery showed one quarter  charge, I would have thought it would have held a full charge being off all night?  The reception is no better than any other phone.I took it back the next day. That is some ridiculous backlight problem to put up with. Cingular, AT&T; must be crazy even putting it on the shelf. This phone deserves no stars.
