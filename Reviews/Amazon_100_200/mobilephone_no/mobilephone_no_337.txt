New? It worked 2 days and died. 2 hours transferring data and tweaking the phone, now it dies and I can't even delete my personal info and I get the PRIVILEGE of paying for shipping broken garbage to me and back - That is if they will accept it since the original box got trashed. I think I will accept I got shafted for $55.00 and not spend another minute or dollar wasted with these thieves and file a complaint with paypal. Yea let me send back the phone with my data do I can then spend 20 hours cancelling my credit cards and BS.This is a damn windows SMART phone - NOT A FREAKING TOASTER!!!!!!!!!I am the idiot for trusting this BS, but not stupid enough to send my data on this phone to these thieves.Thanks Amazon - I'l get right on buying from you guys again . . . . . in my next life.
