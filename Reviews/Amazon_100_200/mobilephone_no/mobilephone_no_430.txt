I just purchased the Tracfone LG 420g (a great phone) after reading the reviews at Amazon. Now to buy the time and service, I looked for the right solution for my situation and chose the one year service with 400 minutes and am completely satisfied. With the phone I bought it gave me double minutes... that's 800 plus bonus of 200 and 20 minuets for free... 1020 minutes total. I won't know if I will need to buy more minutes until I run out but so far I am very happy with my choice. I did learn not to activate the voice mail... at least that's my opinion because advertisers can eat up your minuets and people who leave a message like "couldn't get you on your phone"... like you needed to hear that... right? Great purchase from Amazon.
