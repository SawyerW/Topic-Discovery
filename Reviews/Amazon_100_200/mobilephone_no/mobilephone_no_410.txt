This phone has given me nothing but trouble since I have had it. I think this is due to it being an international phone. Every time a get a voice mail it notifies me about 8 different times, and the new voice mail symbol won't go away. Then it proceeds to send me text messages with symbols. The camera is basically useless due to its horrible quality and bleaching of photos. The call quality is OK. The other features such as memos, and multiple alarms are great. One thing I also don't like is that the headphones are proprietary rather than a normal 3.5mm jack for a headset, which means you have to use their european head phones only. I do like that if you turn the phone you have a full QWERTY keyboard, but it's not worth the trouble with random text messages of symbols and constant things saying a voicemail when I don't.
