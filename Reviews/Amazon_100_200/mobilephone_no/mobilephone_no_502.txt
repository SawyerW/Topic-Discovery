I have just received my treo 600 from Amazon. Brilliant service and bang on time.I read the previous reviews and was concerned about buying this phone.However,I do believe that there were some bad phones around initially.... ( the treo 600 came out in 2002/3 if my memory serves me correctly). The phone you buy today is bug free ( well mine is??). This phone is the best I have ever purchased- and  is pretty easy to use. I had a treo 270 some time ago - but dropped it and it was not worth repairing.There is no comparison between the two- and I think the palm Os is better. The battery life is as stated, and it easily pulls in my GSM signal at the extremities of the cell range. So why all the bad reviews? Frankly, I dont know why.You dont need the 650 .But I must admit, that I never seem to get the lemons???
