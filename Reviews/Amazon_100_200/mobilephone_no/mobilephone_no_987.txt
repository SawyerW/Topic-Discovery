This phone is must-have if you are all up for Nokia. Especially if you are texting a lot! And also if you want to feel secure. I will not feel secure with iOS (iPhone) or Android or whatever crazy system what is doing nasty things on the background. Some people say Symbian is little difficult for use, but I had Nokia all my life and I am used to that. I think Symbian^3 is great.However phone has one serious hardware problem. It is notification light. It works, but you cannot see it. Problem is surface above notification light. It shades/hides notification light, so it could not be seen. Nokia will probably exchange this surface for free -- in Europe definitely, in USA I do not know.
