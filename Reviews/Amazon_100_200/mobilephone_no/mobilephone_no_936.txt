My only reservation in ordering the nexus one was due to the few reviews I had read that describe difficulties with getting the latest version of Android onto the phone.  I need not have worried as the update to Gingerbread was already downloading over the air almost as soon as I had switched on the phone.Delivery was preternaturally fast, and the phone works out of the box with my t-mobile prepaid sim.  I am able to order their pay as you go daily web pass for data usage via t-mobile's m.web2go.com/myaccount/ page on the phone's browser.I have tried out various smartphones and the nexus one seems to equal or exceed those phones' capabilities.  My impression is that the only problem that kept the original 'google phone' from becoming wildly popular was the high price for an unsubsidized, unlocked device.  The price now 18 months after the nexus one's launch is phenomenal, considering the phone you are getting for that price.
