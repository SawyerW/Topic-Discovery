After being bated my wife(moving from a Motorola L6) purchased this phone. Cool design,menus and features.The bad-- the battery life is a joke! I had better battery life from my 80's Motorola shoe phone. Phone gets very hot with little use. The battery life display moves faster than your minutes go by. On a full charge you might get 2 hours of normal use. And you will have to like charging it all the timeI have had good luck in the past with Nokia cell phones but they should be ashamed with this junk. I wish I had read other reviews here before letting my other half purchase this.Don't walk- but run (very fast) from this. I can guarantee you will not be happy.
