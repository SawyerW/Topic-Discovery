I am blown away by the phone's software - it is so easy to use and interface is very slick and nice. You can find a lot of indepth reviews for WP7 on the web.For the phone hardware, this is an excellent option, especially for US customers that do not want to be locked into a 2 year term.ProsPhone feels solid and well made.Keys at the bottom feel a little plasticky, but are much better than the capacitive-touch buttons on the Focus/HD7/Omnia etcSmooth update to the latest version via the PC zune softwareDecent camera16gb internal memoryConsNot compatible with US-based ATT/TMobile 3G network. It will still work and connect up to the Edge/2.5G network.Power button a little hard to reach if youre holding the phone with your left hand and trying to turn it on with the same hand.NoteManuals included in the box will be in some European language, but is easy to find online.
