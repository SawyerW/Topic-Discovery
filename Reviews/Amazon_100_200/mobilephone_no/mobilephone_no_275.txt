Hey for what it is-basic and dependable cell phone. Another durable, workhorse Nokia phone model that has some extra options with 3G and GSM and camera phone options I thought it was very good deal for the price here on Amazon.  I bought this as a replacement phone for another one I had just like this that got smashed and dropped in a river after 5-6 years of heavy usage. Cell reception is great, and unlocked it works all over the world.  Battery life is above average or good.  For a flip phone I liked it and this one from Amazon has been working well, no problems with it at all.  I would recommend buying this phone if they have more in stock, at these prices there probably will not be many left. Still going strong after 3 plus months of usage and no problems.
