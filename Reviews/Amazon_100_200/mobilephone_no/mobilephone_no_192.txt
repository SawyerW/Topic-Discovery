I bought this phone for full price and it works great. The camera takes good pictures and the ringtone quality is awesome, even mp3. I love the speakerphone but you can only get to speakerphone once a call has been connected. Also The phone is a bit on the large side, but the keys are great size and spaced out perfect. this has been rated one of the best phones for Cingulars GSM 850/1900 band network for its reception and call quality. The screen is also great but id like to see it have an external color LCD for photo caller id and as a photo viewfinder.
