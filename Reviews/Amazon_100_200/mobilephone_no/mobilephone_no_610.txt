People complaining about the phone being slow should install the latest ROM (or one from xda developers). It will also improve battery life.If you want a regular phone, just get a nokia and get out of here... If you want a PDA that is also a phone, get the diamond and have some fun! This is a device for those freaks like me who like to install lots os third-party apps and mess around with the system.Battery life, btw, is ok to me, just don't leave wifi, 3g, and etc on all the time (anyway, what's the point of having them on if you are not using??). Or just get an extended battery and your problems are solved (There is one very nice from HTC - 1350mAh, but cost around $70 - others exist, even with 2200 mAh, but they ruin phone appearance!!).Sorry for the bad english...
