Excellent, excellent phone!!Everything has worked just beautifully.  Easy to operate and configure (run into a little trouble with HSPA settings, but it turned out to be more a problem with some service provider settings than something wrong with the phone).Sound quality, as usual with SE phones, excellent.  As far as sound goes it is better then IPhone4 and waaaay better than any BB.Configuring DLNA with my PS3 and Bravia TV was really easy and works beatifully.Tons of apps available through Android Market.Swaps between HSPA and WIFI instantly when it connects to WIFI.Camera works well even in bad lighting conditions.Only downside found so far is that battery life is a little short (a day and a half in average)  but its something that you sort of expect with this kind of phone (I had similar battery life with an IPhone 4 and a BB).  I found a longer lasting battery that fits the phone on ebay.  Still waiting for it to arrive.  (I will update the review once I evaluate it)Quick shipping, well packed.Overall great service experience both from Amazon and JR.
