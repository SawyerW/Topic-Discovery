I make frequent purchases from Amazon and admittedly this is by far the worse purchasing decision I have ever made.  For starters, I expected a new phone since that is what I was told I was purchasing.  Instead I recieved a battered looking "re-conditioned" Vodaphone.  Secondly, though I have had it for over a month, I still don't know whether it even works, as the battery pack that came with it is useless/dead...and I certainly hope, that is the only problem and not the phone itself.It certainly wasn't worth the $159 paid.  I will never make another purchase from Tiger Mart...its also unfortunately that I had the phone shipped to Jamaica and thus am having a challenge making a return.  I hope I am still in the warranty period, as I will be in the US in a matter of weeks when I will be able to return and get back my hard earned cash.
