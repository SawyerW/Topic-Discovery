I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, and I can tell you that is awesome, my previus phone was a cingular 8125 (QTEK 9100) which is a very nice cellphone  too but not as cute as this one, the only thing that is missing in this unit is the Wi-Fi, everything else is fine, very fast, comes with Windows Mobile 6 Pro so you won't need an update, the camera is 1.3MP which is quite good too.Pros:-. Very small & light design-. Nice surface, very clean.-. Windows Mobile 6 Professional-. Voice Command enabled-. Do everything with one hand-. Includes vehicle & wall chargerCons:-. No Wi-Fi-. Comes without a case.I'm very happy with this phone and I would definitively recommend it.
