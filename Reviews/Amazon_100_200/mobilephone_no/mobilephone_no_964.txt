It just arrived today and it is still charging but I couldn't wait to get familiar with it.Pros: small, lightweight,keys stand up so you know when you hit them,easy enough to useLove that I didn't have to do a new contract! Have been unhitched so to speak for a while and I like having the option to switch carriers if a deal comes up that I can't refuse ;) love the price! Oh and there's a way to reject numbers of your choosing! It accepted my old SIM card and memory card, so even tho my old one died at least I didn't lose everything!Cons: cover is slippery  so I'm having to order a silicone case (the reviews for the rubberized one said it doesn't fit quite right) some things take a lot going though levels to get to them, but I'm sure I'll get proficient at it in time and use.Not very good ringtones but I love the piano alert for msg's! Some things should be simpler but...Very happy with my purchase and the wait for it to get here was worth it :)Would recommend this phone!
