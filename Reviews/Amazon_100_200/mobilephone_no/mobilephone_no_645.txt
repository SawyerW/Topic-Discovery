I had the piece of crap for three weeks and nothing but problems from day. All it did was reset itself when it felt like it. Go to use an app on the phone and reset.  Go to make a phone call and reset.  I am in the army, and the went to the range with me and did not come back.  It is amazing what a 5.56 will do to it.  Trying to any help from motorola is total lost cause. I suggest not wasting your money on motorola products.  They are not what they were a few years.  Its too bad I can not put no stars on this worthless waste of a phone.
