this phone is so much better than anything i ever used.. Iphone is for people who don't know what is truly a great product. i have used all generation of Iphone and always have problem with them the first day i got them, either froze, lost signal or crash. But I never experience those problem with Nokia phone. All the review online compare Iphone with nokia N8 that say Iphone is better is bias. All those people dont know what truly is a unique phone and do you really used "ALL" of the iphone Apps? i think there is none other company can compare Nokia.
