I have AT&T;, and I did not want the $30/month data plan forced with an iPhone purchase.  I am a first time smart phone buyer and looked at them all.  I really liked the e71x, but I am not up for plan renewal and didn't want to pay over $200.  I also didn't want a phone with a lot of crap-ware on it, and I liked some of the feature that AT&T; took out of the e71 (like the Internet Radio, modes for home and work, etc)  Looking at the e63, it's a great value.  A little bigger than the e71, but it has the same features and they all work!  The 3G is great, call quality is crystal clear, email downloads are fantastic.  I would recommend this phone.
