I bought this phone to my wife, after a very deep research about pros/cons and other consumers comments.I used for about 2 weeks and then my wife is using it for more than a month, without any problem. She is not a "friend of technical stuffs", but she is operating some functionalities without problem and every day she shows me something new that she learned by herself. This means that Symbian is very easy to understand, learn and follow.The double keypad/keyboard is very good and the camera better than the E71 (my phone).GPS works fine almost all the time (faster to initialize than in the E71).The only 2 cons:1- apparently the wireless antenna is in the top of the phone, so when you are browsing, writing with the extended keyboard, the left hand normally is over the antenna and the wireless signal is not good at all (usually loose connection)2- the memory slot cover was made with plastic (the E71 is with rubber) and if you have no enough care (or long nails) probably you will damage it and then will be very difficult to open.
