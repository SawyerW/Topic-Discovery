Hello, during the last month you ComRes amazon products for several thousand dollars, and I am deeply disappointed with their quality control on some products I've bought you and Amazon.I live in Colombia and now I want to mention two iphone to buy from you last November 26, 2011, both units were shipped without the stamp and one of them is damaged, not working, I contacted the support center apple and they tell me that this team has a warranty expired long ago.I demand an immediate solution, because I think they have deliberately acted in bad faith. I am in Colombia and I demand a refund immediately or send to my home again and sealed equipment.SERIAL NUMBERS ARE DEVICES:86839WA6Y7H87922XS9Y7H
