AMAZON: THIS COMMENT IS FOR YOU ONLY, NOT FOR REPRINTING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY "COVERAGE", WHICH YOU ASKED ME TO RATE. ACCORDINGLY, I HAVE LEFT IT BLANK.  THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD PUBLISH IS WHAT IS WRITTEN BELOW:REVIEW:My TRACFONE minutes were, within a couple of weeks, about to expire, when I decided, on a lark, to check with AMAZON, thinking it highly unlikely they would carry such an item. I was wrong and very pleasantly surprised to find I could save $30 (30%) on the TRACFONE card I was planning to purchase at one of the local drugstores, an item I have not seen for sale anywhere else. You guys are habit-forming!
