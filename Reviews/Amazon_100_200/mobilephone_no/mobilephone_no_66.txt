AT&T; (and everyone elses) signal out here is marginal as I am out in the country but I get a signal just fine and have had no complaints about call quality and have not had any dropped calls.  The phone has bluetooth, & a good calendar and sync program (its got a camera but I just do not care about having a camera with my phone).  C-net gave it (t616/t610) very high reviews, about best in class.  The one thing about the phone that has been commented on on is the smudge factor, fingerprints do show up and a decent case is recomended.  I bought a cheap one from CompUSA that was ok but kind of awkward, purchased a Krussell case tonight which should be a about perfect.  I think there have been some firmware improvements made to improve RF/reception relative to earlier phones.  I originally wanted a Nokia because they seem to have better RF/reception than Sony-Ericsson but none of their (Nokia) currently available phones matched this one on a functional basis for me at this price.  Its a winner, I'm glad I selected this phone.
