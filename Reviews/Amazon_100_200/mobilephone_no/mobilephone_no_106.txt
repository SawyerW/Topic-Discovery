My E105 worked fine until about two months after purchase when it developed this set of peculiar problems -1. Once turned off, the phone could not be turned back on.2. Problem 1 could be bypassed by either having the phone plugged in to the AC charger or by popping out and popping in the battery.3. Once turned off, the phone would sporadically turn itself on. Thumbs-up to T-Mobile customer service on this one. When I called in initially, they said it was likely the battery that was causing the problem - a few days later I received a fresh battery which did not fix my problem. A second call resulted in a replacement phone which now seems to be working fine.Pros: Unit's small handprint, its relative ease of use and the great offer from T-Mobile.Cons: Slow keystroke response, hard to read the display in sunlight, no auto time update and poor selection of ringtones.Four stars for the phone/service package.
