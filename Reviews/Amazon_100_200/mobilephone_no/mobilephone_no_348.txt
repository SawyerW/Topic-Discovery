I have owned this phone since September 2007 and love it!  The phone has never given me any trouble even after I dropped it a few times.  I prefer reading web items from my easy chair so I do not have web service from Sprint with this phone but it is available.  It has a manual touch keyboard on the front and an on-screen keyboard. The camera is very good and the battery last very nicely. My appointments and memos with alarm are always correct. Contacts are easy to use with automatic features. I am just now having to replace the battery which never got sluggish.
