Though this came extremely quickly (within 4 days) it is not what I was hoping for at all. It's a used phone so I knew what to expect in terms of normal phone wear, but the back is falling off at the top, the scuffs on the screen are substantial in size and are clearly visible with the screen on, the micro USB port cover is missing, and there are chips out of the body of the phone (small). As far as the use of the phone, the screen doesn't respond as well because of some of the scuffs, and in some places it wasn't responding for me at all. I couldn't get to the main menu or the messages at all, so I couldn't even program the thing to use it. I was buying this as a replacement phone because my current phone drops calls but I've had mine for 2.5 years and it's in WAY better shape than this. Used phones always have their issues but the phone was no where near "very good", as it was advertised. Not happy at all with the purchase, will be returning. :/
