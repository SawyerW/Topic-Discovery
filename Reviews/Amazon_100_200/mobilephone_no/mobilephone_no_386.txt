I received my Nokia E-63-2 phne a few weeks ago and it is great. I had an old flip phone before and couldn't wait for the upgraded Nokia. I was disappointed that I had to purchase the connector cable, but so far that is the only disappointment that I have had. It is very easy to use and I love the full keyboard. The calender and the daytimer are great and help keep appointments straight with the alarm. I downloaded several free ring tones from WMMR to personalize it for myself. I haven't had much time to play around and find all of the cool features that can be used but I know that they are in there. Good Job Nokia!
