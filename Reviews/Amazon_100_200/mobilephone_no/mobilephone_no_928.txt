Don't buy this phone, it an awesome phone while it works, but almost six months after having the phone, it stops working.  When i turn it on it only saying LG.  When i first bought the phone i could see it was used the user guide book came with pen writing in it.  Not fair to spend all this money on an item that only works for a short time.  The seller or amazon needs to do something about this.  Feels like I flushed my money down the toilet.  Just not fair.  Can't buy any more cell phone from this seller.
