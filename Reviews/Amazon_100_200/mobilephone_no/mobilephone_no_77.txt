Sony's products are known for being very stylish, and this phone is no exception.  Everything about it is organized, compact,and very very sleek.  The menus are logical, however they take a little getting used to, but overall is very good.  One thing that I like in particular is that you dont have to worry about random little things- for example if you're trying to store a number and get a call, it will handle the call, and once you hang up everything you were doing i the contact book will still be there and ready to go.  Anyway, overall it is a great phone.  The only problem I've experienced i the 5 months I've had it is that the joystick became slightly stuck in the past.  It's not much of an issue, but somewhat annoying (although I've read that you can purchase a cheap replacement part if it's really an issue.)  Overall, an excellent little piece of technology.
