PROS : Sleek and trendy. Fits well into pants pockets without adding a bulge to your side. Good quality camera for a phone. All the features are easily accessible. Excellent sound quality. This is the first phone I have ever had that has an effective voice dial system and predictive text writing feature for text messages. Excellent reception (with T-Mobile). Large memory capacity. Easily attached via USB to computers (you can transfer ringtones, pictures, etc.). Lots of accessories have been made for this phone and they are easy to purchase.CONS : The screen is not easy to see when you are in the sun. My battery life seemed to get shorter quickly. The manual doesn't cover much.
