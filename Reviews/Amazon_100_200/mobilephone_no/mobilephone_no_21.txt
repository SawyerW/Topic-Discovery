I've had this phone for just a little over a year. The display screen has totally faded, which means that I no longer have an exterior caller ID, which really sucks. I took the phone to Sprint to see what they could do and they told me I was just slightly out my warranty  and I could 1. get a new phone or 2. get the insurance, wait a few weeks and then send in a $35 deductible for a replacement. Well I don't think so. I'm switching to VERIZON. SPRINT REALLY REALLY SUCKS. They don't do anything to keep their customers happy.
