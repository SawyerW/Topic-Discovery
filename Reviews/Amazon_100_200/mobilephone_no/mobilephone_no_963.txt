I really liked this phone.  Voice quality was excellent.  Texts were easy to send.  Ring tone for phone and texts were easy to hear.  There were only 2 things that I didn't like about this phone.  The keys for texting are very small.  If you have smaller that average fingers it might work out ok for you.  However, I have normal size women's fingers and it is almost impossible to text fast due to the small size of the keys without having a ton of spelling errors and letters that didn't even belong there.  The only other problem was that the battery didn't last long.  I am not a big cell phone user, but the battery would need charging everyday.  For the amount of time that I used the phone the battery should have lasted longer.  I am returning this phone and getting one with a larger keyboard.  Too bad because the voice quality was awesome and very user friendly.
