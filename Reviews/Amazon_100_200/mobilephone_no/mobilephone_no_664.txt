I bought it on November 30. I've been using it for two weeks and the phone is still stable. The first day I had to perform a factory reset because of the phone inestability (for example: crashed when entering the picture gallery or the camera), but after the phone "reset" it has been OK.It's well built, the camera is just amazing, the HDMI output is very usefull (to me), the USB on the go is also very usefull.The downside of this phone is the software, it feels like a beta version of a phone OS. Very very buggy, the touch interface still needs to be polished, you continuously press buttons that you don't want to, and this is my third touch phone. One day the portrait keyborad crashed and when I pressed 2 it wrote 5, the same happen with all of the keys, so I had to restart the phone.I would buy this phone again, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that the Symbian^3 still needs more work.In conclusion, it's like having a new computer running Windows 95. Hopefully the anounced firmware update for january fix most of this anoyances.
