Vibe Cellular's FAQ clearly states will work with AT&T.;This LG KG360 phone will not keep a connection with the tower.We worked with AT&T; tech support for an hour. It goes from zero bars (no service) to five bars standing in the same place. Two other AT&T; phone get five bars in the same physical location. Moving SIM cards from a "good" working phone to this LG KS360 does not improve the reception. NOTE: The LG's SIM card worked fine when placed in another AT&T; phone. We were able to get one call in between signal fluxuations, however, if it doesn't work as a phone, it it worthless.Clearly a defective phone. I have asked VibeCellular for a refund. With a 30 day return policy, can't trust and exchange. That would drag this out beyond the 30 day credit card charge back limit. Now I can only hope I can get this resolved quickly, as this was a birthday present for my 15 year old daughter.
