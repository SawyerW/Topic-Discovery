I bought this with a 2 year contract with Verizon awhile back. At the time it was a great phone that served all of my needs. The QTRY keyboard was easy to use, plus it was light weight user friendly. Sending text with photo or video attachment where as easy as any phone I've had or easier. I loved this phone and the only reason I upgraded to a smart phone was there was a huge discount on the Droid on my next contract.Over all I liked this phone better than the droid 2. It's a very simple to use phone that really is packed with features ( though smaller the display is tiny compared to newer phones ) for a basic phone. I would recommend this phone for someone that  wants good quality phone calls, plus texting with picture/video attachments without having to take a class to use the phone.
