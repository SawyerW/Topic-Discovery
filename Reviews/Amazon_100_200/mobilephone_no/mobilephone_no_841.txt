One would not CHARGE any battery(defect in phone).Neither issue Vendors fault.One thing you need to know about NEW Samsung phones,Wherever purchased,or bought online.IF the phone was made 12 months before you purchased it, it has ZERO warranty.IOW buy a NEW model,or you get no warranty from Samsung.(only way to tell for sure is w/phones serial#, and IME #), which no one can give you, as boxes are sealed.Most manufacturers warranties start at IN SERVICE date.Not SAMSUNG.In this regard, they are rated ZERO from me.Phone is new, if it has never been opened or put into service IMHO.Second NEW phone(Impression Deax),came used,sold as NIB.(Vendor could not have known as it was shipped direct from his Vendor to me).Vendors in both cases gave promt refunds and,one paid return UPS.Amazon vendors are great, never had to battle over a return.Or a credit.
