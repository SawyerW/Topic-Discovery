4 star for the phone and no star for AT&T.;  The phone itself is pretty good but buyers (purchasing the plan), beware of the "fruadulent" billing by AT&T.;  I was billed and paid (didn't realize this until sometime later) for a bill that was for the period before I received the phone.  Even more upsetting was the fact that AT&T; rep. is not willing to resolve this matter stating that I called too late.  He first said, he can't do anything on something that is 90 days past.  When I pointed out to him that it's been around 60 days, he changed his statement and said, he can't help me because it's been over 60 days.In addition, I used to frequently get calls looking for the person who previously owned this number.  Which obviously, used up my miuntes (for answering and checking messages that are not for me).I am upset!
