I bought this to replace one just like it that I had dropped one too many times and some things stopped working.  Everyone who sees this is amazed and impressed.  I wear my fingernails really long and therefore have difficulty using most phone buttons and it's almost impossible to use a touch screen (and NO - I am not cutting my nails).  This phone works really well for me.  It's easy to use.  One thing to note is that all of the instructions are in Spanish; but it has built in help desk.  I'm an AT&T; cellular client.  Swapping the SIM card is all you have to do to use this on their network.  If you have a phone with a SIM, this is a good replacement that doesn't require you renewing your contract.  Also, you can use a non-smart phone data package (cost savings).
