Before buying this product, I did my home work on this phone at various blogs, websites, user reviews, so I  knew what I can and can't expect.One feature I would stress on N8 is CUSTOMIZATION( a lot ). After two weeks of use I am writing this review,The bestCamera (more options, ofcourse 12 MP)GPS ( N8 doesn't need internet, I can find not all but yes most of the restaurants,services, etc. offline )FM TransmitterSpeaker ( Dolby digital surround sound )VOIP ( Skype worked well, actually their use to be some voice delay in my laptop,which I didnt find using N8.)There are lot more features you see on N8 as face time camera, HDMI port.Finally coming to not so great features isEmail client ( needs to be better )Web browsing ( hope to get the much awaited release of an updated web browser )so guys good luck in finding a right phone for your needs
