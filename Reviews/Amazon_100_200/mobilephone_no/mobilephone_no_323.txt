Got phone, worked fine until I tried downloading some apps and error said I needed to update to iOS4 or better.  Tried and tried, would not update.  Took to Apple store today, they tried 3 times to update, sent me to Genius Bar, they checked it out, advised me that it had been opened and some wires disconnected.  Tech reconnected, then tried twice more to update OS with no luck.  Advised I had a faulty unit and they would not even take it back with a $150 exchange.  Verry disappointed.  Like the phone, and will try again from another seller.iPhone 3G 8GB (Unlocked)
