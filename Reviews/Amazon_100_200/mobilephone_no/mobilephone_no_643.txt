Was looking for an unlocked GSM phone with a slider keyboard.  Although the technology is a bit outdated as far as the Android OS is concerned, most reviews gave this phone high ratings especially for the Qwerty keyboard.  Since receiving the phone I've updated the OS via the Motorola website and it now has a little more mojo.  I used standard free shipping and got the phone in less than a week.  My current T-Mobile plan doesn't include data but using WI-FI works great at home or at hotspots.  So far the only fly in the ointment seems to be that the battery takes a very long time to charge up.  Not sure if this is because the battery is old.  I've ordered a replacement online and will see how it charges.  For the price I think I got a good deal.  If the phone works well for a couple of years it will be a steal considering what unlocked phones cost these days.
