Excellent phone!  Very sleek, stylish and easy to use once you fiddle around for a couple of hours.  Has a plethora of options and is extremely customizable.  Digital camera is a great feature, and works very easily with special effects such as sephia, black & white, negative, and night mode.  Large display is vivid and clear.  Last but not least, the battery life is POWERFUL for such a little phone.  Only negatives I can conjure up is the fact that the keys sometimes get stuck, and also the phone does smudge easily, although very scratch-resistant.  I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone with AT&T carrier.
