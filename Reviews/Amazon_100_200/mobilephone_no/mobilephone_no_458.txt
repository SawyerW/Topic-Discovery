I bought my 84 year old Dad a Tracfone because he still drives and I wanted him to have a phone in the car in case anything happened while he was out.  We researched the options for airtime and decided on the 1 year card so that we would only have to buy it once a year.  The included minutes are more than plenty for him and it's super easy to get the new cards installed.  This is our second one, and it gives me peace of mind without constant worry about renewing the airtime.  If the minutes are enough for your needs, a year at a time is the way to go.
