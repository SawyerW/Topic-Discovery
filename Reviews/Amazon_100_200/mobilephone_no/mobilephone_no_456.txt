I was a tracfone for 8 years.  Never had problems until now. Recently the service they provide is garbage.  Other companies are possibly hacking into their services.  Their own managers and analyzers do not know what going on.  Any phone that you hook up with them with randomly be deactivated and you'll spend hours being on hold to get it hooked back up.  It happened every day for 2 weeks.  Many others are having the same problem.  Do not purchase tracfone!!!!!!!  Think about it, I myself just lost three job interviews cause I can't get my number back.  This can happen to you!!!!!!!!!!
