When I bought this phone, I think my expectations were way too high. I'd heard a lot about BlackBerry phones from friends who have them, and from the media, so I thought I'd try it. The phone takes forever just to turn on - almost ten full minutes! - and once it's on, the setup is just weird. I had to jump through hoops just to get my Bluetooth to work. And I really don't like the fact that the wrong charger was sent with the phone. I had to find some other way to charge the stupid thing. The only good part about this phone was that it had a fun game on it: Brick Breaker. Apart from that, it was a complete waste of money.
