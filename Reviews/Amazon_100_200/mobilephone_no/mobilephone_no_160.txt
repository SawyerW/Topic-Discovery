This phone has to be the worse out all of the Nextel phones. Because I work in a quiet atmosphere, I usually use "Private" (turning the speakerphone off) when I am on Direct Connect calls.  The earpiece got so bad on the phone, that I could never hear what the person was saying when using the feature.  Then the earpiece went completely out on the phone. I was livid because this phone wasn't even 3 months old when this problem started.  The phone is horrible. Just overlook all of those 5-star reviews because you would just set yourself up!!! The only thing that is good about this phone is it is pretty!!!!
