This is the phone I was using until the screen broke. Im giving it 4 stars because of how it is while its working lol. Really really easy to use. Easy on the text, I can text really fast with this phone. Its a small phone, good buttons. Good features on it. Easy to get to things quickly. One downfall is the service. I couldnt get very good service with this phone. While in buildings etc. Once outside it isnt no big deal, but in certain buildings ehh... got some trouble. But this is a good little phone!!! But it doesnt work anymore, the screen is black now, and I cant see anything. It happened out of no where to. Even though it has been dropped in water twice, and dropped on the floor quite a few times lol. But nothing serious. Its a good phone.
