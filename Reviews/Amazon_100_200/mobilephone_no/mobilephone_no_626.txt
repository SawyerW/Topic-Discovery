I have now gone back to this phone for the 4th time. Had it since 2008 and used it for 2 years, then upgraded and put it in storage. Had to get it out of storage when: my Samsung Sunburst went completely dead, Samsung Evergreen started dropping calls every other time, and now the touch screen on my 2nd square shaped Pantech p6030 stopped functioning, so I had to get a sim card adapter so I could fit a micro sim in this phone to start using it again. This is the phone I go back to that has no touch screen, just raw buttons that just work. And this phone also gets better reception and holds a charge better than any of these other phones did. This phone just won't die, and is packed with features especially for it's age. Plus it's so small and lightweight all my friends are actually kind of jealous since their smart phones can barely fit in their pockets. What can I say, me and this phone go way back. Buy one!
