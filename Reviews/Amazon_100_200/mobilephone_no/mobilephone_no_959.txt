This looks like a good phone and starts off pretty good, but in a short while, trouble starts. Battery life is short. Cuts out during conversatons while you are at home in a good reception area. Took it in to AT&T; and they could not fix it so replaced it.  Within two months, it started acting weird again.  Stuck in some kind of loop that would not allow you to call out, only receive calls.  Took it in again to their repair place and this time they could not fix and said I would have to buy a new one. In short - it sucks.  Take a chance if you like to gamble.  I'd rather use two orange juice cans and a string.
