I got this thinking it had WiFi, well it doesn't. I read the specs on it and it mentioned that it is great to surf the net...just only through the phone service. It is a nice phone for the ones that are looking for a pocket PC type. I am more the Palm OS, plus I find that it is easier with most of my collegues to exchange some of the programs that we have since most of us have palm OS stuff. Which it isnt compatible with this phone. It is hard to believe that even though it is made by Palm, they didnt make it so that you could transfer from a regular Palm OS to the PC operating system. I had the treo 650 and went to this one, the 750. Well good thing I kept the old one. I am back to using that one.
