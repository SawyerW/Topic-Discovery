Everyone in our family has these and we use them with T mobile prepaid.  They are good phones for the price, loud sound, can use bluetooth and big buttons for dialing.However, you will NOT be able to get the photos off of it with a cable or Bluetooth.  You have to send them to your email, which costs minutes on prepaid.  The ability to do so is disabled on the Tmobile prepaid version of this phone.  The guys at the store do not know this, and sold me a cable. After speaking to Tmobile when struggling to download photos I was told this was true.
