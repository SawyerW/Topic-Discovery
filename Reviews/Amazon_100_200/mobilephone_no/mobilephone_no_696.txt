I purchased 3 of them in February for my wife, my son, and I.  I have pushed the phone to the point of defect.  I have loaded and experimented with many apps. My home page is loaded with updates for my social networks, current news, and weather updates. I also have a dedicated home page for 5 emails set to the quickest update interval. I then purchased a program called RAMblow Pro.  It's a memory management program which closes unused apps for you.  Its similar to the memory programs offered on Android's app store.  I love this phone and all its capabilities. Its the best camera phone ever. Great replacement to my limited HTC Aria.I am also a former N97 and N95-8gb owner
