Tracfone works for me as I do not use the phone much and I have bought cards on Amazon, but not at this price.  Right now, this card with shipping is $94.99+$4.99 shipping =$99.98. You are saving a penny.  When I buy at the store I get it and add it.  Here you are taking a chance on the mail system and a seller that sends a piece of paper with a number on it!! Even if the number works great you have wasted a week getting the thing.  Walmart on line is $99.88 for email delivery, but for 10 cents savings it is still safer and faster to buy at store.  If you see a lower price here then go for it - but not at full price. Also Tracfone customer service is too awful to take a chance for full price.  Wait for the price to go down before you buy here.
