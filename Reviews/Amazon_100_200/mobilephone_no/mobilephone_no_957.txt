I bought this phone through Amazon but it was sold by Unlocked Cell Phone Kings Inc. I had some questions pertaining to the battery life of the phone and contacted the King himself.  He was very helpful and was super prompt with his response to my rather uneducated, to put it mildly, questions.  The phone is great and has so many gadgets that I will never use.  The price was really great and the shipping time was excellent, due to my Prime membership.  Thumbs up to this phone and to the very nice seller as well.  Would deal with the King again but I hope I won't have to as I like this phone and want it to last, lol.  He does have other products on his Amazon Store page though so, one never knows.  A plus on this phone and seller.
