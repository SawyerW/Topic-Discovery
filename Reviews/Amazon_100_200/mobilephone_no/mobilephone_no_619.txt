I bought this phone a few days ago and love it.  Reception is great and it hasn't locked up on me yet. Phone has a very solid feel to it when it is in your hands and the build quality is excellent. I carry my phone in my pants pocket and it is like it isn't even there.  Loads of features  and easy to use.  I put my AT+T sim card in powered up the phone and it automatically setup the internet settings for me.  It knows based on the sim card that I have AT+T and configured eveything I needed to access the internet.  Also has a program to help you setup your gmail, hotmail, yahoo or whatever PoP3 or imap account you have.  The 5mp camera is very good for a camera phone and has a flash.  To many feature to go into here.  Great phone, the only negative I would give it is the soft keys tend to be a bit stiff, but nothing that is a deal breaker.
