I really like this phone. Mostly because of the camera, antenna, and battery life.The camera is better than my point and shoot in bright situations, and close in quality in flash situations (lower flash brightness creates a lot of noise in the photos) but it is amazing.Nokia HANDS DOWN makes the best antennas. I get reception everywhere. The ability to toggle 3G, 2G, and Dual modes works quickly and consistantly. Data speeds are quite good.Battery. This is the only phone where I can go 2 days without charging it. And my personal email is activated with push.I have used a T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream) with lots of Android flavors. And an HTC HD2, with WP 6.5, WP7, WP7.5, and lots of Android flavors. I personally like the N8 hardware the best by a large margin. I am partial to WP7+. I plan on getting a Nokia Lumia when they get something better than the 700 for T-Mobile USA 3.5+G frequency.
