The features on this phone are awesome, but the design of the phone is terrible.  The direct connect speaker is located on the back of the phone, so when you're using it, the sound goes directly into the palm of your hand.  This wouldn't be bad, but he direct connect microphone is located on the opposite side of the phone.  It just isn't near as loud as my I90C.  If you're buying it to look good and put a trophy on your belt, this is your phone.  If you're buying it for functionality and to actually use it in a real world environment, consider another nextel.
