I returned this item for the following reasons:Political-I am completely disgusted with Nokia's involvement in supporting the Islamic regime of Iran in further oppressing its people. By cutting off its digital airwaves Nokia has colluded to perpetuate isolation of the Iranian freedom movement.Phone Features-1- After using a Palm for many years, I could not get over the inferior visual quality of the screens and the icons.2- The phone keeps locking and I had no way to asking it not to lock the home page.3- the text messaging was chronological but it did not keep a conversation string on the same page.Overall-As someone who uses Mac and Palm, I was surprised that non-user-friendly phones like this still exist.If you want to use it for business it had features that were helpful and if you don't care about the political bend of who you support, this phone might be a possibility. For me I feel literally and figuratively liberated after I returned this phone.
