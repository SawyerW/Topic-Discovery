It's been 3 weeks now and I've only had minor voice mail setup issues.  The phone itself is the best I've had in years.  Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not.  My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets.As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series.  My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily.  This phone feels much stronger and better constructed.  Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed.  I'll see what 6 months to a year brings.
