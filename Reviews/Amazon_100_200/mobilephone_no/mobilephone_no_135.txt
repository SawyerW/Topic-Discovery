Save your money. Even if these rebates are true. Whoever you have as a cell carrier, even if your using an 80s style brink phone - your getting better service. Yes this phone is filled with fun colored crap. But even that becomes a problem. This phone likes to stop and think. Often it will take up to 4 seconds after you open the flip for it to 'wake up'. On top of this you'll start pressing buttons, and nothing will happen for 4-5 seconds and it'll finally start doing soemthing. Its not just my phone. Other people I know have the same problem with this model. I live on the northside of Chicago, and have to go outside to use my phone to get an acceptable quality to understand anyone. I can't tell if this is t-mobile or the phone, all I know is that t-mobile bought voicestream, which was known as the worst carrier in the nation. It seems they haven't improved muched.
