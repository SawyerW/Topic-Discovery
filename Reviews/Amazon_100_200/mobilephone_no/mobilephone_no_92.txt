On the plus side:  I've had no problems ripping / downloading songs and it's great for text messaging.  It's got a SIM-card which I think is different from (and better than) most US phones.On the down side:  1) the keys aren't backlit so you can't use in the dark.  2) the earphones are horrible:  they're heavy, don't have a clip, have bizarrely long ear wires, and can't be "coiled up" when not in use (so mine are always tangled).  They're impossible to use while jogging.  They come disconnected from the phone if you leave it in your pocket.  Finally, the mic sits about belt level, which is why you always see people holding their "hands free microphone" if they want to be heard.  It's hard to imagine how the same company could make this cool phone & these horrible mic/headphones.In short:  Fine for on the train, but not for active usage.
