I bought this phone a few weeks ago, and have been frustrated ever since.  Besides the bad sound, it adds a hum to the voice.The menu system is extensive and therefore ridiculous to use.  Too many options to make this phone useable.Ring Tones?  great for kids, but there is no simple standard ring tone that sounds like a phone.  I have contacted customer support on a few occassions, and no one has given me any direction as to where to find a simple ring.  The only option available is the T-Mobile melody that you hear on their commercials.  They dont seem to realize that not everyone wants to play music.  I cant find, download or buy a simple ring.I'm counting the days till my contract expires.
