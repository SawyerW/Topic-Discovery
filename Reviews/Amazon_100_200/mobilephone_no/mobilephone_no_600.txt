I've had this phone since it first came out and love it so I bought one for my husband.  We live in the mountains and satellite coverage for cell phones is not reliable.  I have found this phone to be one of the best for picking up a signal.  Product arrived well packaged and within a reasonable amount of time, but charger did not work.  After requesting a replacement, I received an immediate response and apology.  I was not inconvenienced by having to return the nonfunctioning charger.  I was told a new one was on the way and an additional battery was included to compensate for any inconvenience.
