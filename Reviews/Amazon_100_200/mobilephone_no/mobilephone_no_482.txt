Phone has a nice appearance and feel, but a cumbersome operating system. Trying to place a call can take 3 or4 clicks on the Select button and there is no volume control on the ring. The charger supplied with the phone was a non US type with a cheap US adapter which didn't work, making it necessary to purchase a new charger adding $27.00 US to the cost. Bottom line: I like the looks and feel of the phone, but would be much happier with something else.
