I'm surprised how many other reviewers liked this phone. I can't imagine that they've actually used it much. This phone suffers from poor usability all over: It's a little too slick to hold, it's hard to open with one hand, it's hard to hear unless you hold it just the right way to your ear, the reception is awful (this is compared to a cheaper phone at the same place and time on the same Sprint network), the menuing system is clunky, and it uses it's sloooowww web interface to compose email (including SMS texting... it takes 10 to 20 seconds just to get into the message editor).This is just one of those products that you know the makers don't actually use themselves. It would take a lot of convincing to get me to try another Sanyo product after this experience. I may just go back to Nokia.
