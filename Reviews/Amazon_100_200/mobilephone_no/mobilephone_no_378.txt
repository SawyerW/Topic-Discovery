This is am amazing phone for the price. The array of features is incredible. It has many features that I never dreamed of. Here is a non-exhaustive list:* Quad band GSM plus another host of protocols* Bluetooth (handsfree, bluetooth audio, file xfer, etc)* WiFi b/g* Skype mobile* Nokia Maps (You can download world maps from Nokia's web site free of charge)* with an additional bluetooth GPS you can transform the phone into a GPS* Internet radio ;-)* mp3/mp4 player* 2MP still/video camera* PDF reader* Office (word, excel, etc)* Micro SD card slotand the list goes on. I keep discovering new features as I use the phone more and more.I did have a problem connecting to my car stereo via bluetooth and after a bad experience with Nokia customer service they eventually send me the correct information to fix the problem.
