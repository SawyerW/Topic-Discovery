this is the best phone! i am 14 and have been wanting a cell phone forevr since my older sister got hers 4 years ago (she's 17 now) and so my dad left me with these words: Honey, if u can find a cell phone that works with cingular and is under 80 dollars, i will get it for you. So i found the Nokia 3595 and it is so cool. i can change the color of it whenever i want (right now its pink!), i can change the ringtone whenever i want, and i can IM my friends whenever i want... i think this is the best phone for a teenager that doesnt want to carry a big bulky phone around. All u parents out there, heres the best phone to get!!
