I ordered the card from shopcelldeals.  The card came promptly (it's actually a piece of paper with your PIN number).  I went to the tracfone website and I saw the promotion bonus 250 mins when adding a 400 min/1 year card.  My phone triples minutes automatically, so I actually received 1450 minutes for the full year!The card was for sale at $85 plus $4.99 shipping.  (I think 4.99 for shipping a single piece of paper is silly, but the great deal pays for it)I'm happy to pay $90 a year for basic cellphone service.  I rarely use it and the minutes do roll over! I feel sorry for the people who pay 40-100 a month for their fancy iphone
