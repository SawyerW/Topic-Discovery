I have very conflicted feelings towards my i730.  On the one hand, direct connect, text messaging and web access are great, but I NEVER HAVE RECEPTION! What good is a phone if you can never use it? I would understand if I was venturing out into the "boonies" on a regular basis, but my phone drops constantly throughout the city of Chicago and the surrounding area.  In fact, the only time I don't have any trouble is when I'm in a smaller town.  I've heard rumors that the very first batch of the i730's put out do have a lot of reception problems, so that may be the cause of all my troubles.  I've had enough trouble that I probably wouldn't buy this phone again if I had the opportunity though.  I do want to say that Nextel in general is AWESOME.  They have great customer service and I love them!Oh, one more thing.  THANK YOU for putting in the advice for using direct connect on private. Nothing is more annoying than having to listen to other people's conversations just because they're too stupid to learn how to use their phone!
