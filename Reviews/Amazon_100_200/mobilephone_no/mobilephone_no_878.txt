Well the Sidekick LX 2009 did come in good condition but without a CHARGER. I knew what kind of phone it was because I owned one before. However, sometimes you get 'invisible' text msgs that aren't there when you check them and sometimes after deleting all your voicemails, it still somehow shows the icon as if there is still one. Other that that, it is a phone that is very appropriate for texting given its large keyboard and large screen. But if you prefer light phones, you wont probably like this one because it weighs a ton! Overall a simple phone if you are not into apps and other stuff your laptop or Mac can do anyway.
