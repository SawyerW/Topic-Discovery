This phone is a wonderfully small phone. It's very compact, despite having a camera ald large display. Reception with this phone, however isn't that good, but that may be AT&T's falt (reception isn't reflected in the rating). Despite the poor reception, voices come through relatively clear (seeing that reception is usually in red or yellow squares). It's screen is extremely clear and readable under most conditions- it's hard to reat with the screen facing the sun. The screen smudges easily, but it seem quite scratch-resistant. This phone could use mroe memory, though. It's feature-packed, like many Sony Clies are- it has a stopwatch, calculator, mini-PDA features, bluetooth, infared, and pre-installed games, ringtones, themes, and pictures. It came with a headset. The battery life is also good- it lasted a week in endless keylock before it needed to be recharged.
