experience with the n8 was successful. what I did not like when I got the phone was not working, and I had to take it to service where I was told that the battery came damaged. was why I bother with amazon that sold me a phone with a damaged battery. the phone has new battery and works great. new battery for the phone in my country cost me $ 58.14 and Venezuela is not just because the phone was to bring ua new battery in good condition. so I recommend you pueben the goods to ensure its proper functioning and amazon buyers we will not be harmed as happened to me, that I should pay more money to operate the phone they buy
