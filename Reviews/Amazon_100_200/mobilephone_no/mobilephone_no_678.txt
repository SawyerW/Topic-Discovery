I'm really pissed at amazon for sending a blue n8 instead of a dark gray. unfortunately i'm outside the US and the logistics involved with returning is just too cumbersome for me. so i sold it.good thing the price has dropped. will most likely reorder.having said that.. I am in love with this phone. played with it for a weekend. forget the iPhone buy the N8!the only reason i'm giving a 3 star instead of 5 is because the shipment was delayed without any explanation it arrived late and in a color different from what i ordered.the phone itself gets a 5 star..make that 4.5. the touch screen keyboard wasn't that comfortable for me.. but i'm sure it gets better as one gets used to it. will get a stylus though.I used it as an FM transmitter... verdict: lovely. watched a movie on it... verdict:  beautifulWell done Nokia... will be repurchasing soon.btw the Ovi store is really good!! has enough apps for me.. i don't know what the hype is all about! in fact i'm going to purchase an additional 16gb memory stick to ensure i get as much apps as possible from the ovi store.buy it!
