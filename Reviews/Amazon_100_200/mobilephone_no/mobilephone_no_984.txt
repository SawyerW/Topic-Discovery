I bought this phone after having used the Nokia Nuron and X2, which both had their faults but were generally good phones. The same can be said for the E6 because its construction, video playback ability, great display, and very comfortable keyboard. However, the web browser without true flash playback (flash lite is discontinued by Adobe) and pretty limited app store were disappointing. However, I knew all that before buying the phone. My true problem was that the device sent to me continued to power on and off without any manipulation by anyone. I would often hear it power down and restart when it was simply sitting in my car's passenger seat or on the shelf at home. Additionally, these restarts would cause some memory loss in the phone, including contacts, apps, etc. This was unacceptable, and therefore I had to send the phone back to the warehouse. The Amazon warehouse does not offer replacement, so I will have to simply find a different phone.
