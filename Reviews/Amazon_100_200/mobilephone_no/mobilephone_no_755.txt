I used to have the N97, and N8 way much better, faster, thinner, prettier and more responsive. Do not miss at all the 32 GB internal memory... with 16GB more than enough. I love the FM transmitter, every where you go you can turn on the party with the music going through a real stereo speakers, easy to transfer data, music, pics with Bluetooth, and best of all unlocked for the price!!! Excellent!!! buying it here in Ecuador with the cel service carrier will cost twice more.Add to the N8 the HDMI, the excellent 12Mp camera, the finish of the phone and the size of it not too, long not too wide, it is the perfect device to go a long with it everywhere. Thanks Nokia
