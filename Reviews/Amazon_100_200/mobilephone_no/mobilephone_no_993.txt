I would give the phone 5 stars but it seems like am dealing with a bad batch of phones. I'm working on getting the third Nokia E6 replaced at the moment.Phone #1: Dead keyboard. Only the touchscreen worked. This was amusing because I was replacing a 2 year old Nokia E71 that had a keyboard die after a fall.Phone #2: Loose headphone/headset jack. This really irritated callers but I could hear them without issue. Then the issue started affecting the audio on my side. I replaced this unit as well.Phone #3: Dead keyboard backlight and multiple stuck pixels. I had to return this phone for a refund and reorder a new one.I've never had such a bad run with any tech equipment before. I suspect it could be either Nokia had a bad batch of phones or Amazon's poor packaging of products coupled with UPS throwing things.Either way, the phone is a dream to use and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for all the shipping back and forth.
