The Sony Ericsson T616 Cell Phone is pretty good.  Not great.However, some aspects of it are great.  The display is one of the best on the market today.  And as a cell phone, it's the best I've ever owned.  I've never had any troubles with reception with it in Orlando, Fl; Buffalo, NY; Charlotte, NC; or the area's in Northern NJ near New York City, and lots of other places up and down the East Coast of the United States.  (Save, obviously, for hill and mountain areas where no cell phones will work.)Using it for e-mail and photo's... a little weak. But then, it's a cell phone and not a camera, and it isn't large enough to be a PDA replacement.  I've gotten all the major features to work.The other draw back is the small keypad for the phone.  It takes a little getting used too and hitting buttons by accident is a regular occurrence.But all in all, I've liked this cell phone. I've recommended it to friends and family.
