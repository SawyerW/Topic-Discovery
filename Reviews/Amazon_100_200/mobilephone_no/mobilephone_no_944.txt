Despite the bad reviews from international buyers complaining about incompatibility issues in their country, this is a great work phone! I use it for business purposes only. Phone calls, messages, emails, calendar, notes, and tasks, it handles all of them beautifully. No hiccups, no distracting apps and widgets to slow down the system. I have an iPhone 5 and an iPad Mini for entertainment and exploration, an Android as a paper weight, and I use my Blackberry for work. It syncs with my Outlook seamlessly, doesn't feed all my info to Google in exchange for glitchy cloud functions, it simply works. It's small, light to carry around, not pretentious, and takes care of business faster than any other phone I've used. I strongly recommend it to business professionals!
