I have had Tracfone Service for 9 years and love it. It's very inexpensive for people who aren't big cell phone users. I pay $99.88 for a one year service card and I'm good to go for one year. Unused minutes are carried over to the next year. I buy a new Tracfone phone about every 3 years which usually costs about $49.99. Most phones allow for double or triple minutes of the card. Not all phones work in all areas, so before you buy a phone, go to the Tracfone website and enter your zip code. It's nice that I don't have to be locked into an expensive plan that I don't need!
