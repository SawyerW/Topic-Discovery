AT&T customer service sucks. I was with Sprint PCS before, and their customer service was far better. I am regretting the move. BEWARE OF AT&T.Great phone. Good features. But in a noisy environment you would not hear what the other party is saying. The maximum sound (both ringer and call volume) in this phone is almost equal to the minimum sound with my previous Samsung A500 Sprint phone.Other than the issue with the audio volume I am very happy with the phone, but once again AT&T has a very bad customer service. I would not recommend anyone to come to AT&T.
