I bought this phone because of the SIP Phone features, since there's no other cellphone to support Internet Calls. It just doesn't work.  The configuration doesn't work at all. I have a friend who has the exact E63 model and it does work.  Is not this particular phone because I asked the retailer to send another one and the new one, also, didn't work.So, if you're buying this phone for the Internet Calls feature, you're totally throwing your money away.Other than that, the phone is ok.  It freezes for 5 seconds after each call, I dont know why.. but that small defect drives me crazy because if im in a hurry to call someone it just freezes and i have to wait until whenever its ready again to recognize the keyboard.Camera and Video, SMS, regular calls and the rest of the stuff works just fine.
