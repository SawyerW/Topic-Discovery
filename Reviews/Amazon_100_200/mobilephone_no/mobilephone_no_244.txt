The GPS hardware port is lock! new arrived with  "acquire a GPS signal" forever, after email support get new version of Ostia problem solve, once hard reset problem happen again, update the ROM from pharo, the problem/bug happen on 2007 still there[...]when this problem happen even use the other software like tomtom, garmin, googlemap... not any software can get the gps signal, looks like software can detect the GPS but "acquire a GPS signal" forever.plus the Ostia GPS software can not find the right RD route. if the hardware and software both have big BUG, it is a junk, do not buy PHAROS gps.
