The phone sometimes shuts off itself. Plus, network setting is hobbile too. However the worst of all, it is definately not the user friendly phone at all. I definately want to go back to my old Samsung so~~~ bad. Finally, AT&T Customer service was my worst nightmare. I usually had to wait for 45 minutes and they charge roaming even when you are right in the middle of downtown!! If you are extremely lonly and got lots of time to get used to the phone, plus want to talk to the free live chat, AT&T is the one you want to stick with!
