The phone in general runs VERY slow, it takes almost a minute at times just to load up messages. It crashes almost every other time I go into my messages. The screen commonly will not turn on when I push the button, in which case I will have to wait 5-10 minutes for it to work again(or just pull the battery). It takes a while to start up(about 5 minutes). At times when I get calls the phone will not answer when I push the button to answer. Last but not least the screen commonly messes up(its hard to describe what it does). The only good thing I can think about is that the battery life is fair(lasts 1-2 days) and the slide out keyboard that tilts. Im not sure if my phone is just messed up or if they are ALL messed up, either way I wouldn't advise anybody to take the chance.
