I bought this phone because I love the razor, best reception I have ever had I got signal anywhere all the time. but this phone is not the usa razor. its reception is shakey at best. and I have had really poor performance from the battery. average 1-2 hours use, or 2 days on no use (about half of what my old one got). its the uk version, so it operating screens are quite different ( Texting is "short messaging") so finding all your settings turns out to be a pain. also having lots of "cannot download message" errors.  it was new ,not refurbished but thats pretty much all that matched add.all in all really regret the purchase, sad because I have had 2 US versions and loved them, but with the "smart" phone craze nobody seems to carry them anymore.
