The description states "U.S. Version" but this is not quite correct.  This phone is not even in the Samsung USA database.  It has zero support.  I would expect these complications with a product that states international version but this phone is advertising U.S. version when there is no actual U.S. version!  At first, every function worked great except video/picture messaging, downloads from subscriber and internet.  It is necessary to configure the settings and the carrier nor Samsung could not give any help at all but thankfully, the internet and users did. This phone needs to be set up (for TM) just like the Samsung Behold for APN/WAP browser settings and MMS settings.  If you do this, you will have all features of the phone! Once I got everything working, I really like the phone.  It is considered a "smartphone" so data packages are more expensive.
