When I bought this phone over a year ago, I bought it chiefly for the walkie-talkie feature, speakerphone feature and international usability (...). After one year of use, the walkie talkie feature is the only above average aspect of this phone. The speaker phone is tinny, and interupts incoming audio if there is the slightest noise entering your mic. The cross-platform usability is such a hassle I never bothered going through the steps necessary to use it overseas. The worst part of this phone (besides Nextel's TERRIBLE network-- don't plan on using if you are more than 5 miles from a major interstate or metro area) is the battery life, which with minimal useage is less than two days. This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network. I would steer clear of this phone, and hope that Nextel's recent merger with Sprint improves the network it operates on.
