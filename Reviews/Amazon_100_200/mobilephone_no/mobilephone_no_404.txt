I was in love with this phone when I first got it - it was sleek and very pretty. The programs are much more streamlined than other touch phones - there are three sliding panels that you can alternate between and you can choose the apps that you place on them. The free games that come along with it are cute and a good distraction. The sound quality is decent. The text screen is very intuitive and easy to use - you don't have to waste a lot of time calibrating it.However, after a few months, it started lagging and started dropping calls. Less than 1 year into owning it, the touch screen completely stopped working, leaving me with a defunct phone...Buyer beware!
