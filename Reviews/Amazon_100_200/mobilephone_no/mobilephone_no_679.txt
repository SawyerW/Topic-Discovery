I purchased this Nokia N8 because I wanted a cell phone with a great camera for traveling. After using it for one week, I am pleased with it.Pros:1. Great camera which takes awesome pictures and HD video2. Great signal strength compared to iPhone3. Great GPS and maps4. Wi-fi5. Lots of data storage space, but I added another 16Gig to get it up to 32Gig6. Easy to sync with my computer using Ovi Suite7. Unlocked for use on any network using a SIM8. Stable OS9. Nice desktop options for favorite contacts, missed calls, received texts, Facebook comments, search box, etcCons:1. Not as easy to use as the iPhone which is so intuitive2. Fewer apps available3. Most tasks require an extra step, touch of the screen, necessary on the iPhoneOverall, this is a great cell phone and I am happy with my purchase. I may continue to use my iPhone as an iPod Touch and keep using my Nokia N8 as my main cell phone. It's great to be carrying around a 12 mega-pixel camera with me at all times.
