Although the Sanyo 8200 has many great features, there are three problems that may be inherent in the design of this model.1) Overheating of the handset with backlit turned off. Although store testing finds the product to be within the appropriate testing range, this does not mean that there is not a problem.2) Adjustability of the receiver volume. After repeated testing at all levels, either cannot hear everything being said or voice echoing occurs or voice distortion at higher levels.3) Receiver feature and camera feature share same space.  When switching from left ear to right ear, it is difficult to find a position to hear from.  Have to move the phone almost below the earlobe to get reception.I found this to be true with at least 6 other phone users.The Sprint Store does not take these problems seriously enough to replace the phone for a different model.
