i buy this stuff for my daughter. when got the mail yesterday, i was a little astonished, because before desided to purchase it, i found a youtube vedio. it showed very abundant asscessories. when opened my box, one phone, one batt, one adaptor, one cable, one manual. particularly the manual was not for this cell phone. now you can understand why i was astonished. by the way there had no microSD in the box. so i returned to my original order on amazon and found this stuff was sold by amazon approved PDAgiant LLC. i checked the phone carefully, it is new, not a refur one. a little difference from the picture on this website,there has a logo of att. finally i understand it's an unlocked att phone. when started the phone, there have many att applications. it works very well with my tmobile sim card. untill now it begin to make me satisify. some guys said connot connect motoblur, while cannot connect to wifi network. the truth is i can. even before connecting motoblur, i can connect to my wifi at home. i am still try it now!
