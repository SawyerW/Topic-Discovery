This phone was purcahsed as a gift.  When the box was opened it appeared as new.  We soon discovered the battery would not accept a charge.  The seller was contacted through the Amazon 'return an item' option.  The seller contacted us 3 days later stating that they would send a label through the USPS. It has been 17 days and all we can hear are crickets.  If the issue is resolved with a functional (as advertised) product, the review can be revised to reflect the customer service.  This is the 1st poor experience that we have had on Amazon in 7 years.
