I purchased this phone for an older friend of mine, 82 years old to be exact.  He has been using it for the past week and loves it, he had a Motorola razr but it finally gave out on him.  I was a little worried when I opened the box and the phone said T-Mobil since I was using my att sim card, but it worked fine.  my friend says the the volume and ringer are both louder on this phone (which is a good thing when your are 82).  I set the font to a larger size for him which he really likes and the price what very good.  The only thing I would mention to any potential buyer is:  don't purchase a Separate charger like I did, one comes packed with the phone.  There is a camera but I didn't even try it since all it was bought for was to talk on.  Good phone, good price and easy to use.
