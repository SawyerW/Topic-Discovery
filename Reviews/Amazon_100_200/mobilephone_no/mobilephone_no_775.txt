I do actually have this phone (ordered it from NokiaUSA and got it on time since im close by IN).This phone is for the Symbian lover wanting a new experience, unlike S60 5th edition. And this phone delivers.Construction and hardware wise, it is perfect (no removable batteries my gripe, but oh well). The camera is fantastic and may even replace your stand alone camera. Feels great in your hands too.The software..its what S60 5th Edition should have been...the music player, only 1 touch tapping, multitouch are ALL welcome editions. Do not use the ovi maps that come with it, go to beta labs and use OVI maps there...it has multitouch etc. Am thoroughly enjoying it...where they can improve is the web browser and calendar.Web browser will get an update in Nov from beta labs...will include better multitouch and a brand new look/feel, much like (n900 etc).All in all, this is what we want, something new but keeping the familiarity.Good job Nokia..looking forward to your N9
