If you're looking for a hardy non-smartphone that's great for texting with a great camera that has a long battery life, this is for you. This is the first phone I ever bought six years ago. The phone took a beating (the worst being a fall off a roof into a bucket of water), but held together for over four years. When it came time to get a new phone, rather than upgrade to a smartphone and pay absurd data fees (which I was told was the only option from Verizon), I came on Amazon and purchased the phone and took it in to Verizon to have them activate it. They weren't pleased, but I am. This phone has great software, loud speakers, big screen inside, texts fast, and feels solid in your hands. I can't say I have any reservations about this phone.
