This product is great. It usually sells at MetroPCS for 140 dollars which I wasn't willing to pay for a phone. I was skeptical because it was used, I haven't ordered from Amazon before, and I didn't know the company that was selling it. Everything was great. I got the phone the first expected day of shipping. I've ordered from other websites that take so long so this was a pleasant surprise. Also, I thought the screen would be scratched or the phone would look used but it looked brand new. A charger and battery were included. The software had been reset so there wasn't a hassle about deleting things or not being able to access anything. I am a happy amazoner.
