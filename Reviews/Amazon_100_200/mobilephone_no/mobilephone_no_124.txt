This phone isn't that bad. It's very small and sleek. East to download things on T-Zones. The cons of it is that sometimes when I close it, it turns off (I hate that!). And when you first turn it on, you have to wait about five minutes to get the phonebook and text messaging option to work. That sucks! But it's very durable; I dropped it a couple of times (it only got a few scratches, including a few very ugly holes on the cheap plastic outside window). And I also dropped it in a bathtub full of water, and after drying it off (I dropped it in the water about 6 months ago) it still worked(s). But overall, I like it.
