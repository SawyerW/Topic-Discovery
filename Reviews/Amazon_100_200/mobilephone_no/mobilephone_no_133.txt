I bought this phone, seeing pretty good reviews for it. The part of the screen not turning on for a while is true, but it does not happen that often. The screen on the outside broke quickly also.  I have to live with it, becuase Samsung will repair it for more than i paid for the phone, and T-mobile will give me a refurbished one for 70. The phone is pretty good, but the last thing, is that the plastic part in the outside of the phone, that the screen on (on the oustide of the phone) , is coming off. (the part of the phone that says samsung on the top of the phone)Over all, I would never of choosed another phone
