I agree with above reviews' reports of good reception and battery life.  I've had no problem with the vibrate alert feature - it works fine for me.  The screen IS tough to see in bright daylight, but I counter that by angling the screen away from the sun and can function just fine.  My biggest complaint? The supplied ringtones are nothing short of bizarre.  It's easy enough to download new ones (my present one is the Star Trek red alert siren), but one would hope that Samsung could at least supply some decent ones.  Perhaps it's a Korean/US cultural difference.Anyhow, it's a great phone that's serving me very well.
