Not the fault of the seller, but this phone does not seem to have the quality of my old RAZR, which I used for several years before losing it. For one thing, it keeps dropping the bluetooth connection in my car, which is very annoying when you are making a call, especially in my state where making calls with a handheld phone while driving is illegal. The old RAZR rarely did this. I have to hang up, usually power down the phone and power up again in order to reconnect.Besides that, the battery runs down really quickly with no warning. One minute it looks fully charged according to the display, and the next minute it goes totally dead.
