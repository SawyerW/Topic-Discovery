I got this phone for the camera... and it has not disappointed.  It's wonderful.  It blows away my Olympus point and shoot. After seeing the pictures on my screen, my friends all thought this phone was a nice camera.  They were surprised when they found out it was actually a phone.  The Nokia apps are a bit limited compared to Android and iphone, but there are plenty and I have yet to say "I wish there was an app for this!"  Nokia GPS has performed VERY well too, even re-routing us around a road closure shortly after a huge wreck!The only thing the US version is lacking is Asian language support.  Nokia has dropped the ball by limiting language.  Evidently there are fixes, though it's not easy.The camera takes consistently great pictures, and video quality is good.  Two issues, though.  There is no LED light to light up dark scenes for video.  The camera flash is great, but red-eye is pretty bad.  I hope new software improvements with the Belle OS will improve this.If you're looking for a phone with a camera that can replace a dedicated point-and-shoot camera, this is absolutely it.Price paid: $299 on black Friday
