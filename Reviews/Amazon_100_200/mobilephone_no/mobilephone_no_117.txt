I am an infrequent cell phone user so after a year of not having a cell phone, I decided to take the plunge yet again.  After a lot of research I decided to get this Samsung phone.  When I received it, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The phone was much smaller than the picture indicates, it fits in my jeans pocket with no problem!  So far, I've had it about a week and the phone is pretty clear, no problems connecting.  I've even downloaded some free ring tones.  So far very happy, no-frills service, I received the phone, turned it on and was ready to make calls immediately.
