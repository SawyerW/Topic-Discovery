I got this to replace my SonyEricsson c510, i have been a SonyEricsson user for years now.This is my first nokia phone.  Always heard and read good things about them but this one was a disappointment...Call quality is annoyingly terrible, there is a noise present as if you have the loudspeaker on when you talk normally, i think something is wrong with the microphone on these models.One reviewer said it felt cheap and it is, the back cover is stainless steel, would be nice if it fits - its loose and it moves when you handle the phone. Slider is loose although all sliders are.The case it came with in the box is too small to use so its usless.The phone does have a ton of features though but build is nowhere close to SonyE.I got this for half price at another retailer so i dont feel as bad but if i paid the going rate this baby would be going back right away.
