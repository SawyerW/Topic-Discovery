I will start by saying that it is 2013 and I had to give up the Palm Treo because HP stopped updating explorer and Google maps will not work otherwise.  HP please don't give up on this phone. It is the best functioning phone ever.  Also,  I have not seen a windows phone that makes sense since the Palm Treo.  MS make a phone that works like Android at least, but with all Office features.  That's all I want to say.PSThis is the only review I have ever posted on Amazon after years of buying product from this site (sorry vendors).
