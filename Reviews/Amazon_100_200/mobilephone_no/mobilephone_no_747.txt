This phone is great i have nothing bad to say about this phone but the customer service lacks in every category that makes this phone a 1 star. First of all NokiaUSA is just a bunch of idiots they do not fix nothing, they will return your broken phone to you even if is still under warranty and they do not care that you spent 400$ for a cell. Compared to Apple customer service is like night and day Apple will swap any phone or ipad broken screen or not. They lost my phone under warranty on their possession and they do not want to give me a replacement for it. Their customer service in India is so bad i have to call the corporate office in NY. They still have not replace my phone that was lost by them. DO NOT BUY A NOKIA PHONE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEND TO YOU.
