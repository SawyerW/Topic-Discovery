I've had my N-8 for 3 months now.Its the best phone that I ever had.I opted not to go with i-phone 4 and  replaced my i-phone 3g with the Nokia N-8.It's a no-brainer. So many pluses to this phone over the i-phone and it has an ample supply of useful Apps.Lots of free one as well.It performs very well while multitasking with "several" Apps running concurrently.The 12 mp camera and H-D video is off the meter. Taking professional pictures with a cell phone is insane.It does all of the things I wished my i-phone 2g then 3g could never do and it's half the cost of an unlocked 32 gig i-phone 4.I use a 32 gig micro-sd card along with the on board 16 gig internal memory. Music, videos, pictures movies, and everything else is never a problem.I give this phone my highest recommendation. If you decide to invest in this phone, I'm certain you absolutely love it.
