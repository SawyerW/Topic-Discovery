Well...I thought I was purchasing a refurbished blackberry...but when I got the package today I opened it to discover a brand new, never used, still in the sprint box sealed up tight phone.  I activated it with Sprint, no problem and have already made a couple of calls with it.  Size is perfect and I owned a blackberry years ago and really liked it.  I like the keypad and the navigation button is nice and smooth.  If this little dynamo works out, I'll be turning in my piece of junk galaxy 3s and sticking with a phone that may not have as many bells and whistles, but is at least durable and has better battery life.
