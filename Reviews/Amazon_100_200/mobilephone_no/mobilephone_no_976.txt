I bought this because I've always been a fan of Ericsson phone. I previously had the Xperia X10a and when it broke (to no fault of the phone) I decided to upgrade to the Arc. This phone is slick and gorgeous to look at and the high-definition screen is crisp and clear. The display is far more responsive than most of the phones I've used, too. As usual, Sony Ericsson's efforts show in their heavily modified version of Gingerbread (and the available Honeycomb update). The music player, video player and camera are greatly improved over the default Android programs stylistically and functionally. The high resolution camera makes this phone better than the stand-alone camera I already had. This phone also includes programs that noticeably boost the sound and image capabilities. Everything else has been aesthetically improved and additional Ericsson created apps turn the phone into a wholly integrated social device. Yet, all of the modifications do not interfere with the capabilities of the phone. You are still free to modify and fiddle with it to your hearts content. Receiving it unlocked ensured I'd be getting the complete functionality of the device (e.g. tethering and compatibility with my provider).
