I've had this phone for two weeks now and after a minor learning curve with Nokia's Symbian operating system, I must say I'm very impressed. For $200 and no contract, this is an excellent deal.First off, it looks gorgeous (I have the ultramarine blue) and feels great in the hand with the slightly rubbery plastic case. The display, though smallish, is beautiful and while it's not a touchscreen, it's very easy to move around the various menus with the D-pad.Connectivity is great and the phone always offers different ways of getting on-line. Wi-fi, T-Zones (I use T-Mobile) and Edge all work seamlessly. The phone, in most applications, will ask how you want to connect. The phone supports G3 on ATT's network, but not on T-Mobiles.All the usual functionality is there: great email support, various messaging protocols, calendar, nice media player, decent camera, Bluetooth, App Store, Google Maps (no satellite GPS, just cell tower triangulation), very nice web browser, movie player and a ton of stuff I haven't figured out yet.I highly recommend this phone. If you already have ATT or T-Mobile service, it's a no-brainer in the unlocked smartphone realm.
