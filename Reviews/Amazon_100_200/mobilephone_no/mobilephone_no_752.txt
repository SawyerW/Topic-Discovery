i was skeptical at first Cuz so many ppl saying there's alot of problems with this phone but I've owned it for over 4 month now and I've had very few problems that a simple restart fixed, and after trying ios i found the N8 to to be more customizable and nice looking os and also the camera has been better than any phone I've seen (possibly close to some digital). With all the new updates from nokia this has just gotten better and compared to other phones n other areas there isn't as many apps in the app store bu i've found everything thats important as far as apps and it can be a bit slow at times compared to new phones from 2012 but the phone does hold up pretty well against the competition considering the phone is two years older and half the price as most new high end phones and also this phone does alot out of the box that on other os you' have to download apps.Overall this is a good phone for the price,p.s. I am currently using the phone to type this review.
