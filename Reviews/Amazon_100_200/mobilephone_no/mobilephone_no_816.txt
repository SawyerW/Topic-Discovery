What's good:  you can drop this phone without breaking its screen (gorilla glass), the picture/video quality is excellent, calls are clear both ways, 16 gb built-in memory, good-quality music player, free GPS.What's bad:  Glitchy (even with the update, this phone will freeze sometimes and may seem slow compared to the new iPhone and Android-based phones), limited app store (it's nothing like what Apple or Android have to offer), software is not intuitive (everything from the internet browser to the picture gallery requires many steps in order to be used), slippery (several other reviewers and I found the aluminum exterior to have a fairly bad grip--getting an O T T E R case for about $10 is highly recommended).Verdict:  If you want an unlocked phone for under $300, this is probably your best bet.  I use it on an unlocked phone service provider, SIM ple mobile and pay $40/month with unlimited talk, text, and internet (fairly slow).  I also bought a SIM card while I was in Eastern Europe and the phone worked perfectly fine while I was there.  Get it if you want to save money and don't mind slower internet speeds and occasional restarts.
