I must say I got this cell phone for my mother who's around her sixties and she hates advanced phones so she was looking for something simple. So I got on Amazon searching for her favorite phone color which is Pink and found this phone that was ATT and unlocked. Then I immediately showed her and she fell in love with it because it was something simple and basic she can use when she needs to keep in contact with all her family. When the phone arrived it was a very nice phone and something anyone can figure out. Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication.
