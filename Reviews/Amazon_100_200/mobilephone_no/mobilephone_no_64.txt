DO NOT BUY FROM ATT, Ive been with them for 4 months and they have yet to send me a correct bill. Their customer service Lie to you about what they can and can't do to fix your issues. I have spent 12 hours on the phone with their customer service to fix their billing issues and they will give no compinsation for my pain. Furthermore i told them they were in breach of contact and i wanted out since they have yet to give an accurrate bill. They said that would cost me 400 dollars. No Arbitaition, no customer service what so ever. They cant even be sure that they have fixed the issue. I WILL BE SWITCHING as soon as my contact is up. Look for a nice set of these phones on Ebay in about 8 months.Craig - Sacramento CA
