i do not look new,looks used.  i order and pd for a new Motorola RAZR V3 U.S version with warranty (NEW).  there where no pking slip, no warranty, or instructions in the box.  ph msg and notes in french or some other lang.  clled cust serv no help at all.  he told me to google or ck the internet to change lang to english or order another ph that he was sure "it's unlikely the same thing would happen twice", can u believe he told me that.  if u need help dont look for it from reps CHADWICK, he was no help at all.  so im rtning the ph and get one else where.
