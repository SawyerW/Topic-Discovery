This phone is good overall. It lets you do every thing I would expect from a smartphone at a low price. However, you should remember this is an old phone and it's not even supported anymore by Sony Ericsson. It comes with the latest Android version supported for this: 2.1. What bothers me the most about that is that you need Android 2.3 or more to be able to install apps in the microSD card, and the internal storage is very limited in this phone. In the specs I've seen it says it supports 16 GB microSD cards, but I'm using it with a 32 GB class 10 card without a problem.Physically the phone is compact and sturdy. A friend of my even was thrown into a pool with this phone in his pocket and as soon as the phone dried it started working again. Another friend didn't have such luck with his Samsung SII. Two thing I don't like about the design is that you cannot remove the battery and the cap for the USB cable, which gets impossible to remove.
