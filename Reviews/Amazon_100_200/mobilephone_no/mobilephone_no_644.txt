At first, I was very excited about this cellphone: 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, 5mpx camera, touchscreen, but unfortunately, battery life is very short (this appears to be common for Android devices), it's also too slow to respond and apparently simple things like adding a new contact may turn out to be desperately slow. It could be related to the MotoBlur feature, which at first appears to be very exciting to use, but not that much after a while using this device. And the seller makes no statement about the 3G bands used by this phone, so I learned that I couldn't use it with my (then) current operators and I had to buy a new SIM card from the sole operator that uses that band in my country. Bottomline: until Motorola releases an Android version that actually takes advantage of the hardware features of this phone, I do not recommend this cellphone to anyone.
