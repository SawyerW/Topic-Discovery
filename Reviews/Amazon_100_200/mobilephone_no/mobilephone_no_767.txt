Ok I have only had mine a day so far but I love this phone. I am not what you would call a phoneista because I only need my phone for a few things and I am satisfied (check email, facebook, text, call & a very important one on the list take pictures) well considering pictures are high on my priority list this phone is the perfect fit for me hands down. I was a bit nervous not having a keyboard for the first time because I have never owned a touch phone because of my nails, but after only 24 hours I am getting the concept that a light touch with the ball of your finger will do the trick, that doesnt mean I don't make a few typing mistakes but all in all thats minor.I cant wait to put this camera to the test in 2 weeks I am taking off for Jamaica and I am gonna get fabulous pics and videos. (happy customer)
