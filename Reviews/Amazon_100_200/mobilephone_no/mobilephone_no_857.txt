OK so i got this for Christmas last year because my other phone was awful. and i love this phone. its perfect to fit in your back pocket if your wearing pants and it perfectly fits in your hand. plus it looks so cool i get compliments on it all the time. i love it. the catch is, i don't know why, but randomly it will restart. it won;t be dead or low battery or anything it will just restart. :/ don't know why but it always goes back to normal quickly so its not really that bad, but its restart sound is loud so t can get annoying. but no worries it doesn't do it a lot. but otherwise its great- good quality, gets WiFi, good resolution, takes pics pretty well, easy to use and fun! i would definitely recommend to teens everywhere.
