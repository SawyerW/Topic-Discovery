I got this phone yesterday after a long search for a good phone with the features am looking for. I got instant liking to this phone and this is the best phone I ever had. MP3 player is fantastic. Comes with 64MB RSMMC card, which is insufficient for the features this phone is having. Atleast 512MB card is required. Camera and Video features are great and are above average which is more than sufficient for a cell phone. Though looks little bit bulky, the features it is having makes you forget that. Transfered some files thru bluetooth capability of my laptop into RSMMC, and connection is good without any interruptions. Amazon promptly shipped the phone once they got go ahead from Cingular. Cingular took 5-7 days to approve the connection. Signal reception is very good and till now didn't experience any dropped calls. There are so many features to explore in this phone. Overall this is a great phone to have at a steal away deal Amazon is offering.
