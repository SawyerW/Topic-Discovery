This was my first time purchasing an unlocked phone and an iphone, so I don't have anything to compare to. From the time I put in the sim card to try the phone out I immediately knew I didn't like the phone. I am not tech savy in regards to cell phones so I don't know all of the terminology but my previous phone which I loved was a HTC EVO and way superior in my opinion. I don't know if it's just the unlocked phone that was lacking but the phone is completely not worth it. I will be purchasing another droid ASAP... I basically wasted my $$ on this phone. The apps run super slow (if they work at all), forget about gps could NEVER get a signal, browsing is super slow, not as sleek in design as I would expect of an iphone, this phone is basically worthless to me.
