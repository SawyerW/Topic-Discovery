This product is a one star item because...1) It has a convoluted interface. If you need to make phone calls on the go, DO NOT buy this phone. You need at least two eyes and a few minutes to navigate the interface.2) The screen attracts dust or something. You can clean it, wipe it, pretty much anything, and it just stays greasy.3) The keypad is tiny. Once again, if you text message on the go, DO NOT buy this phone. You will need a microscope, stylist pen, patience, and more than a few minutes to make a simple message.In closing, there are other annoying things about this phone; I would end up making an essay if I listed all of them. This phone was given to me to make my life easier. It just ended up being a constant frustration and has been returned. By the way, I am LOVING the simplicity of the iPhone now. Good luck if you buy this item!
