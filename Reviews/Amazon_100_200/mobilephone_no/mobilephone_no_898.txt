So i ordered this phone as a temporary phone until I can use my iphone again....i had a sidekick all thru high school and it was my all time favorite phone! so i decided to get this one bc any touch screen phone other than the iphone sucks in my opinion lol so anyway i ordered this phone yesterday and received it today. Its brand new and it was boxed great! only problem is the home screen is not set up like the other ones and I do not see a way to get facebook or aim? im not sure if because its a unlocked phone they somehow changed the layout but if theres a way to fix it the help would be great!
