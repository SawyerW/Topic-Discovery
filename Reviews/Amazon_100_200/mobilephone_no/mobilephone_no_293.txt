I got my phone in a week after ordering, it was in good condition, but it did not come with an instruction booklet, SIM card or charger. I went to my local T Mobile office to check out the phone before keeping the purchase, they said it was in working condition and was in good shape as a replacement phone.  I am still having issues in setting up the phone with all the features is comes with. The alarm feature does not always work and I does not always ring when a phone call is coming in.  I liked my phone which was pickpocketed on Mother's day not this replacement.
