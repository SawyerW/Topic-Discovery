My boyfriend has this phone and it is so neat I've never owned a phone like this but as soon as I can I will have one just like it. Everyone that sees it goes crazy over it and wants one but none of them has went to get one yet! My boyfriend's boss asks him to use it all the time because the one he has he can't use it because it just won't get out anywhere. So like I said this is an excellent phone to have you don't need a house phone when you have this one. My boyfriend's boss has Verizon and doesn't like it at all. Thank You Sincerly Robin L.
