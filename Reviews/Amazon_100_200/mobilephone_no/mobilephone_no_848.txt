I bought an unlocked Motorola Flipout from Ebay, i'm sure its the same situation with the unlocked ones you buy from AmazonThese things are GREATThey're so rare, its a 2% you'll see someone else with this phone, they dont sell these anymoreThis thing is so small, but sooo niceperfect for your fingersThis is not for gamers. I tell you RIGHT NOW, almost all the games crash, even with my 1gb sd card, the apps work though, not the gamesThis doesn't matter to me because I use my ipod touch for gamingThis things wifi is a charmThe only thing is that it automatically uses data regardless if you have a data plan or not, so with Tmobile I added a data plan, 10$, for one month, if you buy it for one month they let you add a DATA block after the 1 monthso now its impossible for me to use up data and have chargersnow this wifi works like an ipod touch's wifiit's great.The keyboard is perfect, love the keys, very well madeVery loud speaker, and I LOVE THE 3.5mm jackmakes life easierThis thing is beast, and its so worth the moneyGo for it.
