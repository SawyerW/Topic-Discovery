I recently bought the NOKIA E6 and have to say that its all I wanted from a combination touchscreen and qwerty. The Symbian Anna OS is very responsive and precise, the browser is superb and easy to input URL address, save bookmarks and scroll between open pages. It supports one exchange account and multiple gmail and other services emails, push email is easily enabled in the settings for both exchange and gmail accounts. The keyboard is superb, better than E71, as the buttons are somewhat wider and tactile perception is superb. 8 MP camera pics are great and easy to share to with social networks and by email. Overall I am highly satisfied with this touchscreen qwerty combo in the E71 form.
