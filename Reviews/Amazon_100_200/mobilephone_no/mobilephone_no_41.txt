After purchasing this phone with extended warrenty from Radio Shack and owning it for less than 9 months, the hinge on the antena side broke.  When it was sent in to be fixed UNDER WARRENTY I received a call back stating that the part was NOT covered and that even though the phone showed no signs of abuse that it was my fault that the hinge broke.  It looks to be a factory defect on that side after speaking with the Sprint store in town, however it has not been recalled... I would NOT recommend getting this phone unless you can afford to be with out a phone for 2 weeks while the company gives a poor reason as to why they can't repair it under warrenty. For the company to repair the phone it will cost $76.00. I am in the process of reading back through the warrenty and sales slip. Ultimately, I will be shopping for a different phone in the near future.
