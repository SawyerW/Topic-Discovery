As a phone it has everything it needs to have.As a smartphone lacks some features, but hey! it only costs U$S 260 for year-and-a-half-old model (@ July 2011). If you want more power, more bandwidth, better 3G features, front camera, buy another smartphone... with its U$S 160 to 500 increment ;).The touchscreen works perfectly, no missed calls, no missing files, zero problem. Very recommendable.This review was about the phone not the OS, so the only two things I will say about the OS is the following:1) no trouble upgrading to Android 2.3.4. (Nice and easy: only one touch).2) Take your time navigating Android Market or another application market for Android. Its mindblowing the offer they have for both paid and free applications. 10 points for Android Community!
