I have been nothing but pleased with this phone.  In the past, I always got the cheapo freebie phones whenever I renewed my plan, but this time decided it was time to upgrade.I haven't had any of the problems some people have mentioned -- The color screen is nice, I can actually hear the phone ring in my purse, and its tiny so I can even slip it in my pocket without it stabbing me in the gut.And, yeah, it doesn't have a camera, but thats not a feature that I need as I already have a digital camera.I think its a good buy overall.  I have been pleased with it.And, T-Mobile's phone service is outstanding and you get more for your money.  600 minutes a month a free nights and weekends and truly no roaming for $39.99.  You can't beat that with a stick!
