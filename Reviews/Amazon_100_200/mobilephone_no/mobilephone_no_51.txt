I like the phone. Cool features like Bluetooth, IR, Camera(sort of) and a colorful screen(at night).But ATT Customer Service is HORRIBLE, JUNK, WASTE. (Cann't think of any more words worst than this). It's more than a month since I requested them to transfer my number from Sprint, but in vain. I have to carry two phones all the time. At times it has taken me more than an hour to reach a human being on the ATT customer service line. VERY RUDE & HARSH Service. NOT AT ALL HELPFUL.AMAZON should stop selling ATT Service, otherwise they might spoil their reputation.Hope someone from ATT reads this review.
