I recently made the switch from a yearly contract with another cellphone service provider to Tracfone.  I purchased the LG800G from Tracfone and was about to purchase the 1 year, 400 minutes card from them as well.  I decided to check Amazon first and I'm glad I did.  Tracfone (and pretty much everywhere else I checked) was selling these minutes for around $99, but Amazon (from CardArt/Veronica Tablet) had it for just $75.  I received the card fairly quickly and was able to add the minutes/service to my phone with no problems at all via Tracfone's website. I was also able to use one of Tracfone's current promos to get an additional 200 bonus minutes.  Add to this the fact that the LG800G comes with TRIPLE lifetime minutes and this works out to be a pretty sweet deal of 1400 minutes for only $75.  Thanks Amazon and CardArt!
