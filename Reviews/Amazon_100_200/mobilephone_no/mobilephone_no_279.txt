Everything that these other reviewers have said about the battery life being very short is absolutely true, but I haven't seen anything anywhere written about the horrendous sound quality of the ringtones! Not the (el lame-o) ones included on the phone; they sound OK. But if you download music ringtones (whether they are free or purchased), it sounds like GARBAGE. Incredibly distorted and waaaay too much high end, you won't often be able hear this one ring after adjusting the EQ to sound halfway decent. If you leave the EQ in any of the normal modes (rather than customizing it), it sounds like an AM radio turned up all the way...only without the volume. I actually thought that my speaker was blown and exchanged it for a new one (another NEW one, not a refurb), and it sounds just as crappy. All this added to the short battery life, which I wouldn't have minded at all if the sound quality had been better, makes this a "no-go"!
