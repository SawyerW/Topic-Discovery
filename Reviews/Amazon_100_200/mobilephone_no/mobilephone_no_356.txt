This E63 is good if you do not want to be locked into another 2 year contract with a phone company. The phone works pretty good for the price I got from purchasing from amazon, I am suppose to be getting a $50 rebate from Nokia so the purchase at the time was a decent value for a smart phone. (it has been 8 weeks and I have not seen the rebate yet so I may change my opinion on value :-)I do like my old Blackberry phone better for some of their features but for the price, this Nokia E63 does the job. Be sure to order the CA101 cable from amazon if you decide to purchase, Nokia in their dumb wisdom do not include this "must have" cable with the packaging.
