I have to say that I had my doubts about purchasing this product post-the Elop announcement - but in the end I caved in and received a powerful smartphone with a spectacular  optical lens.  Rather than extolling the virtues of the hardware I will comment, having been an owner of an N85 in the past, that Nokia's Symbian ^3 contains incremental improvements in UI and ease of use while still remaining to the delight of its fan base a very familiar OS to use.  The hardware of this device speaks for itself - those that also know how to take advantage of and feel familiar around Symbian will no doubt be entertained and satisfied.  As a precaution however, the N8 does NOT feel anything at all like an iPhone with respect to UI nor does it presume to command a similar resource rich environment as Apple's App Store.  In summary I was sold on this device with respect to a) an improved Symbian UI, b) a 12 MP Carl Zeiss optical lens and c) an unlimited use of Ovi Maps without data requirements from the network carrier.
