I've just tested this phone in a store, it was better than expected, considering the Nokia E71 and the BlackBerry 9000 and 9780 have been part of my resources for benchmarking mobile phones.  As usual, Nokia brings a very useful tool for the interested in working on the road or during vacations, but also using it as a tool for complementing vacations and  headache free trips while having documents and information necessary to have a plan almost for any activity.  Many other comments must read and reviews must be searched, but this may be one of the best options, even for those like me are looking very carefully the touchscreen alternative with a qwerty included. Also consider the E5 if budget is a limitation.Una mejora sin duda de el E71, considere el E5 si su presupuesto lo requiere, pero de otra forma es una excelente alternativa.
