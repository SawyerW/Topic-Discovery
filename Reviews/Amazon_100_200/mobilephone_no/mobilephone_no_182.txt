This is a very attractice phone....you know...friends and family all wanting to check it out saying its cool and stuff....you wouldnt find that in a nokia.....you know people would say oh well...just another nokia (my opinion...)  No disrespect to nokia. Some are Cool.  Back to the phone.  I dont know why people are complaining.  For me, battery life is great, i messed around with the camera taking pictures and deleting them for about 4 1/2 hours and not one link on the battery went down.  Amazon shipped this phone to me in 2 days with the free shipping. Totally Awesome phone.  Nice color display.  My only regret is to download ringtones (some you actually enjoy) cost $2.50 to download one mp3 ringtone! thats crazy.  I would recommend this phone to anyone who has any doubts about buying it.
