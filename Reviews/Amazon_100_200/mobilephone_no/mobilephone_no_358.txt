PROS:- WiFi Connectivity- Usable with personal headphones, BlueTooth- LightweightCONS:- Mediocre battery life (can be attributed to usage)I bought this phone for its WiFi capabilities. I needed a phone which was compatible with Skype as I do long distance calls with this program. I am very pleased with my purchase. My only gripe is the mediocre battery life, which I think is due to the WiFi and BlueTooth modules being constantly on, plus the fact that I occasionally  use it for 4 hours straight playing MP3s at the office. I should experience better battery life if I use those 2 modules only as needed.
