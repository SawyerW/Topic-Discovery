I purchased this phone for my dad. It has started giving trouble in about 10 months. Although it was never 'misused', or dropped on floor, but still it turns off by itself, sometimes while talking, and the call gets disconnected. Sometimes while on the charger, it turns off. My dad had a similar phone before which lasted much longer, but unfortunately was destroyed in an accident. I got this similar one for him as he liked it and was familiar with its use, but I am disappointed by the quality of this second purchase. Maybe it was because you get what you pay for. The cheap price ($ 35/-) gave the cheap quality??
