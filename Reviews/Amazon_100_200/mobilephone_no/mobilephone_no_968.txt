I bought this for my daughter to replace the phone that came with the att plan we got in. She hated not having a qwerty keyboard. All in all, she likes the phone as a user, but when talking to her, there is a humm in the background coming from her new phone. It does not bother her so she is keeping the phone. But any one that calls her gets the humm in the background, kind of like static. It is not bad enough to interfere with the conversation, but it is a bit annoying. There is also an issue with picture messaging that I haven't resolved yet, she only receives the first half of a picture in a picture message. Not sure about that one yet.
