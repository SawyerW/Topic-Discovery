I bought this for someone who works in construction. It falls on a daily bases and has not taken any damage to date. The writing on the screen is kinda small and cannot be adjusted. It is also impossible to remove the phone from the belt clip before it stops ringing. And you can't use it in the clip since the clip covers some of the buttons. The charger and the headset uses two different ports yet the connector is exactly the same. These ports are also located next to each other sometimes causing confusion, especially in the dark.UPDATE** After just 6 months the rubber case has begun peeling off. Other folks at work are complaining about the same issue and Sonim says its cosmetic damage and the warranty does not cover cosmetic damage although the peeled of parts means that the device is no longer water and dust proof.
