Wow!  What a spectacular phone!  From clarity of the screen to clarity of the calls, this service beats all other cell phone providers by a mile.  I have never had a cell phone that I can use in elevators before, or in basements, or in the middle of the woods- but this one works in all those places (and for all those who complain about it not working in your house sometimes, move out of the boondocks- all cell services have a few black holes)!  Not only is the cell phone service great, but the walkie talkie feature is creative, convenient and useful.  Some complain about the larger phone styles- but the ruggedness of the phones are so worth it (I have dropped mine a million times and it has never even flinched at working).  I will never have another cell phone service! Now you can even keep your cell phone number when you switch to Nextel!
