It's a great smart-phone for the price (in fact it costs the double here in Dominican Rep.), it has a lot of needed-application, the interface is very user-friendly, the battery life is powerful, the keyboard is comfortable, solid built although is plastic it feels resistance, WI-FI, Quick Office, PDA, a 3.5 mm standard connector, micro-sd memory, wireless keyboard, this smart-phone was exactly what I was looking for a device where I could satisfy my business and personal necessities... what I didn't like was the lack of a micro-usb cable, the lack of a volume rocker, gps and decent stereo headset the one who comes in the box literally sucks but it's understood because of the price... I highly recommend this wonderful smart phone for people who wants a very good smart phone but has low budget.
