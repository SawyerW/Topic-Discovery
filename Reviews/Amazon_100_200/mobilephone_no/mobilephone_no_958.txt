This phone sounded good in the write-up, but once we received it, we could see that it is very poor quality.  It is very light weight, and the materials used are extremely thin and flimsy.  You kinda know it's not going to last as soon as you take it out of the box.  I got this for my daughter, and it started dropping calls, and turning itself off after a few weeks of use.  It then started the annoyting habit of scrambling the screen, so nothing could be read.  It developed a buzzing noise that was very disruptive while in the midst of a call.  There are so many low priced phones that are undoubtedly better than this one.  I took it in to T Mobile to purchase a SIM card, and they said it was a promotional for ATT that got very poor ratings and was not offered for long because of it's inferior manufacture and service.  In reality, we used this phone for about four months, then replaced it.  Don't waste your money.
