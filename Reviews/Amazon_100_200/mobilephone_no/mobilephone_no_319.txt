I purchased an Iphone, the second day, I looked down and had no screensaver.  after touching the screen I noticed that it was asking me if I wanted English, then USA, then it was telling me to please reboot using ITunes.  I did this and phone worked.  It later would not let me send messages. button would not work.  Then I had the rebooting problem again.  After the third time, of reboot all in a week of purchase, I contacted vendor,he suggested I go into the Apple store with it.  They were not nice, said I probably bought bootleg or refurbished phone.  After I told them where it was purchased.  They suggested I get my money back.  I am still waiting on my reimbursement.  As for as I am concerned Apple and IPhone can drop off the face of the earth.  This was not a good experience for me.
