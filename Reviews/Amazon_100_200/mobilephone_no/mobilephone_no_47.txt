The phone may have been good, I would have found out if Sprint ever activated my service. After more than five weeks of waiting for them to transfer my cell phone number from another carrier and literally spending hours on the phone (mostly on hold) with them I gave up and cancelled. I routinely spent over an hour on hold to speak to a customer service agent, who could never actually resolve anything, although some did share that it is common with them to take more than 30 days to transfer phone numbers. I had heard Sprint had poor customer service, and now wish I had taken it seriously.
