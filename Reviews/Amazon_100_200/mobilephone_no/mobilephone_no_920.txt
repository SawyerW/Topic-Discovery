I received my Samsung T139 today!  I had a T139 cell prior to ordering this one.  However, I accidently washed mine when I forgot to check my pockets and threw my jeans in the washer (hate to admit, but it happens)!  EcoCell provided me with excellent service, prompt delivery, perfect packaging, and a totally great product!  Thank you, EcoCell for being so prompt.  I can now retire my husband's old phone (which is an extremely old model that I am not used to) that I was borrowing until I received my replacement T139 cell.  If it were possible, I would absolutely give EcoCell and the cell phone ten stars!!!
