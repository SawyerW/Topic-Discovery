I needed a replacement phone for my Verizon account. After discovering how expensive new phones can be, I started searching Amazon. I don't do much on my phone outside of calling and the occasional text, so I didn't need anything fancy. I came across this phone and am so glad I purchased it! The sound quality is 100 times better than the free phone I had just received when I signed my contract and the pictures on the phone (I never take pictures off the phone) display beautifully.My only negatives involve the texting capability. The keyboard is set up a little bit awkwardly, but it is still definitely useable. It just takes some getting-used-to. Also, the menu function for texting is a little clunky and cumbersome. Its easy to figure out, just seems to have some extra steps for every text you send ...Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase it again, if necessary.
