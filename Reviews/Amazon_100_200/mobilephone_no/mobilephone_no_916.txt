Ordered the Samsung T139 because of the low price, it was unlocked, I prefer a clamshell, it had Bluetooth and a speakerphone. However, I live in a fringe area and the signal reception was unreliable.  The phone showed 0 or 1 bar most of the time.  Other than that, it had everything I needed.Went and purchased another new model Samsung (also G2) from T-Mobile and the signal strength was the same.  I returned that new model.Tried out an LG GD570 and the signal was at least twice as strong and G3.  I'm going with the LG and will keep the T139 as a backup as it didn't cost much.  However, the LG has a tremendous amount of features that will keep you busy setting things up for days! It also works great with Microsoft Sync except no texting.
