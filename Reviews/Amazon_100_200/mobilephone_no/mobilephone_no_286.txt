This phone is the single worst phone I have ever used. Honestly, this phone makes me miss my old Nokia 5190 brick just because of its simplicity. The Treo is a pretty decent PDA and good for making calendars, but the sync function (especially via Bluetooth) is pretty bad, and its cell phone capabilities are even worse.The most important function of a phone - picking up calls - simply DOESN'T WORK. If you are writing a text message or trying to call someone and receive an incoming call, the whole phone freezes for about 30 seconds and just sits there. I have missed more calls in the last 8 months than the last 8 years because of this phone. It just doesn't pick up! I personally blame Windows mobile for making the whole thing sluggish and unusable. Trying to do too many things means that it doesn't do anything well.If you want an organizer, great. But if you actually want a usable phone, don't even think about buying this slow, sluggish, non-responsive piece of junk.The best function of this phone was when I smashed it on my driveway. Very satisfying.
