I bought a E75 last Sat on Nokia Sale for $265 to replace my E51 that I really like. After 3 hours of use I decided to keep my E51 and sell this E75. Here is why.1. Cheaper plastic is used compare to E51. (THis E75 is made in China while E51 is made in Finland)2. Too heavy for my taste.3. Screen should be bigger.4 Voice quality is not as good as E51.5. The micro usb port feels fragile.The only thing I like about this phone is the Keyboard design ( Not the material they use to made the keyboard). For $265 this is one decent phone..but not @ $399!!I guess I will wait for E52/E55..
