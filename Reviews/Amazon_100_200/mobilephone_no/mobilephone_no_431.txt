A Tracfone 1 year of service card from retailers and tracfone.com amounts to $99.99 plus tax.The card I purchased from Amazon was $25.00 cheaper and worked perfectly.  My Tracfone phonedoubles the minutes of the card.  If you search on line for Tracfone promotional codes for extraminutes, one can even add more time.  Higher math:  400 minutes x 2 and 200 more minutes frompromotional code= 1,000 minutes (units) for $75.00 and the phone is activated for one year.  Some of the newer Tracfone phones offer triple minutes with every card purchased.  That beingstated, if you text or surf the web alot on your phone, you still may be better off with a 2 yearcontract from a major carrier.  Although, Net10 is an alternative.  Amazon is the greatest!
