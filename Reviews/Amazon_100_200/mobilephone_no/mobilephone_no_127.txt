Hi i just recieved this phone a few days ago. I am 13 years old and thought that the color and the size was cool so i got the phone. I ordered the sony ericsson t610 but heard it was no good so i rejected the delivery. Even though the e 105 lacks the now very common camera you have to ask yourself how much would you really use it? Sure there are some moments where you wish you had a picture but come on. this phone is very reliable yet has a few minor flaws. First of all, this isnt a big thing but, sometimes the screen stays black when you open it. other times when  you dial the numbers wont come up for a while. however the phone has many other features that are cool. I would recommend it over anything but the samsung e715 and the motorola v300. BUt overall it is a exellent phone and i would recommend it for the 80 dollars they give you to take it
