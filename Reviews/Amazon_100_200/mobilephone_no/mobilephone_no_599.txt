I bought this phone for my father back in November because he loves this phone and refuses to upgrade to a smart phone. Cost me 55 bucks to get it back then, he got it and used it for about a month and the screen just went black and stopped working. I was out of the country for the last 8 months so when I got back my father told me about the phone. I said no worries, it came with a 1 year warranty, I checked the page and lo and behold, I had a 1 year warranty, this was yesterday by the way. I sent a return request to them and they responded saying I only had a 90 day warranty with them, I went back to this product page to prove them wrong and the funny thing is they just removed the 1 year warranty on their product title and on their page. Coincidence? This company is selling trashy products that don't work, they are here just to rip you off and don't care whether or not your product works. Be wary, avoid this reseller.
