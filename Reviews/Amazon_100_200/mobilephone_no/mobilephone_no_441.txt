I am new to tracfone, however not to the mobile world, I had just purchased The LG235C, This was a basic phone, I was impressed with it's functions, Anyway I needed a card and looked at all of them.  For me it was the 1 year 400 minute, Thephone I purchased came with double minutes for life, and 400 minutes and 40 Bonus minutes, I activated it on line at Tracfone. Com and within about 10 minutes I had the phone activated and the display showed 840 minutes.  Keep in mind if you purchase a double or triple minute card the minutes will double however the bonus minutes do not. So far I could not be happier with the purchase, The phone works great and activation was a snap.
