I purchased 2, and both of them are still performing good..no problems so far..Pros:>good reception, conversations loud and clear on both ends>expandable memory>easy to useCons:>port connector for headphone will loosen in time as it did with my last 2 nokia phones.. will get bluetooth headset this time..>supplied headset very awkward to use, no adjustment mentioned in manual, I do not think many will like the design..mine will just stay in  the box.>somewhat big but still fit in my pocket>camera cover slide open to easy..increases battery comsumption if unaware its open, happened to me more than 3 times>average battery lifeall in all I am still happy with this phone...
