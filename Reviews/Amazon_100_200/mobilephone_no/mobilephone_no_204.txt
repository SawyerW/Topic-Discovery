I mean how can I complain... it was free with my service!Overall it is not a bad phone... it has plenty of options like text messaging and all that fun stuff... It has voice dialing (you know when you just say the name and it calls the person) if you feel like setting that up... A nice address book feature that allows you to store several numbers under one name and label them with cute icons like a house for home phone and a little cell for mobile phones etc...Sometimes it freezes up (kinda like computers) and you have to remove the battery to get it to work again!? What do you expect for free though?Major complaint: WHERE'S SNAKE??? I miss it! But there is a cute bowling game on it!It's a phone... it serves its purpose. It does not take pictures, but then again that's what cameras are for!
