Got this phone a few weeks ago...so here are my thoughts.Pros:Good call reception (AT&T;,NY region).Very solid build quality.Like the qwerty keyboard,great for text and email.Email set up a breeze.Fast user interface. No lag when opening apps.Nice display.Metal battery cover. Nice touch Nokia.Nokia included a suede phone case.Also included 4Gb memory card with Nokia PC Suite installer on it.So far phone works perfect. No "connection errors" like my N95.Cons: Ring tones could be louder but it not terrible.Camera not as good as the N95.Just a few interesting features on this phone.Has a bar code reader. Very cool. Funny thing is there isn't any mention of it in the owners manual.The scroll key blinks slowly when you get missed calls and messages. Nokia calls it a "breathing light".Overall very nice phone. If you want something different you can't go wrong with this phone.
