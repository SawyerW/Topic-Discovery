I just got this phone on Saturday the 27th of February 2010 and it has been nothing but perfect. I had an iPod touch and it worked ok, I could only sync note to outlook which I don't use and I can't delete music from the device but the nokia e63 is totally opposite, I use it as a flash drive. I can store anything on this phone and transfer it wirelessly to any computer via Bluetooth.  The phone is the perfect price at just $189 it is really affordable, the camera loads with in 3 seconds and takes great pictures for 2 megapixels. The email app was amazingly easy to setup and use. This is a great phone, it's not flashy at all and it works great. It's the perfect phone
