Looked for a phone with a QWERTY keyboard to be able to text lots easier, and wanted an unlocked phone to be able to use my T Mobile Prepaid To Go plan.  This phone works great, but here are my issues:  It has a 3.2 megapixel camera, but even though it was sold and shipped by Amazon, it did not arrive with the instructional cd nor the micro sd card for the camera.  So how is a person to learn what all these buttons do?  So far in the last 6 hours since it arrived, I am just winging it.  Had to go out and pay for my own micro sd card, and am searching online to find the instructional video.  Wish me luck !!!
