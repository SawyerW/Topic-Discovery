I bought for my mom, cause she is not very technological and this would be her first Android. I couldn't be there to give it in person, so every support that i gave her was by the phone. I was very surprise that  she got everything right away, connecting to wifi, installing apps, making phone calls, and even syncing with google account every contact.The phone itself its not fast, but that what you get for the price. Descent picture quality. Perfect for Blackberry user that are used to haven a candy bar phone with the qwerty keyboard. Touch screen its a plus, cause it helps new user (like senior person) to get used to touch the screen to trigger an action.
