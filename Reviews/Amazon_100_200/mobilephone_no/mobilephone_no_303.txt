i am using my mobile phone mainly to write emails and surf the net. as far as emails are concerned, the phone is great - since the keyboard makes typing even longer messages a breeze.yet this phone has a number of really big problems:1) the battery life is abysmal - with moderate use the phone barely lasts 12 hours without charging2) the screen is too small. The numberpad just below the screen is useless - space that should have been used for making the screen larger.3) symbian, the operating system used on Nokia smartphones feels outdated in face of the competing systems like the Iphone OS or Android.
