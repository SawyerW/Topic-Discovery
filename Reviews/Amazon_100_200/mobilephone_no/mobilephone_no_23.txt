AT&T uses two frequencies for GSM service.  Originally they only used GSM1900 but as the old analog and TDA 850 MHz networks are made obsolete they are being converted to GSM850.  The SX56 supports GSM1900 (and GSM900 for roaming in Europe) but not the newer GSM850 service.  As time goes on AT&T will enhance their GSM850 coverage but there are reports that they've done all they're going to do to improve GSM1900 coverage.  So if you're lucky your service will be OK but if you have any signal issues with this phone it won't get any betterI have the TMobile version of this phone and it works well on the TMobile network since TMobile only uses GSM1900 across North America.  But this SX56 version of the phone is sold "locked" to only operate on AT&T's network.This is a problem with many AT&T GSM phones but it's particularly an issue with the SX56 because there aren't any suitable replacements (yet) with comparable functionality that support GSM850.
