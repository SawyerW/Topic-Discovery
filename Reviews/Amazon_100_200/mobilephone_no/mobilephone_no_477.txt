Worst service in the world.  Have had it for years but it has really fallen off the edge of the world this year.  Have literally spent months trying to straighten out my activation date.  Have traveled the world by phone with a variety of "customer service representatives", none of whom were very easy to understand, on phone lines that broke up & added another dimension of garble. Bottom line, they wasted my time, did not help at all & I am looking for another provider.Also, I thought that when you requested being transferred to a USA help desk they had to transfer...these people said they had no way to do that.
