I've had this phone for awhile now and it has become one of my favorite phones.  I know it doesn't have a camera but I don't need a "camera phone".  I needed a good, durable phone for business and personal use.  Besides it being a great phone with PTT (walkie-talkie), web access, AOL IM, Two Way Text Messaging, and more - Nextel has a great network.  My experience with Nextel's customer service has been outstanding!  I highly recommend this phone and also Nextel service.  NOTE: If you're looking for a Nextel phone to fit in your little pocket, go look at the ...I think its the i830. They also make a camera phone.
