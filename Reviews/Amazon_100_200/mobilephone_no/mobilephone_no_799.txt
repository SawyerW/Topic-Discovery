UPDATE: I have the nokia 808 2 weeks ago. I bought it  because most of the samsung and htc phone don't come w/warranty. I think that this phone is much better than the n8, the screen is bigger, brighter,faster browsing. The camera sensor is big, but it take the best picture for a camera phone, better than any camera that have 8MP or more.For future buyers of N8 (made in finland). I bought this phone about 2mons ago. Went out on me a week ago. The camera do not process the picture, just blank green screen. the video part goes up to 7sec. then it stops & freezes. My calls are getting disconnected couple of times.Did everything from reinstall the belle software 5X to delete data & restore setting, but nothing work. I had to return the phone w/ a loss $$$  because i have no warranty from Nokia USA. I told amazon that this phone is defective and they waived my 20% restocking fee.
