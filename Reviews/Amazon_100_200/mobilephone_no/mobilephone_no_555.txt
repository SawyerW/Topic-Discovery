had to get at least one more, in case they stop making them being Motorola laid off a bunch of people too!! and said they will be cutting back on a lot of there products which is a shame!! because they always worked so well and lasted so long!! All the NFL,,,our service vehicles- police, fire, & State vehicles all had them. Love it and the color!!! just wish they would come out with one that has the SD card for more video and pictures, besides the Droid which I am sure is cool too just don't need all that and not paying the big bucks for it or a contract phone. For  me it is way cheaper going pre-paid/ go phone saves over $500.00+ a year!!! love it! more money for other things I need or bills to pay!!
