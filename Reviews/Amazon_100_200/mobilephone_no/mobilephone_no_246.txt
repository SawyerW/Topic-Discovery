I've owned the k700 (stolen), k750 (returned to employer when I quit), k800 (wife washed with clothes) and now the k810 and the k810 is the best of the lot. Round buttons are easier to use than old square ones, camera (with excellent flash) takes detailed photos, and I find the software much easier to use than Nokia, Siemens or Motorola. k810 is also thinner than earlier k series, camera cover less lumpy, and phone feels very solid. Screen is very bright and sharp, and scratch resistant. I have a 1 GB card in it, so I never worry about filling it up with photos, mp3s, etc., phone connects to windows, mac and linux via (supplied) USB cable. Battery goes almost a week on a charge with steady use.
