its really cool with lots of fun features. i like the look a lot and it is really easy to use. there are some features i dont like, the side buttons which are normally used to adjust sound make a status of your phone pop up that includes battery life and memory status. it has music capability but my speaker does not work... and i have never used it but i found out it was blown after my first test of trying to listen to music. it slides decet but scrapes on itself and ruins the blue backing on the edges. Im probably just a little rough with my phone but i reccomend going to a store to get a closer look.
