I know, people expect all sorts of things from their phones. Me, I value small size and light weight very highly, along with good call quality. I don't need cameras, ring tones, web access, or any of the other bells and whistles, and after 14 months of use, I can say this phone fits the bill wonderfully.My one bone of contention, is that I also want the phone to substitute for a watch. In this modern age of electronics miniaturization, this doesn't seem like much to ask. The E105 has a handy time display on the outside screen - but not only is it not connected to any time server, it loses a couple minutes per month :-(. I replaced one phone for this reason alone, but the replacement is just as bad...
