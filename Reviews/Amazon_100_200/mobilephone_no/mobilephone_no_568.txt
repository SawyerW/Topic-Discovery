I really love every razr out their, but see here's the problem. This phone does NOT WORK WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. So if you are like me and wanted it and have Verizon, just buy the phone at verizon. This phone is not compatibe with the Verizon Wirless service. You need a SIM card for this phone, and with Verizon, it is computer autherized. Don't waste your money looking for it on Amazon, or on the internet. Save your self at least 200 $ and go to the store or Verizon Online. It is NOT WORTH IT. Other Than that little factor, I totally think you should go for this phone, (if your not Verzon!) but Beware Of the Dreaded Celly Phone.Don't fool your self over the UNLOCKED thing. It really doesn't make a difference.
