This phone is easy to use, is small enough to easily fit in a pocket, has a very good speaker phone, has a low SAR rating when used away from the ear, and is not very toxic with chemicals like most new cell phones are. If you have sensitivities to chemicals, especially new electronics, I highly recommend this phone. It was not hard to find the needed accessories. This was the best price I could find for it and it was delivered quickly. It has all the functions I require. If you want the latest and greatest, this may not be the phone for you. If you want a reliable less toxic phone that does all the basic functions- I highly recommend it.
