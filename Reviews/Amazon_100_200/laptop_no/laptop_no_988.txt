I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports. This laptop has only 2 USB ports, and they are both on the same side. But worst of all, they are too close to each other! I can't connect my printer AND my USB thumb drive at the same time. The ports are too close together! This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired. When will Apple fix this design flaw? It's a nice laptop, but I have to deduct points for such an elementary design flaw.
