My Macbook is 7 years old, which is nearly unheard of in PC world. It still works and it's extremely user friendly, so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things ;)My only complaint is that the CD drive is broken (it IS 7 years old!) and I can't update the OSX beyond 10.5.8 because 10.6 is only sold via disk on Apple.com. So, I can't upgrade to the newest version of Itunes or use other programs that require a minimum of OSX 10.6, which sucks.Other than that, I'm surprised it's still chugging along. I've only had to replace the battery once!Very happy with this product!
