The computer works fine and everything is as expected from mac.. though now i wish i would of spend a lil more more money for one with more juice.. but anyways.. it seems that these aluminum unibodied laptops all have the same problem.. that being that if you are using a wireless mouse that uses a usb mini connector have mouse issues! everything works fine when you are casually using it.. but if your  computer starts to actually work to get the fan on there is some time of either electromagnetic interference and it makes your mouse jump and skip all over your screen and THAT is very annoying.. specially if you are using this laptop for gaming of any sort.... SOLUTION! if you are buying this laptop...and using a wireless USB mini mouse buy a USB EXTENDER to hook up to usb mini to and get it away from the laptop... and problem gone... wish apple would fix this though!
