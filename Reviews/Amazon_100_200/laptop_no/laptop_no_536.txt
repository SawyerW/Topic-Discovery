I JUST BOUGHT MY MACBOOK AIR NOTEBOOK AND IT IS COOL. I LIKE THE DESIGN OF IT. I HAD A GATEWAY WINDOWS XP, WHICH I UPDATED TO WINDOWS VISTA THAN TO WINDOWS 7, BUT BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN. I DECIDED TO SWITCH TO A MAC TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, ALSO CAUSE I HAVE AN APPLE IPHONE 4. I LIKE APPLE'S PRODUCT, BUT I WOULDN'T GET A IPAD OR IPAD 2, SINCE I THINK THAT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. BACK TO THE MACBOOK AIR. FIRST THE DOWNSIDE, NO DVD HARDRIVE, BUT THAT IS OKAY, SINCE EVERYONE IS DOWNLOADING MOVIES ON ITUNES. I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING A APPLE PRODUCT AND HAVE  IPHONE, SKIP THE IPAD AND IPAD 2 AND GETT MACBOOK AIR, IT IS A GOOD NOTEBOOK. YOU CAN DO SO MUCH WITH IT. IT IS REAL LIGHT.
