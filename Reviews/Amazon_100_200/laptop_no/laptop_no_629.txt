From what I have read online, other people are having the issue of a display the dims and brightens at random and even though all the addaptive display items have been disabled and the machine is on AC power, ithe dimming continues.I have had this problem now since October 2012 and cannot find any resolutions posted online that work even though many people say they have the same issues. The drivers in this machine suck. I've already lost a lot of work when the machine went crazy one afternoon and the icons all got large and nothing would work. Samsung had me reinstall the original setup. None of this nor any of the subsequent updates have fixed the problem.I can't even pull up this laptop on Samsung's site to get drivers and such. IT's not in their list of Series 7 laptops. That should have been a hint something is wrong.I will try one more time to see if Samsung will acknowledge the issue and provide a fix. After that, if there is no resolution, I will officially be through with Samsung products...all of them.
