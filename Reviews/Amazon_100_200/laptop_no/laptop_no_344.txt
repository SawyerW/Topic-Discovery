If you are still pondering over getting a mac and have thoughts about missing windows, get over it. You will probably never use a windows machine ever again. A macbook is a perfect notebook and I have been using mac for a really long time.It is faster, better in performance, prettier, thinner than equivalent models from other manufacturers.The best thing of all is that you run MAC OS X. This operating system is way advanced than any other operating system and you can easily term it the best.Considering the price, it is almost the same as any other laptop and you will not need to buy any anti virus software either.Macbook pro is awesome, but I would call it pricey. Macbook is just right for anybody. Perfect 5 stars.
