On first seeing the mac, it looked great! There were only 2 scratches overall but they were hard to see and in no way effected its functionality. However, it was a year or so older than i had origially expected. It didnt come with facetime or its movie maker and wouldnt allow me to purchase them in the app store either. But over all i love my computer. My only problem is that, after a month or so, the charger stopped working with no explanation. I've tried everything but it refuses to work. Im in the Process now of purchasing a new charger.though the charger is being very annoying and time consuming, the computer works great and i really like it.
