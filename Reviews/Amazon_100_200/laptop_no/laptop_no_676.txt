It's not so easy to find a light, powerful 14" laptop with an optical drive these days.  This one fits the bill, although a blu-ray drive would have been a nice addition. I've been using it for about a month and am quite satisfied with its performance. I'm a photographer and this machine is my travel companion.  It has enough horsepower to handle Photoshop as well as video editting software (I'm not a gamer, so can't comment on how well it performs in that space).  The screen display is bright and the resolution is quite ok for my purposes. The build quality is very good.  WiFi connects everytime and stays connected.The only complaint I have, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, is with the trackpad.  Typing without the cursor jumping all over is difficult, although just this morning another trackpad driver was released (the second in 1 month).  After installing it, things seem better.Overall, this laptop is an attractive, solid performer in a reasonably small package.
