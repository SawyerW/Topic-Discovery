Bought this laptop as a Christmas gift and was pleased with the performance and features at the $399.00 I paid.I was a little surprised by the size of the laptop.  I guess I wasn't paying attention but the 15.6 inch diagonal results in a very large laptop.I personally prefer a smaller machine (I own a 10" netbook" but the person who received it loves the laptop and thinks the size is a plus.  You have plenty of real-estate on the screen for viewing content.  The laptop ended up with an overall Windows Experience rating of 3.2 but that was only for the Aero graphics.  Otherwise it would have been 5.2.  Gaming graphics scored well.  The machine has plenty of power and feels quite speedy.
