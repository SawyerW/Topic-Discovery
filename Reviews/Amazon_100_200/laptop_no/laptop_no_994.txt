I'm new to Mac's. I have other apple products (iPhone, iPad, iPods) and love them, so I jumped into purchasing this MacBook Pro. I was about to purchase the 15" retina, but found out there has been a lot of issues with the new screen. Didn't want to take the chance so I ordered this one and upgraded it myself. Has similar performance, but saved quite a bit of money. I put in 16 GB of ram and a 500 GB SSD. I've never upgraded  a computer myself before, and this couldn't have been easier. It is crazy fast and performs like a dream. I will never go back to Microsoft. This is  by far better than any other pc I've ever owned, and I always buy my pc's upgraded.
