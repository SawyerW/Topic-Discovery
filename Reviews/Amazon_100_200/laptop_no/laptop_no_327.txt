Although the 11.5 hours of battery life are more like 7/8 hs, the overall experience is positive. I had a problem with the laptop, and apparently i'm not the only one: battery was dead on arrival. I tried replacing the item with amazon but it was out of stock! So I contacted one of Asus Authorized Service Providers and I got it replaced in 5 days.The energy saving modes are complete but they mess up your desktop configuration (wallpaper, taskbar). After changing modes two or three times, I was unable to return to the original configuration. Will figure it out eventually.As for productivity, I'm a developer and it suits nicely. It allowed me to finish some coding while on the plane, with the compiler, database engine and so on working at the same time; without major lags.I still would have preferred to buy the 13" version, but Amazon was out of stock of those too.
