I have used the previous model to this the vaio vgn-sz650 which I thought was a great laptop. It was stolen and I have been looking at replacements. For the same price as my sz-650 these are the features sony has REMOVED from this new model.Removed PCMCIA slot (650 has both express and pcmcia)Removed 1 USB port, This machine only has 2 portsThe reason I have not purchaced this machine is the fact they changedthe key board and removed the PageUP, Down, Home and End keys fromthe keyboard. You now have to hold down the Fn key to get to thesefunctions, are really stupid thing to do on a machine without a fullheight display (only 900 pixels) where you will use this keys ALOT.I would recommend finding a used sz650 over this poorly designed machine.
