Long term I do not know yet since I just got this computer three days ago, but have been trying to find something that doesn't make me extremely happy with it and so far there's nothing. (Usually this is not the case.)  Let me just say though buy this from best buy!! It's much cheaper ($700 plus taxes) and its exactly the same model R705-P35.  For what this one costs you can go to toshiba direct and get a better model or extended warranty, faster HDD or whatever makes you happy.  For the price its way more than you would expect.Keyboard feels strange at first but within a day or two you'll learn to love it.Cons: Not that it matters to most people but since it is so new it does have a few hardware compatibility problems with Ubuntu if you were planning to use it much with that.
