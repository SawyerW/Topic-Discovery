I ordered this laptop in good faith, but when I saw the box on the porch I knew there was a problem; it was way too small. I was keeping track of the shipping so that I could run home really quick and get it off the porch before a thief did, but maybe I needn't have bothered. That's because it was a video camera instead of the computer I ordered. Specifically, it's a Toshiba Camileo x100 video camera, which doesn't even sound remotely like Satellite L455D-S5976 15.6-Inch Laptop . This just happened 10 minutes ago, so if they respond and rush me the computer I ordered overnight maybe I can change my rating, but so far no good at all. I'm going to have to say I don't recommend Toshiba as far as customer service goes anyway. I'd rather base this review on the actual product, but if I don't get it before Christmas this review will stand.
