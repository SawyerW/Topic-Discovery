I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas. I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old. The Air is my favorite for traveling since it is under 3lbs. The Pro however may be better suited for older kids with an included CD/DVD drive and burner. Since my nephews are young, I wanted small notebooks that could take a beating and they had to be 5 star quality but not too expensive. The Apple notebooks fit the requests and the nephews could not be more happier. If you are planning on a notebook in 2013 for your child, the majority of kids want Macs and with Apple making them affordable at $1100 each, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are the way to go.
