I'm generally happy with this laptop. I got it right after Windows 7 came out, and there are some challenges involved when using a platform that is so new. I have a very old multifunction printer that it had a hard time recognizing, for example. For some reason, I've also had a surprising number of miswritten DVD R's (-R has worked better than +R for reasons that I can't decipher). But the computer boots up very, very quickly, multitasks with ease, and has a lot of programs that I haven't even explored yet. My one true gripe with this computer so far is the speakers -- they sounded great for two months, and then suddenly sounded busted. Everything I play now sounds weak and distorted. The bottom line is that you should decide what your specific needs are before investing in this machine, and pay more if you have more to spend because when a computer is cheap, there is always a reason why.
