This is the computer that turned me onto apple products.  It is sincerely the best computer I have ever used, and I regret not taking better care of it.  Even the newer macbooks don't hold up to this little guy.  I rarely have any problems, and it's going on 7 years!  It's been through so many drops, spills, and accidents, I'm amazed it keeps going.  The screen is literally falling off, I've gone through three chargers and two batteries, and half the keys are missing and it still starts up faster and crashes less than my new macbook pro!  It's a great, hardy little computer.
