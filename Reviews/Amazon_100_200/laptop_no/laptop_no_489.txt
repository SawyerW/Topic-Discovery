This was a refurbished laptop from Tiger Direct.  The add implied that is was fully inspected, blah, blah, blah.  Nobody could possibly have looked at it after it was returned.  It had a red stripe running horizontally through the middle of the screen and another one running vertically on the right side of the screen (These flaws could not have been missed and I'm sure were the reason the laptop was returned in the first place).The only positive thing I have to say is that when I described the problem they immediately set up a return paying for the postage through UPS.  I also did receive a credit on my Visa but not until weeks later (I was close to contacting them again).On the other hand, the Gateway seemed like a nice laptop (but I'll never know, I ended up getting a NEW Toshiba Satellite).
