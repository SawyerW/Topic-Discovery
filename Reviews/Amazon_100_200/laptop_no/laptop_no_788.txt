Since I can remember, I've always wanted a MacBook whether it was the Pro and Air, I wasn't that bothered which.When I was given this present for Christmas, I was so happy that I'd got a MacBook, and again I wasn't really that bothered if it was the Pro or the Air.The one thing that I was a tad confused about was, that one minute my battery said I had 11 Hours left, and one the next minute it goes straight down to 9 Hours, but I seem to have figured out why that happens now!Also, if I close the lid and come back to it later without pressing 'Sleep' or 'Shut Down', it seems to take a while for me to be able to type in my password to come back onto my Computer, but again, I feel that I have sorted that out now also.So all in all, I think this is a great computer and i'm glad that I got it for Christmas from my parents, but I felt that some things could be improved but nothing that caused me to make a hassle over it.
