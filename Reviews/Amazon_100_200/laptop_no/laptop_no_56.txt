ok, so im going to start with my specs:CPU- core 2 duo 2.0ghzRAM- 4 gigsHDD- 600 gig seagate ok, now on to the review. i've had this laptop for a little over a year now and have not had a SINGLE problem with it. as a mador as a fact i'm righting this review on the laptop now.  i upgraded the laptop to windows 7 ultimate and it runs extremely smooth. it boots up just as fast as my teachers mac bookpro!! and that's a 1900$ computer!! i beat this laptop and it just laughs in my face and comes back for more!!! this is one beast laptop. i would no hesitate when it comes to buying a 2en one!!! in other words i would tell the world about it. this laptop has survived drops, spills(on the keaboard), it being thrown, and alot of other crazy things!!!!
