It literally fell apart after 15 months.HP does not stand by their products:A small crack started near the hinge and the screen literally split apart making it impossible to close and then it just stopped working all together.This laptop was very carefully taken care of and never abused or dropped.We brought it in to Best Buy and they said it should have lasted a lot longer than that and they could clearly tell it was never dropped or abused.Went round and round with HP to no avail. They do not stand by their products. Best Buy gave us a $100 off a new laptop because they felt bad aboutthe situation and of course we did not purchase another HP and never will !!!
