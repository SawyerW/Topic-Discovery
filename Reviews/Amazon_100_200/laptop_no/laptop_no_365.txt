My wife bought me this new model, I ruined my other one when I spilled tea on it (it was last year's model). I think this one is even faster running, which didn't seem possible.I would actually give this a 4.9 out of 5 if I could, because the graphics are not quite as bright with the integrated graphics rather than the separate card. It's not really that big a deal for me, since I really don't do graphics design or anything, but if you do that would be something to consider. I still love it though, and will never, ever go back to a PC.
