Being a Windows user for 15 years, I was a little hesitant about buying a MacBook Pro. The sleek and professional design finally won me over and I purchased one this week. I do not regret my decision one bit. The commands were easy to figure out, although it takes a bit getting used to. I bought the 13 inch for a small, light-weight laptop for carrying to college classes but it has easily turned into my favorite. To my delight, I can even play World of Warcraft and it runs even better on my new Mac than it ever did on my old laptop. I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase and recommend everyone buy one!
