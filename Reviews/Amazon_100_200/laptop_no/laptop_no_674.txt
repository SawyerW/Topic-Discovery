This is a story about a little computer that traveled from a place called Blinq.Blinq said this computer was packed by a Ninja named Natalie. Well Ninja Natalie is a grasshopper, an amateur, not very professional.I am so surprised to find this computer in one piece after opening it. It has shipping bubbles to hold it in place. Shipping bubbles isn't the problem, it's the amount of shipping bubbles. One layer on top and one layer on bottom and a few rolled up on the sides. This computer is about an inch thick, 16 inches long and about 12 inches wide. The box it came in was about 3 feet long, 2 feet wide and about 6 inches thick, a little over kill. I bet this computer flopped and flipped the whole way here.
