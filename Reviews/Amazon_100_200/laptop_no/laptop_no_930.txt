I've used a PC since Windows 98 came out and I thought that Windows was the best a computer could be.  I've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.  I process my digital photos using Adobe Lightroom (Versions 2 thru 5), and my workflow was always pretty slow due to waiting for the PC to catch up to what the software was trying to accomplish.I purchased my MBP from Amazon and never looked back.  My Macbook Pro runs silky smooth and the OS is very easy to get acquainted with even though I have never used Mountain Lion before.  My workflow in LR5 is so much faster and my results are also much better.  I highly recommend the Macbook Pro to all serious digital photographers ...you wont be disappointed!
