I have had it for 3 years and it started giving my problems as soon as warranty was up. It is slow, the fan its very loud, the USB ports don't usually work, I have to take the battery out each time I turn it on, when I close the laptop instead of sleeping it shuts down, the scroll on the touch pad doesn't work, it is really heavy and hurts my back to carry around for school, using microsoft office gives it a head ache and won't work. I had another HP before this and it was bad too in its own special way. I will never buy this brand again.
