The other review of this laptop was unfair about this laptop in general and how it works.  His review reflected HIS choice to purchase a $7 laptop from ebay.  YOU CAN'T EXPECT MUCH WITH THAT!!  THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING WORKED EXCEPT FOR THE WIRELESS CARD IS AWESOME.  He could buy a usb wireless card for $30 and be in business.This laptop is zippy, and has easy options for anyone who wants a decent laptop for a great price.  Either comes with a Dual Core or Intel core 2 Duo processor, between 1 - 4 GB of MEMORY, an 80 or 160GB sata 7200 rpm hard drive, Blue tooth, decent graphics card, etc.  The Core 2 Duo will run Windows 7 64 bit without issue!There is a good reason why these things are still around! They just keep running and were built right.
