This is a pretty nice computer. I bought my wife a Macbook air and bought me a Acer. Both computers have a i5 processor which makes both of them pretty fast. There has been only one time that I saw the MBA beat the Acer, it was when we were installing Rosetta Stone. The MBA was lightning fast but the Acer was not too shabby either. I have not had any issues with freezing or anything of the sort. We did have to restart my wife's MBA a couple times due to freezing.One thing that people say is that it feels cheap with the plastic bottom, I personally like that since the MBA's metal frame can be hard on the wrist...The new Ultrabook is great. It can compete with Mac all the way.But if you want both, get both and you can have the best of both worlds :)Cons: Yeah, the arrow keys are small but really does not bother me too much. Also the trackpad does feel a little "plasticy"
