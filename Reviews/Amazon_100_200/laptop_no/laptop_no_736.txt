ASUS customer support is horrendous, have a problem? "re install windows". Their drivers often check for operating system version and OEM status, quite a few would not install when I upgraded to Windows Ultimate. More importantly, I updated the BIOS and BROKE SUPPORT FOR SLEEP. Now the computer stays awake and spins the fans loudly every time I try to sleep it, no matter what OS I use.Windows 8 works quite well. Most things work except two finger scrolling, the SD card slot, Hot keys and bluetooth.Ubuntu 12.04 has really bad support for the graphics card, particularly with dual monitors. It made me switch out and run it on a VM.
