I have had all sorts of notebooks for past two decades and always liked IBM/Lenovo because of its solid hardware and high resolution screen.  It is all of that, but the W520 has some unacceptable weaknessess:a)  Almost every time I start it up it is confused about the wifi bringing up some sort of Lenovo access center. Often, I have to restart the machine.b) It is extremely heavy (nearly 6 lbs) and the power adaptor by itself weighs in at an additional 2 lbs (which I initially overlooked). Because of the heavy adaptor, it does not fit in the same bag that my old lenovo fits in.c) The harddisk of the model I have is less than 500 GbFor the adaptor weight and size and startup problems alone I would not recommend that anybody buy this for a price over $1000. For that price, there are better notebooks.
