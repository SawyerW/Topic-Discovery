I bought mine through Apple and received a 20% Vet's discount.  Once you go from beyond the stock  order to a little more RAM and SSD, well, it's worth it.  My AirBook went from Shaghai to Anchorage to Chestnut hill in but a few anxiously awaited days.  Like other Apple products, all I did was give it my ID and it integrated perfectly with my Mac mini's keychain, safari bookmarks and all of the email, contact and calendar stuff.It runs fast, it uses a low power Core i5 chip and SSD to make this happen, no painfully slow I/O to drain battery, generate heat or slowly fetch data for buffering.  This laptop can actually sit on my lap for hours without any meaningful heat buildup.  There is so much to say about this laptop, especially in light of my last laptop (generic Windoze machine).Totally worth the money, a really nice piece of engineering and a pleasure to use.
