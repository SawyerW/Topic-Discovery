This machine has been amazing except for the rapidly declining battery life.  When first purchased it was getting 11 hours of battery life and now, just a few months later, I can BARELY get 5-6 hours out of it.I understand the various factors that reduce battery life, including your usage, screen brightness, etc -- but to have my battery life cut in half is completely ridiculous.  I did a bit of searching online and it seems like this is a VERY common issue with this model.  There are posts all over the Apple forums but Apple refuses to acknowledge the issue.I would save my money until they come out with a fix.  There is no sense paying this much when you get half the battery they claim.
