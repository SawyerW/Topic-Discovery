Needed a Windows-based ultra book to take on the road for work. Purchased a Dell XPS 12 at a local retailer, and the machine had numerous issues so I took it back the next day.Fortunately I woke up and realized that I could run OS X and Windows on a Macbook Air - so no problem with running the Windows-only software that I needed for work.The new Macbook Air 13 is the best machine of its kind - design, materials, build-quality. I ordered it with the newer Intel i5 Haswell processor which is more than sufficient to meet my needs. It has 4GB of RAM and the 256GB Solid State Drive. The overall performance of this machine substantially exceeds the performance of my mid-2012 Macbook Air 11. Battery life is very significantly improved.Recommendation to those out there searching for a Windows-based ultra book - don't overlook running Windows via Boot Camp on a new Macbook!
