These people are WONDERFUL!  I am overjoyed at the customer service.  The first laptop I purchased seems to have a problem with it.  They did not in any way question, just immediately offered me 1) a full refund 2) a similar quality machine with a partial refund or 3) a better quality machine for the same price.After discussing with my IT person, we opted for the 3rd option.  It arrived, and I was able to test and assure my satisfaction. Then they sent a mail label pre-paid for the return of the first item.During this complete process, they were always immediate to respond to me y questions.  And as a matter of fact the person I was working with sent me the second one on a Sunday because she was going on vacation and wanted to be sure I was able to have in a timely fashion.I would recommend this company to anyone seeking a preowned laptop.
