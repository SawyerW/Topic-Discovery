I purchased this laptop during a Black Friday lightning deal.  I've seen similar Toshiba laptops with smaller hard drives and fewer features in the ads.  So far, so good.  It works as advertised.  I would warn people about holding the laptop at the hinge when carrying it.  The center is not very well supported so the monitor presses in when holding it.  I'm not sure if this is healthy for the monitor, so I try to avoid carrying it this way.  If you are careful and carry it in a laptop case then you are probably fine.  Won't be to sturdy if dropped though.
