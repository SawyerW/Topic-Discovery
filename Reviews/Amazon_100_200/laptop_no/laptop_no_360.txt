It used to be true that a laptop was not a good desktop replacement because they were simply not as fast--for a variety of reasons. I got this laptop in March 2011 shortly after they became available. It replaced my big G5 desktop computer and is much, much faster. No doubt the current desktop Mac Pro is faster but it is far more expensive and would be difficult to carry around :>) I maxed out the memory and replaced the hard drive with a Seagate Momentus 128 Hybrid Drive which made it even faster. It is connected to a 25.5 Samsung display so I have a dual display system. I also have several hard drives attached to my MacBook Pro.
