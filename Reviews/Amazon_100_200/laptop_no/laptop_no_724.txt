We needed a second laptop for my husband who uses a computer for e-mail, internet research and playing solitaire-type games--he is not a sophisticated computer user but we needed to upgrade from our slow desktop!  We didn't want to pay a lot of money.  We found this great deal on line through Amazon.  The vendor was excellent--immediate order confirmation and shipped the same day I ordered it.  The set up was quick, the computer is working great--we love it.  We had purchased a cheaper laptop just prior to this but it was loaded with Windows 8.  We hated the new format and searched to find another with Windows 7.  Thankfully, we found this laptop and returned the first purchase--we are so glad we did!
