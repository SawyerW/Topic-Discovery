I am a software developer and I use this machine to program, run business applications, and do some heavy surfing.  I am very pleased with the performance this machine can get from its fairly modest hardware specifications.The 4 GB of RAM is more than enough for OS X Mountain Lion, which itself outstanding.  It feels faster and more stable than my old Asus G73JH running Windows 7, which had 8 GB of RAM and a 2nd generation Intel Core i7-740QM.The display is small, but I normally use an external 27-inch Thunderbolt Display, which this machine runs win zero problems and turns the visual experience into a joy.  I have used it for about 6 months with zero issues, and I love it.
