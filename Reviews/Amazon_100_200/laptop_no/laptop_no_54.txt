As an owner of 3 IBM Thinkpads in the past I have been very disappointed with the Lenovo Thinkpad T61p. It worked well enough for nine months but then the screen went out. When I returned it to Lenovo for warranty repair they said the screen was not covered and demanded $700.00. I pointed out that the machine had not suffered physical damage(not dropped or dented) but they said that "sometimes this just happens" and it is not covered under the warranty. Some warranty! Lenovo is not in the same class as IBM. I suggest you look elsewhere for a reliable machine and a reputable manufacturer that honors it warranty.
