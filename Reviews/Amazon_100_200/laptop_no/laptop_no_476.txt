Am astonished and very disappointed that the new MacBook Pro has NO word processing program installed.  The Apple site indicated that iWork was included in the pre-installed software on the MacBook Pro.  But, it's definitely not on the laptop I received today from Amazon.  In fact, there appears to be no word processing program of any sort, unless you count textedit, which hardly qualifies.  I will have to order iWorks, but that's an extra cost and delay.  I cannot imagine omitting something as important as word processing from the standard software package on a computer.  The computer itself seems nifty enough, but I cannot use it for writing, which is my primary purpose.  Apple MacBook Pro MC374LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop
