Okay so the computer itself is pretty fast.Except here is what has broken on this thing in the two and a half years I've had it;battery.charge chord.dvd player.keyboardreplaced the keyboard-- in six months half the keys have popped off just for no reason.hard drive had to be replaced twice in the first year of getting it.the CPU would have fried already but I had to buy a fan platform and it has to stay on the laptop. if it's without the fan for more than an hour, the laptop overheats and crashes.so yeah. not worth your money. maybe if it was $100 cheaper, yeah it'd be an okay price. but not for more than that.
