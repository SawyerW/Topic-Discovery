I ordered this Dell Laptop for my 12 yr old son for a christmas gift. I received a email 2 days after I placed my order. The email stated that the laptop would be delayed due to battery issues with their supplier. The email also stated that the Laptop would be next day air delivered due to the inconvienience. As i wrapped gifts 5 days before Christmas, a very nice gentleman hand delivered it, so i wrapped it right away! The laptop has since 12/25/11 has barely been turned off. Needless to say IT WORKS GREAT & WHAT A GREAT PRICE! I highly recomend purchasing from this site.
