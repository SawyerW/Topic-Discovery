This laptop is perfect for school related things. That is what i needed it for and along with my specific internet connection, the internet is quick and the laptop delivers. What i dont recommend it for is viewing youtube videos or downloading lots of things. Any HD video takes a while to load, and forget watching anything in 1080px....it will always lag. Downloading isnt as quick as i would like. Eventually, the laptop will slow down a little as i store a good amount of pictures and music BUT for the price i got it for, i dont regret purchasing it at all!I recommend this product!
