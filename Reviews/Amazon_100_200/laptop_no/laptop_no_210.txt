I like this computer still learning how to use properly some of the features garage band particularly useful since I'm learnig to play guitar also the interface between screens and the speech function are brilliant I got this because after 3 years of using the iPhone and many toshiba satellite I decided to give it a try I still belive it to b overpriced however when you put into the equation the fact that your computer doesn't freeze or get viruses ... That does it for me I like the video editing software too  and the fact that I can sync several email accounts in one folder overall stilish etc a good buy on amazon specially because  what the" Genious" in the store never tells you is that you can save the tax by ordering here in addition if you chooseto buy the protection plan wich I never do you can get it cheaper in amazon too
