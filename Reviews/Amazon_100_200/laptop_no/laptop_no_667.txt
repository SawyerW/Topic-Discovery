I don't care about compact or lightweight, I wanted a laptop I could use as a home computer, would be portable if needed, and would never lag.  The Asus G74SX laptop is definitely a beast, but man what a powerhouse.  I got what I needed and more, wow!  Built well, screen resolution up to 1920, and tons of muscle.My wife summed it up when she said I had the Death Star of laptops.The **only** issue I have had so far (I have had the laptop for a week) is the mousepad is UBER sensitive... when I type without touching the mousepad it still senses input and moves the cursor on the text while I type.  I did a little research and found this is a occurring (don't know how common) problem with Asus laptops.  It was not an issue for me as I always use a USB wireless mouse, so I simply disengaged the in-keyboard mouse in the control panel...  problem solved.If this is the only problem I have with this laptop I will be happy with it for years.
