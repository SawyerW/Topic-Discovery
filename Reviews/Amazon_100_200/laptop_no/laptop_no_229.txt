Buying this is like buying a lotto.After half a year, this junk simply fell apart:  A couple of keys quit working, plug gets loose.  Then, hard disk fell.  Now the cooling is shot.  It gets really hot.  And the hinge broke.  The nasty warranty rep is scolding me like it is my fault.Dont buy ever from them again!PS. I have bought a few others from them and without any glitch so far.  But you happen to get a junk, you are screwed.  I think they have a real problem with quality control.  They should not have let this junk out of the door.
