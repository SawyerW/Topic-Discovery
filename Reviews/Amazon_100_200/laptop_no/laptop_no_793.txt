First off, I am techno-impaired and won't be dazzling folks with tech-speak. What I will say is that the size is perfect. In fact, I bought a 13" Macbook Air and exchanged it for this. The size is perfect. Picture clarity and colors are incredible. It is so easy to carry and so light. The battery life is unbelievable. I got eight hours the first time I used it. Finally, best of all, it is lightning fast. I sold my MacBook Pro, just a year old, to my son, so it's not like I had a dinosaur. But, there is virtually no time difference when I click on a link. (Except when I'm in a motel, like now, where everything is in slow motion). FYI, the keyboard screen and the palm guard are exceptional.
