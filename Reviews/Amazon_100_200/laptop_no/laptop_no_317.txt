Bought this ole hog back in July of 2009. 2.4ghz, 4GB RAM, and standard features the rest of the way. With a little tender love and care, it's still running great. It's been through 4 years of college, an absurb amount of music downloading and file transferring, CD burning, electronic music making, etc... this thing has been a beast for me. I bought it with Vista installed and then got the free upgrade for Windows 7 in late 2010 so it's been running 7 ever since. I can't say enough good things about this computer. Awesome keyboard, good speakers for a laptop, great battery that still gives me 3.5 good hours. The small cons that I can think of aren't even worth mentioning. I'm using my Studio until it dies and that's that. A beast and half!!!
