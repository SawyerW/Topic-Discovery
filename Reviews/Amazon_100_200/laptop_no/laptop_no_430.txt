I got this laptop in the January of 2010. A few months after I got it, the touchpad began to wear down, which has resulted in a huge and very unsightly white spot in the middle of it. The left clicker also has a black spot worn into it, as if a Sharpie was used to draw on it. The spots on both have grown over time. Another issue I had with the left clicker was sticking and sometimes not working.I had many problems in regards to performance, and I often found my laptop not being able to run some programs, and while it's not a gaming computer by any means, it couldn't run even low-performance games very well.Lastly, the hinge broke after about a year and every time I opened the laptop, there was a loud clicking noise and the top of the laptop would be crooked and coming loose. Just an hour ago, it completely broke and the screen is now barely hanging on.I've decided that I would rather just buy a new laptop than get this one fixed. This laptop is not worth your time.
