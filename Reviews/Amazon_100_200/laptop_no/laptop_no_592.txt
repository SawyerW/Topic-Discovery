As a person who is still on a budget because of the economy, this was a suitable option and price range for my purpose. Of course the battery is useless, i knew it would be, but I'll just replace it when i can. Mine came with windows vista business, so long as it had windows i was happy.This product is working fine so far, it's an older model so it may need to have some newer drivers installed to operate the new plug and play products like optical mouses, but but my printer booted up fine with no driver disk needed.The seller answered my questions promptly, i would purchase from this seller again.
