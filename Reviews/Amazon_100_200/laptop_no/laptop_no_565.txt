I got this for college and love it! It runs almost silently and doesn't get overheated even with multiple programs/windows open (I may get a cooling thing if I decide to get more intensive games but barring that it does just fine by itself). For this price, probably one of the best deals you're gonna find. I spent months looking at different laptops and was pointed to Lenovo by a friend. I'm very glad that I listened to him.Sleek, impressive speakers, crisp images, quick, multi-tasks really well, and the keyboard is very comfortable (which is always something I worry about for some reason). Battery hasn't been a problem, but I have the cords in my backback with me just in case, mostly for when I have rehearsals without clear time requirements.Not the most comprehensive review anyone will have ever read but if nothing else, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone.Also, it isn't that big a deal but facial recognition log-in via the camera makes me feel like a secret agent. Huge plus for that one Lenovo!
