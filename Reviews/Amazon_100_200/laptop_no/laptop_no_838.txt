If you like to bring your laptop with you when you travel, or to meetings, etc., there simply is no better Mac than the Macbook Air.  It is by far the lightest laptop in the Mac lineup and it has significant amounts of processing power, graphics capabilities, and perhaps most importantly, battery life.  About the only reason I might go with a different Apple laptop would be if I needed greater processing power for video editing, gaming, or similar applications.  However, for virtually every other application, the Macbook Air is by far the best offering in terms of portability, ruggedness, and battery life.Would not hesitate to buy the next update of the MBA once it comes out.  Hopefully Apple will be adding Retina displays to these things soon, but until then, there's simply nothing better out there.
