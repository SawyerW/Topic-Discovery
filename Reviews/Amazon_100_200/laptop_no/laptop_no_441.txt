Note: This is a review of this product bought from Wal-Mart, not Amazon.  I had a Toshiba Satellite I bought from Best-Buy in 2003 that I really liked (although overpriced) and so we decided to buy this machine for my wife to use.  We paid about $300 for it and have had it for a year.  Currently, the power cord is not working, and we will need to buy a replacement.Graphics: Acceptable, 15.5" screenHard Drive: Acceptable, 250 GB is plenty of space for a machine in this price rangeSound: Terrible, unless you use headphones.  It's just weak.Processor: Terrible, passmark score of 498: [...]Memory: Acceptable at 2GBThe only reason I gave this machine three stars is the price.  It is almost useless for our noisy household of three children under 5.  I still like Toshiba, but it seems you get what you pay for (almost).  This is essentially a souped up netbook.
