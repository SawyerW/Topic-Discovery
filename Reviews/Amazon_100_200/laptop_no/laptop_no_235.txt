Love this little tank. I say that because I've dropped it a few times. Bought it for the wife 2 yrs ago and I ended up taking it over. Works great for on the go needs. Great for music and pics. Not powerful but if you just need something portable and for simple usage, this is great. I just started having problems with the cord but that only because I keep folding/unfolding the cord when I travel. Even after 2yrs the battery life is still great. I get about 4hrs to each charge. On here now to buy a new cord. Would easily buy another one!
