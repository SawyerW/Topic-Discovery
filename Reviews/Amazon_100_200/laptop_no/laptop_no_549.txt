I purchased this machine a month ago. Mine came with the AMD processor... As an avid fan of AMD/ATI I had to grab this one. The only thing I did not like is the fact that the onboard peripherals use too much of the installed 2 gigs of ram leaving only 735mb of ram for the operating system and your software. I quickly upgraded my ram to the maximum 8 gigs and this thing runs sweet... It will chew up almost anything I throw at it; Games, 3D modeling, multiple OS's under VirtualBOX and high end multimedia... Great value for the price but it needs better and faster memory than the stock it ships with.
