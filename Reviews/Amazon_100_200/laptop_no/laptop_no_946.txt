Have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever. Most of them were either too big, too noisy and too slow after 2 years. Mac User interface is just the best. Have used windows for years, so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it, you won't feel like going back. Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro, but glad bought the Pro, because I didn't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters, separate DVD player etc.....Honestly didn't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display, so didn't fancy paying that much premium for retina, others may fancy that, I didn't.Compared other ultrabooks like Zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of Mac, so stuck with MacbookOnly thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!
