This laptop is one of the best purchases I have ever made! It is lightning fast, paper thin, and light as a feather! Here's a bit of advice though: when you are buying it, the 128 gb is something like $1,048, but when you go up to the 256 gb, you add another $200 dollars to the price. Take my advice and just get the 128 gb version, then get a 1 tb external hard drive for about 50 or 60 bucks. This saves you so much money and gives you so much more space. Other than that, this is the best laptop I have ever worked on, and I definitely recommend it!
