This is not a bad laptop.....it's light, got a great size screen and I think can handle alot of applications...BUT the keyboard is too sensitive, whenever I start typing the cursor will end up on the top of the screen or to the right/left and always have to bring it back to the text that I am typing, unless I type very slow.  But I am a fast typer as alot of other people and this appears to be a unique problem with this laptop.  I don't know, is there something I can do to change this on the settings????????????????  This is just too frustrating as it can take several tries to type a sentence.
