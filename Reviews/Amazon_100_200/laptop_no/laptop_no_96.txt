I purchased this laptop used.  I needed a cheap computer to be used for little more than web surfing and personal correspondence.  The model being somewhat dated, it is not quite as lightweight as I had hoped but the cost makes that a minor issue.  Installing Ubuntu 11.10, 4-Disks DVD Installation and Reference Set, Ed.2012 was relatively simple except that I had to go find and install the internal wireless adapter drivers.  I had recently purchased a more recent model Inspiron and had had no issues installing Ubuntu so I was hoping for no hiccups here.  At least it was a minor problem and searching for help on the web I found several discussion threads on how to determine which drivers I needed and how to install them.  Overall, a solid laptop computer with a good-sized and sufficient USB ports for adding an external keyboard and mouse.
