I'm in a small Production Company so we work with Mac's.  My old Macbook Pro a 15" video card finally died was an issue with my model but lasted 3yrs of heavy use.  Our Company owns several Macbook Pros and just recently bought the small 13" 2.4ghz to data manage footage from our RED cameras.  After My MBP broke I started using the 13" for other tasks since it was just sitting there and was very surprised by how much I really liked the small form factor I was allowed to take it home for a weekend and liked it so much that I just ordered the 2.66ghz version to replace my downed machine.
