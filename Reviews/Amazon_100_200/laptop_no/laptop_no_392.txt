I ordered the Dell Latitude D610 Monday, August 26, it was delivered Saturday, August 31.  My daughter, (a college student in her last semester), opened it, turned it on, and booted up and connected to her wireless internet, and was doing her homework in less than 10 minutes.  She is so happy with it, and it even seems faster than any laptop she had previously used. (Even her sisters  $1500.00 one she had used this summer.)  I would highly recommend a refurbished laptop from TAMPA LAPTOPS to anyone!!! Needless to say, this laptop exceeded our expectations for a refurbished unit. lrh
