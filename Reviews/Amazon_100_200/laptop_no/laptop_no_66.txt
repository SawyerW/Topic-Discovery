When I first got this laptop (at a garage sale, broken) It was really slow and leggy so I installed Linux Mint.  Right away I noticed a huge difference but it was still not fast enough to be my daily computer so I upgraded the ram to 1gb. WOW THIS THING IS BLAZING FAST!!!!! I thought when I was testing the new ram.  But after awhile it still seemed a little slow so I read on-line and found out some cool tricks you can do to Linux to make it faster and after a little work this laptop is just as fast as my quad-core desktop. Highly recommend this laptop to anyone
