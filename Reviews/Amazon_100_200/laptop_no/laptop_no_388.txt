Very sad.My dad bought this laptop as a present for me, so we can talk via Skipe,well, i opened the box i did found out it came without web-cam and internal microphone as the brochure from HP. Then, after buying 4 kinds of microphones i noticed the external microphone is broke. Amazon sent me to talk directly with Hp, no way, Hp is imposible to reach, nobody helped. Two weeks ago i went to Best Buy to buy a printer, the salesman told me to bring the laptop so they can sent it to Hp,two weeeks ago i received a e-mail from Hp warning about the broken microphone, i hope i can change this laptop with one with internal webcam and internal microphone, my laptop is still in guarantee so,i hope to change it.
