I bought this laptop in June of 2009. In September of 2009, the hard drive on it failed. No biggie, as I had my data backed up and it was under warranty. I figured, it was bound to happen to someone. Well, just today, the REPLACEMENT hard drive has ALSO FAILED.I was under the impression HP made good quality notebooks. Unfortunately, after my purchase of this particular model, that perception has changed. This notebook runs exceptionally hot, even for low-memory-usage applications. It frequently shuts itself off for thermal protection, which means if you don't have a way to cool this laptop down, you better save your data and OFTEN.This model also purports to have an ATI Radeon 3200 HD Mobility Graphics Card. If it does, it doesn't like to show itself. The graphics are gritty, slow to respond and overall do not function anywhere near as smoothly as purported to.I would stay away from this laptop. There are other models available from other manufacturrs that will run double the memory usage and not run anywhere near as hot as this, nor will the hard drives fail every 3 months.
