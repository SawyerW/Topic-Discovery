I am loving my new MacBook Air.  I have always owned PC's and after using an iPhone and an iPad, I decided to try an Apple computer when my HP started giving out.  The first MacBook arrived promptly and right from the beginning I had problems with it.  I couldn't get it to recognize my wireless printer and also couldn't get it to send mail.  I called the Apple support line and after a 2 1/2 hour session, the technician felt it was a defective computer as nothing seemed to fix the problems.  Amazon sent me a new computer which arrived within 2 days of contacting them.  I returned the defective computer and have had no issues with the new one.  The only thing I'm missing is the screen being bigger.  I love how light weight it is and the battery life is incredible.  I'm still learning to operate it but getting better all the time.
