Selling a new MacBook Pro with a 5400 RPM hard drive is like selling a Rolls Royce with a Model T engine.  The old hard drives just cannot compare with the new SSD/Flash Drive, the same things used in iPads and thumb drives.  I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur.  I just bought a Pro with the high end i7 chip, 8 GB RAM and a 512GB SSD with speeds that almost defy belief.  Everything is practically instant.  The same goes for my iMac which I recently upgraded with a 521GB SSD. Frankly, while I was shopping I have not seen ANY 15" Pros with less than an SSD.  Obviously, they're out there but not here.  BTW, Amazon's quoted retail price is the Pro with the 512GB SSD - check the Apple Store.  Apple is charging a pretty penny for them.  One can get a 512GB Crucial from Amazon for about $400 which is good.  It cost me an extra $200 to have it installed in an iMac since I wasn't about to fool around with it.
