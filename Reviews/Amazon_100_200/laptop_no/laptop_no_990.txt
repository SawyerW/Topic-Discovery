in my opinion, the only negative aspect about  this laptop is the low resolution it offers compared to the retina display model ... but its advantage is that you can upgrade or change your RAM when some module fails. if something like this happens in retina display model or macbook air, you'll have a very nice decoration for your desk.also...- excellent operating system- size and weight for optimal mobility- excellent durability of the battery- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand- if you need sync with other Apple devices, is the best option, the process is completely transparent
