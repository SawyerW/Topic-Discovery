I bought one three years ago at a chain store. It worked well for about a year. if you want a computer that crashes all the time, freezes- in Opera, Chrome, IE or Firefox- this is the brand for you. It can take upwards of ten minutes from the time I turn it on until the browser loads. IE disappeared one day - about 6-9 months after buying the laptop. Error messages pop up when I try to load it. A product of crappy laptops. When I replace this piece of junk it will not be with an HP brand, that's for sure.
