Each person has their own requirements for a computer.Mine were portability: light weights and small. I want to be able to bring this on a day trip, overnight trip and not think about the weight or what bag I am going to bring.I don't do any kind of video, photo, 3D, graphics editing.For when I need to do serious work on spreadsheets that require multiple open simultaneously, I use an iMac.I use external hard drives to keep extra data and photos.For basic word processing, email, surfing, powerpoint, skyping etc The MacBook Air 11" works perfectly well.This is a real iPad Killer - (almost*) all of the benefits of the iPad and none of the disadvantagesCons:-audio is not very loud-only two USB ports and a video outAfter 2 weeks with the Air, I don't miss my MB Pro 13" at all, the screen size is not an issue for me, and I love the size, for people on the go - it's perfect (except photographers, designers, people with butlers and chauffeurs, etc)PS I purchase a Colcasac as a sleeve, it's great.* no touch screen, no 3G
