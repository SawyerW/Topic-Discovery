This computer is small and light, essential for a road warrior like me. It slips into my bag or pack like an extra file rather than a laptop. It is fully functional and nicely handles all my "heavy" apps, such as those I use from the Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, etc. The resolution on the small screen is very good and during most work sessions feels as spacious as my 13" mac pro.  The battery life is terrific; that was a major selling point for me. Amazon price and delivery were excellent. This is the first time I've purchased an Apple computer through Amazon but I will certainly consider doing so again.
