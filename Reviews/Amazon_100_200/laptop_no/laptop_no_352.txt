First and foremost, this is a great computer. It does all the things I need it to do FAST. Its great to have that 2nd generation Intel Sandy Bridge processor. It hurts to not have a dedicated GPU, but it runs 2-3 year old games very well. I have COD4 running on medium settings at a pretty good clip for example.Everybody has already said most everything I want to say, but coming from a bare-bones PC to this, its the little luxuries that make it worth the money to buy this mac. The backlit keyboard, awesome touchpad, ease of use (why make things hard w/ a PC when you dont have to?), great construction and insaaaaanely long battery life are just a few examples.If you have the funds, I highly recommend this computer. Apple made a huge leap in technology with the 2011 macbook pro update and I was waiting on it and it was soooo worth it. Do it.
