I am pretty satisfied with this Gateway laptop. It has Windows 7 which makes connectivity with other devices, networks, etc a breeze. While I am no fan of Norton AV or Internet Security, it comes with a 60 day trial package, and I was surprised that I actually now like the utilities. Keypad feels firm. Speakers not much but headphones deliver great sound. Max resolution is 1600 x 900, so using HDMI cable to connect to a 1980 x 1020 screen ain't gonna happen. I found that I could either set screen to lower resolution to accept my HDMI connection or I could adjust laptop resolution to a lower resolution that was comparable to my LG flatscreen.  With limited resolution set aside, it still has a great picture on it's 17.3 inch screen. It feels very durable, but my only problem with it is it's keypad. While it is allegedly "touch sensitive" with varying options upon touch, it remains too touchy. I have accidentally closed or opened programs which could cause dramatic results while working on important files. Yet, it is overall a very nice laptop.
