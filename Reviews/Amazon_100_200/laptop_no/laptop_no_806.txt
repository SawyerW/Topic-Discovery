I am a die hard Windows user and really did not understand all the Apple 'fanatics'...at all!  On a whim, I decided to purchase the MBA 13.3" screen and although it took me a couple of hours in watching YouTube videos on how to navigate the Mac operating system, I have grown to LOVE this unit.  The build quality is great and like everyone else is saying, it is terribly difficult to drain the battery on this unit.  On my prior Windows laptops (ASUS, Lenovo, Dell, etc.), I would be lucky (LUCKY) to get 4 hours.  With light browsing and watching Netflix/Amazon, this unit has run the full 12 hours!  WOW!  Honestly, I told myself that I would learn to code for ios and thusly justified this purchase but I've done everything but that.  On a side note, I did have to get the Windows Office package since I am familiar wtih it.If you're a Windows user and on the fence of purchasing a MacBook Air, I say go for it!
