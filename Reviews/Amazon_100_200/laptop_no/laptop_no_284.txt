Runs amazingly cool for a fast laptop, good keyboard action and a usable touch pad.  Too much bloatware, but I expected that (and have already deleted most of it), and I hate that they no longer ship Windoze computers with a recovery CD, but that's not ASUS.  I got it the day after Lucid Lynx came out and have it dual booting into Windows and Ubuntu, with both systems running smooth as glass.  The shiny case is a fingerprint magnet, but I never go anywhere without a cleaning cloth, so we're good.  I play WoW at nearly top settings with no noticeable lag even in Dalaran, and that's before upgrading to 8 gigs RAM, which I'm going to do anyway on my next round of frivolous spending.  With regular cleaning and maintenance, and keeping coffee away from it, I should get a good three to five years out of her.  I'm a very happy girlgeek.  Thanks.
