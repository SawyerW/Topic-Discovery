This machine is a replacement for your desktop.  It's that powerful and versatile, and if you're a windows user, the design of the OS X operating system that it runs will enhance your experience and workflow in ways you can't even imagine.  The aluminum frame beats the old titanium design easily.  Solid, resistant to scratches, better heat dissipation.  Close the lid, then slam it around, drop it, prop it against the wall and kick it over.  You'll break your foot before you break the laptop.  The display is large enough, and the text rendering is sharp enough, that you'll forget entirely about workspace issues.  A piece of advice: Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it, and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3.  Use it whenever you're working at a tabletop or desk.  Freaking brilliant.  This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be.
