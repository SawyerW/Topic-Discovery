This thing is a beauty! It is BMW of laptops or Mercedes, Ferrari, whatever you want to call it. It's drop dead gorgeous. Let's use the car metaphor, unlike the exotic cars which have special engineered super power engine to justifies the high price. This Macbook pro's engine is similar to one found in not so exotic PC laptops such as Acer Aspire TimelineX AS3830T-6870 13.3-Inch Aluminum Laptop (Cobalt Blue), which cost $400 - $500 less. These days, computer components are very similar in performance and quality, because most of them are made by the same factories in China. The only differences is the case design and OS, is it worth the extra $500? That's for you to decide.This beauty feels very slow, because it uses a 5400 RPM hard drive instead of 7200 RPM drive, and I'm used to SSD speed on my PCs. Other than that, it's a laptop like all others. It's what you do with it that matters.
