This is the second 13" macbook pro we have purchased.  They are tanks that take a beating and keep on working like champs.  Yeah, Apple products are expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I had to help my kids with their pc issues constantly, but on the macs....nothing....they just work.  The 13" is a great size, not too heavy but with the solid aluminum body, it's strong.  I would advise getting something like Zagg Invisible shield for it as the aluminum finish does scratch easily.  Also, if you decide you want more memory and a bigger hard drive than the base model, buy it separately and not from apple.  Simply take out the bottom screws and pop in the RAM or the hard drive.  It's a piece of cake and will save you a bundle.
