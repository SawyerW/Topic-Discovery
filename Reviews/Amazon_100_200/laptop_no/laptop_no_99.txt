This model was my 2nd laptop. I never had any issues with it. I bought mine from Office Max for around$720 with tax in 2005. The only problem I've had out of it is when I.....put a pen on the keyboard near thescreen and foolishly closed it without thinking; cracking the screen. I've taken it apart and depending onprice, I might replace it. I own a Toshiba Satelite and another HP dv6 series bought almost two years ago.In total, I have owned three HP laptops.To make laptops more affordable some parts are made with plastic or other materials which degrade when hot.NO laptop fan will cool it efficiently and require laptop users to need a good laptop fan/cooler. There are waysto circumvent the shortcomings in manufacturing when computer companies do this. I replaced the power jack/porton the Toshiba with a sturdier model which cost $2.99 and about 2 hours labor myself.NO DUCT TAPE INVOLVED.It sucks that many people have had bad experiences with HP. Everyone has their own preferences and I for onehave had great ones with HP. This model is best for a desktop replacement WITH a good laptop cooler.
