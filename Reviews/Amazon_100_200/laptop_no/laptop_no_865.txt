I am usually a fan of all things Amazon.  They really screwed the pooch on this one.  I ordered a new macbook and I got a used macbook, packaged in the very box that they originally sent to "Kim Nguyen".  When I turn on the computer, the log-in reads "Kim Nguyen".  A shipping label to "Kim Nguyen" is super-lamely covered up on the box.  If you're going to try to sell me used merchandise as new, at least use a new box Amazon.Do you want to pay full-price for an obviously used computer?  Me neither.I may be ending my consumer relationship with Amazon forever after this.  Gross, nasty and shenanigans!
