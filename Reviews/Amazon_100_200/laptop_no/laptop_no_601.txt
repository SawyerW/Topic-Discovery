Powerful laptop and good for most users, I have had the laptop for about a week and will be returning this laptop next week. It has the power, but the screen quality is so-so. I had a MB pro and the screen was better as well as my desktop monitor. The sound is great for movies and music but piss poor for games, overall I feel like itds a marketing scheme with the beats audio. Build quality is good overall, but placement of power cord and exhaust fan could have been different (for right handers who game or use their laptops alot). A good laptop if you are looking for something fairly powerful, but look to another brand for a better HD screen and a SB onboard soundcard with EAX to blast the beats audio out of the water. One minor quark, for the money you should get a finger print reader for security, but then again it is a minor tidbit.
