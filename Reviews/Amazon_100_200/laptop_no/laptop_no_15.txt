After extensive review I found this Toshiba to be the cheapest way to get the most power in a laptop. It is sleek and the display is great, but good luck if you need tech support! I installed DeLorme's Street Atlas 2003 and Earthmate GPS. It wouldn't run even after I followed all of their trouble-shooting advice. When I called DeLorme they refused to help and told me it was a hardware problem. Toshiba's tech support person was foreign and almost unintelligible. I was not impressed with what I COULD understand. She told me my brand new 2.0 GHz, 256 MB computer with XP Pro "probably doesn't have enough space on the hard drive to run the program." When I insisted my laptop met minimum requirements she told me it must be a Windows OS problem! Moral? Dude, I'm getting a Dell!
