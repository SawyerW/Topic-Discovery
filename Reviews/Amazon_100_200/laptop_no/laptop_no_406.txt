I purchased my Toshiba L455-55975 two years ago. I wanted to write a review after I used the machine a while to see how it would work for me. This is the best computer for the price on the market. I work for an Early Childhood School and I am a College student. I use this computer to store children's records, lesson plans, observations and personal use. I also have taken on line classes with it. I also have used it for computer classes. During a computer training at work we had five computers to work on, a couple of Dells and HP's and my Toshiba. My Toshiba was the fastest computer. The Instructor asked if she could borrow my Toshiba for the training. I guess that speaks for itself. I highly recommend this computer.
