Do not be fooled! This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge"), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.  That means it has less battery life.  It also lacks a "Retina" display.  This is the 2012 model that you can buy at the Apple store for exactly the same price.  Not that it a bad laptop - not at all - but it is definitely not the "newest version" as the ad claims.  Naturally, the actual newest model, similarly equipped, costs more, but it is also in many ways a superior machine (the 500 gig HD is solid state for example).  That is no doubt why one reviewer says he recently bought both a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and found the latter clearly superior.  The MacBook air with the Haswell CPU (which is what he evidently bought) has been available for far longer than the MacBook Pro with Haswell (introduced only about 1 month ago).  If you buy this laptop you may be completely satisfied - just be aware what you are really buying.
