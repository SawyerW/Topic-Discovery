This is not sold directly by Amazon but through an intermediate company Data Vision.  They sent the package via FedEx requiring a signature.  I am at work during normal hours so I contacted Fed-Ex to go and pick it up in person. FedEx said they could not do it because Data Vision requested delivery at the address and require a signature. I called Amazon and they gave me the number to contact data Vision.  The customer service by Data Vision Computer Video was very bad. The person taken the call was very rude and he said he could try but really there nothing he could do. I requested to talk to supervisor and this person was even worse. In short, if you have any problem with this product good luck dealing with Data Vision.  I would not order again from them. They claim in the phone message that they are one of the largest companies. It may be true I do not know, but most certainly they have a terrible customer service.  If they cannot fix a very minor problem for the delivery, what can they fix?
