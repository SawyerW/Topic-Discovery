This Dell Studio model 1555 I use has performed flawlessly. My model has the subtle  black 'Chain Link' finish on it, which produces a stylish distinguishing look; In addition the thin LED screen not only has great video but looks great the way it's forward hinge design integrates the screen with the entire unit.This model is built well, is relatively light in weight, & has a very good quality feel.The battery capacity is large enough for an effective afternoon of work or enjoyment. This model provides great dollar value (at least at Amazon prices) by being equipped with and effective Intel dual core processor, SRS premium sound, 15.6" LED screen, large 4GB ram memory, & numerous communication ports.  I find the 3 USBs, SDHC card reader, and the HDMI port (connects to HDTVs) very useful.
