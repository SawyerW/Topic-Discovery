The boss found these on special and got 3 for the office, and I got one.  I hate it SO MUCH! The trackpad is absolutely awful - extremely temperamental, fails to register clicks very frequently.  Additionally, the keyboard has these extra keys along the left side.  They open your email, web browser, the "hp media center", the calculator, or the print dialog.  They are pointless and extremely easy to accidentally hit, so you bring up the calculator in the middle of typing an email, for example.  Additionally, while you can remap most of the keys using hacks, you can't remap the print key without remapping the "P" key also.  Idiotic design.  Did HP's engineers ever use this?  They should be sentenced to using nothing but this machine for the next year.It's fine when using an external mouse & keyboard.  But IT'S A FRIGGIN' LAPTOP IT SHOULD BE USABLE ON MY DAMN LAP!!!
