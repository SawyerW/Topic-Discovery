Better than a PC, but apple's customer care sucks if you don't live near an apple store. Since it was 2 years old my macbook has been losing power even when plugged in. So even if you have a power source, you can't expect to get more than a few hours a day out of the damn thing. Add to that the fact that Mountain Lion tries to hide the battery problems, requiring you to use third-party software to even see how much time you have left.Would just buy a new one, but my old one is better than the new, unupgradeable, unrepairable pieces of crap they're trying to sell. So disappointed in Apple.
