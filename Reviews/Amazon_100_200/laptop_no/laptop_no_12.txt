If your are looking for a good used laptop..........look elsehwere.  The FXA47 is loaded with software and problems and VERY POOR customer support.  In the 2 years we have had it, it has stayed in the case most of the time because of lockups.  I have restored it several times to original configurations with no help.  Sony is clueless and wants to charge for phone supoport and has only responded to 1 of my e-mails.  It seems that everytime we install software the computer wants to lock up.  My Compaq 2715US works great with out any problems.  I will never by another Sony product.
