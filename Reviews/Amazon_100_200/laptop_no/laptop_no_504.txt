I bought this laptop for my wife. She uses it mainly for MSN Messenger, Facebook games, hotmail and photo viewing. I was looking for a decent laptop that costed me no more than $700. I also read before that the AMD based computeres performed well with games/graphics and were cheaper than the Intel ones. The design and size was important as well. Its white case makes this laptop look finer than the ordinary black laptop. There is nothing to regret about it. Even Windows 7 turned to be very friendly (first time we ever use it). Net is: my wife is very happy with her new laptop. The only thing this laptop lacks is the Bluetooth connectivity, but it's ok 'cause I can buy a USB bluetooth connector. Also, the wireless network radio is better than my Lenovo T400's. The HP does not get disconnected in low signal areas but mine does.I recommend this laptop if you're looking for a nice computer for a basic user with eventual gaming.
