I work for an IT department for a hospital so I know about computers. Overall a nice computer. However, I am a firm believer that they are WAY overpriced for what you get. I have been using Windows since 95 and will always be a "PC", but I wanted to give Apple a try. I also use Linux so I am use to the UNIX system. The battery life is not as good as what I expected but this seems to be caused by Mountain Lion, even though there was an update to fix this. I would refer this computer to other users only if they are needing the extra power for programs and the upgrade capabilities (RAM, HDD).
