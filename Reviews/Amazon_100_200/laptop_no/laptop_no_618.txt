first off it is a good laptop for the normal person who doesnt do too much stuff, but i have had a problem with it and i missed the period to send it back but the only problem i have had with this laptop is that it will randomly freeze and i cant move the mouse or do anything on the screen and i will have to manually shut it down using the power button and when it comes back up i get the usual "it was shut down improperly would you like to start in safe mode" other than this problem it is a great laptop
