This computer is definitely not worth the money. It broke just before my warranty was over. I sent it in to acer and the hard drive was replaced. It worked for another 2 weeks and died again. Another problem with the hard drive. Now since the warranty expired in the mean time, I wasn't even able to contact acer anymore without paying a high fee. I decided to order the recovery cds instead which weren't included and didn't help either. I am still trying to fix it but no success so far. So much trouble for a computer that was quite expensive and barely lasted through the warranty. I will not buy another product from acer!
