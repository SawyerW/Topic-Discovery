I will start off with that the iBook looks better than I was expecting it to be. It works fine, although I have to mention a few points:- Combo drive did work for the first time; later it quit working while my DVD was in it. I could give it back for repair, but I can live with it. I cannot afford to lose more of my precious college time when I have to prepare a presentation for 35 people (I always can attach external DVD, may I need to) After all, it's 7 years old.- Although the bottom of the LCD case is loose, it does not interfere with my work on the iBook.-RAM is 768MB, not 1GB. I don't mind.- I got a cheap replacement adapter (on AMAZON for 8 dollars) in the box BUT it is long and way more comfortable that original APPLE charger- The battery was dead after half an hour but it's minor; I will use my old one from my broken Apple PowerBook if it will fit.Overall for 212.00 pretty good APPLE.
