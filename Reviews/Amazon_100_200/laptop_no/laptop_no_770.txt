I will probably sound like a HUGE Apple geek, but I have to say, this is the PERFECT travel computer.I bring it to the office, university, and business trips out of country. It is amazingly light, versatile, and strong.In reviewing the actual usage, it is AMAZING. I can play League of legends with little lag on high graphics and a good connection. I can do small editing to videos from my go pro, and I can zoom around on the internet.For my battery life, I have have between 16 to 20 hours on normal webserfing, and 8 or less on gaming days. (Pictures if requested.)Though desktops might have an upper hand due to the fact that windows computers can be user upgraded, Apple beats the world in portable electronics. Think about it, why does every laptop look like an Apple now?
