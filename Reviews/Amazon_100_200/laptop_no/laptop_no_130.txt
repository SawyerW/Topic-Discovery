I have owned this laptop (SL400) for around 1.5 years. All I can say is the build quality is horrible. I have three main issues with the laptop. The DC port on the laptop is loose and possibly a safety hazard. The LCD left hinge broke, so the LCD was dangling on one hinge (until I fixed it). The keyboard is acting up, some keys I have to press hard to get it to register. I treat my laptops with care and all of my previous laptops never had this many issues after 1.5 years of use. Time to try a different model or maybe even a different brand.
