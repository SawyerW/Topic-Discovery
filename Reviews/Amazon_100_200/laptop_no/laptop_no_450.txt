This computer may be the dream for youngsters who will make use of all the fancy stuff for film and electronic music editing.  I just want a machine for research in arcane subjects and some speech recognition.  A replacement for my old Dell would have cost a third and done what I need better than this Mac.  I switched because all the kids in the library have Macs! Just goes to show that one should not just follow the latest trend.I had Mac laptop more than 20 years ago and did not realize that even with the newest Word for Mac this machine today requires a completely new set of habits and reflexes different both from the old Mac and the PC.Also just a month old, it has developed several bright spots in the otherwise wonderful screen.A good and necessary thing is that the Apple shop gives workshops.  I was lucky, none of the other people who had signed up came, so I had the very knowledgable instructor all to myself.  Without that session, I might otherwise have had to turn this computer over to my grandson as a much too expensive Christmas present, but I am still struggling.
