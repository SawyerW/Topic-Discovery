So far, the computer is exactly as billed.  It seems nice and fast with the Intel i5 chip.  The case looks nice and the display looks good.I have to say that I absolutely hate that they don't include a Windows 7 disk with it.  It uses the Lenovo 1 Key recovery system, so you will need to create your own recovery disks for the inevitable day you need to re-format or replace the hard drive and re-install Windows.  The file is 32GB, so it took 5 DVDs to make the reboot disks.  If you have an option to pay a few bucks extra for the Windows install disk, then do it.
