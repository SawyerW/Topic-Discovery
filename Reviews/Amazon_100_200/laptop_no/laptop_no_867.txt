I bought this laptop last month and when I first received it there were updates to install. Two of the updates will not install because the computer is not recognizing me as the owner for those two applications (iPhoto and iMovie). I brought it to an Apple Store and they told me that there was a previous owner and the computer wasn't properly deleted and restored. I was given the option of having them wipe out everything on my computer to restore it as new or they'd have to keep sending me codes to maually update the applications. Not what I expected when I purchased this computer, especially for the amount of money I spent.
