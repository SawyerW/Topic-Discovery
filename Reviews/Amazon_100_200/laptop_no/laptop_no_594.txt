I needed a VERY inexpensive computer for my worker to use at the scanning station.  This arrived very quickly and is actually a very nice machine.  All we will be using it for is scanning documents and burning CDs so it may not be fast enough for more complex users but it sure is nice to have this machine here.  (The old one literally died right as I was bringing this one over to the station).  It jumped right on the internet.  it did have that annoying "Do you want Norton Antivirus" crap on the first bootup but I got rid of that.
