This was a good solid deal for a used laptop.  It came in nice and clean.  I could tell from the stickers on the bottom that it used to have issues which were repaired.  Everything worked, and the battery was even fully charged out of the box.  The adapter and shell were in good condition.  No blemishes on the screen.  A cpu and ram test resulted in no errors.The only fault I can see is the fan does make sounds like its worn and needs to be replaced.  I found a cheap replacement part at Amazon, and found some easy to follow instructions on YouTube.  So, this shouldn't be a big deal.I ordered two T61's, and only had a problem with one of them, which the seller, Open Electronics, quickly offered to replace at no cost.Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase.  These refurb'd Lenovos, along with some new RAM, make for great gifts.
