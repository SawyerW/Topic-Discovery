Just received the laptop a week ago, however will be returning it due to a newer version of this laptop just being released (with GTX660M and additional 2GB of RAM for similar price).  I must say I am highly impressed with the machine.  I would not be returning this if the newer model was not released.  The machine is quick and powerful and battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop (got about 3 1/2 hours battery life without gaming, which would probably get better once the battery was broken in).  It allows you to convert to integrated graphics instead of dedicated which also increases battery life.  Another cool feature allows you to change the backlight keys (in sections) on the keyboard.  If this was only $700 or $800 I would probably not bother returning for the newer version, however considering this is almost $1,500, I would like to have the newest model (considering it is less than $100 more for the newer model).  Thanks to Amazon and their kind and helpful support team for allowing me to return the product!
