i LOVE my macbook air. its a thin piece of aluminum that i can just stare at for hours and admire. its so portable (which is necessary for a student or anyone who wants a light portable machine. i would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone HOWEVER PLEASE PAY A COUPLE EXTRA HUNDRED BUCKS AND GET THE MODEL WITH 4GB OF RAM!!!!!!!!the ram CANNOT be upgraded once you buy this computer because apple stuck the chips on the motherboard. i often find myself running out of memory when doing cpu intensive tasks such as flash.other than that, its very silent, quick, and extremely easy and fun to use. I've had it for over a year now and i love it.
