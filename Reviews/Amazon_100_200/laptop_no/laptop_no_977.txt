I've only ever had Dell computers previously but heard great reviews about this computer. I bought it for college and so far it's amazing! Very light and easily maneuverable. It has better features than any Dell laptop I've had in the past. It does take a little while to get used to an Apple computer compared to a PC but it is worth it. I love this computer!I'd recommend this laptop to any laptop seeker! Choose Apple over Dell, it's worth the slightly extra cost!Also, in concern over buying this computer from Amazon vs. the Apple website. I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed. It's a brand new computer and completely wrapped up safe in the box from Apple. No problems whatsoever. It's worth it to buy from Amazon cheaper because there is no difference in buying from Apple besides the price!
