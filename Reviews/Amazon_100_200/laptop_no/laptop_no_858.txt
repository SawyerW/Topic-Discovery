Received my new MacBook Air today -- turned it on, and couldn't even get past the 3rd startup screen before the machine froze.  It began getting buggy on the second page, and now it is simply stuck without any options (the battery is internal, so I can't remove and start over again).  Very expensive trash.For someone who had just put his toe over the line in terms of converting to Apple from PC, my recommendation to anyone considering is DON'T.  The machine would be more effective as a door stop.I'm typing this from my husband's $400 Toshiba Satellite -- save yourself the money and hassle and buy yourself one of those.
