This is my second MacBook, and this tiny thing is better in every way than the MacBook Pro it replaces.  The only moving parts on this sucker are the screen and the keys on the keyboard.  Other than those it's just one big solid state device.  It really moves files around faster than any computer I have ever seen before.  In several cases I drag and dropped folders with hundreds of megs of files and they just copied in the blink of an eye.  So fast that I didn't believe it and had to verify that the files actually copied before I could believe it.It is really an awesome line of machines and in no way is it a "limited" machine like the Air's used to be.  This is going to be my main work machine.  It has the guts to do it too.  I'm just shocked at how fast it is!
