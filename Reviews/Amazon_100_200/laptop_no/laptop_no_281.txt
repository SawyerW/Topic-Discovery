The only major & very important grouse for me is the way E-sata Port Implementation is done on this laptop. The E-sata port provided is Generation1(SATA1) in spite of the fact that this PM55 chipset supports 6 SATAII ports with Native Command Queuing (NCQ), Port Multiplier, bandwidth aggregation. This laptop for some stupid reason deprives the E-sata port of above important feature.I'm unable to notice my JBOD implementation with E-sata enclosure. I had to go in for Express card in spite of this laptop being in the category "high End". Asus.. can you tell me why when you could h'v implemented it with no extra manufacturing cost?
