If you are going to use this computer for surfing the internet, book reports or light gaming then this is a good computer for you. I would not try to do much more than that. I ordered my refurbished D610 from Cool Running Technologies.When I received my computer the battery died and it would not charge. I sent an email through Amazon and Cool Running Technologies called me back the same day . I missed the call and they left me a message saying that they would send me out a new battery. I received the battery and I have not had any problems since. Even though I had a problem with my battery I would order again from Cool Running Technologies.They acted quickly and fixed my problem for me.
