I purchased this after agonizing over weather or not to get the 15" i5 or the i7.  I could not decide.  In the end, I ended up going with this MBP for the following reasons:* The i7 is not worth the extra price performance wise* I wanted true HD resolution* The 17" is not as massive as some make it out to be.  I carry it with a Lenovo T400 through airports weekly, no problem* This MBP has 512 video RAM, which is awesome* I kinda wanted matte, but after using glossy, it isn't the nightmare some make it out to beThe deal from Amazon was actually cheaper than my company corporate [...] discount. Sad but true.  And with overnight Prime shipping, you cannot beat this deal.  I have finally whittled down to one personal computer (still have the work Lenovo).  I put Win7 on this MBP through Fusion and it works great.  Very fast computer and the best I've ever owned.Highly recommended!
