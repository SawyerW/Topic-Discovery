The Asus Ultra Portable is a steal of a deal.  This little perfomer blows my mind.  Now granted I don't do any gaming, but for internet surfing, emails, spread sheets and all the other stuff I typically do this is just a terrific bargain.  I love how quickly it boots up!  The screen is bright crisp and flawless. I love that it's NOT loaded up with starter software that harrasses you to death to buy the real thing (like Dell's and HP's are, that starter software is such a tease and virtually no help). The Asus is configured exceptionally well, plenty of USB access points, WiFi is great, card readers built in and the battery life is very good with an easy 6 hours!  This is just a terrific bargain (I paid approx. $445 May 2012)!!!  I shopped Best Buy, Fryes and Office Depot, Amazon had the best deal and fast delivery, no sales tax.  LOVE this ASUS U32U-ES21 and can't imagine that there is anything else out there that comes close for the price I paid!
