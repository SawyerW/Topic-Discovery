I was looking for a great laptop that would be able to respond to all my digital needs and hopefully I found this.With a 6GB RAM, this laptop can handle everything you could simultaneously. You will love the the extra light weight, you barely feel anything on your lap.SRS Premium Sound integrated gives you a complete personalization of your sound quality. As on the description, you have a 640GB Hardrive that will hold all your musics, videos, games, movies, etc...I also found the Intel Turbo Boost Technology very handy when it comes to run heavy programs at the same time, it gives you that extra boost(up to 3Ghz)when you need it.Bluetooth also integrated (couldn't ask for more). Battery life is pretty decent for a Windows laptop(up to 4hrs on Balanced power plan).Sleek and professional design.Webcam can deliver HD videos which is simply amazing.Finally, the processor is so "robust" that even when you have many programs running at the same time, your CPU usage is usually less than 20%.Great value for the price, would greatly recommend it to laptop buyers.
