I own two of these and didn't realize the hassle I got into. One of the two is hardly usable now. The hinges are made of plastic that's easily cracked (and they did). The motherboard or hard drive also appears to have failed. While my computer is still under warranty, when I called the service center I am told that the cracks must be repaired separately first before they can take a look at the motherboard or hard drive issue. I have used quite a number of Dell desktop and laptops for years but now see my children's perspective of why they prefer the MacBook.
