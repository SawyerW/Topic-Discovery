I bought this mac because my old Sony labtop that is around 5+ years old (window XP was the O/S to give you an idea) and heavy touching about 6-7 pounds with a extended battery. Therefor it made me start shopping around for a new labtop. Also the main job for my labtop is for school work, microsoft words, power point, presentations and etc. a work horse and i'm not a gamer. In one aspect some say its a bit over kill for my needs. What made me go with this mac and comparing to my old sony is the battery life 12 hours Vs. about 6-7 hours. Weight 3 pounds vs. 6-7 pounds. Carrying labtop along with books around campus is a lot of work.Coming from a mircosoft and in to mac it is a huge learning curve. I have used older mac O.S but this one is so different.The only thing that I don't like on a mac Vs. p.c is some of the adapter is standard on a p.c but you have to buy on a mac, which mean more money.
