This laptop is great. At first I thought I would be paying for the beats logo, but that was not the case at all. Besides from being very stylish and cool looking this computer has very good hardware. The beats audio makes the laptop have good sound (Although I will admit I expected a little more from the speakers in the laptop, but with an okay pair of headphones it sounds pretty boss). The keys are really nice and easy to use. The touch pad is also nice easy to use and it has a feature were you can lock the touch pad. The laptop itself run very well it doesn't come with any BS already installed programs. It comes with photoshop elements which is a cool bonus. and the webcam is great one of the nicest I've seen on a laptop. Overall this laptop is great for the price. You really get your moneys worth from this and off of Amazon is the cheapest I found it at.
