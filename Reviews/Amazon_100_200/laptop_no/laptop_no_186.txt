I bought a MacBook Pro directly from the Apple store.  At first I was impressed by the speed, mostly booting up and shutting down, considering I was used to a PC with Windows Vista.  Over time, things started locking up just like on a PC.  7 months old and the battery is about to die.  A friend of mine has a $2600 MacBook Pro that already needed the DVD drive replaced.  I sold this thing and got a $300 PC laptop that runs just as well and just as quickly with Windows 7.  Lesson learned: sometimes, more expensive is not better.
