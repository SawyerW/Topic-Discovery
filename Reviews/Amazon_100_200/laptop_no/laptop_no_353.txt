I've been a PC user for a long time.  There are plenty of reviews and features comparison already out there between Mac and PC so I won't go over it.  You really can't understand until you actually used both.  The Mac experience is light years ahead.  After using the Mac for a while my HP laptop 6730 laptop feels like junk.  No wonder why Apple has such loyal customers and high customer satisfaction.  I think what makes it better is not a tangible list of features, but overall how it works and the attention to a lot of small details that makes up the whole.  Thats why you can't just compare over a list on a piece of paper, but you have to actually use it to know.  All the people I know who use both always prefers a Mac.
