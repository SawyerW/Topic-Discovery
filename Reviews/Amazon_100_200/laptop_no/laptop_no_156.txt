Happy with my purchase so far.  I am very pleased with the preformance of the computer for the money.  This isn't a top of the line machine but for the price I think I got everything I had hoped to get with this purchase.  The downside is this machince has a body and keyboard (My last laptop was a high-end Sony Vaio which probably rasied my expectations).  When typing on the keyboard it feels like some of the keys are going to pop off and the body is cased in shinny black plastic that show all the finger prints and more imprortantly scratches.I would recommend this a computer for someone looking in the $500-$750 range
