I purchased this Z Series laptop about 5 months ago, its my first Sony laptop, Im a Mac fan, but not any more I guess... I gave my sister my macbook pro, and the change has been great. I was looking for fast performance and reliability, as well as light with strong battery life (6 hours in speed mode). This computer has all of that.The screen display is very sharp as well as scratch-resistant. Keyboard is very comfortable and not loud; similar to my new Macbook.Price is MORE than fare! (once you bought it you wont regreat it)I also own a macbookpro that I bought here in Amazon (15 inch,2.53 processor,4gb ram) that I loved untill I found this one, now I found my Macbook heavier and slower compared to this pice of heaven.
