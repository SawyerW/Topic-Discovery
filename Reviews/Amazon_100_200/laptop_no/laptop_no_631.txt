I bought this laptop when amazon was really pushing it for about 365.00. The specs are decent if you only want it for just surfing the net or for a student.What I really like about it is that the in built webcam has a light when its activated so it great when using skype. What I hate about it is that touch pad is rough and the right and left keys are too close together (fingers go further away from where it really is)The price I see they are asking for it now (468.00) is definitely not worth it. If you want a basic computer this is for you.
