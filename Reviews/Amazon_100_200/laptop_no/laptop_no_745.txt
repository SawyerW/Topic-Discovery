I have been looking to buy a mac for some time given I have other Apple products and wanted them all to work seamlessly together. Now I have the Mac Air, its fantastic. All my docs and pics are seamlessly on any device through the icloud. The computer itself is small, light and very much portable. My only problem with it is the battery does not last as long as I thought it might have.I chose to buy from Amazon as the Apple store would not allow me to buy online since my credit card is not issued by the USA. The service I received from this seller was fantastic. When I placed my order, The expected delivery dates extended beyond the time I was in the USA. I emailed the seller and they were quick to assure me that it would be there the next day which it was.
