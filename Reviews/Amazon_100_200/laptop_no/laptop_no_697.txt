I was looking for an inexpensive Windows laptop to run Quicken.  I've benn using iMac for most applications for over 3 years and have just upgraded to Lion.  I did not like iBank or other Mac  financial apps.Office Depot had the Lenovo 570g on sale this week for $399, my price point.  Set up was easy.  I've installed Quicken and downloaded transactions from 5 accounts.  I also installed Turbo Tax and got 2011 out of the way.I've enjoyed the Chrome browser that was bundled.  I was surprised I had to download Adobe Acrobat  Reader, but this was easily done.  I'm looking forward to a walking tour of my apartment when I next Skype with my out of town daughter and grandchildren.I don't see a downside to this pc for the casual user.  I'm a retired IT professional who enjoys easy to use applications.  Windows is easier to use than when I abandoned it 3 years ago.
