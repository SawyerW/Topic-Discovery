There's nothing poor I can say about this computer. Incredible graphics, ungodly amounts of storage, and works with great speed. You can drop this thing, put things on it, leave it running 948290 applications and spill stuff all over it and it STILL preforms like it's brand new. All hail Steve Jobs and the Apple company. This thing is miraculous.as far as the company that sold this too me goes?Do not purchase from Proton Computers.I bought this through them and they never "informed" me that this was not refurbished. When I bought it with the understanding that it was. I expected to get a brand new shiny looking computer, and it had physical defects all over it. As well as a very used up battery.Regardless, the upgrades they did to this thing we're enough for me not too care too much. They also credited me money to get things like the clutch cover fixed.
