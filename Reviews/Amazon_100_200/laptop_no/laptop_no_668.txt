I purchased this for my father who lives in Russia and never really had to deal with any computers at all. So I wasn't looking for anything fancy, just a basic laptop that would work in another country, would get him online and let him watch movies.  For what we needed it for - it was perfect. Still is. My dad has now been using it for about a year and is very happy with it.  It has all the basic laptop features, very user friendly (even for a total beginner!) and really made him very happy. If you just need a bsci laptop for the purposes that I needed it for - this is just great!
