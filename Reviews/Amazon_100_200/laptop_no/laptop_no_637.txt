So I have been using my new Acer ultrabook for about 5days now.  I bought it for personal use, and so I don't have to share with my son.  Mostly I use it for internet, email, facebook, pictures, videos, and the occasional document.  I love the size!  I was worried the screen might be a little small but its perfect, and so light weight and easy to carry.  It holds a charge really well.  Its super fast, and loads really quickly.  The only complaint I have is that the internet connection cuts out sometimes, or doesn't load well.  It could just be my wireless system though.  All in all I am very happy with it, and am satisfied with the cost.
