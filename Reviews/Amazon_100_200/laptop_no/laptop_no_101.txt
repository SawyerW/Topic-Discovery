I HAVE BOTH THE DV 6000 AND DV 9000.  MY DV 6000 I HAVE OWNED FOR FIVE YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THOSE PROBLEMS.  WHEN MY WIFE WANTED A NEW LAP TOP FOR HER SELF, I DID NOT THINK OF ANY THING EALSE OTHER THAN HP.  I HAVE HAD OTHER BRANDS PRIOR TO MY HP's.  I HAVE ALWAYS DONE MY RESEARCH AND COMPARISSON BEFORE I BUY.  HP LAP TOPs FOR ME ARE SECOND TO NONE.  I DO NOT LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE TEACHERS THAT WALKS AROUND SCHOOL WITH A LAP TOP WITH A PICTURE OF A FRUIT JUST TO IMPRESS EVERYONE; ALL THAT DOES IS TELL PEOPLE YOU ARE A BIG SPENDER AND NOT TOO WISE WITH YOUR MONEY.
