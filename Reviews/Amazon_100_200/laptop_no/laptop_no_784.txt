Get the WARRANTY - My Mid 2012 Macbook Air i5 8gb has already had:- Screen replaced (due to dead pixels)- Hard Drive SSD crashed and was replaced under their recall program- Now, that I am out of warranty the Memory has started to fail, so I was told by the Apple Tech - Ironically this is right after I took my Laptop in for Hardrive Replacement Recall... They messed up my laptop when they replaced the SSD and now I'm at fault for the memory failing!Apple wants me to fork out another $280 to replace the logic board after I have already spent $1400 USD on this laptop!This laptop is only a year and a half old!!!Apple "USED" to be reliable... but not anymore... which is probably why they are promoting the warranties so much.Good Luck to all... This is made in China so I guess we get what we pay for...By the way I own a lot of Apple products: iPad, iPad mini, iPhone 5, macbook pro, airport extreme, ipod's, iTouch.. Apple is slowly losing their loyal Customers...
