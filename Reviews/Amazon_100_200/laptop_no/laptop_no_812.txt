Its perfect! I love tha fact that is not heavy at all! you could travel or take it to work and never notice it in you purse.The keyboard is great, the screen is nice, it's fast, impecable and with long durable battery charge, I have used it 3 days in a row for approximately 3-4 hours before charging it up.The only issue I have is that o bought the 128 GB hard drive and I had to buy a portable external one of 2 tb because when I'm getting close to the maximun mac storage my computer gets slow and even frezzes up.But in general is the best computer I have ever had! I love every single detail, And definately consider myself an apple fan! I would only change it for one macbook air with more storage capacity.
