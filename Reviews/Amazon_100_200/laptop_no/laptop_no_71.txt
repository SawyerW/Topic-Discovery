I have this machine and loved it for the first year.  First, the WIFI stopped working.  I thought it was somehting I did; but I never worried about it since I usually plug it directly into ethernet anyway.  Then I noticed it was getting very hot; again, I thought this must be normal. Then I noticed all the other people who have the same issue.HP told me it would cost $400 to fix this computer since it wasn't under warranty; I liked the computer so I sent it back.  then the fun started... it wasn't fixed by the time promised and each time I called, I spoke with someone about 10,000 miles away from the repair shop, who knew nothing about what was going on.  After over a month, the last time they called me to tell me there would be a delay in getting it repaired I told them to just send it back to me.  HP is horrible; they refuse to accept responsibility for selling a product they know to be defective and they don't care about their customers.  I will never buy another HP product and am considering a class action lawsuit.
