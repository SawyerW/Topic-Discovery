I am a complete apple product junkie but have never liked laptops in general.  I had a MacBook Pro for a while but it felt so heavy and awkward to carry around and use I eventually ditched it for an iPad and Mac Pro desktop computer.  Now with this MacBook Air I finally found the laptop for me!  This little machine is so small, light and sleek but very powerful!One of the biggest improvements in this laptop from my Macbook Pro is the temperature.  I can rest it comfortable on my lap without it getting scorching hot like other Macbooks.  This was my biggest pet peeve about Macbooks.  The only negative I can think of is the battery life is just OK.  I seem to be getting more in the 3-4 hour range than the advertised 5 hour life.The more I use it the more I love it.  This is a definite buy!
