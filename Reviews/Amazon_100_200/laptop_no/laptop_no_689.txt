I bought this laptop specifically to run Ubuntu 12.04 and it passes with flying colors...everything works out of the box and well. As for the laptop itself, it's a Dell which means its slightly cheaply made. The trackpad button are really tight and one of the hardrive screws stripped using the correct driver; it was just soft metal and they used locktight on the screw too. I didn't get the illuminated keyboard and do regret it but without it works fine too. first thing I did was max the RAM to 8g and swap out the harddrive for a small SSD which rocks! Windows 7 is gone and good ridden...it sucked from the moment the laptop booted up. I kept it on the original hard-drive so I can sell the laptop later with the original setup on it. all in all good hardware but your not going to game on it. graphics are good but this isn't the laptop for gaming.
