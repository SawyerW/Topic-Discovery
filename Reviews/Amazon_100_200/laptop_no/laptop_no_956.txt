I have been getting increasingly frustrated with my PC laptop always being slow. I've had it for 5 years, and this one replaced the one I had for over 5 years prior. I had gotten tired of always getting anti-viruses, slow speeds when I had multiple tabs open, and always trying to defragment or clean it up because it performed poorly. I've been itching for a MacBook for years, and when I got the amazon card with no interest for a year, I grabbed it. So far, I've had it for almost a month, and I love it. I really haven't used it to it's full potential yet, but I enjoy how not only is it VERY light, but I can use it for an entire day without charging it, unlike my laptop as it got older. (Near the end I couldn't have it unplugged for longer than an hour, so imagine if I wanted to move from room to room.) I hope to have an update in a few months to see how far I've come, but I have no complaints so far.
