It's my first Mac and I am pleasantly satisfied with it. By using it you feel you are in front of a machine built with detail, quality and good performance.Strong Points - Attractive design, solid appearance, good materials. - Excellent keyboard and trackpad. - Portability, ideal size to carry anywhere. - Operating System, friendly and intuitive. - i5 Sandy Bridge processor, faster for most applications. - Battery life.Weak points - It could improved graphics capabilities and the resolution of the screen, but still very good. - No Blu-Ray.Definitely one of the best in its category, is excellent,  but if you're a fan of the games or your needs are graphic design and photography I would recommend take a look at a laptop with i7 quad core processor and dedicated graphics card.
