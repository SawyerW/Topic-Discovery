It may say to be the OLD Version, as the so-called Newer Version is available, thou that is not the true statement, as the Newer is not with the same configuration, not even close.The primary reason for me wanting this rather Former Model instead of the NEW Model (Retina) was the Configuration itself, and the UPGRADABILITY of it, which is almost NON Exsistant in the Retina Models.After decades of Pure PC usage, it does take a bit time to get use to the new OS and the way things work in this one compare to Windows, but that sort of applies to every change over.The integration of the system on my domestic set-up, consisting of almost purely Apple Products, from router to Systems, and Peripheral iOS units like the IPads, IPhones and IPods, went smoothly,
