I got this laptop to replace another gateway that had almost run out of space due to media files filling it up.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase and have not had any problems at all.  The 17.3 screen is taking a little getting used too as its seems huge compared to what I was used to but it delivers a fantastic picture and great for watching movies on.  The 500 GB hard drive will give me plenty of space for years and the i3 core processor has been exceptionally fast.  Highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a media laptop or just an everyday laptop.
