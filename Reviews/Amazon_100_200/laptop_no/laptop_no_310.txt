I got this computer on a lightening deal on cyber Monday. I use google chrome for internet, and it worked fine the 1st 2 days.  Then I started to install and transfer some basic software & files to this laptop and planned to use it as my work computer. But I don't know what happened - The internet start to crash every time I want to use it, with both google chrome and internet explorer. I checked and did all updates available, and restarted computer again and again. Yet it is still happening. I really want to like this computer - I mean I got it at $399, and Toshiba is a well established Japanese brand. But I don't know what to do now. Have this happened to anyone else? or if any one has any idea about this issue? Thanks :)
