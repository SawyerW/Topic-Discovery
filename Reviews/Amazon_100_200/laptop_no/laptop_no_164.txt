After reading all the reviews it's obvious this is a bottom of the line piece of it .It works well at first but over heats easily .I prop it up high and have my own small fan under it. It can't be pushed and CPU runs high under even a simple task like playing a song or  a video , thank God I'm getting my desk top fixed and this will be a nice backup for me and my Mom to use .This is like a small foreign car compared to a desktop or something with better processors.It's like comparing a 4 cylinder to a V8 .Treat this little car with respect and don't push it and say your prayers,just be thankful your doing well enough to be reading this and able to buy a laptop.Good luck consumers.
