Seller was offering a good price, and I ordered my Macbook Pro-15.  Seven days later, UPS dropped off my computer.  When I opened the package and removed the computer, I was dissappointed to see a 1" long dent on both the top and bottom of the aluminum case!  Returned it to J&R;, and ordered a replacement.  After a day or two, I was informed that the replacement unit wasn't in-stock, and I elected to get my money back.  Amazon promptly returned my money, and was kind enough to give me a few bucks as an incentive to continue doing business.  I took that money, and bought a Moshi Card Reader and Silicon skin cover for the Macbook Pro 15 that I just bought from my local Apple Store!  Amazon? (top notch)  J&R;? (they have a couple issues they need to address, and should of double-boxed the computer).
