I've been a PC user ever since I ever started using a computer, but until the last couple of months I started thinking that I should try out a Mac. Then I decided I wasn't going to get one, because I thought they were way too overpriced, but after going into the apple store, and trying them out on so many occasions, and loving it every single time, and reading all the positive reviews, I thought that they were probably worth the money. So I finally decided a macbook pro model (13") would be perfect for me. The price was a little high, but much more affordable than the other models. All I can say is I am so glad I made the purchase this computer hasn't given me any issues, and runs so smoothly and quietly. The screen is so vivid, and the aluminum material feels sturdy. I love the backlight keyboard, and I really dig the ilife software that comes with it. The computer takes no time to start up, once it's on you are ready to go. In conclusion I can't complain about this product, it really did meet my expectations.
