The computer is fast and lightweight and reminds me a bit of Apple laptop I have owned over the years.  Unfortunately, the battery will totally discharge in about 10 days when the computer is shut down and not in use.  Sony (very reluctantly) sent me a replacement battery after I had spent about 4 hours on the phone troubleshooting the computer.  The replacement battery discharged as quickly and Sony had me send the computer in.  Then Sony declared that a total battery discharge in 10 days was perfectly "normal" and simply sent the computer back to me.  When I requested a replacement computer since Sony had not been able to fix the problem Sony simply stated "we don't do replacements".  Even talking to a supervisor and Consumer Relations didn't help.  Sony's tech support is a disaster.  This is my first and last Sony computer.  Total disaster.
