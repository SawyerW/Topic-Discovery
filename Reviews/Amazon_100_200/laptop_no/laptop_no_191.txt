This is by far the best computer that i have EVER owned, and i have owned over 10 different computers. The quality is unsurpassable, and it is clear that you are getting the most for your money.Prior to this Mac, i had had PCs, and thought that i would never want a Mac, ever. Some of my reasons were 'oh it's too expensive,' and 'you're just paying for the brand'Both of these were proven untrue once i was gifted this amazing computer. You are not paying for the brand, you are paying for top-of-the-line technology, and an environmentally sound, as well as functionally sound computer.This computer has literally changed my outlook of all computers. and i wish that EVERYONE who is an active computer user was able to have this wonderful, amazing, stylish, sleek computer.
