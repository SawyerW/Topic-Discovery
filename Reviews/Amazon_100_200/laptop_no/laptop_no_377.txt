I've always been a PC user my whole life. Always bought VAIO's and TOSHIBAs which are both very nice, very fast and with very crisp screens but...  There is nothing, nothing, NOTHING out there that can compare to this MAC. I did not even wanted to be a MAC user myself but if you haven't tried one out, please do before buying into a new laptop. True, is more expensive than most, but just ask yourself WHY?? Good stuff never comes cheap. No? compare speed, performance, OS X vs Windows... There is no possible way to compare them!!! Thinking to buy a new computer, get a MAC... everything else it's just a screen and a keyboard.
