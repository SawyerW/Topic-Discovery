Update: FIxed with OSX 10.9.2For the last few months the screen goes black at least once per day while the keyboard is still lit. The mac has to be hard booted to be usable again. The Genius at the retail store told me this is a known issue and Apple will eventually fix this problem. This sounds like something Microsoft would say... "Just live with it, there is no problem, It's a feature." This is the first macbook I have owned and will nor recommend to my friends and family. I purchased this expensive machine so it would work. How can I do presentations in a business environment and still look professional with an issue like this?
