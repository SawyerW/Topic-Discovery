I am a completely non-techie former PC user and never thought I would want a Mac. I thought the new system would be too hard of an adjustment. I tried buying 2 laptops that ran Windows 8- now that is hard to get used to! Returned both of those, got the Mac, learning what I can by trial and error and Googling the rest. Love it! Easy to use, beautiful, light and responsive. Only thing is- I am not getting nearly 12 hours of regular use (not streaming) and at half dim screen. I found a way to reset the battery online; will have to try that out. If the battery issue gets resolved, this laptop will be perfect for me.
