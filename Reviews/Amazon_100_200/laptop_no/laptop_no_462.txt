I had an iBook before and loved it.  After a brief experience with PCs, I was happy to come back to the Apple family.  Unfortunately, the return has been filled with a lot of frustration.  I already had my MBP's keyboard and Airport replaced to fix manufacturing defects (within first month).  The problem with the Airport continues.  Throughout my 6+ months of ownership, my MBP experiences sluggishness + regular "force quits."  To make matters worse, the internal CD drive is a headache too and doesn't properly read many CDs that PCs have no trouble.  I love the design and feel of the product, but have had too many "I can't believe this isn't working" moments to give my MBP a thumbs up.
