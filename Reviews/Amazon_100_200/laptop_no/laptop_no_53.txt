I just got one of these second hand, but in very good condition from my dads work. It doesn't have a single scratch on it. My dad has the T61 and I have the T61P, this laptop is as solid as a tank and feels so good. Its just made right. Although I wouldn't recommend paying 2000 dollars for one of these, if you find a second hand one you should definitely go for it, if its in good condition. I have a G73 and two desktops one of them with an I7-2700k and the other one with I5-750, I use them mostly for gaming and stuff but this is for my school work its not a gaming machine but it does what its supposed to. fantastic laptop.
