This laptop is just great.  It is light and portable.  After having suffered with having two laptops (non-Sony) damage themselves because of a cost cutting strategy of using the screen itself as a support member, I have switched to Sony.  They have a case that is stiff enough to actually protect the computer.  A 12.1" screen is the perfect size for most things (especially if you are are trying to use it on a plane and you find yourself in coach, you just can't open a 17" screen unless you are Mini-Me).  This machine is great for everything you might need from a notebook and want to use it outside of the home.Great job from Sony!
