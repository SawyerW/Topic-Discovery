We bought one of these (at OfficeMax) for my college-age daughter.The wi-fi sensitivity is so poor that we had to buy an external USB adaptor. TP-Link TL-WN822N 300 Mbps High Gain Wireless N USB Adapter with 2x 3dBi Antennas This fixed the problem, but it's a pain to have to carry around an external device to connect with the Internet.Last night she picked it up by placing her thumb on the screen -- something you wouldn't think would be dangerous in this age of tablets -- and the screen cracked.Clearly not satisfactory for a "portable" device. I've dragged my 11.6-inch Acer all over the world without worrying about it. I wouldn't want to take this HP laptop around the room.On the plus side, it was trivial to partition the disk and install Ubuntu Linux, so at least I don't have to worry about viruses ... if I can manage to replace the broken screen.
