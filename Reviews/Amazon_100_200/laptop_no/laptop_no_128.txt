So...I had spilled some stuff on my ancient HP laptop in December, and toughed it out by splitting time with my husband on our desk top...but with a seizure and neurological condition, I don't always have the energy to sit upright at a computer...so I was really jonesing for a new Netbook.  Just to play games on Pogo and Facebook, watch a movie, go on youtube etc...nothing complicated.However, every net book even used was 200 dollars....so I found someone local who refurbs laptops and pc's.  Got this one for 160 dollars! It's insanely fast! for me that it is...I'm used to older sluggish load times...so this product, while a bit older of a model, is still perfect to mess around with while hubby does his transcription work, and I want to have some fun, catching up on tv episodes or playing games....and as I said...refreshingly speedy, compared to what I did have.Hey...at only 160...if it lasts 18 months I will be one happy camper! love it love it! Especially when something similar is going for 250 something at a pawn shop down the street.
