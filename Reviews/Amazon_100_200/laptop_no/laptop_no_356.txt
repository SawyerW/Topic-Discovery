Ok, I have had many laptops and desktop computers.  What can I say, I'm a geek at heart.  I have been a Linux user for the past 4 years and refuse to use a Windows machine outside of a virtual machine setup.  I have always wanted a Macbook Pro, especially the 13 inch model.  I bought mine here for $929.  I also purchased 8 GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256 GB SSD hard drive.  Now if I had ordered this setup on Apples website it would cost me $2,000.  But after working the dollar menu here on Amazon I did it for just over $1,200.  After switching out the RAM and hard drive this laptop boots up in 10 seconds and there is zero waiting.  My SSD is the Crucial 256 GB  and the write speed is 270 MBps and the read speed is 504 MBps.  WOW.  I highly recommend getting this laptop and upgrade to a SSD.
