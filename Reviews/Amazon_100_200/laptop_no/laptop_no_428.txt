This laptop is pretty good, I ordered it off of amazon is used condition and am using it to write this message. I've had it for 3 months now, and I think it's pretty good. I would give it 5 stars if it had a little bit of a better ram, I try to play my sims 3 games but they don't come out as good looking as they should, and if it didn't go slow every now and again. I think this laptop's great overall, I use it to browse the web, watch DVD movies, play games, etc. If you're looking for a cheap laptop that can go pretty far, then this is it.
