This is a solid laptop with great performance. I too was disappointed with the very dim display when running on battery until I figured out that Dell has set it that way in the system BIOS to persumably extend the battery charge. If you hit the F2 key while the laptop boots up you can enter the Setup and correct this. I moved it from a default setting of 3 to 6 and the display dims only slightly now on battery.Be careful not to change other settings while in setup unless you know what you're doing. You could cause major problems.
