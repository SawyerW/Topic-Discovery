I had this machine for 8 months and everything was going well. It had decent speed and overall performance even when using multiple programs at the same time, like web browsers, Adobe Photoshop, and InDesign. People also always gave it compliments for having such a sleek and beautiful design. HOWEVER, near the end of its 8th month, it just crashed and the screen turned black. It wouldn't turn on. It was such a pain to have someone figure out what was wrong with it. In the end, the battery was FRIED, and since the battery isn't user-replaceable, it was IMPOSSIBLE to find a new one. I gave up on it and got a new LENOVO laptop instead. BEWARE, you WILL have problems and you WILL experience how stinky Acer's customer service is.
