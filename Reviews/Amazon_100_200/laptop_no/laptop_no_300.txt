Computer failed the first time that I turned it on after opening box. Apparently I can either return it or HP will send me some parts. I am guessing that if I return it, it will only be sent to someone else.....Added - So I decided to keep it and get another hard drive from HP. It took awhile, and many phone calls, but I now have a computer that appears to work.It seems that everyone that orders this gets an inoperable computer So be prepared to call HP service... It seems to be the policy of HP and/or Amazon. Just sell the returned units as "refurb" and hope that the purchaser is willing to call HP service and work through the problems....
