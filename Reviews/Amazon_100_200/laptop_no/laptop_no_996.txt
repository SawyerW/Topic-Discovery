I'm not going to talk much about the technical side because there are tons of it online.I got this Mac as a gift to my wife on our anniversary and she was stunned :) So aside from the technical specifications I would say that this is diffidently a great gift.I chose the Mac for a few reasons:- It looks fabulous!- Durable- Extendable (You can upgrade memory and hard disk - not the Mac Air ver)- It is luxurious like a jewelry- The system is easy enough for her and she saw it before- As an all time Windows user I was interested to try the system too :)She love it and I did like it a lot, but I'm going with a Windows 8 device when it comes out ;)
