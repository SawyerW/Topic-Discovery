I bought this laptop around this time last year during a sale.It was amazing at first, since the keyboard was very easy to type on and the casing was a solid matte finish.I used it as my main computer for months since it had nice specs, barely took it out of the house twice.However, around January the side of the casing started to crack off just from regular opening and closing.I could push it back into place and it would hold fine, but it got worse.The entire left side started to crack off, leaving the screen to not stand upright or close correctly.I brought it in and tried to call in but repair was not covered on my warranty nor was it cheap.I've heard of the same problem happening with many people who have the same laptop, if you are looking for a new laptop, stray away from Lenovo's consumer line.
