What I like:1. Unlike other HP laptops I have owned recently this one does not have the heat problems the others have had.  (this might in part be due to only having a single processor)2. Nice case design3. I personally like the touch pad on this model better than several of the other HPs I have owned4. It ships with Windows 7 and so far this has been a very stable systemCons:1.Only 2 G of RAM (this however is a very easy fix and HP has great video and illustrations on their web site for adding laptop RAM)2.With the single processor even some basic computing seems to slow down.  (However I am still able to run the latest version of Adobe Photoshop Elements which is a bit of a resource hog)I got this on a lightning deal at even at a higher price point I feel this is a nice value for the dollar for someone who is looking for a basic entry level laptop.
