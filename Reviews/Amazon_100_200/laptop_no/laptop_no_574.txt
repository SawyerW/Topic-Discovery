Looks about the same as older elitebooks.  Hinges are not as noticeable.Improvements are many:1) I5 runs cool and quiet.  Didn't gotten hot on my lap even during installation of MS Office 10.2) Solidly built. The area below your palms doesn't flex and nor does it flex if you hold the laptop from the corner.3) Easy access panel to memory, hard drive, for upgrade, maintenance, and cleaning.4) Decent battery life.  Not as good as apple but getting there.  Runs for 4-6 hours on standard battery.5) Bigger mousepad.Complaints:1) Larger mousepad gets in the way of typing sometimes.2) Continues to run when laptop is left unattended. Waste of battery.3) A little on the heavy side, although expected with more metal parts.4) Buttons have a little more travel than desired, especially the mouse buttons.Best laptop so far.  Looks like this one will last for a while.
