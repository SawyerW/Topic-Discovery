This latest iteration of the MacBook Air is very speedy.  At least double that of my mid-2011 model.  Other than that, the form factor is the same and the screen is of the same clarity, brightness, and quality.  I have not seen a great improvement in battery life compared to my 2011 model either; it has been lasting about 8 hours with normal use, and about 6 when running Parallels (with Windows 7) or working with pictures.  So maybe not worth an upgrade just yet if your MBA is 2011 or newer, but a highly recommended laptop otherwise.  I am the only MBA user out of a company of a few hundred, and my MBA has lasted longer and remains faster than the stock PCs we buy.  Using Parallels (and Windows 7), I am as able as any of them to use Windows applications as needed.  100% compatibility with our network and others so far!  I sure wish Macs would get a little more traction.  Apple laptops like the MBA are truly innovative, user friendly, and quality-built.  If you are new to Macs, the MBA is a great place to jump in.
