It's quite a change from a PC to an Apple but Apple has lots of tutorials to help.  IF you ignore the tutorials you'll probably still figure most everything out - but it is a culture change.  The computer itself is small, handy, and waaay faster than my PC which has the same memory but more hard drive space.  I have installed Microsoft Word for Mac and some of the features I've grown used to aren't there, but all the important stuff works.  Apple is a much better computer if you start with it, so you don't have to unlearn so much.  I wish I had never had anything else!
