This is my first Apple laptop, finally!!! I bought it here on Amazon, since the price was substantially better than anywhere else;) I got the base model, as I wanted to upgrade it myself after the purchase. My current configuration has 16GB RAM and 256GB+512GB SSDs inside. It boots up in 7-8 seconds, rather than 42 secs as in the base configuration when I got it. Can't complain;)I got used to the OS X fairly easily, absolutely love the trackpad and gestures, the single best feature to me!!! I also installed a version of Win7 through Parallels Desktop 8, just in case, but use it only sporadically, if at all... Mine main uses are just basic browsing, downloading, watching movies, tv shows, listening to music, syncing my iPad and iPhone and light photography apps: Lightroom 4.2, Aperture. For this, i5 dual core CPU is fine, didn't see a need to spend extra for i7 and 15.4". I really wanted only 13.3" laptop (I upgraded from Dell XPS M1330) and that's more than enough for me as I also have an external 24" IPS LCD NEC monitor. So far, I love it!!! Go get one, too;)
