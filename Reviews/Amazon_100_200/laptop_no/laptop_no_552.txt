I got this laptop as a Christmas present about a year and a half ago, and I have never been happy with it. I didn't have internet for a while which made my usage short with using only paint, solitare, etc. However, when we finally got our wifi hooked up my computer immediately slowed down, I don't have a lot of documents, pictures, and only 3.7 GB of music, yet if I use the laptop on my bed, floor, couch, or even a wood desk the fan kicks in very loudly and it becomes hot to the touch, I have been forced to unsafely take the battery out to turn in off to stop it from burning me. It has terrible playback for dvd's, I have never watched one without it skipping, do not buy this computer, if you have children, dvd's, or want to do anything other than play solitare.
