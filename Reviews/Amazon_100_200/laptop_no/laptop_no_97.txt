Laptop review for used Dell Laptop for Tampa LaptopsThe shipping USPS was very good sent out right away, Packaging was ok.The laptop right out of the box had some problems. The mouse track pad would not work, tried a corded mouse, did not work, tried remote mouse got it to work. System was ok at first then Internet explorer started crashing and system was acting funny. Tech support was good, tried their ideas, did not work, arranged to send laptop back, Please note: You will have to pay shipping to send it back to Tampa Laptops. The company repaired the machine, it is working good with no issues as of this time. Support from company is very good, they will call you back, and do what they say they will do. I think buying a reconditioned laptop is a better idea than a used laptop.
