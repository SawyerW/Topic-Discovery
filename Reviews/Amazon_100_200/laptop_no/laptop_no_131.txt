I purchased this aluminum MacBook to replace the white plastic MacBook I acquired in June of 2006. I enjoyed using my white plastic MacBook, but when I learned about the manufacturing process used to construct the new aluminum MacBook, I realized it was time for an upgrade!I have read the unenthusiastic reviews despairing the removal of a Firewire port in the aluminum MacBook. I certainly understand that to some people Firewire connectivity is essential. I am not one of those people. I have never used the Firewire port in my white plastic MacBook. I guess I'm just behind the times; I don't even own a video camera.I have also read the negative comments about the glossy screen. I like the glossy screen because everything looks a little sharper as compared to the matte screen of my white plastic MacBook.The new MacBook has a glorious aluminum case and the computer is significantly faster than my 1.83Ghz 2gb RAM white plastic MacBook.This machine is a winner..
