DO NOT BUY HP PRODUCTS!HP has the worst customer service. I took my laptop in because there was a short in my video cable that caused my monitor to flicker. They wiped my hard drive, tried to deny my warranty by saying I spilled soda all over the mother board (apparently I sat my laptop on a sticky spot once, but the substance never got near any internal parts), and after several long weeks, sent it back STILL BROKEN with a $800 bill! Customer service ran me in circles for months trying to get the issue resolved before I finally got a phone call basically saying, "That's too bad." When I took the laptop to the local repair shop I got the cable replaced in under 24 hours and only paid $50.Toshiba, Samsung and Sony are all GREAT machines; they're more reliable and won't treat you like trash while stealing your cash.
