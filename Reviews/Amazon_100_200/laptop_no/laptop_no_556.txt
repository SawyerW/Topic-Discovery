DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR ANY OTHER COMPAQ OR HP PRODUCT. Unless of course you feel like being charges exhorbitant fees to ship the product you bought thinking it would work back to them so they can fix it.  They DO NOT stand behind their product.  You will pay them $35-40 to ship a product that is defective OUT OF THE BOX to them.  One would believe that they would take responsibility for building something incorrectly and make it right.  You would be WRONG.  Those of you who get one that works, you are OK.  If by chance yours does not work as it should, you get to pay MORE for a defective product.  Congratulations on a terrific policy HP!  Nice customer service!
