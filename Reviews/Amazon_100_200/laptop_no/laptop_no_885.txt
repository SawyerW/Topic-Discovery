I bought this computer for photography purposes. I needed a laptop with big storage, a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem. It suits me perfectly for what I need and I'm very satisfied with this purchase.I don't give it the 5 starts because of the weight factor. It's quite heavy so I try to never move it around. I guess that if you need it more as a stationary computer, it'll be alright. Bought this one instead of the air because of the storage. And besides you can watch movies with any DVD ;) which you can't do on an air laptop.I don't know about the other technical facts, but for an average user like myself, you won't be disappointed if you get this laptop as long as you don't have to carry it around too much.
