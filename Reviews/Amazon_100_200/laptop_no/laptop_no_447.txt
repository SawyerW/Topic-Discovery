I have had this laptop about a week now and am extremely satisfied.  I owned a 3 year year old Macboook Pro prior to this and am very happy with the increase in performance. The machine runs Final Cut Studio and Logic Pro without problems and provides a clearly noticeable increase in performance.  The only negative things I have to say are regarding battery performance.  I am getting "only" 4.5 - 5 hrs of time using pro apps and this is only about half of what Apple claims.  This is still better than about any other laptop currently on the market though.  I have experienced no problems whatsoever with overheating even after long days of use.
