I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect ultrabook... plus my older brother is a major computer guru so he was helping me out. I used to dislike macs and honestly I never thought that I would buy one... and yet here I am. I was tired of waiting for better processors so I decided to buy a mac because of all the positive reviews that I recieved when asking about them. I absolutely love my MacBook Air. It is extremely portable (really light and fantastic battery life), sleek, and stylish. The only problem with buying a mac.... is the cost.. But in all honesty... totally worth it!
