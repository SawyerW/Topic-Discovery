As a whole, I absolutely love this laptop (or "ultrabook").  It is incredibly light, stylish, and comfortable to use . . . except for the touchpad.  I found the default touchpad driver to the best, however.  I downloaded other drivers, but they made the problem worse! The problem for me is not scrolling with two fingers, but rather with the "buttons"--specifically, the left button (the buttons are embedded in the pad like the newer macbooks).  Often I find myself, by accident, clicking as I am scrolling (I will accidentally highlight text, for instance).  Strangely, this problem is not constant. It is very erratic.I hope that Acer is able to come up with updates that reduce all the problems associated with the touchpad.Would I buy this product again?  Absolutely.  The touchpad is the only drawback.  But, it really isn't THAT bad, and I'm sure that I will get more comfortable/adjusted to it.  And, I have a wireless mouse, which I prefer to use.
