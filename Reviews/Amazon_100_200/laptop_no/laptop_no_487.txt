I bought mine in 2010, and at first it looked pretty good. But as time went by, it started getting slower and slower, with occasional freezing (at the point where I needed to press & hold power button in order to reboot). And I have not installed *any* games whatsoever, nor CAD / heavy rendering software. I've always just used it to surf the web and run torrent client software. It does not have bluetooth, which I kind of miss. It comes with Vaio's "web button", which I never used because it basically sucks. You always end up willing to use other applications when powering on your computer.
