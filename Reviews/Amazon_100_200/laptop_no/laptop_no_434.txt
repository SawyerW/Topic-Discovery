Reviews of the Lenovo G555 were decent for an inexpensive laptop so I bought one. Five months later the hard drive crashed. They eventually agreed to replace it and did. Next the plastic facing over the CD drive broke while lifting it out of my backpack. Then, over a period of 3 months, the plastic center piece of the two USB ports on the left side of the computer broke of while removing a USB port connection. The one year Lenovo coverage was up but I had a 2 year warranty with Frys Electronics. Turns out the USB ports are welded to the motherboard so Frys could fix the ports but I would have to pay $190 to replace the motherboard.Other disappointments include; a lot of junk programs the uninitiated would use rather than delete, an inadequate hard drive,cumbersome program access process and tendency to freeze when running multiple programs.
