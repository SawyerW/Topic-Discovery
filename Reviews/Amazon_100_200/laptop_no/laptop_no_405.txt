i've had this laptop for a little over 2 years now.  now on a search for a new one since my hard drive just crashed.  lesson learned to back up more often :/  i've brought this to school many times, it is pretty heavy at over 6 lbs.  i really don't know too much about laptops.  my dad basically just told me to get this one.  i like that it had a lot of USBs.  it seemed sturdy enough to bring places.  the touch pad wore out probably around a year and a half.  it ended up being pretty slow towards the end.  i don't think i would buy a fujitsu again.  i do think the sturdyness is  good though.  i have a 20 month old and a dog, there have been plenty of times my 20 month old has pounded on my laptop.  probably resulting in the hard drive crash... over all i would say its okay.
