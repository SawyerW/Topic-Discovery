Purchased in 2010 and used almost EVERY DAY since, Asus has once again has created a work of art. I never write product reviews but I had to make an exception this time for this laptop. If you're looking for a high performance laptop for all of your multi-media needs, this laptop is sure to not disappoint. I use mine everyday for video games and video editing. The Intel core i7 combined with a speedy HDD and 4GB of RAM is definitely enough to run smoothly for years to come. Also, with all of the extras this thing comes with (bluetooth, multi-finger touch-pad, USB 3.0, ect.) you wont have to worry about connectivity and will quickly be able to navigate Windows with the touch-pad shortcuts. The graphics card is definitely enough to play many earlier games from 2010 on mid to high settings, however it will unfortunately struggle with current and newer games to come. Asus has been a great company that has yet to disappoint me.In Short,The Good:i7 (although it's 1st gen)Quick HDD (7200RPM)BluetoothUSB 3.0HDMI outDecent graphicsScratch Resistant (keyboard and pad area)The Bad:Gets VERY HOTBattery LifeSmall HDDPrice (Currently $1200)
