The item received was exactly as identified.  Also, there was a negative experience that was quickly transformed into a positive experience. The item was to originally be received by a specific date; however, due to the items being damaged in transit, Amazon promptly contacted me and notified of its status and immediately re-shipped a new item at no additional cost, which was received on time.  I was really impressed with the communication and services received with this purchase.Also, the specs of this laptop are perfect for the purpose intended, which is to cater to my educational requirements; furthermore, due to its high capabilities it can also be recommended for a small home business.I definitely will recommend this purchase and amazon to anyone!! :)
