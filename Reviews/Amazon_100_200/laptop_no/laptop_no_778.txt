I got the upgrade with 8gb memory.  This is my go to machine.  Its very fast, very user friendly, and can handle many programs running at once.  I'm a teacher so my typical day is as follows: MS word, MS excel, Chrome (10 tabs), Safari (5 tabs), evernote, mint.com, iBook,pdf viewer.  My husband is a software architect so he has lots of other things open as well.  This still out performs all our machine in speed.  By the way, this machine NEVER GETS HOT and makes ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE!I especially wanted a machine that would be easy to use and I don't have time to fix viruses, software glitches, and such.  I also don't want to trouble my husband with anything as he is usually very busy.  He is looking it that I never bother him at all.  As a matter of fact,  I think he is considering getting a high powered apple machine because of the ease of use I have with this one.Our last apple machine was an ibook in 2001 and that was a real disaster and considered never going back to Apple.  But Apple has come so far in the last few years.
