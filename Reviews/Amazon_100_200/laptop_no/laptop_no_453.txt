A list of the things that Apple has done to reward MacBook Pro customers:1. Visually crisp and brilliant screen.2. A clever large touchpad that negates the need for an external mouse. Gestures actually work.3. Solidly built frame that wont flex and still only 5.6lbs4. Backlit keyboard that is activated only in low light conditions.5. Longest Battery life of a performance laptop.6. Ingenious magnetic power cable attachment with a mini LED that notifies you when charging is complete.7. Firewire 800 9-pin8. Windows running via BootCamp is smooth and fast and all my peripherals work.I'm thoroughly pleased with my Mac. Yes it costs about $300-400 more than a comparably equipped WinPC, but you've got both environments in a well engineered system. You won't regret it... treat yourself! Get a MacBook Pro!
