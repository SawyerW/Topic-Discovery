Like many young professionals in the arts, I needed a mac but I couldn't afford to buy it directly from the source.  I took the time to search product reviews and found that Jay Brokers not only had a strong trend of great reviews (like many people on amazon), but what was unique was that they took the time to positively respond to people who had given them so-so or negative reviews.The product was exactly how they described it in the mail: gently used with minor scratches --although they kind of exaggerated on the scratches--I had to really look to see them.  It had 16 battery cycles prior to my purchase and worked brand new.  They even included a complementary screen cloth.  I feel bad that I'm just getting to doing this review for them because I had a great experience and I love my new mac.
