I have owned more than 4 hp laptops/computers in the last.. 2-3 months. They keep breaking and this was the last chance that I was going to give HP. Upon receiving the product in the mail, I was astonished by its beautiful packaging. I looked for every little problem about this laptop like I had on my other HP's. After having it for a month now, I am simply amazed. This laptop is rock solid and problem free! What I really like about this laptop is the keyboard, sound quality, build quality, webcam, performance, and it's touch pad. There are a few problems though, the screen resolution is a bit low for the cost (1366x768),and the battery lasts me an average 2 hours 40 minutes on HP recommended. Also the laptop speakers are not great, they are just your regular laptop speakers, but that all changes when you plug speakers or headphones into the headphone jack. The sound quality and the bass feels very very good! Overall this laptop is amazing and I definitely recommend it! (Not to people who travel a lot though).
