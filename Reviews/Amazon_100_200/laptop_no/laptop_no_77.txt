I decided to take a chance and buy a refurbished MacBook because I didn't have the money to buy a brand new laptop. I am very happy with this purchase and I don't have many complaints. The few I have are that the bottom came with a few marks and that the keys are a bit worn (but that happens when a laptop is "pre-loved")Really, I think that a refub is the best way to go because you get a great price for a product that might be just a little older but with added upgrades that make this product more desirable.Things are going well and I really couldn't be happier with this purchase.
