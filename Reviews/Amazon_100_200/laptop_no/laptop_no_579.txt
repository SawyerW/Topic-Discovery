I'm not a computer freak. I need it only for single things to do.The best part is it is a really lightweight.Otherwise it is a normally LaptopI found only two very bad pointsOne is the option to recognize your fingerprint. It works very bad. You have to move your finger a lot of times over the sensor before it recognize it.The second and worst point is the option to recognize by camera. Forget it. If you use this option the windows never booted correctly and I needed a lot of attempts to start the system. Then I deleted the driver and since this time I didn't have anymore problems with this Laptop. Overall it is not bad. My friend said if you buy a computer for $ 4000, you get it. If you buy it for $ 350 you get it too. It's a device for people like I not for professionals
