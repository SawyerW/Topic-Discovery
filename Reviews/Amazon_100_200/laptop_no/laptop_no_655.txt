I chose this laptop because it has the AMD A-series A8 chip... This is a powerful integrated graphics processor for a mid/low-end laptop and I'm surprised just how great a deal this machine is. The game performance is impressive - according to a few reports online (youtube videos and PC harwdare test sites) compared to Intel i3 with integrated graphics it's double in terms of games performance) and it's very fast in Sketchup too. I almost went for the newer model suggested... but that only had an A6 chip... if you need a little extra performance buy this computer, you won't regret it. Speakers are average (ie weak) but not a deal breaker for me. Nice a light, LOVE the fast start feature - that's awesome. Samsung are doing great things.
