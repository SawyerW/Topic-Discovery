The iBook G4 is a GREAT laptop, perfect for-- just about everything. I only didn't like some things in it, like it only having an Apple MINI DVI video out, no PCI slot and it does not have the extensive amount of software that you can use with windows.PROS:Just 5.9 pounds for a 14.1" laptopGREAT design2 usb 2.0, firewire802.11g (optional airport extreme card)UP TO 6 HOURS of battery life!
