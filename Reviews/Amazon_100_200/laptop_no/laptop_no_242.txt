The computer is okay.  He set it up with a free Microsoft Essential anti-virus, but the seller should also before hand set up the computer ready for wireless connection.  Because I am not a techie person, I've had so much difficulty in connecting it to the wireless router.  The Netgear technical support (by phone) even charged me of $80 for a six-month (free tech support help to all my computer stuffs in my household) service for calling them to help me set it up.  Very sad fate for me of this needless spending, me, who was just trying to make both ends meet, as a working student, who works only 20 hours in a week.
