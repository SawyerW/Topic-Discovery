I have had this for over a month.  Best computer I've every owned.*The keyboard feel is extremely comfortable, light, and responsive--highly important for a computer injury victim like myself.*The 14" 1366 x 768 is clear and easy to read, even for largish spreadsheets.*The 5 lb weight means I can carry it everywhere in my backpack.  It's the right compromise between a heavier laptop with a bigger screen and a netbook.  I have both with Windows XP, but I had to keep transferring data between them.  Now I just use the G42 for home and coffee shops.*I find I like Windows 7 better than XP.  I upgraded to Professional and installed the XP virtual machine to solve any compatibility problems, but haven't had to use it much.*Feels nice and sturdy.*Decent price*HDMI output.
