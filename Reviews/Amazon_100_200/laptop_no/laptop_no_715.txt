I got my U400 09932FU from BestBuy roughly 18 months ago because Lenovo kept on pushing the delivery date. The only issue I had along the way was the wifi signal but after tweaking the network card a little bit (as instructed on the lenovo forum, there are several options to play around with) it started working just great. It seems that the defaults on the wifi card are set on minimum of requirements in order to preserve battery life. Once you undo these settings it will work just right.After 18 months I can still get 4.5-5hours of battery life, of course wifi off and low brightness, but you can still watch a movie or do some typing. The case is still shiny with no dents or scratches as when I bought it.One annoying thing is that for some reason it takes a minute to connect to a wifi network after waking up.Other than that I don't even think of changing it anytime soon. Maybe I will add an SSD and more RAM.
