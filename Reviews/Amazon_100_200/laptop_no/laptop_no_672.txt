As they say, you get what you pay for.  This is a nice sized unit with good power and capabilities.  It does want me to reboot at least once a week and seems to fail to clear memory quickly so eventually it does bog down.  The only other issue I have had is with the screen color calibration on a second monitor.  After a reboot it defaults to the oversaturated settings and requires a new recalibration.  It allows a comparison between the old cal and new so it remembers there was an old calibration but doesn't allow you to load that on reboot.
