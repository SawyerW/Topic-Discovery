I owned a macbook before I went today (3/14/11) and bought this macbook pro.  Heres a quick run me down:Previous: Macbook, intel core 2 duo, 2.4ghz, 4 GB ddr2, 350gb hdWorked great for 3 years (of course I upgraded it through new egg when I purchased it).Current Macbook pro, i5, 2.3ghz, 4gb ddr3, 320gb hd.So far, I notice a significant increase in speed and power.  I purchased an 8gb kit which should be coming soon.  My Windows 7 vm will fly now....unlike on my macbook...which lagged heavily.Overall the reason for my switch was Battery life, cpu improvement, memory expansion, design, and resale value of my previous macbook ($500). Plus I got a graduate student discount.Once I went mac, I was sold on Apple products.  Definitely a good buy.
