Love my new computer!  Decided to upgrade my 3yr old laptop and was surprised by how  much technology has changed over the  years.  This computer is hands down one of  the best in the market.  I  been looking for a laptop for  business, as I travel quite often,and nothing comes close to what  the S3 offers--  It is so easy to carry, connects fast to internet and I can do multiple things with an ease.My kids has been using ipads for over a year now, and now they want to use my new laptop!!  I may end  up buying another one for Xmas!!You get what you pay for. Awesome buy. happy overall.
