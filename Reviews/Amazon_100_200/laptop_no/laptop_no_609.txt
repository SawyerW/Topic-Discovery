I really don't recommend this purchase. Actually, I will never buy HP products anymore.The keyboard came with a button broken. They send a technician to change for a new keyboard. So, the new keyboard also has a problem. Now, the space bar is not working.In addition, the 2 USB ports on the right side is not accessible (I can't plug any device). This seems to be a design problem of all "dm4" notebooks of HP.They promised me another technician visit. I waited, and nobody came.After a month trying to solve these problem, they offered me a new machine, a "dm4-2033cl" model. But I search this model on the web and I discovered it usually has the same problem on USB ports. After telling that to customer support, they said I have no option. Now I am really pissed off.Customer support on HP is really bad.
