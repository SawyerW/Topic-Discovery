Well, My Mom needed a laptop that 'wasn't too expensive, but could play the games she wanted' so I figured the old Dell latitude series was a good bet. Purwa Trading had the upscale version of the latitude (The Precision M20) which is noted for being pretty bullet proof, so I ordered it- Now, My Mom,(bless her heart) isn't exactly "Computer savvy", so this was perfect for her! In Fact, I had to order another one because my older brother saw Mom's laptop, and decided it was tough enough for him to use everyday...So yep- Purwa Trading and Amazon did alright by me. These are not anywhere near top 'o the line, but they are solid pluggers, and as I said earlier- they are darn near bulletproof!
