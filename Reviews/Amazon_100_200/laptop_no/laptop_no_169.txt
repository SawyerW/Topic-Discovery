I like to think the computer industry has become more like the car industry. You spend more money, have less problems and more features, you go with the cheap car and everything falls apart and you end up paying the same in repairs. Well this is one of those computers that, when the newness wears off, it just ends of being a pile of badly constructed, overheating, and problem stricken piece of crap. It is impossible to repair this computer yourself as you literally have to tear the computer apart to get to things like the fan, which broke after 1 year. The performance is staggering due to effects-heavy windows 7 and always running anti-virus. My advice, just go for a mac, you really do have less problems, and it is worth it.
