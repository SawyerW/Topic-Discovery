I've had a macbook for years. This macbook air, is the best purchase yet. I've got the high end unit with the SSD hard drive. This electronic hard drive makes the unit extremely fast. Startups/Shutdowns, application opening/closing is just amazingly fast.If you travel, and want a quick boot up at the airport to check something. This is the machine. Very fast.The size, screen, lighting is all just excellent. The keyboard lights up in the dark, and is smart enough to save energy and not light up in bright light.The screen brightness is so bright in the dark I turned it all the way down to get it right.Just a dream machine that will be a workhorse for years.
