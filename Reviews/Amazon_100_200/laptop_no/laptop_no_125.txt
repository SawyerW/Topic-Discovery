I was very pleased with this computer when it arrived. It came within just a few days and I had reason to contact the seller prior to shipment and he responded quickly. However, the screen went black after about 60 days. It appeared that the computer itself was working because you could see the lights blinking but nothing on the screen. I contacted the seller asking if there was anything he might be willing to do but I've not received a reply and that was over 2 months ago. This is very disappointing after spending the money for this item and not being able to use it at all. Being retired and on a fixed income means we need to watch our purchases - we think this item should have lasted longer than a couple of months.
