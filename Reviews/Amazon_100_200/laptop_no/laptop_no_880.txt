First of all, I'm a forever Mac user. It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the retina display. For my needs (I also have a desktop), the 13" is very adequate. The display is already extremely good, so didn't feel I needed to pay the $ for retina. I also looked seriously at the Macbook Air. I need the camera card slot (not available on the Air), and I'm not ready to give up the DVD drive yet. And again, the price difference is significant. My Macs have always been extremely reliable, virus free, and easy to use. This is no exception.
