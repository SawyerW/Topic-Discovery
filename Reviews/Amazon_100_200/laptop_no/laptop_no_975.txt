I waited a week to write this glowing review because I wanted to make sure the MacBook Pro was great.  It is!  I was able to make an informed decision to make the purchase because of the complete details provided in the product review. Of course the laptop is for my daughter whose original laptop was stolen so I was not excited about the prospect of purchasing a replacement.  This particular purchase was an exceptionally good choice for the MacBook MD103LL/A runs cooler than my daughter's previous MacBook Pro.  I will have to investigate the limited warranty advertised good through Sept 2013.  It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied. The new MacBook Pro MD103LL/A runs cooler than her previous MacBook MC371LL/A 15.4 purchased in May 2010.
