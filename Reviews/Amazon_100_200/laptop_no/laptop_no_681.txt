The laptop in itself is amazing. Slick design, super fast, stable. However, Samsung doesn't pay much attention to Linux as an operating system and for a long time (until a person from the community fixed it), the battery life was horrible (about 2h). Finally, the audio quality of the mic is poor and people on video calls cannot hear what I say. The quality of the front camera is not very impressive.On the positive side the display is amazing, the SSD that came with this version is super fast (although I have read somewhere that Samsung went back to a slower model on more recent version of the laptop - please double-check this info just in case).I'd buy another one if Samsung started to pay more attention to Linux (ensuring all devices and features work smoothly on it) and fix the mic/camera quality.
