I bought this laptop for my job (I do web design, graphic design, as well as normal day-to-day business stuff) for when I'm on the go (I have a Mac Mini in the office and a Mac Pro at home). Both my other Macs have 16 Gigs of RAM, so I was expecting that I would have to upgrade this one too (it only comes with 4GB). I was figuring this would be like a netbook with sub-par performance. However, the performance has blown me away, in all the times I've used it, it still seems like I've never even really strained the performance (to be fair, I don't multitask on this laptop or use extra displays). My guess is that it's because of the Flash Memory being extremely fast, and the computer thus having super fast swap memory. I've had it for months now and I probably charge it once a week at the most. It's very light, very aesthetic, powerful, just all around amazing. I've had an iMac, a MBP, a Mac Pro, and a Mac Mini, but in terms of price to performance this has blown me away. Highly recommend!
