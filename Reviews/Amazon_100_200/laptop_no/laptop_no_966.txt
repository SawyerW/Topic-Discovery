I have had this for several months now. I waited to review to make sure it is what it is. I was debating about going with the similar one with retina display, I was torn between that and the CD-ROM drive. I opted for this one, (with the drive) I have NO regrets, in fact, I 'm very glad with my choice. I use the drive a lot, and to have one without would be a pain for me. (An external drive would be a nuisance.) I have always had a P.C and was a little reluctant about going to MAC, especially never using one.  I'll never go back to P.C! Love my MAC!!!Thank You Apple for a great product!
