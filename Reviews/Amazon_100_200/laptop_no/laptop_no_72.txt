This is a fantastic machine. Sure, glossy screens aren't ideal for everyone (anyone near any light), but this computer is magnificent.It's as speedy as you could want in a portable, along with being thin, light, and beautiful to look at (in my opinion).It handles Photoshop like a champ, as well as Final Cut Studio 2, and even ran Crysis at mostly high settings in XP Pro (had to drop the shadows a little to get 30-45 FPS average).If you're in the market for a mac, this is a great machine. If you're looking to do any sort of photo work with it you already know that you should reallly have it in a setting where you can control the light.
