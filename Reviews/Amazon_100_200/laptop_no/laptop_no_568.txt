I didn't buy this on Amazon, I got it on sale on Best Buy (< 450) but it's such a good computer I thought I'd leave a review here. This was a great deal at 450. I bought this after reviewing similar models by Dell and Lenovo and settled on this because of the larger 4gb RAM and 500gb hard drive and it was on sale. It's also lighter than most 15.6" laptops, about 5.3 lbs. I enjoy having it on my lap while sitting on the sofa. It doesn't get hot and the only minor distraction is the fan blowing air on left side.  The Core I3 is speedy, the 500gb hard drive is huge and the integrated graphics is more than acceptable. I am able to run NBA 2K10 and MLB 2k9 with acceptable quality.I tried to install a Hackintosh but it didn't work, kept on getting kernel panics. I tried both the MyHack and iBoot so I just ended up running Mac OS X 10.6.7 in a virtual machine. Other than that, I'm happy with the Windows 7 64-bit.
