I don't know why anyone has not mentioned it, perhaps these users didnt follow up or only use this machine for surfing, but it gradually (in less than 2 years) disintegrates and shuts down when you use heavy applications such as editing videos in movie maker or playing games.I have no idea whats up with this thing but i am sick of it, not looking back once i replace it.Don't believe me? Google it. Toshiba has also the worst customer service, so if ever they will help you, they will just reformat your laptop , as another user says, its their way of telling you don't ever come back.
