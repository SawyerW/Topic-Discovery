It's not easy to find a computer this slim and light without buying an ultrabook.  This is half the price of even a low end ultrabook, so of course there are some compromises.  It's not quite as sleek, the processor isn't that powerful, though it's good enough for most HD video and light gaming.  The keyboard has a little flex to it as well.  It's biggest flaw is the screen, which isn't that vivid and has poor viewing angles.  That's to be expected at this price though.  The battery life is very good, about 5-6 hours even with the brightness on high and the wireless on.  I didn't want to spend ultrabook money on a laptop, so I was glad to find this.
