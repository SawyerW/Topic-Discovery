I bought this Macbook Air to my girlfriend. This is her first Apple product. It looks great, and it feels great to use it. She basically loves it. But she also hates it when it freezes. And it freezes a lot. In the first week, it freezed 5 times ! And when it freezes, you can't do basically anything, but hard reboot the system, and all of your unsaved works are lost.Apple know about this issue for months, and yet no solution at all. Just google for "macbook air screen goes black" or join the facebook group with the same name.This is really sad. Buying a premium quality machine, which freezes more than Win95 on a chinese hardware :( Disappointing...
