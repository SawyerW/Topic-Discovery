I purchased this laptop 2 years ago directly from Lenova. They no longer carry it so I can't write a review on their website, but I wanted to make sure someone knew of the issues I've had with this laptop.I've used Lenova laptops at work and have not had any issues with them. That's why I bought a Lenova laptop for my daughter. In two years with this, I've had to send it back to Lenova during the 1-year warranty period for hard drive issues. I've had to take it in to be repaired to an indenpent dealer twice because of slowness and other performance  issues. Currently, the hard drive is not responding and needs to be replaced. Also, there headphone jack is loose and we have to tape the headphone cord into the socket for it to be used. I will not buy a Lenova laptop again. It's been very disappointing.
