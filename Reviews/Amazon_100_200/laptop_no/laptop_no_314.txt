I have worked with computers long enough to understand that a 1.6GHz processor is not all that great, but I figured since it was a gift I couldn't complain, though it was awfully slow even when it was simply trying to pull up Google. I hadn't had it for much longer than 5 months before the computer's screen warped and then it shattered. I was completely frustrated with this horrid excuse for technology. I have a Dell b-130 with a Pentium M CPU(1.87GHz) with 2Gb of RAM that ran better and faster without the dual core and the 4gb of RAM that this thing came with. It is really not so much that it is an atrocity as it is just simply a bad computer even for the price that it was purchased at.
