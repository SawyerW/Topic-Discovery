This is a good, solid machine.The title of this review is also the reason why I took a star off, because F9 hasn't been the norm for BIOS settings to change the order of boot devices. A little label on the keyboard would be helpful. I just went through all the function keys to find this out (not even Google was helpful!--But now it will be :).When the machine starts, press F9 and you can choose to boot from a CD if you like.This machine doesn't come with much clutter, unless you think MS Office is one.Initial battery life never impresses me, let's see how well it will stick to its multiple-hour promise a year from today. Battery is a problem for all computers. We need more technological advancement in this area.Price is great for the performance. I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase.Enjoy!
