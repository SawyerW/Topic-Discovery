This laptop was excellent from the start then it started to give problems with the OS. It's light and compact for a 17" laptop. The raised keyboard makes cleaning easier. The combo function keys means you don't have an overtly cluttered keyboard. The laptop can be used readily by a business or home user. Windows 7 may seem as the right companion OS for this laptop. Windows 7 starts up faster than Vista and performs even better at first. After a month, you get problems rebooting the laptop. I've had to system restore the laptop on numerous occasions to be able get the computer to start properly!
