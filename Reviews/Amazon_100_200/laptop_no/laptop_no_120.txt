I purchased this laptop as a gift for my Mom. I currently use the same make and model which I purchased during an off-lease corporate sale.  I am very happy with this laptop.  It does everything I want with surfing the web, checking e-mail and word processing for the volunteer work that I do.  Since it is an older style laptop it does have some difficulty with the newer higher resolution graphics.  It does not have a fast enough processor to support the Flip camcorder.  But it still is a great buy for the average person.  The laptop I ordered came in a timely manner and it is in great condition just as promised.  I am very happy with this sale.
