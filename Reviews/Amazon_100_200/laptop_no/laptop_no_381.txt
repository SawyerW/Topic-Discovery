This laptop is a disaster, don't buy anything from Lenovo. This is my 2nd lenovo and I have had to send it back to the factory 3 in a span of 6 months to get something or the other fixed. Their repair is painfully slow and support is horrible. The laptop's screen starts developing bands and you need to send your laptop back to the factory for replacement each time. The laptop's body is equally fragile and starts developing cracks in a matter of months. Their support is a joke; No one answers your call for 30 minutes and when they do they just put you on hold and pass you around from department to department.Don't buy a lenovo laptop. Even my 300$ second hand laptop is better than this.
