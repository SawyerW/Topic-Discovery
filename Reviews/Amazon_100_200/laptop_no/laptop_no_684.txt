I recently bought this laptop, on paper it looked great, seemed good value for money. While setting up the laptop I noted that battery wasn't charging, I referred to help forum which advised me to upgrade bios. File was downloaded, I attempted to up grade but it didn't allow me to beacuse the battery needed to be at least 10% charged, after much effort I managed to upgrade however it still would not charge... I called dell who told me that mother board needs to be replaced... I take iss with the fact that I bought a new laptop, I didn't pay for one that needs repairing and so I think the laptop needs to be replaced as opposed to repaired....  After visiting multiple forums I found out that thousands have complained about the same charge fail issue and dell has not acknowledged that they are selling defective devices... I recommend without hesitation that NO ONE BUYS THIS LAPTOP!!!!
