I got this laptop two months ago. I wanted something small so I could carry to school. The computer seem pretty fast. I had no issue running multiple applications on it at the same time. It is very light to carry around. The battery life is pretty long. I am not sure it will last 8 hrs but still good battery life.The only issue is the keyboard is not so easy to use. It took me a while to get use to the smaller keyboard and typing at first was hard. After two months I am getting use to it. Overall a good laptop especially if you use to for travel. Just wish they would improve the quality of the keyboard a little
