My transition to Mac has been smooth, and the 11.6" MacBook Air has just added to my Apple-ness joy!  I thought I might be upset with going with the smaller display, but that is now history.  For those who travel much and want as little space for your gadgetry as possible, choose the 11.6" and you won't be sorry.  I thought I might be missing out by not having the Retina display, but unless you are a serious gamer or graphic design developer, this laptop will be more than sufficient.  I might have gotten the greater memory model, but for my purposes this device will take me through until my upgrade purchase (say, 2 years) without any grief.  And the transaction through Amazon was, well...as it always is with Amazon: flawless.
