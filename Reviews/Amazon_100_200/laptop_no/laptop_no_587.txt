I bought this laptop last month but i didn't receive it yet, maybe the fedex driver sent it to the wrong address, suddenly i complained to the seller. Less than 3 days as the seller promised to me, they sent me another same laptop with extra security. Little bit annoying because the fedex want me picked up the package to the fedex office at that day.I received the laptop and it was completly what i want. As i saw the review before, the charger is heavy and big. But doesn't matter for me. I love this machine so much. Thank you for LaptopAuthority!
