I've owned three iBooks.  The clamshell was a sturdy design, but heavy and limited.  My G3 iBook 800 was great, worked well, but the screen was a little small (dense) and it didn't quite fit on the lap.  Plus I wasn't a fan of the drive tray.  So this new design is far better.  It is much sturdier.  They replaced EVERY material in construction for the better, improved battery life, and it is much faster.  It might just be the perfect laptop at any price.  For most people, it can even replace a desktop.  Comes with tony hawk, plays beautifully.  All other apps I have work perfectly, airport extreme is faster than airport, and keyboard is MUCH better (no longer squishy, better feedback).  You will not regret buying this machine.  Not sure that the 1GHz is worth the extra money.  This model hits the sweet spot.
