The product details are actually correct for the computer specified, but I recieved a different model.Pros: The optional backlight for the keys is amazing, love it. It has a num pad (hate going without one), the touchpad has a button above it to disable it and it is  in the perfect place for me to type without hitting it by accident. The speakers are great and it comes with a built-in webcam and IR sensor (haven't gotten the IR remote to work yet, but it may just need a new battery in it, will update when I can).Cons: Windows Vista (I upgraded to Win7 Pro), the fan is located on the bottom (can heat up if you set it on your lap and your leg happens to cover a fan), the video card is actually an NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT with 512 MB dedicated memory (still DDR2 and not a big problem for me, but it was quite disappointing since I was expecting 1GB dedicated). Also, the battery needs replaced (I bought mine used and the seller mentioned that in his description, so it was expected).
