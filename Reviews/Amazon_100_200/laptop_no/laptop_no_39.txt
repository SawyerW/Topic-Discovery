I've always used Windows, but wanted to check out a Mac, to see how I like them. Since I'm a complete novice, or was, I purchased this used iBook mainly to check it out and learn how Apple works differently than Windows. Granted, it is an old machine, but did teach me things about the Mac OS. So, when I found out my stepdad was getting the newest MacBook, I jumped at the chance when he asked if I wanted the MacBook he'd been using. I think I've used my Windows laptop a handful of times since. Love the Mac and this iBook really helped me start learning, before I got the MacBook Pro.
