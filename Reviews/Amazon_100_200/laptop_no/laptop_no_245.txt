The Good:  For the money, it's decent spec:  Dual core CPU, 3 Gig Ram, 320Gig hard drive.  It runs fairly well.The Bad:  No microphone, very weak speakers, only 2 USB cards I originally bought a high end system that kept getting delayed delivery, so I figured I get this system on the low end to get me by for a year or so.  It should make a decent "travel+school" computer since if it gets lost, damaged, stolen, I have under $400 invested.Recommendation:  Get this is you need for school and basic office work stuff.  Should be okay for some games.  DO NOT get this system if you are huge multi-tasker or bigtime gamer.
