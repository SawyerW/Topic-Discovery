HP Pavilion g6 is my first ever personal laptop that I got about a year ago, and I don't think I would ever want a replacement since I am in love with it.We have started to understand each other well. The keyboard is comfortable to use and the touch-pad has features like auto-scrolling, zooming in & out (even the desktop can be easily zoomed in to magnify everything if need arises, perhaps showing something to my uncle who has a poor eye-sight etc. )The pavilion g6 is very user friendly.The reason why I did not give it a five star rating though, is that I have had some problems of getting slight electric shocks through the keyboard while charging. The customer service said it is because the plug I use for charging is not earthed probably, but I have experienced the electric current even when the laptop was not plugged on for charging. Anyhow, it is only occasionally that happens, and since everything else about the laptop is just great (the webcam, the speed, the smooth start-up & shut-down, auto-updates for every thing, great HP support etc.) I'm all happy.
