Purchased this laptop from  major retailer 4 months ago and it has been working great, no issues whatsoever. The screen is nice and bright and its moderately light weight. Hook up was smooth and customer service was great when i had any questions. And the best part......customer service is in the US and not some foreign country like India. Sad to say, but when i am buying electronic products today if the customer service is located internationally I hesistate to buy. The processor is fast and keeps up with my husband's laptop which has the i5 processor. Samsung has created a very good, but cost effective laptop for the every day man/womans' budget....thank you Samsung.
