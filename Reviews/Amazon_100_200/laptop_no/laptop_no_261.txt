I have had a Dell desktop for a long time and have always been happy with their products and service.  I had a tough time deciding if I was going to get this particular laptop as there were a few very negative reviews regarding their service.  I decided to give it a go despite the negative reviews and although I have only had this laptop a day, I am extremely happy with it.  The screen is bright and clear, the keyboard is easy to use and not cramped and difficult to navigate, the laptop weight is the most surprising thing to me.  I thought it would be much heavier!  All in all, I am very pleased with the entire experience.  Especially how quickly Amazon got it to me.  Normally Dell makes you go through a laundry list of "personalization" steps, and then it takes a long time for them to "build" it.  I guess a lot of people want or need to personalize their laptops, but this one was perfect for me and I love how simple it was to buy.
