This computer looks great: fast albeit heavy.The problem is that the notebook has an extremely fragile power jack. It breaks often. This obviously cripples the whole system and there is no way of fixing it except sending it back to California.You can tell how big the problem is when the official forum has a 17 pages thread about the problem:[...]The repair people were courteous enough but it still takes 2 weeks to send the computer in, get it repaired and sent back. And then a month later you'll have to send it back again because the new power jack is broken.Right now it's just inconvenient. And what will happen when my 2 year warranty expires? This was such a huge expenditure, and soon they'll make me pay dear to mantain it.This is such a shame. I have been a loyal Asus costumer for so long. I used to own an Asus m50v , I own an Asus transformer. And the reason I chose Asus was because their manufacturing standards were extremely high (the m50 is truly indestructible). But that period is gone. Clearly Asus quality control can't be trusted anymore. I won't be cheated again.
