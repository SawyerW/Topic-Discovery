Ok before I purchased this computer last July, I owned an 2009 white MacBook that was an introductory  low end MacBook , it was 2g of ram and 160 gb HDD so going from that to an actual PROFESSIONAL machine is amazing .USB 3.0 is a beast , the 500GB HDD Is amazing and I also SELF upgraded the ram from there stock 4g to an 8gig . My machine is amazing this is my favorite model because the new retina MacBook Pro  is not self upgradable AT ALL . so I enjoyed upgrading my computer on my terms instead of apple overcharging their upgrade on order section.But overall if your a creative type or a business professional this is an absolute MUST BUY as I guarantee satisfaction , great durability , nice software with Mountain Lion , sdx card slot , you will a very happy customer. I have had this computer since early July 2012 and I have had no issues OF ANY KIND . NO BUYERS REGRET OVER HERE.
