This company did an excelent job of getting this Apple to me and the delivery was better than expected.  However, the machine itself left a bit to be desired.  After setting it up, and working on it a bit to get used to the Apple (first one I have owned), the response time slowed to a near standstill.  Not a good sign for the Apple "control everything" approch to Q.C.  The result... had to take the machine into an Apple store (about 35 miles away) and they admitted that the hard drive was failing.  They replaced it and so far so good.  We'll see.
