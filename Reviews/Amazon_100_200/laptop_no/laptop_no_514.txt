I got this laptop and the backspace button stuck a bit. There is an annoying red light on the "thinkpad" logo that is always on; on both the front of the cpu and right by the keyboard. This laptop doesn't come with a 9-key pad on the keyboard. 2GB is not enough to run windows 7 (64bit) smoothly. You could upgrade to 8GB but each 4GB card will run about $75, might as well spend the money up front on a better machine and get a better processor as well. It ran slow out of the box so I returned it and got a Gateway 4GB 500MB with a full keyboard and spent only 13 dollars more. I won't even think about getting another Lenovo. Lenovo is IBM's personal computer department that was sold to China. I'm glad they stuck to the mainframes, good thinking IBM.
