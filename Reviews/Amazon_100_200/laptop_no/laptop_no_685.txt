Ok lets break this laptop down and help you find out if you should buy this laptop.Product FeaturesIntel Core i3-2350M Processor 2.3GHz6GB DIMM RAM500GB 5400RPM Hard DriveNote: I3 processor at this price is not a good deal even with 6gb of RAM (4gb is what avg users use). The 5400rpm hard drive doesn't justify the price either.14-Inch Screen, Intel HD Graphics 3000Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bitNote: 14 inches is a sweet spot between portability and screen size, but you will see that this laptop comes in at about 6.57lbs. Pretty heavy for a 14inch.USB 2.0 Ports: 1USB 3.0 Ports: 2Note: this is good but an extra one would be better.Battery Type: Nonstandard Battery (6-cell battery)Wireless Type: 802.11bgnNote: Wireless is standard. The battery...you can expect about 3-4 hours with normal usage.Other:Chiclet-style keyboardTouchpad with integrated scrolling and gesturesVGA Output (Connect to another monitor or TV, non HD)This is entry level to getting your feet wet with a laptop. For a first time laptop user that does not go with a Netbook, this is ok, but for about 50 to 100 dollars more you would get a much better laptop for your money.
