I really want to love my 13" Macbook Pro.  I really do.  However, the glare that I am experiencing is intolerable, especially when the Web page has a black background.  I tried a matte anti-glare screen protector but to no avail.  The protector removed the glare but caused white backgrounds to be extremely pixelated, so much so that my eye strain was even worse than without the screen protector.  I am not against all glossy screens...I love my Macbook Air's screen.  However, the extra layer of glass on the Macbook Pro causes these horrible reflections that can not be mitigated by adjusting the screen angle.  Furthermore, even at the brightest setting, I see both the keyboard and my hands reflected in the black, glass covered bezel.  Perfect solution would be to use museum glass or no glass at all with a black, non-reflective bezel.  When Apple offers that, I will buy it.  Until then I'll keep using my Cube and 20" matte LCD display for my desktop (and hope it doesn't die) and the Macbook Air for my laptop.
