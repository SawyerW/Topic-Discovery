I was a staunch PC devotee for a long time. I've had two HP laptops. The older one, I actually have no complaints with, it just got old. The newer one was a little slow and glitchy. I got an iPhone and loved it. Then I paid several visits to the Apple Store over a period of months and decided on the MacBook Air 13 inch. (I'm a writer and student, so I mainly use word processing, but I also watch a lot of TV, so I wanted a laptop with a fast processor where video would look good). I have no complaints so far. It's beautiful, the screen is amazingly clear and who wouldn't like 12 hours of battery life? Anyway, I would recommend it. I'm sad to leave HP, but honestly, I like this computer so much better than any PC that would have Windows 8.
