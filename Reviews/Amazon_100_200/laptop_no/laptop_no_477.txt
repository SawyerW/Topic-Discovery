Unbelivable that macs do not support AVCHD or bluray nativelly .Anyone who has bought an HD camcorder in the last 3 years will be frustrated trying to use a mac to edit there videos. APPLE's solution is either to use there own codec which either creates very poor qualty videos almost like standard definition video or creating huge files 5 times the size of your original. how ironic georgeous 1080p display but you cannot watch  high definition videos unless you buy it from the apple store or spend hundreds of dollars extra on  more software and bluray drives, how shamefull. Even worst is that they deliberately cripple there dvd drives using some feature called Riplock that slows the drive to a crawl if you wish to backup your dvd collection. I gues it's back to windows untill Apple solves these problems
