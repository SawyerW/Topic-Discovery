I LOVE LOVE LOVE this laptop. I was a little hesitant as their were both good and bad reviews. i wanted something that was great for gaming, music, portable and perfect for a college students. When the laptop arrived the packaging was perfect. Right out of the box, the laptop was of course brand new. When i first used the laptop, the battery lasted for 5 hours which was great since my last hp only lasted about 2. the true vision webcam could be a little more clear but the quality of the laptop overall is great. It is fast loading with documents, web browsing and gaming. The keyboard is very easy to work with and easy to clean. Overall, this is the best laptop that i have bought so far.
