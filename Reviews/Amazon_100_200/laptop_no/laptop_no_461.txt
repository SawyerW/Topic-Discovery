Was debating higher priced 2.66 and this one.  Ended up saving $300 and buying this one.  This works fine. I am running VMWare and Windows 7 so I can run MS Office 2010 beta and MSN messenger (can't do video chat with the Mac OS version yet).  Used the $300 savings from the higher priced one to buy Windows products. The 4GB of RAM and this computer is good enough to get really good performance.This machine can also stream video content to the 24inch apple monitor which is only evident when first starting the program that the task is reaching the upper limits of what it is capable of (a little fuzzy when first starting the task but clears up some as it starts).  It is not a problem for my wife's 15 inch macbook (last years middle model) but I can tell in some of those tasks this one is a little less powerful BUT it can still stream the content to the 24 inch monitor and vmware with windows is excellent.  I will mainly use it for analyzing sound for studies and word processing in windows.
