I Did not purchase this on Amazon, but I Still thought it would be a good idea to do a review! This laptop, at the time was one of the smallest and lightest, with the most power. After 2+ years, it still runs amazing! It's Stylish and the keyboard and glossy mouse pad was a nice touch. The Battery life is about 4 hours, that is if you run it on, "Power saver" mode. The only real problems i have had is when people ask me if the front part of my computer is cracked, till i show them it's just a design! The best part about this laptop is that I can run so much at the same time! I love the, "High performance" mode! I can be on Adobe Photoshop, run a movie, and be on facebook, while also on the web cam, all at the same time! This little machine is powerful! I Love my Pavilion DV4!! I also get asked alot, if this is a mac, (since the color is white) Nope!! It's not! It's my hp!! ;-)
