The funny things with Mac is like any electronic they have a bad side.  On mine I enjoy what you can do with images and using the commands does have some nice things to it.  On the downside my machine only works with Firefox I've tried to download Chrome,Opera and Safari none of the latter work though.  It won't download Firefox updates so I'm not sure if thats a software glitch or what.  Netflix wont work on the mini either.  It seems to be read as if its downloading to an ipod which it says when I attempt to download. Something Apple must've overlooked. Adobe or Flash(?) don't even ask!Ive had a G4 that I took the guts out of it so I know now first hand all the Mac has going for it is that its glorified IBM nothing more.  I now know the real Mac and I scoff when I see people act like nothing EVER goes wrong with Mac hardware.  Please give it a rest already! The Mac mini is built by Intel so I guess Mac is now officially a PC.
