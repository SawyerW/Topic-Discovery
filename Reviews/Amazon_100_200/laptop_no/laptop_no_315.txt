I bought the K53E at a local retailer two years ago for about $500 and it has been a great laptop until this week.  We don't do much gaming and all of the word processing and the like was done using Google apps.  This was used mostly to access the internet, occasionally stream Netflix and store Photos.  It was a good thing we had the last backed up to a cloud device because after just two years (almost to the day) the hard drive quit.  I expect more from a A computer than just two years of life.  The repair guy said that the Hard rive was stuck in a boot cycle and the it was a total loss.  I am going to try and replace the drive, and will see if that works, If it does then this is a four star computer (last week I probably would have given five) But if not the n maybe I should have left just two stars.  Over all  three and a half.
