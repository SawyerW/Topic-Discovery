Wecam, 15.6" screen,intel P6200 duo core, 4G Ram and 320 HD... great laptop! I use it for basic stuff: email, internetj/research, download music and that is pretty much it. I don't game at all. This is my first laptop and you need to understand that my old computer (6 years old) was a Pentium 4, 80G HD, 512 Ram. I've had this ACER for a month now and I am more than pleased with its performance. Speed is great. Screen is great. Keyboard is great (I never have to worry about my wrists accidently hitting the house pad), mouse pad is great. I haven't tried the webcam yet. Speakers are weak but I don't use my computer to listen to music. I bought this laptop for $379.00 with free shipping in early February. Too cheap. I wonder how much the workers in Asia are being paid to make them??? :(-D
