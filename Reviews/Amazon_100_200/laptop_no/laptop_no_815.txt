I bought this computer for working on-the-go. And it fits this purpose very well - very light and fast, with a great battery life. The only minus is that it's my first Mac, and it feels a kind of odd after Windows. I have to learn many basic things all over again.I definitely like how it loads in about 10 seconds. In addition, it looks and feels great - admiringly light and sleek.Overall impression is very good. It's is light, fast, beautiful and... slightly uncomfortable - like new classy shoes. And, alas, I'll have to install a copy of Windows to run software I need for work.
