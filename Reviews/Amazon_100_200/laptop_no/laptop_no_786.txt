started on Mac notebook, then the Mac pro and finally this one. Though It has no CD rom, the ethernet port and has smaller hard disk space and smaller ram memory, the convenience of carrying this when you travel is priceless. This and a mini iPad and you have a perfect way to travel. As in any mac, you have to purchase all the softwares and cannot transfer old purchases (word for mac, adobe etc.) which I found was quite an expensive endeavor consider you now have 3 laptops with individual software. Thus, before buying a mac you prefer, consider its weight specially if you travel as this laptops are your carry ons. the rest of the missing component can be bought thru their store or online (portable cd rom thats mac compatible, an ethernet adapter thru mac port ..there is a name for it which i forgot, and a portable HD or usb with high capacity.
