Ok so I bought the macbook pro at the apple store and I have always wanted one, iv had it for 3 months now and i have not had a single problem. For starters i love the keyboard and its screen is just the best. Now lets talk specs ok the 4GB of memory is good and fast the hard drive space is really good compared to my previous laptop wich was a dell inspiron the i think they dont make anymore. I dont know about the games too much though i play the sims 3 and it works good. ohhh one more thing i like about it is that it dosnt take forever to start up. :)
