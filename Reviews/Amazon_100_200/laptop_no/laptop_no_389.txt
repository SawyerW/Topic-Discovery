I bought this as a Thaksgiving Day special and love it.  It was easy to start up.  Windows 7 is a nice operating system, I ahev not had any problems.  I would like to see a longer lasting battery, the description did state @ 3 hours, but it would have been nice to have at least 5-6 hours.  If I used this outside the house it would be a problem,  My college age children  have different model HPs with no problems except the batteries, which I have had to replace (ordered from Amazon at a great price).  Despite the battery issue I would buy another HP.
