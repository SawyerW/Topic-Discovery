When in the market for a very basic laptop (one that can hang out on my coffee table for anyone to surf, check email, or whatever) I did a great deal of comparison around this price point. In terms of features, processing power, and memory (processing and storage) this laptop beat all comperably priced models by a landslide. A comperable laptop in terms of performance was at least another $150.Now that I have used if for a few weeks, I am stil impressed. Satisfies the intneded need perfectly, and I have also loaded up some software development and simulation software which the machine handles just fine.I highly recommend this is an excellent choice for a general purpose laptop.
