I went through numerous RMA's and send back to Acer for repair.  I had nothing but trouble with each person I dealt with with Acer and the place I purchased this (newegg)  I had always had good luck with newegg before and since.  But this unit kept getting hot.  It did absolutely no gaming without overheating.  They kept saying it must be a bad unit, but they never fixed it, and they never offered to replace it.  I have gotten maybe 20hrs use out of it so far and the warranty is almost out now.  I will never buy another Acer computer again.  Sorry for the rant, good luck if you purchase this unit.
