Purchased late November.  Received item promptly.  I've had no problems with the item.  Nice quality display and sound.  I do not game or do other intensive tasks with the laptop.  So far it has performed well.  It does come with pre-installed applications from toshiba that should be removed.  Wish they did not install the items.  Keys not backlit. Wireless networking easy to set up.  No problems.  It is not heavy.  the touchpad is rather sensitive and adjusting the settings does not appear to help. Has full number keypad which is a big plus.  For the money 399.00 with no shipping or taxes it is a great laptop.
