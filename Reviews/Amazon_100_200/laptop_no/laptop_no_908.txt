This is my first Mac and I love it. I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend. I also upgraded to 8gb of memory. Coming from a pc, its a bit of a learning curve but totally worth it. The build quality is second to none, i was worried about the lower screen resolution of 1280X800 but am happy to report that it is still very sharp and high quality. The trackpad is easily the best I have ever used.I was considering the macbook air due to the smaller size,  while larger this macbook pro is still easily portable and I kind of like the added weight as it feels I wont break it by just looking at it like the Air. Also, the fact i can upgrade the hard drive and memory is what made me choose this macbook pro. On the macbook air at you cannot upgrade the RAM or hard drive as its soldered onto the board.
