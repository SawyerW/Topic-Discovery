There have been plenty of reviews panning the Mac Air due to limitations.  I'm not a techie so for me it is a perfect fit.  I own a desktop mac and can do on it what I can't on the Air.  The Air is great for travel or just to carry around the house when I don't want to be pinned down to my desk.  It is super light weight.  Yes, it meant shelling out some serious change for what is basically a Netbook on steroids but unlike a Netbook, it is substantial.  Full keyboard, GREAT screen, etc., etc., etc.  Then again, the new IPad may fill those needs for others.  Your choice. K
