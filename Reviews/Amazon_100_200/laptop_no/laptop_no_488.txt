I had bought this laptop in March 2010, and this month it has been exactly 2 years since I had it. I never encountered hard drive failure, dead pixels, memory problems, etc. The only complaint I had in this whole time is that the battery life has dropped but that is expected because any battery depreciates over time and use. I never had the need to upgrade it. I have read other reviews on this laptop and some of them could be prevented by doing the necessary windows updates and Sony vaio care updates. Just like any other machine, it requires maintenance to keep it running at peak levels, just as your car requires an oil change or air filters, this requires maintenance also. My previous Sony Vaio lasted me 6 years and was still functioning when I sold it because I needed to upgrade.I like the chiclet styled keyboard, the screen is very bright. I rate this laptop 9.5/10.
