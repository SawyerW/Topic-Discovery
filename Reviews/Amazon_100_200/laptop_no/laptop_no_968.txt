This is my first Apple computer. The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing. I decided to go with this model instead of the retina display was because of the upgradable memories and hard drive for cheap.The MacBook right out of the box was ok. I wasn't really feeling the speed especially coming from a long time SSD user on my window. Then again my feeling was changed after a week when my new Samsung 830 SSD and 8GB of rams came in the mail. I quickly took the back cover off and installed the hard drive and ram. Reformatted it and my face just smile at start up.Now this is the MacBook I wanted it. A little expensive after the upgrades but it was worth it if you can get it for a good deals. I pretty much use this for web browsing, a little photoshop, a little video editing, and little gaming so the graphic card is good enough. Got my desktop for all the other hardcore stuff :)
