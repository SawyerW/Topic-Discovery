I hooked up this new laptop and it functions very well. If you read all of the information on the page for this laptop, Amazon recommends a Netgear push2tv ptv2000. Please check with the people at Netgear before spending $91.00 for something that isn't compatible with this model's Widi. After purchasing the ptv2000, all it would see is my laptop's wallpaper and nothing else. I called Netgear 3 times before I found someone who could speak clear English and after some researching, they was told that the only adapter that was functional with this laptop is the Netgear neotv (ptv200). Tonight I will try to see if it works or not. I read that the neotv pro might be better. I was assured today by Netgear that my neotv ptv200 would turn my flatscreen into a smart tv. We'll see. I have my doubts. Finally, Why doesn't Amazon or Dell include the Window's 7 disk?UPDATE: 7/13/2012  The Netgear ptv200 did not work. I sent it back and got the Netgear neotv pro. Now everything works as it should. I am a happy camper.Customer service and tech support at Dell is the best I have ever seen.
