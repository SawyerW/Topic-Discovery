This computer was design for the business traveller person in mind. It's a very powerfull machine that can handle complex pogrames. The machine allows you to toggle between 2 graphic cards. Although it consumes more power, i use the NVIDIA dedicated graphic card when i want to hook up my 24 inches external monitor at my office. The 6 cell battery on POWER SAVER mode can last my 5-hour weekly flights and the computer is so small and compact that fits very comfortably on the plane seats front pockets. Surprisingly, the screen looks amazingly bright and sharp to view any graphics,in spite the slim screen. The computer doesn't come with any usefull free programs, so expect to install your own software, unless you proceed to purchase the pre-installed 30 day trial software already on the computer. The computer works great, my only criticism is that is an expensive product, so i reccommend everyone to purchase the 3 year warranty service plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies, Inc. offered at amazon.com that extends your computer to literally 4 years. I also reccommend buying the sony vaio neoprene sleeve for 13" laptops to proctect the machine from scratches while travelling.
