I have had this laptop since September now (3 months).  Have had no problems at all.  I was leary about ordering online as I am not a techie type person and no real knowledge of how to set up computers.  Was a snap to connect to wireless and really user ready right out of the box.  It did take a while for the automatic windows updates but was no problem.  The only thing it did not come with was anti-virus which I purchased online my first day.  I use the laptop every day.  What really surprised me is that there was not a scratch or blemish on it - like new as advertised.  The battery life is great on mine and no issues with it.  I have had it run on battery for well over an hours with no problems.  The laptop is not too heavy, not too small and not too large - just right.  Would purchase again.
