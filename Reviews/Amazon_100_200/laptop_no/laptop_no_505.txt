I love this laptop. It's fast, durable and still feels like a new laptop after almost a year of ownership. I say this because after owning an Acer Aspire laptop for a year, it felt so outdated and slow that I had to upgrade.The keyboard is great and so is the touchpad; except, that the tiny bumps on the touchpad have a flat stop in the middle now.The screen is nice a clear as well as very bright. Wifi on this is better than most laptops as I can get WIFI from 5th floor in a old concrete building in Chicago! (My n320 netbook can barely see the signal and I get 4 bars with this SONY)
