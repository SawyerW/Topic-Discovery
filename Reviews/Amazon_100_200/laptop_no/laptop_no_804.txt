Ok I've had the MacBook Pro Retina and the latest version of the Air.  This thing may not have the screen resolution of the Retina, but the battery lasts forever.  I got this fully charged and turned on at 2pm and spent the day installing Microsoft Office and various other programs and media from my other machines.  At 1030pm I was down to 54% battery.  Today I've been on it the last few hours and its still down to the 40s.The other features of the Macbook are good as expected but nothing ground breaking.  I wouldn't switch up if you have a model thats pretty current.  I can't tell a big difference in performance between this and my one from mid 2012 I got.  I just switched because I travel a lot and want the extra battery for flights.  The 13" model is definitely noticeably heavier than the 11" was, but nothing too crazy.  Overall great machine and I can't begin to express how amazing the battery is on this thing.
