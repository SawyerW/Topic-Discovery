I purchased this laptop after trying the acer timelinex series and a couple of others.  It's a lightweight laptop.  Maybe not built to be roughly handled, but the thinness and the overall weight are worth not having a tank of a laptop.  It's fast and works really well.  Screen is great for movies and everyday use.My only complaint is that the space bar needs to be hit towards the middle, not the edges.  Otherwise, after a few minutes of getting used to the keyboard, it's really nice.  I love have the keys spaced apart so you're not accidentally hitting the wrong keys.
