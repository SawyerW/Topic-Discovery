I bought this little laptop about 3 years ago, and its been the most reliable, functional and convenient laptop I have come across. I have traveled with it cross country 5 times now, 2 by air and 3 by car, and its held up. I am currently in art school, and run the Full CS6 Suite on it. With Windows 7 it runs really well for as little ram as it has. In fact I ran side by side tests with a 2 month old Mac Airbook and they had the same start up times for photoshop, illustrator and indesign. Works perfect with my Wacom Bamboo Tablet.Great for people on the fo and on a budget
