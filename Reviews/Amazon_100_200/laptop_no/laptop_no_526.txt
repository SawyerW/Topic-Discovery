I bought this to upgrade from my Dell Mini 9, which I liked for its portability but disliked for its lack of a CD drive.  The Toshiba Portege 705 is wonderful because it is small and easily portable, but also has a CD/DVD drive, making it not only ultraportable but also ultrafunctional for my needs.  At 13.3", it is small, but definitely easier on the eyes than the 9.1" Dell Mini.  The full size keyboard is easy to type on, and the i3 processor has been fine as far as speed and functionality.  A 500 gig HD is great for storage of everything I need.  I mostly use this for word processing, email and internet, Powerpoint presentations, and playing Sims.  The only complaint I have is that the touchpad does go haywire sometimes, but this hasn't happened often enough to be a real problem, just a minor inconvenience.  The bottom gets hot when I play Sims, but other than that the airflow is fine.  I would give it 5 stars if the touchpad didn't have occasional issues, but I rate it at 4.5 overall.  This has been a great laptop for me!
