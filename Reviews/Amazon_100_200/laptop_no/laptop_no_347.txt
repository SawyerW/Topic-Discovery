Apple MacBook MC207LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptopas I have used my macbook eversince its arrival I found it very safactory the Item delivered in good packaging which protect the item's quality. Plus the customer service of amazon is also good when they replaced the missing order with the new one. except that they don't support for phone call on customers here in saudi arabia.The macbook is really beautiful in design and performance all of the hardware really works with its OS and also it works with windows as well with full support on its hardware. The only thing that disgust me is "the power of its USB terminal" which has only 500ma. If you have a device require 500ma power to run on USB then you may not extend the USB cable to longer than 3-4 meters.
