I purchased this system in Hong Kong, planning to bring it the US for College. I also bought a 3-year international warranty for about US$50. The computer worked fine for one year, and then hell broke loose. First the battery refuses to hold a charge. If I plug in the computer overnight, the charge would still hold for only 50 minutes. Then the LED screen refuses to lit up when opened. I have to open and shut it for ten times before it finally registers that the screen is propped up. Lately the computer is also making loud, scratchy noises. I have tried to contact Dell to redeem my supposedly international warranty, but the database of Hong Kong and the US are not connected. You have to manually request to transfer your service tag to another country. I have tried three times doing that, and every time Dell emailed me back and say that my information cannot be verified. It doesn't help that each 'transfer' takes up to 22 days. I have concluded that Dell is not interested in honoring its warranty. Will never buy Dell again.
