I bought this as a gift for my niece (14 years old) as a quick replacement and it was well worth the price paid.  It is great for general internet browsing, emails, movies, and music.  Everything worked as advertised and I could not tell this was a used laptop.  My kids all had cheaper laptops throughout High School and I purchased more up to date versions when they went off to college.  They were pretty rough on them when they were younger, so I didn't mind as much when something needed replaced.  I would recommend especially for early teens just getting used to taking care of expensive electronics.
