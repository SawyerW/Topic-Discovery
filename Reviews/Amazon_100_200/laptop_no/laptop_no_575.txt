I have used many HP EliteBook's over the years and this is by far the best in the line. The 6930's were a joke and the 8440's made huge improvements but the 8460 definitely is the winner. Excellent battery life, solid processing performance and versatility make this a great machine to have. The island keyboard is by all means they way to go. Old EliteBook's could easily have keys ripped off by simply wiping the dust off. In the office I use mine in a docking station with dual 22in monitors and a wireless keyboard and mouse. At home its attached to a since 22in monitor, no docking station and just a wireless mouse. As a network engineer it gets the job done every time. With no bloatware or add ons they are pretty much ready to go out of the box.Pro's: Reliable, stable, good warrant, docking station capable simplicity of use.Cons: Its heavy.
