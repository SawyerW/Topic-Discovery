If you are thinking about getting a T61p, I suggest youfind one you can see and feel first.Mine is working properly -- I got it with XP Pro.But, I was disapointed in the quality.1) The T series Laptops used to be solidlike a tank -- now they are flimsy like a potatochip.2) There is a flex cable from the keyboard base unit to themonitor lid -- first I have seen in a loptop --Concerned about reliability of the flex.3) Mine has a lump (or bulge) behind the LCD.I feel it as I swipe my hand across it.It is not too visible due to the mat finish,but it is there. I did an internet search andothers are seeing the same thing.4) besides the bulge, there is a noticable dipon the lid near the flex cable area.
