I purchased this item from another place other than Amazon. It is a replacement for the previous laptop I owned. This is a good student computer, it runs fast, has a good clear picture, holds a charge well for a large screen. It would not be a good gaming computer. The drawback I have with it is that it only has 2 USB ports and I had to purchase an extra USB that will allow me to charge my iPhone, plug in my mouse receiver, and plug in my jump drive all at the same time.This computer is amazingly lightweight for its size and has a thin profile. Overall it is a good computer that is fairly portable for the student on the go.
