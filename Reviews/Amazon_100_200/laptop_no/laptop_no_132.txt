I am very much impressed with this machine. This is a upgrade for me. Previously I owned  the First Generation Intel Macbook, the 1.83 ghz version.  That machine always ran hot underneath (on the bottom). When I used it to encode video the fan would run like crazy because the processor was in overdrive! This new macbook runs super cool and encodes video with ease (I hardly hear the fan). The display is beautiful! The aluminum case is real sturdy and I like the way it feels in my hand. Feels like I'm holding a quality  piece of hardware! This machine is thinner then my previous macbook. It's so much thinner that I'm not envious of the Macbook Air anymore.  The only thing I don't really care for is the one button click mouse pad. Other than that I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
