Hubby and I bought this type of Acer laptop in the nearby Walmart store in our local area. I saw it in the walmart ad and it was for 329$. Asked my hubby on how he think about it, and he said it sure is promising. It has windows 7 OS, multi-use CD/DVD, multi-in-1 card reader like SD card reader/slot etc, battery/slot, webcam, 3 gigabytes RAM DDR3 and 250 Gigabyte Hard drive and has wifi in it. Very nice 15.6 inch screen. Fast in uploading images and searches in the internet. Can open lots of windows which is cool for me since I only have a Dell Latitude before. Bright screen. The only downside is that it only has 2 usb slots. Hubby says it's a powerful little machine. I love it!
