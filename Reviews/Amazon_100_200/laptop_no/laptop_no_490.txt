The price was very good and thats why i buy it. But i received it with one key damage (hinge kit). I have the option to ask for a refund but i found the hinge kit in ebay and i prefer to the the replacement by myselft.The laptop works just fine in my opinion, sometime when the laptop was hybernating doesn't start up again until i restart it, i think is winsdows 7 issue, not a laptop problem.Also, sometimes i need to restart windows audio service, again, i think is win 7 problem.Overall, i think this laptop is the best option in terms of price, but next time i will going to buy a better brand even if i pay a little more money.Note: This laptop is refurbished.
