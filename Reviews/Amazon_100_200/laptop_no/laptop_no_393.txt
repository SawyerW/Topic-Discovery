My husband needed a laptop that he could take back and forth to work. He is a machinist and he really didn't want a new one because he was worried it would get ruined in the dirty machine shop. He looked around before he settled on this one. The computer was shipped lightening fast and was packed very well. When he took it out of the box he realized it was an even better one than the one he ordered and it was in such good condition he almost didn't want to take it to work. He has had it now for almost three months and he loves it. He has had no problems with it at all.
