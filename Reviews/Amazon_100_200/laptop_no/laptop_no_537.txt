I can't add a lot to whats already been said about this awesome laptop other than when I first saw this laptop I wanted it and haven't been disappointed in its performance I have had the 13inch model with 2gb of ram and 128gb of hard drive space I thought that I would never use another laptop brand other than sony but I can say that I will never own another laptop unless its an apple I really don't see how apple can make the macbook air any better but I can't wait to see what they come up with next !!!!!
