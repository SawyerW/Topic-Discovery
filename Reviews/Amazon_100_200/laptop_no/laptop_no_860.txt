I am upgrading from a 2008 OG Macbook Aluminum Unibody and as soon as I booted this baby up I knew things would be different. This thing is FAST, the boot times are probably a quarter of what they were with my old computer and never gets the rainbow wheel of death. I love the battery life while my old one could only last max 2 hours, this beast lasted over 7 hours of HEAVY USE, as I downloaded software that would make it my new baby. The keyboard is nice and springy. There is no lag, as soon as you click it's done and the better entrenched you are in the apple universe the more you get out of a mac. I love OSX and mavericks is just beautiful and quick the animations don't slow you down and everything that has made OSX great all these years is still there just upgraded. Overall, I love my new Air and this upgraded version is as good as it gets, better performance for a lower cost = Win!
