Ever since I purchased this laptop in August 2009 there has been a problem with the heat sink and fan. It would randomly shut down (and I mean suddenly the machines dies) and therefore losing lal my work. I sent it to warrenty and they said the heat sink was the problem so did the appropriate replacement. Soon after, it would still become very hot and this time loud as hell. 2 years later, the wi-fi went out and I cannot even watch ore than 10 minutes of Netflix on this thing without it shutting down on me. I have purchased a wi-fi adaptor to compensate and waiting for the harddrive to die so I can justify purchasing something else. I had a Toshiba for 5 years throughout college and it never gave me any issues. Oh, and on top of that, if you order a Lenovo via their website, you will likely have to wait for weeks or months before they can ship one out to you.Other than that, I like the white keyboard, patterened outer case, and the touch volume control.
