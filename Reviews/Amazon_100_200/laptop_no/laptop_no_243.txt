I find you are really gambling with your money when you buy a used laptop.  For the money, the little flaws of a refurbished computer are worth the tradeoff if you find a good seller.  Right now, I couldn't afford to buy a new one but Dell's are notorious workhorses and can get years of  use out of them.  I have to buy a new battery and the keys stick a little, ( quite common if over 3 years old).  I use a supplemental keyboard and plug it in because I don't like the flatness of laptops anyway.The seller was helpful too and recommended some products to go with and even provided a bag!  Very happy.
