I absolutely loved this laptop. My style and seemed very nice. Im not the kind of person to return everything I get, and Im not picky. But unfortunetly, I am returning this laptop. It was very weird. I was using it one day just fine never gave me any problems, but I packed it up and when I got home it would not turn on or anything. A half hour later it finally turns on and is just fine again. The battery life on it is excellent so that wasn't an issue but I did even try plugging it in. I've only had it for 25 days and I haven't paid anything on it because I charged it. This little episode just scared me and everyone I talked to said I should return it because it should not do that. I'm sorry for the bad review!
