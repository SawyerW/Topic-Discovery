We have a Latitude computer,, it is the E5400. It was givenn to my son to use with his school work. We have had it all school year. Because of it's durabliity and size we have just started using it as our home computer. It is 11:54 pm and I am online looking to see how much it would cost to replace this computer. I have to give it back tomorrow and I dont want to. We have nine children all have touched/used this computer over the last nine months nad it is in amazing condition. It has wonderful keys. I just really like it. And if I can afford one I will be getting one.. or perhaps two. Really no joke. it has not crashed nor has it been repaired. We have had not one problem with it. I would  highly recomend this computer. Really I will miss it a lot.
