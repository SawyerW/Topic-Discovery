I have tried my laptop and I don't have a bad thing to say, except the design makes it a bit big. This is a plus/negative because the battery is kinda big so the laptop has ventilation when putted in a surface.Battery duration is good, and for me as an architect works pretty well. I use programs like autocad, 3dmax photoshop and they work normally and fast. The little control is for me the best thing because you can control almost everything and you can watch a movie and you dont have to move from your bed to pause it.This is a good option to buy, I'm a satified customer!
