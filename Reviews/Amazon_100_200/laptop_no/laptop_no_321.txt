do not buy it!!!! it looks great, and probably would have worked great, had Dell not released this product before they fixed all the glitches. it is a disaster, and don't bother trying to "fix" or get a replacement. it is a dead end street with Dell.  the computer over heats and shuts off constantly. i have done a Google search (after i bought it! big mistake) and learned that this model being a lemon was a known fact in the tech world. there are literally hundreds of complaints on Dell's own customer boards. read them before you make a decision!! no more Dell for me- ever!
