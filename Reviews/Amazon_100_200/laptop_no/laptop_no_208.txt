After a lot of thought I finally made the leap from a PC to MAC and I am mostly happy. Does it always "just work" NO but mostly it does. The wireless drops out often which never happens with my PC. It sometimes refuses to shut down and my printer which is only 1 year old will not work with it. I run windows with a virtual machine on it because some software is not mac compatible and at times the OS is just plain slow. All that being said I still have to admit that I like it very much. All these things are really minor and overall it is much more reliable and stable. The OS itself has never crashed after 2 months and is much easier to use. It's a lot lighter and quieter and just somehow more "fun". If you are thinking of making the switch I'd say go for it. (I still find myself trying to right-click though)
