This animal is older than the hills. It actually came with Windows Vista. I only bout the critter for something to use while having another system updated. The selling point was being able to see the 15 inch screen which was a good size for the time. This wireless "g" is still in the main stream today and wireless N devices also accept it.I have recently updated the ram form two .5GB to two 2GB sticks. The system recognized the update immediately.  The system came with a restore partition but I never trust them and have external disks in case of a virus or anything physical. I also updated to Windows 7 and anticipate trying Windows 8.Just a note that unless you are ept and can adjust to the exterenal wrld without help from the manufaturer this may not be the best way to go.  Personally I find the challenge fun.
