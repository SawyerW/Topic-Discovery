I purchased this laptop for travel. It has great features and is very light.  I was happy for the first 28 days and then the screen cracked.  I called Toshiba customer support, and the person was polite, but tried to suggest that I was responsible for it cracking.  They tried to pawn it off on my non-existent cat or dog, non-existent kids, and my wife (who exists, but did not touch it).  They then offered to fix it for $450 minimum (I payed $700 for it), but they noted it could take three months. I ordered a replacement screen and repaired it myself (1 mm too thick, which meant I had to crack the casing to have it work) for $240.Although it looks broken (at least nobody wants to steal it) and is kept together by electrical tape and rubber cement, the laptop is reliable and still performs very well more than two years after the trauma.Bottom line is that in my observation of the casing, Toshiba's design for this computer has no protection for the rather delicate screen.  Those who buy this need to have a very protective case for it, and treat it with kid gloves.
