I like the computer, especially for 830$. It's fast, nice a small, travel friendly, perfect size screen.A couple things to note,The overview says there is a USB port on the right side, there is not; I have 2 on the left. One's a normal USB, while the other is a USB SS, so technically you only have one normal USB port.For the CD opening, while I do not have a problem with it besides having to go to computer -> CD *right click -> eject, I am a little worried of the open cover, that it may lead to damage.But overall as of now, a month in, I love the computer.
