The laptop was dilivered promptly, but somehow damaged in the dilivery process.  I called DRK and he immediately returned my call.  He was more than helpful and tried to fix the problem with me on the phone.  I explained how I purchased the laptop for a student in need and he graciously told me to return the laptop and he would completely refund my money and shipping costs.  Within a couple days the I was refunded the money and DRK offered to contribute to the cause and assist with getting me another computer for this student.  His customers service was amazing.
