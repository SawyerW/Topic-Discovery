Bought laptop about 3 years ago.  It's 64-bit running Win7.  Very fast, good quality.  Use for Office products, watching movies, web and streaming, all work great.  Speaker quality is very good, not tinny.  HDMI feature was new then, maybe standard now, but super easy.  All ports still working.  Original battery lasted about 2 years, then purchased replacement which is going fine after another year.  This is a typical maintenance cost so I don't mind.  This was a high end laptop when purchased and at good price point, still running fine now, looks good, and stays clean.  Video display is really good.  Fingers cross, will continue to work as-is for years to come.
