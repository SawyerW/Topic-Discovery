Needed a new laptop and went for the windows 8 but I hated the new system, maybe its just me but could not understand the drastic change and feeling like I had to do more compared to windows 7. I returned my windows 8 and went for the apple and i am glad I did. They really know what they are doing. The laptop is so easy to work with. Like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do, very user-friendly. Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks. If you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac. The investment is worth it.
