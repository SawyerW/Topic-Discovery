This review is not techy nor full of hardware information; for that there are other great reviews on Amazon. The Satellite was easy to set up right out of the box and it works perfectly. The screen is bright and clear; it was a little too bright but it was easy to adjust. The "chicklet" keys are different than our old Dell Inspiron but they feel comfortable and respond well to the typing. I expected the touchpad to be a problem when I type but I haven't had any issues. There is a easily accessible button that will turn the touchpad off if it does become a problem. The laptop is exactly what I wanted for our home and I look forward to enjoying it.
