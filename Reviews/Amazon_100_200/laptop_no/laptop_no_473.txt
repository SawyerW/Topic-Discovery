Mac Powerbooks are great but I did not mean to order this item using the new Amazon App for iPad. A word of warning using this App to order items from Amazon. I accidentally hit the "one click buy" button on the iPad and could not cancel the item. When I called the next morning to cancel the order over the phone the item had already been shipped and could not cancel the order! My credit card had been charged and the only way to get my money back was to refuse shipment when the package arrived. My credit card was finally credited $1200 dollars eight days later.Needless to say I have the deleted the Amazon App from my iPad!
