I wasn't particularly happy with Windows Vista, which this HP Pavillion DV9500t laptop came with, however, aside from that issue I've not had an iota of trouble with it.The 'C' drive is only a bit more than 100gb's, however, I've a 1TB external HD attached to it and I've used this laptop with Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom loaded on it, again experiencing no problems. I've watched TV with it, and although it slipped from my grasp and fell down 7 steps and landed on the concrete floor below, aside from some minor scraping, it suffered no ill effect; I couldn't believe it myself.Although I've also a desktop pc with multiple screens I still use the laptop almost on a daily basis. It has the original battery which charges without difficulty and I take it with me when in the field or giving talks.
