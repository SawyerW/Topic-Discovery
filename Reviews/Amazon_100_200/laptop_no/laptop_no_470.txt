I'm new to Apple computers and after my HP broke after three years of use I considered getting one of these.  I debated for about a week over whether or not I should get a Mac or PC and I decided on a Mac.  I am greatly pleased with my purchase.  There are expensive but worth it.  Super user friendly and very portable.  I love the long battery life too.  The only thing I dont like is the lack of Microsoft Office, but your buying a Mac so it goes without saying.  iWork is a pretty good alternative to Microsoft Word...you can open Word documents in Pages (an iWork program).  All in all it's a perfect computer for someone who carries their laptop around.
