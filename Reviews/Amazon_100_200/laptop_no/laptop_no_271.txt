Out of the box and running less than 15 mins, Windows 7 looks alot like vista with no issues so far.  First impression of the notebook was that it looked clean and business like, far from the truth when I popped in a few games, Dragon's age runs at near all high settings flawlessly with no stuttering or major fps drops and is stunning, runs warcraft @ 50fps in Dalaran, programs are fast, a very nice all around notebook, hard drive is a bit small for gaming, but who needs a bunch of games loaded all at once, does warm up but not too hot, for extended gaming sessions a cooler would be a good idea.  Onboard speakers are actually very good, resolution could be higher, but looks great, gloss finish on the screen does produce glare if not positioned right.  IMO price vs performance, this thing is a 9.5/10 for what it is and what it is capable of, if you know what you are buying, you will not be dissapointed, this is not a desktop replacement, simply because I prefer the performance of a desktop but the N61J performs outstanding considering its a notebook.
