I bought this laptop for my wife 3 weeks ago. In that time we have had a chance to try it out. I agree with most of the other reviews as far as most of the features of this unit. The only problem we have is in the speaker. It comes with only one speaker which you cannot hear. I called Acer service and was told by someone in India, that there is no cure for the problem. He said because there is only one speaker, there is low volume. It is a shame because the rest of the unit works so well. If you use headphones the sound is excellent,but if you use the external speaker be prepared to put your ear next to it to hear.
