I have always loved Mac, and I found that it was time to upgrade from my MacBook to one that was more robust (2.9GHz processing power). The performance is definitely superior to any computer I've ever put my hands on.So why 99% instead of 100? Well, I use my MacBook Pro a lot to record audio. The description said that the headphone jack also doubled as an audio input, and that it could be reversed in system preferences. But guess what? ... Not true! To my dismay, I have been unable to use the audio port as an input, despite Apple having advertised it as such. I searched online to figure out what I was doing wrong, and lo and behold, everyone is having the same problem. (FYI, this problem is apparently exclusive to OSX Mountain Lion)However, since the problem appears to be software related, I am hopeful that Apple will release a fix soon. Apart from my frustration over the false advertising in that area, I am otherwise satisfied.
