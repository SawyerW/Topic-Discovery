I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PC USER UNTIL A FRIEND OF MINE CONVINCED ME TO TRY A MAC. WELL I TRIED THIS ONE AND WAS ENJOYING IT FOR A WHILE AND ACTUALLY GETTING TO LIKE IT OVER A PC, BUT AFTER ABOUT A WEEK OR SO IT STARTED TO FREEZE UP REGULARLY.WELL THE FIRST THING I DID  WAS TO GOOGLE THIS PROBLEM, ONLY TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE MAC BOOK PRO'S. IF YOU CHECK OUT THE APPLE DISCUSSIONS SITE YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR MAC'S.I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A MAC AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL EVER TRUST BUYING ANOTHER ONE. I THINK I MIGHT PURCHASE A LENOVO OR A TOSHIBA TO REPLACE THIS ONE.A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT HARD DRIVE FAILURE IN THE FIRST 2 MONTHS OR SO AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE GETTING A SYSTEM WITH RELIABLE HARDWARE, CONSIDERING THE PRICE OF A MAC.
