I bought this laptop at an insanely nice price from staples when it was on clearance. I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive, replaced the terrible wireless card and the sub par fan. I luckily spent only $100 dollars on these extra parts on black Friday. The laptop I paid $210 for at Staples. It runs incredibly with all of the new updates but with the factory wireless card, you are going to have some troubles.The wireless card: Drops signals randomly and will not work until you reboot the computer.The hard drive: I put it in an extra external hard drive enclosure and it died on me within four months.This computer is not worth it unless you understand how to upgrade a laptop. The parts are cheap. But for the price I bought it for such a small and light laptop I cannot complain.
