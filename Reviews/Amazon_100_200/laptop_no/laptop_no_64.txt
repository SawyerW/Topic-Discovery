The Dell Latitude D600 is really a nice little laptop. It has numerous great features like built-in wifi capabilities, 512MB of memory, a highspeed processor that makes this laptop just speed along. I think its only flaws-- and minor ones too-- is the limiting 30 GB hard drive that can get filled up far too quickly and it's small screen. While 15.6 is a standard size, it can be hard to read sometimes nontheless.Yet this laptop is a great bargain for the price as is. Still, once I got it I decided to upgrade the hard drive and get a mouse to replace the sometimes troublesome pointing stick. If you need a good laptop but don't have a major budget, this is the one to get.Ron
