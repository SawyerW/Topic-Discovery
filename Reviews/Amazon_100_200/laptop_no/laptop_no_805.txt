I've only had this for a month and have already had several chats and Skype calls with Apple support because it's been freezing and shutting down frequently. Also, randomly I've been unable to use Skype or gchat because my camera and or microphone will be hard frozen and I have had to shut the computer down and start over, which only sometimes works.I've had my old mac book for almost 6 years and it's still working and even now it does not have as many problems as the new macbook air. The apple support team has been helpful but it seems that the quality of mac products is really going down :(Also, you have to keep up with constant updates but then things become incompatible with other people or other machines. I'm usually really excited when I have a new apple product but this one is making me nervous.
