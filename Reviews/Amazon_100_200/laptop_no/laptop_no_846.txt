I had a Macbook Pro and when I needed a new laptop, decided to switch to the Air. At first I loved it. It is a lot lighter and easier to store. But then reality struck. It is a wireless only laptop (meaning if wifi is down, you can't hook it up). It has no CD drive. I didn't think this would bother me because I don't use CD's BUT a lot of technology comes with CD's to install on your computer. It over heats A LOT quicker and A LOT hotter than the Pro. I am regretting not getting another Macbook Pro.
