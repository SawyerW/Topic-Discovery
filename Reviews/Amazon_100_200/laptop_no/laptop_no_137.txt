First off, Im not from the US, so dont blame me if there are any language mistakes ;)I have been owning this laptop for about two and a half years now and it has been quite reliable over the past years!The specs back then were pretty decent 3 gigabyte of ram and a blu ray disc drive, a 2ghz processor, plus the small price made me buy this laptop.Here are the pros and cons:Pros+ It's handy+ It has a good screen and the build quality is good+ The keyboard has good pressure point+ It has a blu ray drive+ Its just fast enough for my needs+ It almost never crashesCons- It gets quite hot- the graphic card is just good enough for writing emails and surfing on the internet. Games dont work fluently- The buttons in front of the display act weird from time to time when the laptop gets too hot - which is pretty annoying.I cant share the experience that it s a horribly bad laptop. Maybe I got lucky with mine, but It has for sure been a good buy for me.
