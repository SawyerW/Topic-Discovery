After limping along for a couple of years, I retired the old Mac Mini and MacBook to keep up with new software. Realizing that I use the desktop computer most of the time but need a portable only on occasion, I chose the basic MacBook Pro. It operates in closed clamshell mode, so it's out of the way, and---unlike the MacBook Air---it has all the necessary ports to function as a desktop computer. It connects to all of my existing hardware: 19-in. LCD monitor (Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter purchased separately); external storage device; printer/scanner; keyboard/mouse; speakers/headset. Since I use the laptop screen so infrequently, I passed on the additional expense of Retina Display.
