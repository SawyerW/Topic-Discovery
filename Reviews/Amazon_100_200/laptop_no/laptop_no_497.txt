This laptop is fast enough for everything i done so far and for basic gaming (Dont buy this expecting to play last generation games on full quality).Pros:** Aluminum** Fast** Lots of spaceCons:** It will take some time to get used to the keyboard** Screen it is not so good (Compared to Dell's), bad viewing angles** The mouse clicks are included on the trackpad and they are really hard to press** Because of the dual video card, if you are a linux user, you wont be able to use the ati 5650 (and the HDMI port) included, only the "Power Saving" video card (Ati 4200) and ati/hp dont plan to support this on linux** Battery life not good compared to a i3 or i5 processor
