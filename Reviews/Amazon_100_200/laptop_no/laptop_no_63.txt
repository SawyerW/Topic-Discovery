Go to your favorite search engine and plug in this model and a choice keyword or two (Trouble" or "Problem" ought to do for starters).  I didn't want to believe that a Toshiba Notebook could be so bad, but it seems that the joyous reverie of other reviewers (I wish them well) is not universally echoed by owners everywhere. People are having awful problems with it shutting off spontaneously and then perversely not being able to shut it once it is running.  The Hitachi SATA hard drive dies on some owners. USB isn't working right for others.  Toshiba is uncooperative, the drivers for XP are darned hard to find, Vista crashes, on and on and on.  I can't vouch for all of these problems, maybe they're operator error or sunspots or alien abductions.  All I know is that mine is going back in the packaging and off to a service depot for a long rest, hopefully for the cure of two show-stopping problems (aforementioned dead disk after 4 months, and chronic shut down problems going back to since new).Bon Voyage. l'il notebook. we hardly knew ye.Caveat emptor.
