I used this laptop for 3 months and it crashed. I called Gateway and they had me pay $30 for a recovery CD....that did not work...now they recognize this is a hardware problem covered by the 1 year guarantee but they want me to pay +50 dollars to ship the laptop to them. If covered by guarantee why don't they pay all expenses associated with the repais? why do I need to pay almost $100 to have them solve THEIR problems? Not worth it. Buy HP, Dell or any other well known brand, you can trust their customer service will take care of any issues, at no crazy extra cost for you.
