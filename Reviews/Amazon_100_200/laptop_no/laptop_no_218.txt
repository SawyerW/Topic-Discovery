I am a creative professional and have multiple computers including a MacPro 8 core with 16g Ram, 27''iMac, Macbook pro 15'' i7, iPad, iPhone, iPod, etc.  In my opinion this is the future of computing.  It is instantaneous for most everything I do.  I can start the computer AND open the entire adobe creative suite (design premium) and Microsoft office in under 30 seconds.  All programs open and ready to use.  Of course my Mac Pro will process 4GB PSD's faster but for personal computing (email, reviewing assets, conducting business) nothing is more responsive, light, portable or stylish than my MacBook Air.  I am in love.
