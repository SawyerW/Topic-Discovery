I've had a T-41 for about two years.  It's been back to IBM three times for new motherboards when the video went out.  It's been back once for a new wireless card.  A second wireless card is coming via delivery service as I type.  This time I get to put it in.I've had several Thinkpads and love their functionality.  IBM's service people are friendly and helpful.  The problem is that I'm getting to know the guys in Atlanta way too well.I asked IBM to replace this T-41 as a lemon. They responded by giving me an extra year of warranty.  That was nice, but every time this thing goes down, it costs me lost time, and for someone who is self employed that is a bad thing.
