I'm not sure where all these bad reviews are coming from, I've had nothing but great experiences with this laptop. It's now over 3 years old and still running perfectly. I'm a college student, so I'm running this thing for an average of 5 hours a day every day, and it's held up great.  The battery failed around the 20 month mark, but it was still under warranty so I had it replaced for free. Admittedly, it can get a bit hot, but as long as you're putting it on a flat surface you'll never had a problem. I know this review probably won't persuade anyone to but a used model of this product, but I had to stand up for my laptop. HP for life.
