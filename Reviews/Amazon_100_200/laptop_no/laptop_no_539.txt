This notebook is one of the most powerful laptops in the ultra portable, super compact laptop class. It's not your typical cheap notebook, it costs more then most, but it looks expensive right out of the box, and yes, it's worth every penny, because it offers a great bundle of the most popular options and very latest technologies, in one extremely small but a powerful package! Punch of a Monster in a size of a netbook! A definite show stopper! Will work for years to come with Fujitsu famous assembly quality and top of the line reliability! You will take pride in owning one. Enjoy!
