As someone who has owned an ASUS G73JH, the crown jewel of that notebook was the ATI HD5870 1GB GDDR5 GPU.  Nvidia 460M is hardly any better in many benchmarks shows it's inferior to ATI.  Check Anandtech.com for a review of the ASUS G73JW with the Nvidia 460M, it's slower in nearly every gaming benchmark to the ATI HD5870.These Nvidia 400m series do not have the Fermi core, they are repackaged and remarketed from 2 gens.  Think of 460m = 260M GTX performance.  Thumbs down.Nvidia GPUs are also prone to overheat, we all have heard of fried Macbooks and Dells with Nvidia GPUs.
