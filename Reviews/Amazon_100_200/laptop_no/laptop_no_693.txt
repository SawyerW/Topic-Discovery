PC very slow. Could not link via home network. Called Dell phone support who turned out to be quite hostile. Kept insisting we upgrade to a pay for support. We've had the laptop for less than 5 days. We have another Dell - same model - purchased from Costco with Costco Concierge service. Great support and lasts as long as you own your laptop. Would not buy through Amazon again given the poor support after purchase. Dell support transferring us from one place to another. Most unhelpful. Michael Dell would not be pleased with this customer experience. The machine must be a stripped down model.
