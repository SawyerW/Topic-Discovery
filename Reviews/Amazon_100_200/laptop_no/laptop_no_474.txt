I can't believe nobody has mentioned this here yet!The new Macbook pro has really sharp edges! You can't type on the keyboard for more than couple of hours.I didn't realize this until started typing (I am a programmer) for couple of hours and my forearms/wrist couldn't take it anymore. The sharp Edges cut through your fore-arms or wrist! I can't believe how apple sometimes has this stupidest designs! Didn't they type on the keyboard before shipping it out?I have to say everything else is great about the computer, but since I am a programmer I'm debating if I want to keep this, specially that they don't give all your money back.I guess you can't really realize this when you go to the apple store because they have low desks so your hands naturally stays high...This is really disappointing specially for how much you pay to get an apple computer, last thing I want to deal with is not being able to type on my computer!Apple sometimes really sucks!
