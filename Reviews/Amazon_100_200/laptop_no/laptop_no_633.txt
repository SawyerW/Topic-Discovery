This HP Hewlett Packard Laptop PC (Model DV6-6130US) FAILED miserably. It arrived with a keyboard that was hanging loose, it bounced up and down and caused all kinds of errors. It could not be used. We made four videos of it and posted to YouTube under the HP model number.Then we found a hundred other reviews of HP laptop keyboard malfunctions on various HP laptop PCs too. The Escape key was broken off. The entire computer was unusable and we had to return it to the Amazon Marketplace seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z guarantee program the first week we had it.Recommend: Do not purchase any HP laptop PC because the company is ignoring reports of defective keyboards. "Zero" stars.
