I bought this laptop on May 5th, 2010. After 1 month, the hard drive crash, brought it the Best Buy's Geek Squad and because it was still under warranty they changed my hard drive for free. After about a year, May 11th, 2011 the computer started acting up again, I will be using the laptop and all of a sudden a blue screen comes up "begin dumping physical memory...." so I called ASUS, they told me it is not longer under warranty and I have to pay for it. This product is not worth the money and a waste of time.
