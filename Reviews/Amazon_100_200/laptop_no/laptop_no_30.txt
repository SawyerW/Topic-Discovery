Steer clear from the FRV series from SONY.  Sony makes great products but this is not the one.  Go with the GRT series for any multimedia graphics needs.  I owned this laptop for 12 days and had numerous issues including the DVD-R was DOA.  Pinnacle studio 8 crashed every time.  Benchamrk scores compared this 2.8 p4 to 1.8 p4's .... not good.  On a positive note the LCD is beautifull, great keyboard and design, Nice Sony software package.  This is not a desktop replacement though.  And with the inability to do any multimedia with the limited IGP, it renders the DVD-R useless anyway.
