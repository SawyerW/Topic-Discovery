This is a piece of junk. I can;t imagine how HP can still make  laptop like this and manage to sell, in 2012. You can almost say there as been zero innovation in this laptop since 2002 or so. I didn't buy this, got as my work computer from office. I am now forced to write the review give how bad is this laptop. In less than 2 months the battery is almost falling off!!. I have an extended battery and the battery lock is so poorly done and quality is so flimsy. Also, the laptop is really fat, unlike what you can see in the pictures. The Compaq laptop I got in 2001 was thinner than this and this was supposed to be HP's business class travel friendly laptop. What a shame to HP's design. Do yourself a favor by not buying this junk.
