It's an OK laptop, though Samsung said it's aluminum case it is not - it's a plastic frame with thin metal layers on top, the edges where metal meets plastic are not very smooth, could be better designed for $1000 machine.It's a high res screen but with fairly poor vertical angles, many smaller fonts look washed out and barely readable. Vertical scrolling in touch-pad only works in some applications, and it's nowhere near smoothness of a Mac.Hard drive is huge but very slow, some Samsung apps take literally minutes to load while HDD indicator just never stops, for a PC with such high specs it's just embarrassing, my 5 year old Windows XP Fujitsu laptop feels faster.Another problem is Linux compatibility, touch pad misses every second touch under Linux (tried OpenSUSE and Ubunutu) even with sensitivity set to max. In addition it seems CPU runs at full throttle permanently under Linux which triggers fan to always run at high RPMs creating high noise and battery runs out in 2 hours.
