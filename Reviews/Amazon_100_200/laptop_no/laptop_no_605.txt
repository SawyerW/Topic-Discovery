My 1 1/2 old Toshiba laptop finally gave it up after a prolonged series of manufacturing defects and hardware failures. I had been looking for a (non-Toshiba) replacement and ran across the hp dm4-2070us at my local office supply store. The price was attractive at $499 so I bought it on impulse.I've been very impressed. The build quality is good. It has an impressive set of features and is quite fast. The battery lasts over 4 hours (which is astonishing to me). The only thing that I wish it had is a back-lit keyboard. However considering the price, I can live without that.The pros:1) It's light weight2) It surprizingly fast3) The battery lasts a very long time.4) I like the biometric password manager.I don't really have any serious cons for the computer. The only real quirk I've found is that biometric finger scanner seems to strongly prefer my middle finger for identification. I guess it's middle school of me, but that makes me chuckle.Other than that, this has been the most solid laptop I've purchased in a long time and I got it at a budget price. So Kudos to HP.
