I have been a Windows user for a long time and have been eyeing on a Mac for past few months.I was in luck this Thanksgiving when Amazon listed this product for an unbelievable price- rather- best price anywhere.I seized the opportunity and am glad I did so..I have been using my Macbook for the past few days and am very impressed with the look and feel plus the ease of use of the laptop.My wife and I had no difficulty switching to a Mac from a PC and we love this...The product is very well designed and the attention to detail is simple awesome. I haven't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review.Will probably find time in the near future to do so...All in all it was the best purchase of the year!!!
