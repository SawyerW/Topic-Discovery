I originally wanted to get a Mac, but I did not want to spend as much as I would have had to in order to buy one. I feel like this is a nice low-cost alternative. I have been using this laptop for about the past 6 months, and it has held up very well! I feel like the design is very sleek. I also like that the LCD screen as opposed to all of the other laptops on the market that have glossy screens (which are AWFUL with smudges and glare). The MS Office suite and STATA run very well on the laptop, and I never have any problems attending online classes/conference calls through Adobe Pro Connect, Skype and other communication applications. I also ordered this item from Circuit City through Amazon; I chose the normal free shipping option, and my package arrived within only 2-3 days! Overall, I would highly recommend this product!
