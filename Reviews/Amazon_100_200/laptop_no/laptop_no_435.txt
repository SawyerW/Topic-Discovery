I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality of this laptop.  I was looking forward to a Lenovo laptop after a disappointing experience with a HP product. The touch pad does not not work and the right and left click pads are extremely noisy and made of cheap plastic. A wireless mouse is a must. Very poor quality and design even for a no frills design. The laptop does not have a locking mechnanism; another disappointing feature.  There is nothing positive that I can state about this laptop.  I have learned my lesson by buying a cheap product as I got what I paid.
