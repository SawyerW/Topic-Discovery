Recommended by a software company it disapoints in numerous important ways.OS:  Windows 7 is confusing and slow compared to Windows XP on my Acer DuoCore 6593.Display:  The screen is fuzzy and out-of-focus.Battery life:  nowhere near the stated 4.8 hours.  With less than 2 hours battery life this device is useless for the intended purpose...electronic health records which are accessed in the examination rooms.  Okay I suppose I could just settle for a 2 hour work day :) but come on Toshiba....be honest!Core 7 processer: I was prepared to be thrilled by the increase in speed.  Instead I found it not as fast as my old Acer laptop even with it's slower-speed hard drive and smaller number of cores.Tablet rotating screen:  I never even used the tablet feature because of the low battery life.  The stylus was an extra-cost feature ($35) which I found expensive.Conclusion:  A total waste of money which also damaged my business:I never was able to use the electronic health record system because of the poor battery life in the examination room.So....I spent $12,000 for the software and $2,000 for the computer; both of which are useless to me.Paul in Napa
