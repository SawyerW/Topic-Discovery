I bought this laptop as a replacement a year and a half ago.  It has worked very well for me since then, no problems with the system.  However, the hardware has slowly deteriorated over time, just from regular use.  The screen hinge on the left side has loosened and when I went to open the laptop today, the hinge ripped a bunch of the plastic off the corner of the screen and the corner of the laptop itself.  Another issue I had was that the charger plug also came loose, causing the laptop to not recognize that it is plugged in.  Overall this laptop works well, but the hardware issues after long-term use that I have had would cause me not to recommend it to others.  The hinges especially appear to be poorly made.
