I have been needing to replace my old Laptop for some time. I've waited until I really needed it for work, and needed to get one asap. After some searching, to really get the best deals, well, they're almost always online. I've found that for certain types of electronics, there is nothing wrong with refurbished. In fact, in many cases, the slightly older models are built with higher quality products, parts. And have fewer "bells and whistles" type features that can break easily. This Dell was / is surprisingly faster than I anticipated. It's not super heavy or bulky, it's great!! The built in speaker sound is loud enough that I can actually enjoy watching movies on it, or listening to music. The streaming is basically perfect! And the screen (the most important part for me) is large enough that I can sufficiently use this Laptop on the road for more complex software programs, for work. Eventually, I will want to upgrade and get a bigger screen, yada, yada. But this is just what I needed and I trust I will continue to enjoy having it around. I recommend!!
