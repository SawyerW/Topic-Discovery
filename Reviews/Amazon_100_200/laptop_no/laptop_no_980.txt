I wanted the newer version of the mac book pro that I had had (with no problems except age 8 yrs) so I decided to go with the mac book pro but this time more memory and a smaller size (13) instead of 17.  I also chose the hard drive because I wasn't ready to go to solid state or the mac book air where I couldn't upgrade...It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion and everything on my ipad and iPhone iCloud it over to each other!  The perfect match for me and I can still with one machine watch a cd (with out adding a part) and I have 8 GB and I'm thrilled about that!
