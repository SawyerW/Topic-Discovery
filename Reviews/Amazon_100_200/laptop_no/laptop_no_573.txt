I've had this laptop for about six months now.  I'm reasonably happy with the laptop itself.  I use it for word processing, spreadsheet, downloading photos and editing, and on-line games.  Just routine stuff.  The Windows 7 software takes a little getting used to.  There's a game that my kids like to play where you walk by pressing the directional keys.  If you're walking a long distance and holding the key down for awhile, the computer seems to think that you're telling it that you want it to do something and the game is then messed up.  (I'm convinced that this is my computer's fault, not the game's.)  This is my first experience with W7.
