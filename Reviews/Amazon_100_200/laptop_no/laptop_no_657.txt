I've had the new Samsung Laptop for two weeks and it is marvelous. Windows 7 is slightly different than Vista so I had to adjust my approach a bit to get my programs & data loaded, but all that went fairly smoothly. No problem with it locating my wireless network; however, I did have to call HP to get the Samsung to recognize my HP printer (had the same problem with my old laptop so it must be an HP thing). Yes, the Samsung start is fast; beautiful color screen; can have several programs open & easily switch among them. My previous laptop was a 17", but I actually like this 15.6" much better. The screen size is plenty big enough for Netflix movies; the laptop is so much lighter & easier to cart around. Someone  mentioned that the zero on the numeric keypad is inconveniently placed directly to the right of the right arrow key. As a bookkeeper, I agree. I must be very careful.  The only other thing is that I constantly mis-type because the keys seem to need a firmer touch that I'm used to. All-in-all though, I totally love my new SAMMY!
