I purchased my machine a year and a half ago.  The only problem I have had with it is that a piece of popcorn got stuck under a key and I had to send it to Hewlett Packard where they replaced the keyboard and had the unit back to me within a week!!HP's service has been exemplary and so has the laptop.I upgraded it to Windows 7 without a hitch and it runs like a top.It does, however, run a bit hot on the left side.I have used the machine heavily for internet browsing, chat, word processing and web page development.EDUT:  After using this machine for another year, I find that it's runs so hot that it burns my leg through my denim blue jeans if I set it on my lap for any long period of time, which I tend to do.  Also, it runs VERY loud.  I am reducing my evaluation to 3 stars from 5.
