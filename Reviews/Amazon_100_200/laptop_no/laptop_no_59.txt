I love the T61, but I think that there was another version.  I had a T61 in the past and have noticed a few differences.  Minor ones, but the other machine I had was as comfortable as an old shoe.  It had a particular "click" to the keys.  I wonder what that version was?  This version is very close and has become a part of my "computer family".  I like to have a computer in every room and at this price, it is affordable to do so.  With the reputation for being a "tough" machine, I expect to have my T61 around for a very long time.
