I don't know what some of these people who are saying the hardware and the build quality is poor are talking about. I have two of these computers and both of them are still running fast and smooth and I have never had to replace any parts on either of them. They are  the most reliable computers I have ever had. It comes with all the bells and whistles you want too; full hd, backlit keyboard, blueray, multi-touch pad, full size keyboard, hdmi and DP ports, dedicated graphics card, usb 3.0, e-sata port, etc... I do it all with them including some gaming and they hold up well in that too. The computer is big and heavy but it's supposed to be a desktop replacement.
