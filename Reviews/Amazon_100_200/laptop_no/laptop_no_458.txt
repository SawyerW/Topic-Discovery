I like the display (crystal and bright and great image quality, the best laptop screen I ever used)  and state of art of design and build quality. I also like the back-lit keyboard.My dream list of changes expected to happen in 2011 13" model(1) change HDD to on-board flash storage.(2) get rid of DVD/CD drive for more ports and lighter weight(3) Make webcam a HD webcam(4) CPU upgrade(5) Desperate Video card(6) Weight is reduced from 4.5 to 4 pounds below.(7) reduced priceupdate (03-10-2011):on Feb 24, 2011, Apple released new macbook pros. I checked Macbook pro 13" and did a comparison and found the graphics of new model cannot compete with the old models (not as bright, rich color as). I would recommend you go for MBP 13 2010 over MBP 13 2011 if graphics is your major concern.
