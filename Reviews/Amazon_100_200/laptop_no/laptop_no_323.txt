I've had this computer for over two years. I upgraded my screen so it's the 1080p fancy one.Pros* Nice screen (I should hope so for an additional $400)* Keys are lit* Fast and powerful (I have upgraded GPU too)Cons* Screen is reflective like a mirror so good luck doing work where there is natural light (eg: airport)* The whole laptop has a shiny finish so fingerprints collect* The speakers have a large mesh-type surface that just gets full of dust/dirt over time* Runs hot!* Came with Vista - that's probably not the case now but it sucked at the time* HeavySo as you can see not too many problems for me. The aesthetic cons and screen reflectivity are what gives this laptop a four star. They're quite obvious faults that I knew were problems the moment it came out of the box ~ they're just stupid mistakes.All in all not bad. Note: if you buy this laptop used then its battery likely should be replaced. At this point mine lasts about an hour on battery with no music or video, no wifi, screen at the dimmest, etc.
