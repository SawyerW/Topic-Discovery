At this price, this machine is a steal.  It has the capability of a full-fledged computer and the convenience of an extremely portable laptop.  At just over 5 lbs. it's certainly heavier than a tablet, a Macbook Air or an ultrabook, but then again it has all the advantages of a "real" computer.  Responsiveness is outstanding since Windows 7 is a great OS, certainly when compared to Vista.  Even compared to Apple's OS X,  Windows 7 performs quite well, although it is of course much more "labor intensive", which is another way of saying that it's not quite as user friendly.  On the plus side, it provides what is possibly the most widely used software platform in the world. All in all you can't go wrong with this device if you are looking for something that provides heavy lifting computing power as compared to a tablet or even an ultrabook.
