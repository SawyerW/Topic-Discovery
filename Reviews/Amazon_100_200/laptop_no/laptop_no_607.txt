I am from India and I ordered this product from amazon to India because this is not available here and a laptop of this configuration costs more here(I paid $760 for this including shipping) and it reached to me within a week. I am using this for more than a month. I am very much satisfied with this product and I have no complaints as some other reviewers who says about the physical damage or non functioning of the USB ports but I have no such issue. It is very fast and very light, fingerprint reader works great as I don't need to fill my password at login but just to swap my finger on it. Battery life is very good and I used it continuously for 6 hrs for net surfing over WiFi,watching some online videos and editing some documents and still some battery(around 15%) left. It does not heat at all and the fan either do not run or I didn't come to know when it was running, very silent. 640 GB of storage is enough for any type of use.
