The only thing i found to not be great about the macbook pro is the graphics are lacking compared to PCs with a similar price tag but honestly gaming isn't macbook's strong point and if thats what your looking for look else where.Otherwise everything else beats PC, the software is individualized for the computer itself where as Microsoft makes one software for hundreds of computers, the build is stronger and more durable, the list goes on.Finally Amazons customer service is fantastic, my first computer had some issues with the battery life and amazon sent out a new computer right away, the current one I have works fantastic.
