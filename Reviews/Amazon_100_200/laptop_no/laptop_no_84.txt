I ordered this machine in confidence that ALL I needed to add on it was the OS...WELL guess what!?  IT came with NO RAM...the WRONG size HDD, (it said it would come with a 250gb and it came with a 120gb one), and to top it off when I finally added the missing ram on it...the screen gave me colored lines and then a solid white gradient background... AH and also no power adapter.. I sincerely hope the seller stands behind its good business and gives me the refund.. This machine was shipped out to Costa Rica and its not worth shipping it back
