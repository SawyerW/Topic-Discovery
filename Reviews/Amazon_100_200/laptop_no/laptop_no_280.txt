I spent months searching for the perfect laptop. One that was portable, capable of gaming and cost under $1000.I did a lot of research before considering the ASUS N61J Series. It turned out that it fit my needs perfectly. I mostly play modern RTS and MMORPGs, all of which I have played with no problems at all. Of course there are many other factors that will determine what is the right laptop for you , but this one is definitely worth looking into further. I have had it for months now and I am totally satisfied with it, especially considering the price. Take a closer look at this one, it may be just what you need.
