I was really anticipating the arrival of my laptop. When it finally got to me I was so excited until I turned it on using my friend's charger, the display is cracked and bleeding through SO much that the computer is completely nonfunctional. I am more than disappointed since I've been emailing the seller and have only gotten two replies that still don't answer my question. I needed a computer within a certain time range considering the one my family was using stopped working and now all I have is another broken device. This review itself is being typed on my mother's phone.
