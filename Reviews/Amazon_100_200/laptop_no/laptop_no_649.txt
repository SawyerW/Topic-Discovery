I enjoyed my S3. It was so much more portable than my old, big laptop. That was in the past tense because my S3 just wouldn't start this morning. No lights, nothing. Dead. It is less than six months old. To have a computer fail after six months is a sign of poor quality to me. Sending it to Acer for repair. I fully expect that they will find something that gets them off the hook from doing the repair under warranty (I'm sorry sir, but you were using your S3 while breathing. That is clearly a violation of the warranty terms.) I hope they prove me wrong.
