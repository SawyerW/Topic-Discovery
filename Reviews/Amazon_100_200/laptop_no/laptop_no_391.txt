This laptop delivers on performance and function.  Who said you have to pay a lot get to get a lot. Don't be fooled by the Celeron label...normally I would stay away from Celeron go with its bigger brother Pentium.  But in this case, with its upgraded W7 OS this computer diver on performance any normal user can enjoy.  Don't just look at the Gigahertz and Gigabytes...think about what your daily function will require.  If you are not a heavy gamer or a super duper tech savvy guy who will ping the living crap out of  a processor...this laptop will more than satisfy your daily activities for the next several years.Pro: Price and performanceCon: Battery life
