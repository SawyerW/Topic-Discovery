I bought my Gateway  Laptop in 12/2009 after what I believed to be extensive research as to it being a great computer.  In March of 2010, just three months after purchase the computer motherboard went out, then when I was returned the computer fresh from the Geek Squad repair shop, the Microsoft Windows 7 version was not genuine?  The day the manufacturers warranty would have expired, the hard drive crashed and It is still at the Geek Squad reapir shop now waiting for the 19.95 operating system disk I had to order because Gateway is too cheap to include when you pay way too much for their inferior jumble of junk parts.  I spent 700.00 at Best Buy for this computer, purchased the additional 3 years of product protection for 269.00 and I am back using my piece of junk Dell desktop, I lovingly call the dependable dinosaur.  I would not recommend this to anyone for fear they would have as much problems with it as I did.
