I've had this Mac for 3 years now. It's the first Mac I've ever owned. I would never go back to using any other computer model. Windows is now very confusing for me to use. Although I will likely live my whole life and never know how to use all of the MacBook's features, it's still a great laptop. I had an issue with the screen going black after the 2nd year of use, but the people at the Apple Genius Bar fixed it for free. It doesn't run as quickly as I'd like. I will have to change my battery soon as it now only holds a charge for about 1 1/2- 2 hours of use. I consider all of this to be normal wear and tear for a laptop. I've traveled with it a lot.
