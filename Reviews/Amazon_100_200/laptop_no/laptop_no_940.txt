Yeah, it's super expensive. I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!' But it's so worth it! I used to be a solid HP person. I loved the way they ran and wasn't a fan of my sister's Macbook Air. But after one busted computer, and another HP that crashed no less than four times (no joke, it was RIDICULOUS) I decided that an Apple was the way to go. I chose the pro because I definitely wanted the cd drive included with the computer. I LOVE IT! Definitely worth the extra money. It's fast, super user friendly, and easier to personalize. I had to use my old hp shortly after purchasing this and couldn't stand it! Once you go Mac, you won't go back!
