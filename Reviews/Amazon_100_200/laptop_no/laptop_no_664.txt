This computer is everything that the description says it is. I am a gamer and I am trying to get into computer gaming, and I am also a student. I have tried a few games like Fallout New Vegas and Oblivion and they work great. I haven't tried any shooters yet, but it looks promising so far. No problems so far.Pros:Good at gamingQuiet and coolGood sizeComes with great mouseKeyboard easy to use (and a number pad)Looks niceCons:-More heavy than some would prefer, but still not as heavy as a textbook so I'm ok with it.-Speakers aren't the best but they are fine.(I have high expectations for speakers.)Might not fit in certain backpacks.-I can't think of any other cons so it must be good.Overall, there were no bad surprises. As long as you know what you want and this is it, I don't think it will let you down.
