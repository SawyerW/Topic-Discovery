This is my first MacBook coming from a Windows environment. Like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I'm excited to do it. This MBP is clean, neat, and simple. I like that. It takes less time to power up, and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode. WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately. Very nice. I am pleased with my decision, however I have only had this for a few weeks. There are a few things I am dissappointed with though. Only 2 USB ports. Most Windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more. No HDMI port. Most Windows laptops have at least 1. The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac. These are about twice the price of an equivilant Windows machine so it was a tough decision, but like I said I am pleased so far.....
