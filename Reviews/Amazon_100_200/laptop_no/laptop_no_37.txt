I've had my ibook G4 933 for a month now. I got it from amazon with their fantastic rebate and free shipping. So far, it's unmodified, but I've ordered 512 of ram. The computer is fantastic. It feels very solid. Everyone who sees it comments that it looks like the older ibooks but better. The keyboard is a giant step up from older ibook keyboards, and I prefer it to the powerbook keyboard. I have not experienced any of the mild problems that were reported with very early ibook g4s.  I have been driving an external 8x dvd burner through firewire with no problems. Also use an external monitor with screen spanning. Everything is completely plug and play, including cameras, printer, scanner, and ipod. I love this computer!
