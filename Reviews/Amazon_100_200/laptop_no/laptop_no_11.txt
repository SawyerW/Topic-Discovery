Old computers never die. They become Linux boxes. Debian 4.0 (etch) installed right out of the box and everything ran except the touchpad was slow; all you have to do is edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf by adding the line: [Option "AccelFactor" "2.5"] to the synaptics touchpad section and it's fixed. Most wireless cardbus adapters work; just Google how to install them. The thing just plain works with Debian, much faster (even with only 256K!) and more stable than with anything Microsoft sells. Best part is, the OS and all the software are free! Wipe both of the Windows partitions from  your hard drive, install Debian by taking over the whole disk, and you'll have a machine with room to spare. You'll never look back.
