First thing that I noticed when I received my Asus u32u was the quality of the product it seems very sturdy and has a great design that feels very premium. I added some RAM to my notebook to give it a extra boost and I think it dose very well running programs, such as fairly recent games, Office, multiple website browsing. However I do notice a slowdown when watching videos. The notebook is also very portable and is great for students on a budget. I can say that this is the best laptop I have ever owned.Pros-Great DesignLong battery life (High Performance) 4-7 Hours/(Balanced Performance) 7-12 HoursStrong Performance for the cost.Cons-No CD SlotSlight lag when watching videos.
