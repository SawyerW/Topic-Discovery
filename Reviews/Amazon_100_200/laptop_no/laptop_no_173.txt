HP does not honor their warranty.  After six months the screen failed and showed many lines and some black areas.  This was just for normal operation of opening and closing the screen led.  No force or pressure applied on the screen or lid to open and close.  It is simply a poor quality design for expected operation.  HP blames it on the customer and does not honor their product quality and reliability.  After paying for replacement part plus labor, it will still be the same poor quality component.  Failure as the result of poor design for durability is blamed as damaged by consumer (operator).  I recommend Dell or Toshiba for much sturdier and well built design.  Would you accept this on your car warranty if the door wouldn't function and breaks after six months of normal use without any accident?  HP expects the consumer pays for their poor development.  Customer services were poor and at time insulting.  I hope you don't have to deal with them.  Would you take this risk for your new purchase?
