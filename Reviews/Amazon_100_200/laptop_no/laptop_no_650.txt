It is a beautiful slim computer, but performance is not the best. I have one since December 11 and I'm not happy with it. The ultrabook usually overheats, specially when using videos. When it overheats, the computer goes slow, or even stop to work, what is ridiculous for a new computer. The fan is noise, usually running at maximum speed. The HD also makes some sound.The battery is fair for the size (~3 hours), but I miss my old Acer 4810T (~6 hours). The touch pad is not the best, the keyboard is ok. Definitely the S3 is not even close to a Mac Air. It is a nice computer for travel (size and design), but to pay ~ $ 800 for a "netbook" is ridiculous.Pros: Beautiful, slim.Cons: Easily overheat, that makes it lose performance, and the fan makes a annoying sound.Don't spend ~ $ 800 on this. Buy a ultrabook with full solid state hd (less noise, more performance). Be careful with overheating on these small computers, it kills performance.
