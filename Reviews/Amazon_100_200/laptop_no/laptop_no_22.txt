I've had the sony PCG-V505DX for more than 2 years and overall, I've been satisfied with it.  What I like the most are the keyboard, the sleek feel of the computer, and its weight.  It's a pleasure typing on it.  The design is great and it's light enough to carry around.My only negative experience, unfortunately, was a near-catastrophic one.  After about 8 months, it stopped working.  It wouldn't even boot up.  I called Sony's tech support and they were no help.  In fact, their suggestion that I ship it in and they would reformat everything was less than helpful since saving my data was of utmost importance.  Fortunately, I took it to a local shop and the guy fixed it in a day without any loss of data.  Also, the warranty covered the repairs.  However, the experience left me with little confidence in Sony's quality control and no confidence in their tech support.All in all, the computer is a pleasure to use.  However, the fact that the computer wouldn't even start up after just 8 months has convinced me that my next purchase will be of a company with a better reputation for reliability.
