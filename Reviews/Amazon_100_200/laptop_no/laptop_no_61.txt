I got my Toshiba satellite A135 S4527 in April 2007, its worked great for me almost 3 years now.  No problems at all to report, except that Vista sucks compared to XP.  But, that isn't Toshiba's fault and I could always buy XP to replace it.  The laptop was a good deal at the time, I paid $599 I think and have no regrets about it.  One of my better purchases, I might stick to Toshiba since I had a good experience with this one.  A friend of mine has a really high-end Toshiba and its also 3 years old, and very nice, lots of extra stuff on it.
