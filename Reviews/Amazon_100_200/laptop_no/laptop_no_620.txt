I just finished busting an eight month old DELL 14RN 1364DBK laptop repeatedly against my coffee table. Damn!, that felt good! I admit, I am a dinosaur when it comes to computers and most other modern devices. But, I can only stand so much of freezing up, the cursor going where IT wanted to go, etc. Plus, the windows 7 home edition leaves you wondering whether it is even working most of the time. There is no icon to show that the thing is searching, etc. I have owned several computers in the past, but this is the worst one that I have ever owned. I bought one from Radio Shack in 1987 that performed better than this.
