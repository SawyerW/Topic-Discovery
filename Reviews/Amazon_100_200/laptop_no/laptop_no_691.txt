Im older so don't know and cant judge the bells and whistles of the product but it works well for me and its attractive looking. The only issue I had with it is that it came with lots of games on it (not my thing) and a 30 day free trial of McCaffey but I bought Norton already and so had to pay someone to get that stuff off my computer (told you Im a real basic user). Sometimes I have gliches and manage to muddle through and I don't understand how to find cookies and get rid of them. Then scan disk and defrag are difficult to find so any problems I had were not with the machine but the way the software was set up. The computer itself is great and now I don't have to drive my powerchair to the library to use a computer so I am very grateful its working well. I was concerned because it was a big buy for my budget.
