Purchased this laptop at an Apple Store, after my mid-2011 Macbook Air was stolen. It was still in excellent condition, and I simply wanted an equivalent replacement.I'm a software developer, and this laptop met all my needs just as well as the 2011 model. The battery lasted a full day of travel (& travel delays), with intermittent use from 4am to 10pm.There appears to be a bug with the audio on this laptop, and I'm not sure if it's hardware or some sort of firmware issue. The volume of the built-in speakers fluctuated quite a bit while listenting to music and watching video. I'm not the only one with this bug ([...]), and it's pretty annoying. I'm planning to return the laptop and get a 2012 model.If you're totally gung-ho for the 2013 model, I recommend waiting until Apple resolves the audio issue.
