My previous Mac was a PowerMac I'd had for 10 years. Needless to say, the leap from that to this has been amazing and (aside from the financial reasons) I am astounded that I hadn't made the switch sooner. This machine is fast and works effortlessly. I quickly adapted to the changes in the OS, and adore the different finger swipes to move from webpage to webpage and desktop to desktop. The screen gives a clear, crisp picture. It downloads and streams quickly. Honestly, things that took me an hour to do on my old Mac now take half or even 1/3 the time. As someone who needs to occasionally write in a Slavic language, I also appreciate the ease of instantly typing those letterforms with a few keystrokes instead of looking them up on an "obscure glyph" chart.Nitpicks include a caps lock button that doesn't always react to gentle touches and the occasional glare on the glass screen (which I'm sure will not be as much of a problem once I move into an apartment that isn't illuminated exclusively by skylights).But, I couldn't be happier.
