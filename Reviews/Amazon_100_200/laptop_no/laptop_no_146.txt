This is a great computer i brought mine back in 09 or something like that, and it still works like a champ. It plays 2011 games on high graphics settings; also i do plan to give it a upgrade at the end of this year so it can last a few more years. The  screen, the sound quality, the durability, and the four usb drives makes this a great computer.One down fall is the mouse pad, i get very upset when my palm hits the pad and the computer registers that as me wanting to fire, or attack. other than that this is a good buy, a fair price for this computer as is would be 200-420. there is a refurbished one for sale, that might be an upgraded version, but if not i would not recommend it.
