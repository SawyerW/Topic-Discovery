I'm not going to lie, I really had my heart set on getting a MacBook air. But unfortunately I don't have rich parents and I have to work for everything I get. So, I had to get something a little more affordable. I went to my local computer store (Compusa) and looked around. All the laptops were just so ugly looking to me! I like a machine that looks as if a lot of though was put into it's design. (One of my reasons for wanting an Apple machine) When I laid eyes on this beauty, It was stunning! I looked at it's specs, and it has USB 3.0, great processor and even a dedicated graphics processor. I'm going to switch the HD to an SSD soon so it'll be even better! I like that when you open the lid, it wakes from sleep without having to press a key. That's a feature a lot of people take for granted. Just another great part of the design.I have read reviews on here saying it stops working after a month or so. I'll update this review if this happens!
