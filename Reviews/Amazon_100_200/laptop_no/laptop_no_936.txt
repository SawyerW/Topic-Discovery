I bought my MacBook pro on february 25 2013 and I thought it was the greatest. It was fast, and it was "different". I fell in love with my machine, and it was pampered. Then only FOUR months later, my great MacBook pro FAILED. My 500 GB hard drive went "bad" according to APPLE. I'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product. I guess other users may have a different experience, but I'm livid that i had this experience!.I've used PC's all my life, and I have never had a single PC go on me this quickly - FOUR MONTHS!!!. My PC's have lasted for at least 3 years of heavy use before I encountered any problems with them.I never liked APPLE, and this incident  reaffirms my thoughts of the company. They are nothing more than a consumer hype company. Don't waste your money purchasing a Mac. Don't buy into the hype. Just get an ordinary PC that can do the dam job for a lot less money.Sadly, I'm still paying my credit card on this paper weight of a Mac.
