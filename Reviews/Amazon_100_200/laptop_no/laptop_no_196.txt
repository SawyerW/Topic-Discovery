I BOUGHT MY MAC BECAUSE A FRIEND ADVISED ME TO "GET ONE AND I'LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER LAPTOP FOR YEARS". THIS MAYBE TRUE ABOUT APPLE MAC BUT MACBOOKS FROM SOCALDEALS ARE FRAUD!!! FIRST THING HAPPEN THE DARN TRACKPAD WAS DEFAULT (IMAGE HAVING A TRUE GHOST IN UR MACHINE) SO IT MOVED AND MADE CHANGES TO MACBOOK WITHOUT MY INTENTIONS!!!!! AFTER DECOVERING OTHER DISLIKES ABOUT MY PURCHASE I CONTACTED SOCALDEALS BEFORE 90 WINDOW  FOR RETURN THEN WAS TOLD BY SOCAL REP TO HOLD OFF RETURN UNTIL I RETURN STATESIDE AND THAT THEY'LL FIT ONCE I GET HOME. I'M MILITARY IN AFGHANISTAN SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR LEAVE BEFORE I COULD GET HOME AND GET IT FITS!!!! WHEN IT WAS TIME ONCE I GOT HOME BAM! "YOU'VE WENT PASSED THE WARRENTY ALLOWED, YOU'LL HAVE TO RETURN PRODUCT AND LOSE 25% RESTOCK FEE. I ENDED UP PAYING FOR REPAIRS MYSELF PLUS CONTINUE TO FIND MORE AND MORE THINGS WRONG WITH THIS LAPTOP! DO URSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T BUY REFURBISHED MAC LAPTOPS FROM SOCALDEALS!!!!!!  SCAM/SCAM/SCAM/SCAM/SCAM.....
