This mac is awesome, I have no complaints about it It just works! As simple as it sounds. Hard to accomplish when you own a Windows pc. The first thing I used to do when I owned a Windows computer was to update it to the latest "Security Fixes" which needless to say are countless and useless... Install a good Antivirus, remove unnecessary crappy bundled software and after a few hours I had a almost working environment.Those times are over, this Mac works out of the box it launches immediately almost unnoticeable and its ready for action. It is just perfect!
