To sum it up, the Macbook is one of the best computers I've ever owned. It's fast, light, and is perfect for media editing, which is mostly why I bought it in the first place. One problem does emerge though: the price. At $1899 to start, this is no cheap machine. Though you are getting an excellent machine and paying a decent price for the parts, many other machines can match if not go far past this one in terms of graphics preformance and other factors and run you a lot less. It is my belief though that if you intend to use any computer as a media editing machine, or even as a daily driver, then an OSX machine is certianly worth it, and with this now taking the top spot in screen size on the Macbook line I would definatly recommend this to anyone who asked.
