Everything about this laptop is great with one exception.They have miss-placed built-in microphone. It is located just left/under of your left hand.I was doing some remote training via Skype and my typing noise and system humming noise were too loud for the training to continue.  Everytime I put my left hand on the keyboard, hand will muffle mic pickup and they would hear key click louder than my voice.  I had to resort to my cell phone to have voice conversion and screen training demo at the same time.  Mic location does not make as sense.Samsung! Other laptops have Mic next to the webcam for that reason.
