Great Price but word to the wise. Laptops do not come with restore disks these days and I have found that the restore on the physical laptop itself corrupts and typically user cannot restore original factory image. While trying to create a restore disk with Acer's software I got errors and was unable to burn a restore disk. I called Acer and they will be sending me a free restore disk. The error was 0x207. If the computer crashes and you do not have a restore disk you will be down and then have to pay big bucks Acer's technical support, so try burning a restore disk right away and if you can't call Acer right away. After the 90 day software warranty, you will have to pay by credit card for support.
