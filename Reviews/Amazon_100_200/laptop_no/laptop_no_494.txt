I bought my probook 2 years ago for a general use laptop, and I'm very pleased with its performance!  I traveled with it to Afghanistan and back and not even a whiff of trouble.I can't comment on battery life or touchpad issues, which seem to be the common complaints.  I keep mine plugged in pretty much always, and I have a separate mouse.  I actually like the keyboard on this machine - it's pretty user-friendly, I think.  The sound is good too.  All my USB ports still work (that has been an issue for me with other computers - USB ports quit after some time...)As for random restarting, it has never happened to me.  Nor have I had any compatibility issues, or crashes, etc.
