I purchased the L755 series/S5349 on JAN.26,2012 from Amazon. Right out of the box it ran extremely slow,I have an 8 year old Toshiba laptop that is 10 times faster than this new laptop,very unhappy with its' speed and the extreme garbage it has installed in it, I am reluctant to contact Toshiba due to their inability to care for the customer and my inability to understand their english ,,I saved my money thinking this toshiba would be great,but I am now stuck with a dead horse so it seems!! So new customers beware of Toshiba and the poor quality item it has. Also check other review sites before you buy Toshiba.
