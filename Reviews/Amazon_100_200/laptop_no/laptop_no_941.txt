I needed to upgrade to Lion but my old platform (MacBook vintage 2008/9) was not upgradable.  It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.  I chose the MBP over the MacAir because of the extra ports, DVD burner, etc, accepting the extra weight which was not that important to me.  I love the new platform, though it took some getting used to with the Launch Pad and Command Center paradigms.Con:  The only small complaint I have is the power cord attachment to the laptop.  It has a 90 degree bend in it that either requires the cord to bend along (and partially cover) the various ports on the side of the laptop or bend away to the rear which generates a long loop for me the way I plug it it with the possibility of accidentally popping out.Pro:  Besides delivering the higher level performance that I expected of the new platform, the display on the MBP is much better than my old MacBook which had a poor quality display with a waviness I never liked and poor off-angle viewability.
