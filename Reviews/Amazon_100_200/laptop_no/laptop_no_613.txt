I wouldn't go to far and say its a bad laptop but it isn't great. If you want to get into some decent gaming, this MIGHT be the laptop for you but it probably wont. Its graphics aren't that great, like you guys have said the shift button is pretty awful. I dont plan on buying a laptop again, for a while at least, because it did what i wanted it to when i got it but now that im REALLY getting into computers I'm rather disappointed. It does have some nice features but once again, if your gonna game this isn't the computer for you. At least you can play TF2 max graphics :p But the main seller on this for me was the cost (btw i got it at staples) and it cost me $450
