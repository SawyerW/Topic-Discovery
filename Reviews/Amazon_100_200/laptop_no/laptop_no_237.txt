I am not very tech savvy, so I wanted a PC that came with a Windows OS and little else.  The plan was to "build" it to my liking and efficiency.  This was a fantastic product to experiment with, and everything is going well so far!  As for the physical nature of the product, the screen is large enough to enjoy visual media, the images appear crisp with good color, and the sound is surprisingly great!  It's relatively light, as well.  I've been having fun making this laptop my own, and have received compliments from IT colleagues on how clutter-free it is.
