I bought this laptop last year without researching a whole lot about it (based on a friend's recommendation). It was pretty much love at first use! I love how awesome it is to have the keyboard with a backlight. The battery life is FANTASTIC!  The screen is large enough, super clear.  I love how it feels to click the keys on the keyboard, they do not "crunch." It is light weight and it also doesn't make my lap hot when I use it. Like all Macs, it is easy to use and I quickly navigate between applications with multiple windows open. I am a teacher so I use several resources at the same time to develop my lesson plans. Of course as I type this I know that I bought it in 2012 and today they have a newer model and version. This one is amazing though. You won't be disappointed!
