Quite impressed with this machine.Asus was kind enough to supply a (1) 4 gig memory chip that made it outstanding for an extra 4 gig of RAM upgrade. Hats off to Asus for the open slot.My battery meter at full charge indicates 8hr-4min of battery use. Screen brightness is at about 50% but very viewable.Early reports indicated poor screen angles. Although not fantastic, its a lot better than expected, totally acceptable. Also, it was reported keyboard flex at top may not suit you. Keyboard is fine and not as reported.Can't believe how thin the screen is. Beautiful display.I really like the Computer and Asus has done a top notch job on the design.
