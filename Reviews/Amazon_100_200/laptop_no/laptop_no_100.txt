my hp dv9000 has ran great for 3 years now and it is loaded to the gills with power and speed for an older laptop it has 4gb of memory a digital tv tuner remote control and a blue ray player that I use to drive my 55 inch tv with and it does that very well. I use it as a dvr too. The battery is my only real issue it only holds charge for about an hour or so now so I think I will buy a new battery soon. these laptops do overheat if you dont use a cooling fan underneath them the bottom of the machine just dosent have enough space to circulate any air under its huge baseplate so prolonged use is limited to about an hour if you dont provide a usb cooling device underneath it. once you address that issue it will run true and cool without a hitch. I can only guess that a lot of people have let their laptops fry themselves out rather than spend the 20 dollars on a cooling pad. This computer blows any other laptop I have ever used before out of the water.
