I received the item before the stated date.  Great.  The issue I have is that I paid for "NEW" condition.  When I received my item, I noticed "refurbished", and "reconditioned" all over the box/packaging.  I immediately contacted the seller (Electronica Direct) about receiving the wrong product.  I was informed that this item shows up "NEW", because Amazon assigned a NEW SKU/item number on an existing refurbished item.  Electronica Direct was very helpful in every way and offered an exchange or refund immediately even it not being their fault. They've informed me that this model isn't even sold in true new condition anymore.  The SKU is in plain site on Amazon, yet Amazon still lists this in NEW condition.I have yet to open the box and mess with the actual product.  I just felt I should warn others before they go about purchasing this (and selecting "New" condition) expecting a brand new product that never needing any tampering.  Thanks.  (World record for number of times the word "new" was used?)
