This laptop has been reliable and quiet in the 4 years I've owned it. In the past year I bought 4GB of RAM, a new Solid State Hard Drive and installed Windows 7 64-bit. Things seemed great but when I would push the laptop to play video games on High Performance it now has trouble holding a steady FPS (Frames Per Second). In other words, games which did work are barely running and they lag too much that gaming is unenjoyable. These are games made around 2009 to 2010. It seems Intel's HD Graphics gets worn out and will lose its horsepower. Other than that, for the price it's a great laptop to own! It was just frustrating to be involved in a game and find out it can't play anymore. It's time to upgrade to a better system.
