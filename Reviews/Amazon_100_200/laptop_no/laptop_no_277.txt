I bought this laptop for work and I don't regret it. I dropped it onto a steel grate and all that happened was a small nick on the side. I can play games like Skyrim on this laptop and it can almost be set on the high graphics settings without stuttering. It loads super fast and has almost every port you could wish for. ie, USB 3.0, digital audio out, HDMI out. It eats battery though, I normally have it plugged in. It can last about 2 hours when the screen is on the highest brightness and I am not playing games.
