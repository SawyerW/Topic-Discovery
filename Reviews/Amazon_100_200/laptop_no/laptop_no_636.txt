I needed to replace my Samsung NC10 and wanted something as light and easy to move around.  I first bought the Mac Air 11.  I'm a senior aged woman, not a techie by any stretch, and just couldn't learn the Mac operating system. I returned it and bought the Acer Aspire.It works fine -- I'm able to do what I need, email, internet, spreadsheets, documents, without any difficulty.  The unit is light enough to use on the couch, at the kitchen table, or wherever I need to go. The battery lasts at least a whole day.  The price was less than the other Ultrabooks currently on the market. It starts up almost as fast as the Mac which is a really nice feature.  I have it for a month now, and no complaints.
