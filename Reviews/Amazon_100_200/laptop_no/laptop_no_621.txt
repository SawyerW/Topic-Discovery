Wanted a laptop to replace my 3-year old Toshiba Satellite, which slowed down and froze up until it died. Replacement was to be for family use primarily, with basic applications such as word processing, banking, shopping, browsing etc. So far, I have had no complaints.The I3 processor is quick enough for my needs, the system boots up very quickly (about 20 seconds or so - a far cry from the Toshiba), and I've had no crashes or freezes so far. Build quality could have been a bit better....this Dell feels....well, delicate. You don't feel like it can take any sort of abuse...which is not a real issue with me because it remains on my dining room table anyway. Dedicated numeric keypad is a definite plus, along with USB 3.0 connectivity, Bluetooth and WIDI. Overall, a competent and capable family laptop,
