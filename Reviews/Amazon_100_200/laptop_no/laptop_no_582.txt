I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It's very versatile, it does everything she has loaded flawlessly.Pro's: its fast with photo rendering in Lighthouse, of course any business application, video editing. web surfing, Itunes a few games, you name it. The screen is bright and the key board set up is great.Con's: my one complaint is that when I bought it, in the description it said it had a lite keyboard, the only thing my wife said she really wanted. Well it is lit, with an LED that sits on the top edge of the display. It shines down on the keyboard, it ISN'T repeat ISN'T back lit. However the screen is so bright that my wife doesn't need it lit,so it all good. All in all it a very good multi use notebook.
