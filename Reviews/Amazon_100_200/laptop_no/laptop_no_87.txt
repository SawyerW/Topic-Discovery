It's been a little over a year since I've bought this laptop and since then I've had to replace the DC jack, the AC adapter, and the keyboard. The center control do not work anymore so I have to access controls manually (e.g. volume, eject CD, etc.) The battery is now worthless. It only last for 20 minutes at the most, and the replacement battery is very expensive. Fingerprint reader doesn't work anymore and I can't uninstall or re-install its software. Many software such as Adobe is incompatible with the 64-bit Vista. It overheats to the point where it burns my hands so I had to buy a laptop cooling pad. I get the "blue screen of death" very often and the problem started shortly after I bought it; I've tried several anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-malware, etc., but the problem persist to this day. The frame on the upper part of the LCD and the center controls cover are scratched due to lack of contact protection between the screen and the laptop itself. The wireless card and the touchpad continuously stop working. If I could afford to I would have moved on to another laptop long ago.
