I am a techno idiot, so if you want a review that goes in detail about gigs, jigs and migs, then this isn't it. If you want to know if this computer can get you online while on the road, listen to music, watch movies and just plain rock your world, then I am your man. I pulled this thing out of the box about 2 weeks ago and fired it up. I bought a router so I could use it anywhere at home. I have had no issues with it and the fact is it is much faster then my HP desktop. All preinstalled software works perfectly and the picture quality while watching video is perfect. The first night I had it I watched my DVD of Cool Hand Luke on it and was just amazed at the quality. Bottom line? I love it!
