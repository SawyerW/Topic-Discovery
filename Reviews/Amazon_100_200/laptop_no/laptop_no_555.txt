is really a jumbo netbook with dvd with performance only little better than intel atom.Fortunately for people that are in market now there's many new generation of much faster processor/video alternative with good battery life.For sub $400 now, you can get 3gb+  320gb+ harddrive with hdmi (east tv connection plus accelerated video).All with great battery like 4hr+ etc.Avoid V and E series from AMDIntel i3/i5 are great, new generation(2011) laptop pentium are good.Amd A series are good, turion II are ok...If you see dedicated/discrete video ram for extra $20-50, go for it since that will give burst in multitasking/video.So there is not much reason to get slower one like this.
