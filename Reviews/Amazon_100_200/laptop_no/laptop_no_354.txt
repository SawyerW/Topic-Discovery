I think everyone else's ratings for this computer speak volumes. I'm sure like most shoppers I was debating between this and a 13" MacBook Air. When it came down to it the value of this MacBook Pro far outweighed (pun intended) that of the MBA. 4GB of RAM and an i5? I'm sold.The issue of the Intel onboard graphics is not that big of a deal to me. The 320M in the MBA would be great, especially the 1440x900 resolution. But for getting work done, this machine is so much more powerful than the outdated C2D. Maybe not as snappy as the SSD in the Air, but it's got power!I may upgrade to a SSD in the future, another thing I really like about the MBP. But for now I'm enjoying a great premium laptop at what I consider a great value.Gone are the days of the clunky and troublesome PB 190's and 5300's. You really can't go wrong with an Apple product these days.
