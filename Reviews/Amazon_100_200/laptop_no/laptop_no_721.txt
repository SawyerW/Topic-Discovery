Bought this so I wouldn't have to work from my old desktop that the kids and husband use. Makes my life easier, have had some quirks like the mouse jumping around on the screen occasionally just like I read in other reviews. I worried about that but it's really not that big of a deal. I also wanted to avoid Windows 8 and Windows 7 has had good reviews compared to Vista and 8. When I went to college for computer information technology the rule of thumb was that every other operating system by Microsoft is the good one. So since Vista had quite a few issues, seven was the way to go. This little laptop offers room to upgrade to the next good OS so it should last me a long time.
