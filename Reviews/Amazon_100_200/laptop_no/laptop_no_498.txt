First of all, I've used Dell, Lenovo and Sony Laptops. None of them compare to HP Laptops.The HP Pavilion dv6-3050us 15.6-Inch Laptop is a great laptop, at a great price. Here's why:- The AMD Phenom II N930 makes it one of the fastest under $1000 in the market. This is a great processor, even for gamers.- It's has a clear bright screen with optimal resolution- This laptop is slim and lightweight and has a great design- Stays quiet and has a nice keyboard layout, with discrete light indicators (more business-style wise).- It has a finger-print reader for a quicker access and the webcam and microphone are incorporated, for a better multimedia experience.Some minor cons:- It takes a while to get used and to configure the mouse. It has multiple touch options for browsing, zooming, scrolling, etc.- The Keyboard has quick access keys on the left and it takes a while to accustom itself to those keys. I tend to press them by mistake, instead of the Ctrl, Shift and Caps Lock keys).- It sometimes gets a little to hot (on the upper left side of the keyboard).
