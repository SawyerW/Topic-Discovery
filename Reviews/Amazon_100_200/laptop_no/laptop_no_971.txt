I looked at multiple Apple laptops and decided to purchase this one.  Even though there is MBP that is thin like the MacAir, I decided to purchase the one with the CD drive that would allow me to burn images which is a must have for me.  I chose this over the retina because of the price and retina is not a must have.  Honestly, can ppl really see the difference between a retina and non retina?  It's a beautiful laptop, I run parallel and fusion with no issues on the installed RAM. I upgraded my memory to 16gb and haven't had issues either.  I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends...it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
