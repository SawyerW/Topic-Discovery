This is simply the best computer I've owned.  I've owned PC's and Macs.  No doubt, Macs are by far superior.  I wish I could afford another [$$$] for a G4 powerbook, but since I can't, I got this one.  I can't believe the power, versatility, and the attention from others.  As someone who writes software, and attends school full time as a law student, this computer does it all.  My only complaint, hard-drive is small, so I bought an external firewire drive to store non-essential data.  Dang, firewire is fast.  Also, I have an iPod.  It is of no "Practical" use, but try and take it from me and ....well.... the won't let me say it here.  Let's just say, I love it.BUY and APPLE, if you can afford a G4 powerbook, get one.  If not, trust another developer the G3 is still kick - a**.
