Editing my earlier review because the problems I had with this computer - the shoddy case design, and the touchpad not working - are dwarfed by the fact that the computer overheated, the case partially MELTED, and now the computer will not boot up. We put the laptop back in the box and are sending it back to Best Buy with a request for a full refund. I feel fortunate that we were home when the computer overheated and it didn't burn our house down, or burn our four-year-old son when he accidentally touched it. Toshiba is no longer selling these laptops and there is a recall because of the overheating issue - the solution being that you install a piece of software that will force-shutdown the system when the computer gets "too hot." What a travesty. Toshiba should do right by consumers and issue people full refunds. This is not only a useless product, it is dangerous and should be recalled by the CSPC.
