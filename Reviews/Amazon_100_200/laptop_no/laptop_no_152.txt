Yes ..I had to redo my earlier review on this Pc. it started out with a few bugs . i was not very happy, But now after updating a few drivers it seems like to be one of the best Laptops i have ever owned. Sound was one of the issue i had earlier. Now after trying out different music i realized its totally depends of the quality of music you play. better quality better sound.It is definatly very fast laptop and Support from Hp has been excelent so far.That's the reason now i had to rewite my review on this laptop. Great value ..solid feel..super fast.
