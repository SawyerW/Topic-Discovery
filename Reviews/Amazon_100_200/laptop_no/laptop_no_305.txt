I bought this Toshiba a few weeks ago. Got one of those black Friday deals. I am very happy with this machine. It performs well for the tasks I use it for (the I3 processor has more guts than my old Pentium). I am a newbie to Windows 7, but I like it so far. I generally use the Toshiba as a desk-top - with a larger monitor and wireless keyboard and mouse, although when I do use it as a laptop the screen is fine, and the touch pad is easy to use. My photo editing software has no problems running (which is one of the reasons I wanted to upgrade, the old Pentium and slower hard drive was having some issues with Photoshop Elements). I would definitely recommend this laptop.
