I like the 13 inch macbooks. Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable. The new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad. I didn't think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times. Installed Parallels 8 on it and windows 7 and windows 8 actually works excellent (should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the Mac OS). The magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool. Used my IR remote with it and was kinda glad i didn't buy the retina display or the air.
