I just brought mine home today. Got it up and running with a wireless internet connection in no time. I'm extremely happy with it. The display is crisp, but the darks do break up a bit at certain viewing angles. It's a very quiet machine. The HDD is a Seagate--part of the reason it's so quiet. I would like to have a had a little bigger HDD, but 320 isn't bad, and a 7200rpm drive is necessary for running Hi-Def video NLEs. I may use this laptop for wedding videos where I can grab a few minutes from my cams and make a quick short to show at the reception on a portable big screen (the latest trend in weddings). So far I haven't found anything bad to say about this laptop. I paid $500 on closeout at Office Max.
