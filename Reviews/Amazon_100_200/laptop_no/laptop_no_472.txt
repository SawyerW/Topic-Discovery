Don't trust on a 2 day shipment, its just like Santa Claus.I order and pay US$18,90 for 2 day shipment because I had to give that macbook as a birthday gift to my daughter, and what I received was an Amazon email asking sorry about the delay. You should be very shame on that.I want my money back once I didn't have what I ordered for....this is the second time that you make the same mistake and I had the same penalty for trusting on your delivery dates. Next time I should be smarter and go for it on a regular store!!!!
