I have beeen fixing one thses laptops for my cosin pretty much non stop.  I was interested to see a HP/Compaq hybrid after reading Compaq had been bought out by HP but I was expecting a much better notebook.  This note-book has horrible performance just like the old Compaq presario I used to have.  Had the same screen issues that my old Compaq had and also possesses the same horrible crashing that my old compaq had.  SO I guess HP just took the failed design of the old Compaq systems and re-shipped them.  This is proabally why just before they were bought by HP, Compaq had the lowest ratings and test scores of any brand it all catagories.  Not all Compaq's are bad, my releationship with the Compaq systems is they work or they don't, which I was no where near satisfied with.
