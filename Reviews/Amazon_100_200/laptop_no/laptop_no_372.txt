I have been very disappointed with my Macbook Pro.  It is very unstable for connecting to WiFi.  I keep getting the Self-Assigned IP address.  Google self assigned IP address and you will see that many others are getting the same problem.  It is a problem that Mac refuses to address.  I have tried all the solutions suggested, and non have fixed the problem.  Mac support has not solved the problem either.  They claim it is the WiFi routers.  No way.This is my second Mac.  I bought a Macbook back in 2007.  Although there are some nice features on Mac computers, the cons outweigh them all.If you are thinking about jumping from PC to Mac, I suggest you reconsider.
