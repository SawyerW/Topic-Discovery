Bought this computer for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  It is the perfect first computer for her age group.  The parental controls on a Mac are exactly what a parent would want.  My daughter can not go on any website unless I have created a shortcut button for it in her favorites bar.  I was able to decide what applications she is allowed to use and I set up network sharing between my computer and hers.It doesn't have the latest and greatest of everything on it but for my 10 year old it has everything she could ever want.  She will probably use this as her primary computer for the next 5 years and at less than $200, that makes it an awesome investment.Plus, with it being a Mac, it will continue to last as an extra laptop for my family forever!  I still have a G3 desktop Mac that I have been using for photography work since 1998 and I have never had a problem with it.  I trust Apple computers with my life and I would never buy any other computer brand.
