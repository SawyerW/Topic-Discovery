When I was looking for a laptop with the performance, style, and light weight, I naturally settled on this HP G-42-230US. It has a 14 screen that is perfect for your everyday typing, if you want to watch a DVD at a coffee shop, or if you're like me, the occasionally youtube video. So far, I have no complaints about this laptop.Like the previous reviewer, I was surprisingly happy at the weight of this laptop. At 4.85 lbs, I feel like I can carry it with me everywhere. I even looked at some 13.3 inch Toshiba and Lenovo laptops, but theirs' measured at around 4.75 or 4.8 lbs with a bigger price tag.Pros of this amazing laptop:-lightweight-long battery life-very good quality camera-a senor mousepad that allows you to turn it off or on with just one finger-user friendly installation-rank #1 in Newsweek's green ranking (it uses less energy than your average 14-in laptop)-sturdy feel (good material)-brought it when amazon had a fantastic price of only $550 with free shippingIf you're looking for a stylist laptop with the performance specs to back it up...this is the laptop for you!
