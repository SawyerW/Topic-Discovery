Really liked this laptop for size and outside design.  Very user friendly.  HOWEVER, the wifi assistant would stop and literally disappear from my desktop.  I would be working along then suddenly I would be disconnected from the net and the laptop would ask me to plug in the ethernet cable.  I understand this was a problem with many of these machines.  I would have to go into the BIOS to fix it, only to have it happen again a few days later.  Finally got a blue screen and it was pronounced dead last week.  I really hoped a laptop would last a little longer than 17 months!  Hopefully the glitches have been worked out on the newer models.
