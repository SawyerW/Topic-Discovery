I purchased this computer for my daughter to use for school. It replaced a MacBook from 2006, the older computer was still working fine, and we were able to sell that one to partially defray the cost of this new one. I have purchased many Mac portable computers over the last 15 years, and this one is the best one yet. My overriding review comment is that I have had no troubles with my Mac laptops (or desktops, for that matter) over the years, and I always look forward to replacing old devices with the latest that Apple has to offer. Exceedingly high quality, reliable and trouble free.
