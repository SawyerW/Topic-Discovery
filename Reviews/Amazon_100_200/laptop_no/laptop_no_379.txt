4 months after purchasing this computer, for my work, 2 things were malfunctioning.  The hard drive was toast and one of the USB ports was not working (as there are only 2 and I use a USB mouse and USB laptop cooler this became a problem).  I sent it in for servicing after talking to tech support and included a note with an arrow highlighting the bad USB port.After 9 days I got it back with a new hard drive, all my software and files gone, and still only 1 working USB port.  When it works, it works fine, but this is the very last Lenovo I will ever buy.
