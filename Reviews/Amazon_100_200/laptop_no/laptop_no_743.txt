I've owned this computer for about a year now.Primarily, I'm a gamer... Why didn't I purchase an Alienware? overpriced. The graphics card in this system is a 1 gig dedicated card. Once you figure out how to lock it to this graphics... you will have a much better experience.The only thing I wish I did was install an ssd drive for a boot drive. My kid and Fiance decided to upgrade my memory to 16 gig... Didn't make a big deal. i'd go 8 if I had ot do it over, and spend the balance on the SSD. Other than that... I'm completely happy with this system. Fast, I7, Good size HD/ Enough ram to not need anything.Don't worry about the system. It will handle almost vertyhing thrown at it.
