After using this laptop for 2 weeks, I am totaly satisfied with it. The new hp envy sb version has all aluminum chassis and feels vry solid. Windows boots up in 18 seconds. Running program as fast as average desktop. Here is some feedback:The screen: some one may complain this laptop never comes with radiance display anymore. Actually, the bright view screen is great, and it's even brighter and has more vibrate color than my wife's macbook pro.The touchpad: This sandy bridge refresh version has a nearly as good as macbook touchpad. Multigesture, two finger scroll and pinch zoom all work smoothly. Just remember don't update the synaptics drive. New driver doesn't support double-tab to turn off touchpad feature.Battery life: If you set the brightness to 60%, and just normal use, the out of box battery lasts about 5 hours. If you turn off the bluetooth and wifi, battery should last even longer.Finally the noise: Normal using won't produce much noise. You need to put your ear at the air vents to hear it. It does has some noise when playing games, but tolerable.Purchased from amazon, and happy to deal with them.
