Like another reviewer, I've also had started having problems the AC adaptor and the battery.  It will cycle between AC and DC power at random.  I don't know if this is because of the placement of the adaptor and me consistently bumping up against it because of this bad placement, or some other reason.  The metal end of the power adaptor will get extremely hot to the touch as well.  I honestly don't know how long this laptop will last and it really bugs me that I'm expecting this unit to fail after only having it a few months.  It's still under warranty and I will get this fixed, but it is a huge inconvenience to lose my laptop for a couple of weeks (again) for a second repair in the time that I've owned it.  I do regret my purchase decision and will waste no additional money on ASUS products in the future.
