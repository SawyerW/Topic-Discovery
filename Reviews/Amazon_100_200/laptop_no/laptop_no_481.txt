Having used a PC my whole life, trying to use this laptop was a nightmare.  If a Mac is all you've ever used, then it might be good for you.  I spent too much time just trying to figure out the simplest of things.  I finally gave up and gave it to my daughter.  She loved it.  I hated it.  My one star rating goes to all Apple products, just because they can't seem to make things easy for those who want to change operating systems.  They are also over priced and for those who want to make a social statement to their friends.
