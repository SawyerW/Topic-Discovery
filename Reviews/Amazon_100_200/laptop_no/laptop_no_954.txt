I purchase the Macbook Pro 13.3-Inch Laptop about a week ago and the experience has been great. I was a little worry at first because I don't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows. For anybody that feels like switching from windows to apple let me tell you that it took me a couple of days to get used to this operating system but now I love it. First of all, the trackpad on the Macbook Pro is easy to use and after you learn all the gestures to use the trackpad you will see that this is a great way to use you computer. The computer itself is very well built and the keyboard is great to type on for a long period of time. Lastly, bootcamp is one of the main reasons I switch to Macbook Pro because you can run window 7 or any windows operating system you want on your Macbook Pro.
