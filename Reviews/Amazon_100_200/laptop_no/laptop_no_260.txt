I got this laptop as a Christmas/graduation present from my parents. Overall, I'm so pleased. The battery life is amazing, the display is awesome, and the fact that it already came with Windows 7 was really convenient. And it's so lightweight! As a web design major, I carry this thing around everywhere. My previous Dell brickbook nearly dislocated my shoulders. I'd recommend maybe getting a different color if you're worried about fingerprints, though, as they're quite noticeable. The only negative thing I have is the touch pad gestures. I thought that the "pinch" zoom in/zoom out features would be really handy but while browsing the web it would often zoom in and out on me without me doing much. But I just disabled that feature and it's great otherwise. :) It's a great buy, I'd recommend it to anyone.
