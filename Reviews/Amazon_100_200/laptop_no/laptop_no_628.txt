I can tell you right now, this computer is poorly designed and poorly serviced. My laptop has already been back to Samsung THREE TIMES!! The space bar has never worked right! I type with my hands in an upright position and usually only tap the outside edges of the space bar. If you do not hit the space bar within 1 inch of exact center, IT DOESN'T WORK!The first time I sent my Laptop back it was due to HD failure.The second time was because the DVD drive was grinding and failingThis time my Video card went out..SAMSUNG'S RESPONSE: Samsung would like to provide you with an exchange offer of Model: NP700Z5C-S02US.Based on the features and specifications of your original unit Samsung feels that this is the most comparable unit based on our inventory.THIS IS A DOWNGRADE!!!I offered to pay the difference to let me upgrade to a newer version. Their answer was: NO how about a refund??The worst part is.. I wanted to love this computer, it was my first laptop purchase in years.If you care at all about your sanity, do everything you can to avoid buying this computer and supporting this company.
