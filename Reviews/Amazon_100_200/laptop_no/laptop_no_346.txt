The Macbook is an amazing laptop. For about $200 more, you can get the MacBook Pro, but with less hard drive space. To make this under $1000, they had to use plastic, but to make up for that, I think they made up for it in hard drive space. The metal makes the laptop very sturdy, but even though this one is plastic, you will find that this laptop is also sturdy thanks to the unibody construction.The display is gorgeous thanks to the new led backlight. Although the display is much warmer than the last version, I find most people will like it, and the nvidia graphics is more than enough for web-browsing and word/pages whatever you use. Gaming is not recommended on the MacBook as it usually makes the laptop hot to the touch around the "qwer and asdf" keys. One gripe about the graphics is that when it is unplugged, the performance is noticably reduced and there is no setting for it that i have found in system preferences.Overall, it is a great product.
