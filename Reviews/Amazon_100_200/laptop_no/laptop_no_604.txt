Issues with the touchpad freezing which I cannot resolve anymore with reboot. Now I have to use an external mouse which means I can't use as meant to be. Makes it difficult to work at client sites where there is limited counterspace and I have to remember to bring the mouse and attach. Keys on the keyboard have worn off and I have had the keyboard replaced three times!  The finish on the keys should not wear off after just a month and a half.  I have had for a year and even tho HP has replaced the keyboard THREE times, it took an hour to have an HP tech understand that the keys' finish was wearing off (she kept insisting I had to bring the unit in and let tech's do diagnostics!).  They have extended the warranty for me for a year.  I use this laptop for work and love that it's lightweight, nice size screen and speed but it is the worst laptop I've ever had!
