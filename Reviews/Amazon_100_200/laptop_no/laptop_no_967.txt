Where to start, well the 13" MacBook Pro is just the right size for what I wanted, the keyboard is backlight (which is a big issue for me), the trackpad is awesome, and the overall functions are very nice.  I like the brightness and adjustments.  The little features are very well done.For a new Mac user, I can say there are some things that definitely take some getting used to.  I am still learning what all this little power PC can do, but I will say I like it.Core I78GB Ram750GB HDD13"OSX 10.8I have been able to make some really nice movies on this PC.  To see a sample of what I have been able to create with this Apple MacBook Pro check out on Youtube.com - Keishidojo (Bjj/MMA commercial, Jiu-Jitsu Fight Team, Reece, and the Youth Grappling Team) videos.  Also the OSX is well laid out to make things simple to share online and make these type of things easier.I would certainly buy this laptop again.
