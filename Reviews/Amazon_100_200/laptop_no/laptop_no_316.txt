The Dell Studio was provided to me by Dell Tech Support as a replacement computer, for another Dell Studio.  The original Dell Studio continuously overheated and the left side plastic hinge and monitor frame broke.  Unfortunately, the new one didn't overheat, but the left side hinge and frame broke again.  The first and second time, the computer was covered under an extended warranty.  However, it broke for a third time now, and it's off warranty.  My wife and I have been careful and conscientious with this computer, and it keeps breaking.Now, there's also a power issue with the laptop - you can only use it after putting it in sleep mode.  If you do a total shutdown or a restart, you have to reboot it a half dozen times to get a video display.NEVER AGAIN.  DO NOT BUY A STUDIO 1555.
