This was my first laptop and i love it! There is nothing wrong with apple products. Its reliable and always works. If there was one thing i wanted to change, it would be to get a little bigger hard drive(but i take a lot of pictures). Yes apple is a little more than some other laptop out there but with this you get the safety from viruses and other bugs. And these days when we have basically our whole life on a laptop, and if something bad were to happen and it went all away, you would be lost. Thats why i chose this and i have no doughs about it! Also the battery life is AMAZING!
