I bought this laptop of May 2010 4 months ago, i heard lots of good things about mac laptop , i agree it is defferent from other laptops it is durable and very easy to used,but one thing it says the battery will long last up to 7hours, mac was lying about the battery , i was a bit dis-appointed because the battery long last only 1 to 2 hours, then i have to charged again with this prise they should  have a better quality of battery its not 7 hours it is only 1 to 2 hours fully charged it is disappointing, so i give only 3 stars for this, i bought a laptop for my nephew and it is ASUS brand the battery long last to 9 to 10 is what exactly it says in thier advertisement, i don't think i will buy mac again if the battery will be a big problems, the prize is too expensive and the extended warranty is expensive too, it would be perfect if the battery is not a problems.
