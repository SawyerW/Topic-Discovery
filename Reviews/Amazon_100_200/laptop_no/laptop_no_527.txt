I am in my late 40's, therefore I am no computer expert, just a very satisfied customer.  I also own a MacBook Pro 15in for home and an IPad.This MacBook Air has made my IPad totally redundant.  With a little imagination and savvy, one can just use the Air as one uses the bigger laptops. I just put my GOPRO camera or digital camera in one USB port then after move it through the computer to a large external hard drive and therefore it does not eat at the internal hard drive.On planes, it is compact enough to use and can be powered through the aircrafts seat power supply. The screen is fine for Kindle books. It is lighter than the IPad with an after market case on it.My honeymoon period has lasted 3 weeks so far and I still cannot fault it.
