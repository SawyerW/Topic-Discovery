I got one of these around thanksgiving from Best Buy, and I was not disappointed.  The only true drawbacks I've had are the off-center touchpad and finding a case for it that isn't overly expensive (I'm very picky), not that you're going to really NEED one anyway.  This is a big laptop, meant more to be a desktop replacement than the type of grab and go size you may be accustomed to, and is definitely not a "stuff in your purse" netbook.  The graphics card isn't up to par with current games, but that's not what I was looking for.  The screen is huge by laptop standards, great for multi-taskers, students, or artists who need or like to have multiple windows up at once or just like a lot of space, and is good for movies.  Sound's pretty good too, and if you're big into the arts or downloading a lot of movies or music, you can't argue with a 500 GB hard drive to start.
