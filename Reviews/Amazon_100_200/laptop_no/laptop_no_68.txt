This seller was very dishonest from the begging. I was sent USPS tracking number, and when I went to track the shipment it showed only electronic intent to ship. I contacted the seller via Amazon repeatdly to clarify why USPS shows intent only, and repeatdly, I was told it will arrive on the date. The seller even told me not to worry my item is scheduled to arrive on 3/25/11. On the 25, I get an e-mail informing me he was not able to get the computer and is willing to send me another computer. I waited for a month and till the end I was give false information knowingly.
