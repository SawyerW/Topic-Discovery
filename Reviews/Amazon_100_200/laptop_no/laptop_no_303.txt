We've always bought expensive computers and was weary about buying something so cheap.  But this thing is awesome! It is replacing a 6 year old Toshiba Lap top that was $1,800 and after this, I'll never pay those prices again.  It's used for basics, Itunes, surfing, photo's, a few letters.  It is soooo much faster, the speakers are really good, lots of memory.  I like how you can touch the sensor and swipe your fingers to make the screen bigger or smaller, and charge the iphone while the computer is in sleep mode.  It's quick to start up or shut down, and key board is pretty nice.  I'm more than made up with this computer.
