When I purchased this laptop I was thinking about the price, I just had 400$ to invest, definitely it's a good choice for the low price, no overheating, good performance, 64 bits windows, Norton internet security 60 days free, practical to work, just one detail: no webcam...But it's just that, a detail, no big deal if you're looking for a laptop with excellent performance to work, even if you use graphics software like Corel and photoshop, another possitive point is its big display of 15.6 inches with an excellent graphic interface, ATI radeon 4250 HD will give you an unique experience..If you're looking for good performance to your job or university at a low price, this is the right choice...
