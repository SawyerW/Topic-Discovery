Inspite of being soooo good and attractive in its looks, this laptop failed when it comes to hardware... I ordered one and that had a malfunctioning trackpad... When connected to an HDTV through HDMI, the trackpad went crazy... I sent that back and ordered for a replacement and that the same prob  and some more.. The spacebar was not correctly responsive... The bluetooth never worked properly... I felt soooo pissed and returned the item.. I have a netbook of acer that has been performing really well over the past two years and after buying this laptop, I ve lost respect for ACER.. I guess the entire electronic industry is now more of managers and less of engineers... that is y u get attractive products but not performing ones for a good price...ON THE WHOLEACER S3 tried to make it early and will prob leave earlier than expected...BAD HARDWARE INTERFACE...
