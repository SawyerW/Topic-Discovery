I use this laptop for school purposes and also for gaming. It probably couldn't run Crysis 3 on even low settings, but for less demanding games and such it does great. I've played Amnesia and Portal 2 on this, and it looked fine. The laptop is also pretty quiet (as in the fan isn't that loud). There weren't any major problems with performance in that area. The main problem with this laptop (and the reason why I gave it a lower review) is because of it's build quality. The externals are 100% plastic. the back of the screen is not metal at all, just textured plastic in which the paint chips fairly easily. I've never dropped this laptop before, but there are still several cracks on it. The screen also gets really wobbly after a while. The usb ports also seem loose. This laptop would have been awesome if it weren't made out of a thin, flimsy plastic.
