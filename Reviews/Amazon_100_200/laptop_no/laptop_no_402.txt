My father bought this laptop for its exceptional price-to-features ratio.  One of the reasons he purchased this is because it has both an integrated MIC and WebCam so that we might Skype together.  Unfortunately, these features, though physically there, they DO NOT WORK.After some time researching this, apparently, no one else finds these features to work either.  And further, there is no real documentation to indicate why.I would NOT recommend this laptop on principle as I believe this to be a bait-n-switch tactic, where Acer put features on the back of the box, and hoped customers wouldn't notice the difference.  :-/Pay a little more for a different machine, and get what you pay for.
