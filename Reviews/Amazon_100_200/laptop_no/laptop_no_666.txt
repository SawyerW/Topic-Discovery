Actually..  The computer was a dud!  But the company was great to deal with.  They shipped same day and sent the package overnight because I was leaving the country and needed it with me.  That was amazing! Then, it wasn't their fault that the computer was having problems and would reboot constantly and display windows error messages and try to reboot in safe mode and I hardly had any software on it at all.  I had my IT department walk through technical issues with ASUS and when the problems could not be resolved,  Adorama sent me the UPS labels and issued a full credit to my card!  Computer = bad..  Adorama = GREAT!
