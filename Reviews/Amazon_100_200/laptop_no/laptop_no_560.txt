Don't even think about buying this laptop. My largest complaint is that the wireless connection device in it is horrible and cannot establish a decent connection for more than 10 minutes; you have to stop whatever you are doing to fix it every time it is disabled. This is not a router problem. All the other wireless devices in my home connect just fine. Another problem is that the keyboard is horrible. I am a fast typist (around 90+wpm) and I have had to stop to correct the letters that were not registered at least 15 times thus far in this paragraph. I am an English student, so I have to type a lot of notes and papers for classes.  I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for around $550, but this is something I would have payed about $200 for. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP; IT ISN'T WORTH IT.
