I don't have any technical pearls to share.I can provide a review from a layman's viewpoint. This is my first apple laptop. I currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio. I have not used my IPAD  since my mac purchase. The mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina display, not in the least The mac pro works just fine. My main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies. Once I complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales. Along with email and playing angry birds.The OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.
