This is my third macbook, and I've never been disappointed. It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS.Integration between the OS and the machine is excellent, the gestures supported by the trackpad are really useful, the trackpad itself is beautiful to use, and I can't think of a better machine to do my work everyday and also enjoy my free time and do personal projects.The only issue that comes to my mind is this: the two USB ports are too close to each other, I've some old pen drives that are bulky and I can't plug two of them at the same time.
