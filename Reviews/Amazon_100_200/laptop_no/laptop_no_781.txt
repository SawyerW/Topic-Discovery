Bought this laptop for my wife. She switched from Windows 8.1 to Mavericks. There was a bit of a learning curve, which is to be expected, but she took right to her Mac. I'm not a huge fan of the "everything proprietary" approach: it makes the Mac hard to compare to anything else - but she loves it and Apple's pre-installed suite of software (which now includes Works). She also loves the fact that her iPhone and her Mac sync automatically via iCloud.Two possible improvements:a) on our home-brewed battery rundown test, the Macbook 11-inch ran out of juice 5.3 hours into running an .mkv video on a loop, using the VLC Media player. I'm told Quicktime might do better, but Quicktime is not a great player.  This much less than the advertised battery life. In normal browsing and word-processing, the battery life increases to nearly 9 hours. But many of us watch videos on those cross-country flights and 5.3 hours is cutting it close.b) How about a touch screen? That would make it even more like an iPhone.
