I'll have to admit I was leery of purchasing a refurbished laptop on line but is destined to live in my vacation home in Mexico so it's not being used every day. The computer arrived on my door step right on time. It worked right out of the box! It looks almost new. And XP is easier for casual users than Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8! And the price is/was right! I'll be happy if this computer lives for two years. I'll be back to buy another one. Individuals who say that they can't afford a personal computer should check this out.
