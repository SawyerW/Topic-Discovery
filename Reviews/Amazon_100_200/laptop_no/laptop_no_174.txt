I always regarded myself as a PC person, never giving serious consideration to purchasing a Mac because I thought the computers were not as powerful and because I thought they lacked the software I normally used on a PC.  Boy, was I wrong!I purchased the MacBook Pro 13.3" because I needed it to develop iPhone applications and it has exceeded my expectations in all areas: ease of use, speed, battery life, and screen clarity (photos on the screen look absolutely amazing!).  As with other Apple products, like the iPhone or iPod touch, it is well-built and beautifully designed.  All the software I use on a PC is now available on Macs and I have yet to experience any bugs or crashes; everything just works.Sure, Macs are definitely more expensive than your average, comparable PC, but for such a good product, I don't mind paying a little more.
