This computer was purchased to replace a newer machine the had failed and has been a fine replacement. After adding the battery that the seller said was missing I have been very pleased with the performance of it. Though it is a used machine, it was in nearly new condition and has worked well, even accepting a 2GB memory upgrade from the failed machine it replaced. with that addition it has been able to run Windows 7 without fault. This is how a purchase should be, honest and easy. If this seller has another machine offered, buy it, you can't go wrong.
