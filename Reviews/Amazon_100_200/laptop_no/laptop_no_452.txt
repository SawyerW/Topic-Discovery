After nearly 4 years of great experiences with Amazon the streak has come to an end.Not sure about you but when I purchase something that is in "like new" condition I expect to only find small blemishes and scratches...NOT A HUGE DENT THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE SIDE OF THE COMPUTER AND SO DEEP THAT IT DEEPLY DEFORMS BOTH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BOTTOM AND THE UPSIDE OF THE TOP OF THE KEYBOARD SECTION OF THE LAPTOP.I hope to write a follow up review of how well the return process went...and the wonderful customer service I am going to receive :0)Of course, in the mean time my credit limit is still locked up until they process the review...so I can't re-order one until they confirm the return...URGH!!!Either way--- you'll hear about it!  I give credit and criticism where its due.  Hope this ends well...it sure hasn't begun that way.Rob -Western Chicagoland Area and Amazon Prime Member since '07
