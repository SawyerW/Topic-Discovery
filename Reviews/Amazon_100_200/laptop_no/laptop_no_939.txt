Very pleased.  It took me a bit at first to get used to the OS, having been a PC user all of my computing life, but I simply love it!  I wish I had made the jump years ago.  You do end up paying premium for the Apple name but I am more than satisfied and confident in what so far seems like a more stable system than my former PC's.  I am not a student any longer and do not anticipate the need for MS Word or Office, but am glad to see I could get them if I wanted to.
