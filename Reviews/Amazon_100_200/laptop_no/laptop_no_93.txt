Not one of my best spends. The item is so slow, I can drive from Virginia to New York and back before it logs online. I was told via email by the seller it's only for loving online, well good luck to me. I can't even get the iTunes to run properly, when I hook up my iPad " forget about it,"  so now I can't do school/work documents.I literally have a white elephant sitting on my desk, so I have to go purchase a real working laptop. I know it was an older computer, but wasn't really aware because I'm not much of a computer geek, I'm just fourty-something year old female, trying to complete an unfinished degree. So I thought I could have a use computer to get me through my online classes, & my for my p/t retail merchandising job projects. I see I was duped.Well never will I recommend this seller, use this seller & hope they never gets anything sold again.Frustratingly,Stacey McKay
