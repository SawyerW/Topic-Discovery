If you're buying used or refurbished on Amazon, make sure that you check the description of the used item itself. Don't go by the description on the main item page as the actual item can vary. This laptop came with a number of options which you can see in this PDF on HP's site: http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/13061_na/13061_na.pdf . Make sure you know what you're buying. I got mine from Kucotech for $150. It was in near perfect condition, everything on it works, even the battery lasts for 2-3 hours. It has the t9600 2.8ghz CPU, 4gb of ram, and the 320gb HDD vs the p8700 and 250gb HDD listed.  Also the screen is the upgraded 1440x900. Make sure you know what you're buying! I got a great deal on a great laptop. Couldn't ask for more for the money.
