I have had my MacBook Pro for almost a month and I am very happy and satisfied with it. Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure. I have had the best experience ever with importing and editing videos and pictures. Email and Internet browsing is a breeze. Don't get me wrong, not everything is perfect. Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an application crash within the first month, but I did. However, the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen.I highly recommend the MacBook Pro to anyone who wants a product that is stable, intuitive, easy and fun!
