I just want to address the people who keep bashing this computer and sony products.  I have this same computer but in Red since october 2009.  I absolutely love this computer and it has never given me problems.  There is one trick i've realized with sony computers.  You must use VAIO care which comes with the computer.  It finds and fixes issues with the computer and prompts updates.  You only have to use it when it automatically appears on ur screen.  I've found that if I ignore it...the computer starts to act up.  If i go ahead and start the VAIO care all the issues go away.  I compare it to a whining child who will bother you until they get what they want.  I hope this helps anyone who isn't pleased with their sony.  VAIO care does wonders.
