I normaly don't do reviews but for this item i must. I read all the reviews for the Dell and on the advise of the computor Geek that services the computers at work boughr one. I have none of the issues mentioned in the bad reviews, it runs cool, so quiet you foget its on, fast, and with several items up at the same time the ram is only running 35% and the unit still runs lightnig fast. I use my laptop as if it was a tower, I use a wireless mouse & key pad and a 23" monitor, the laptop sits closed in the corner of my desk, if I could find a way to start it without opening the lid I would probably never open it. If your looking for a compact power house and don't need a large screen or the 10 key option, this would be a good choice. I would recomend this to a friend.
