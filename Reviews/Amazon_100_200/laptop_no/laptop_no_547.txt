10 years ago, I bought a 12" powerbook.  It was an amazing laptop.  Small, powerful, the perfect travel companion.  I used it as a road warrior for years.  The full sized screen and reasonable battery life were ideal.  I later replaced it with a 13" black macbook.  I liked it, but it wasn't the portable wonder that the old powerbook had been.  I've tried netbooks, bigger laptops, an ipad, etc, and they all work well, but still left a little something to be desired.  Enter the 2010 Macbook Air 11".  Wow.  It's everything my old powerbook was, but better.  Better screen, better keyboard, better battery life, and fast.  It's not a replacement for a video render farm, you wouldn't want to run the latest game or lots of virtual systems on it, but for my needs, it's brilliant.
