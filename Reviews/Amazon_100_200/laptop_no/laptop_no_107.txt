This is my second VAIO laptop.  (I am still not quite ready to retire my tinier -- but heavier -- VGN-T250, which I really loved.)  I cannot say enough good things about this machine.  The screen is gorgeous.  The sound is really amazing from the speakers.  The webcam is a little tough to find but works very readily.  The fingerprint reader takes some getting used to (take the tutorial!) but what a great security measure.  And as for the machine itself, it is INCREDIBLY fast, and has one of the most comfortable keypads and most sensitive mouse pads I've ever used.  Did I mention how very light the laptop is, how elegantly thin the screen is, and how sensible Sony's power offerings (stamina or speed) are?  You do burn fast through the battery on "speed" setting but overall battery life is good even then, better than 2 hours.  I may pick up an extra battery in future just to have some extra juice when an outlet is far away, of course.  Anyway, I think this is a wonderful laptop for the road and frankly would be in the running for me as a desktop replacement.
