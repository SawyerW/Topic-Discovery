Mac computers are the greatest! It's awesome knowing that I can sit down and do my homework online with no popups, no virus, and no distractions. I have had my computer for about four years now and never have had any problems with it. I loved it so much that I decided to get a Mac Book Pro, which is a laptop. Again, no popups or any type of distractions when I'm really trying to focus on line. My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere. The battery life is amazing. I feel like I can be on it all day long without it being plugged into an outlet. It has a perfect size screen and many different USB plug ins so I can always have my phone charging or a hard drive plugged in. It allows me to download any apps that I might need for school or just to have for my personal life. I would recommend a Mac to anyone that is looking for a laptop.
