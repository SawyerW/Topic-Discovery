It arrived quickly and you can use it to surf the web and download pictures and such but, the description lead me to believe that i could watch movies and burn dvd's along with cd's and so far i haven't been able to do any of that which was a big part of wanting a laptop in the first place. I suppose i should have spent the extra $100 or so and got a better newer laptop, i just heard bad things about windows 8 and wanted an older version laptop. I'm not a computer wiz but i thought i could trust the description.
