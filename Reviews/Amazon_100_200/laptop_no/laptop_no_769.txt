I have never written a review on Amazon and I have spent over $20,000 on this site. I must say that this computer has blown away my expectations. It is completely sealed just like any SSD shell would be. It doesn't get hot, it doesn't freeze up, and it doesn't require or even prompt for anti virus software. It is fast and very responsive. I have been an Aircraft Mechanic for the DoD for the past ten years working with aluminum structures. This MacBook Air is very well build. Aircraft grade but I cannot see any rivets. I will never buy a PC again. I have talked down about Macs for years until I got this one in my hands. When you first get this and run the battery down for a full discharge it will exhaust you. Even at 13% it gives 2.5 hours of battery life left. When I charged it fully it showed 14 hours till death but it levels out and is accurate pretty fast. I highly recommend.
