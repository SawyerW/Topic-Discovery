After my last review and the motherboard got replaced for the 3rd time it has gotten worse. Once again I had to go through all my settings and reinstall all the programs that I lost. Along with this is iTunes and setting up all my play lists. This takes a lot of my time and Dell just doesn't get this. I just called back because the last tech messed up the built in microphone and bluetooth. So they want to reinstall the OS to try and fix this. They ask if I have important files on my computer. Why should I have files on my computer? This is crazy. They don't care a lick for your time and effort you put into the junk that they sell you. The support might as well not be there. He warned me that my warranty will expire by January. I don't expect this piece of junk to last that long and don't care. I'm going back to Sony. Never should have left in the first place.
