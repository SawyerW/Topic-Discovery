I've had this laptop or one close to it (mine has 2G memory) for 1.5 yrs now.  This was my first laptop and my first experience with Vista...got a bit frustrated with all the security measures in Vista and almost corrupted the OS trying to get my stuff setup...would recommend shutting most of the Windows security stuff off before installing your own progs.During the first few boots...it tended to overheat...to the point of having a strong burnt electronics smell...after which I downloaded a prog to monitor the processor and drive temps...and its been OK since.Managed to corrupt the OS finally when using a prog that monitored changes for backup purposes, but which did not uninstall correctly.  Surprisingly...the OEM recommended backup disks I made reinstalled the OS as it was originally and I got it back up again using my manual data backups.Actually this laptop has done fine....EXCEPT for the overheating issue....which has not reoccurred...and the intrusive Vista security crapola...and I would STRONGLY recommend making the backup disks for both the OS and the drivers as soon as you have it up and running.  Battery only lasted 1 year though.
