As you can see from the title, I also use PC. My desktop is a PC and the macbook pro is just something I picked up.This laptop is an absolute beauty. The Mac OS is surprisingly fun. Windows allows more "tweaking" but the Mac was just plain fun to use.The display's resolution isn't the best. However......... Actually, I'm not going into ANY details on the pros as you can probably see from all the other reviews.***************************I want to mention a few cosmetic caveats:The aluminum: VERY beautiful but also VERY prone to damage. Try not to get too much sweat on the aluminum, as it will cause these black specks to appear that cannot be erased. I recommend getting a palmguard as well as an outer case/ skin.Keyboard: the material of the keycaps WILL wear out. I know a lot about keyboards and this type of material will definitely gloss up/ wear out. I recommend a keyboard skin.Besides these 2 caveats, I still give this a 5/5. Very nice.Oh right... honestly, comparing PC to APPLE, the price is a little steep. Everyone knows that Apple charges more because it produces it's own thing. However, it's still a great machine.
