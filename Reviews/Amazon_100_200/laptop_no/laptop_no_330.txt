It must have been dropped because a peice of the outer casing is broken off on the corner. The DVD drive does not play DVD's, only CD's, but this may have something to do with the original video card that can't be updated. Taking it in to have it upgraded would probably cost as much as I paid for this. Have to touch the mouse pad with a delicate touch or the cursor barely moves. I bought this for my daughter because it has the software used by her school which benefits her to get homework and online assignments done. The graphics is the only dissapointment because she has to use my pc to get somethings done.
