Agree that the T61p has many positive attributes as far as build quality and performance but the LCD screens on Thinkpads any more are just horrible. Just check some of the Thinkpad forums and you will see all the complaints about narrow viewing angles, terrible contrast, light bleeding on the top and bottom, and washed out colors. This is the one weak link on the Thinkpads since Lenovo took over from IBM is the cheap LCD screens. I was more then a little surprised when I received my T61p to see how much worse the screen was compared to my prior Thinkpads. I have decided after all these years using Thinkpads to look elsewhere for my next laptop.
