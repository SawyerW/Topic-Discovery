I have owned this MacBook Air since the day it had came out and to my surprise....it was just not powerful enough! Simple tasks such as copying files to the SSD would take 15 minutes on a 10gb file. That is clearly unacceptable. It does have great battery life though and an okay screen. It looks elegant and sleek. I just wish it would push my files and around faster. I think I am going to just stick with my Samsung Series 9 15 inch ultrabook because that is VERY fast compared to this. The Samsung with a 1.9ghz i7 compared to Apple's 1.7ghz i7 for some reason is so much faster. I would not really recommend this unless you are an extremely basic user. Well back to Apple it goes =/
