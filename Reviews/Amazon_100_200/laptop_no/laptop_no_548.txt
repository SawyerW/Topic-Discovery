This laptop is the best one in its class. Its processor is fine for the price. The ram is very fast(should be upgraded to 4 or more gigabytes to give this laptop its full potential) the hard drive is fast, but without a fast processor it is somewhat slow. the graphics card is wonderful, it actually can play WoW and many other games without lagging. The wifi card is fast as well(thank god for n wireless).The battery can get 3 hours on serious usage, and about 4:15 on very low usage with the brightness all the way down.This laptop is the best of the cheap. If you need a computer for word processing, mail, Internet browsing, and the occasional game, the price is right for a great laptop.
