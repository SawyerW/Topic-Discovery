I am not a computer expert. Just someone who uses a laptop to work and have fun.I work with an HP and with this VAIO, that was supposed to be a "home laptop".It works "fine"...but Sony is not good designing laptops at all. Things that shouldbe very well known for any laptop designer, like the touchpad annoing interference when you type wore left insecond place... in an hp you can find very quick ways to disable it, for instance, but in vaio youhave to find through google..than find it in your computer.... but if you need to open an veryheavy and bad designed picture browser, you find it right on a button.... Ok it`s just one example...but thereare many others....little details (in mine, when i hibernate it, when it restarts it came back like if it have crashed...Sony online team just asked me install a new service pack.....and it kept not working...Looks like they gave the design task to a designer who never really worked with a good laptop...Sorry about that...if you find it to be very, very cheap. Go arread. It`s better than nothing...butotherwise, go to a lenovo or an hp...Regards,Pedro
