I switched to Mac in August 2008. I bought the Black 13.3" MacBook and used it everyday for almost a year. When Apple changed their MacBook Pro lineup in June this year, I waited about a month until I could read the reviews and visit the Apple store several times. I wanted to upgrade because of the aluminum Unibody design, the SD card slot and the long battery life. I also found that the display on these newer one were so much better. I sold my Black MacBook for a nice price and decided to go with the 15" model here on Amazon. I've had it for about  three months now and I still marvel at the simple elegant design. It is a pleasure to use everyday. The start up time is quick, the display and keyboard still look brand new. I don't have a desk top computer anymore so this MacBook Pro has to do it all, My one complaint would be the mini dvi port, It's not the same as my 13.3" one so I have to buy a new adapter. I'm holding off because I am seriously considering getting an Apple display to complement this laptop.
