I am quite disappointed that the LCD screen has a yellow hue to it.I have two older Thinkpads (T42p) that are dim but the whites are white, not yellowish.Reading on Google, it appears that some T400 PC's have this problem. Apparently some T400's have a LED backlight and others have CCFL backlight. LED backlight is good white and CCFL backlight has the yellow hue. See this video for comparison.[...]I have tried the color calibration without success.Unless other problems crop up, I plan to keep this unit, but I am not happy about the yellow hue. Fortunately I usually use the laptop with an external Monitor which looks OK.Update 5-26-2013I upgraded the review to 3 stars. After a while you do get used to the yellow hue.
