I bought this to replace my dell home laptop that I had for 4 years. I've had this computer for 18 months now. It worked great for the first few months but as the clock struck 12 months and the warranty expired, I've had hardware failures right and left.-->1st  A/C adapter (transformer part) totally died for no reason,  (This actually happened within 6 months of purchase)-->2ne  battery release button broke off,-->3rd  d/c jack shorted out (that's inside your laptop where you plug your power cord into your laptop),-->4th  and the D/C Jack started to effect the mother board.So, if you want a cheap laptop that's nice for 12 months - this is fine.  But after that, watch out, the poor components don't last at all.If you want a workhorse, I'd suggest another manufacturer. Think I'll be switching back to a Dell or possibly trying a Mac Book Pro. I can't stand adding to the landfill will the hp.  This was our first HP and I won't be wasting my money a second time.(oh and I had to write this review from my Dell worklaptop because my HP won't start. This Dell is 6 years old and going strong.)
