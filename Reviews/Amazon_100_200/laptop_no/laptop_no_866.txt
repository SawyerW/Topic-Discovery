I was dissapointed by Amazon. The Apple Mac Book did not work from the very first time. I took it to the Apple Store where I was informed that some components of the mac book (the memory) were not part of the computer. Even though the cover of the computer said it was a 2012 model, I was told by the Apple Service that the computer was 2008. The computer's cover was exchanged and taken from a 2012 mac book for that purpose. I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty. Should I still consider buying through Amazon? I wish this review is useful for future Mac products buyers.
