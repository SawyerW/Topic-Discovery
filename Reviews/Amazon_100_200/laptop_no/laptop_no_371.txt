Received my computer on time.  I did have to go to the UPS Shipping and pick it up because it was delivered when I was not home and Amazon needed a signature for it.  I still received it the same day it was delivered.  Just had to call UPS and they called me back when the driver returned to the shipping center.  Packaged very well, in three different boxes.  Opened it up and was up and running in about a half hour.  I did have a little problem installing the Adobe Flash player but after installing the new apps and restart the computer it work just fine.  I have worked on one at work so I have a little help.  Apple is different then a PC, but I think I am going to like this.  I am only giving this a 4 star because I have only had it one day.
