I purchased a Toshiba laptop model LD55 and 1 month later, the keyboard stopped working.  I had to send it in for repairs at Toshiba depot.  4 months after this, the hard disk crashed and the Toshiba repair depot has been holding my laptop without repair because they have a delay in arrival of parts ordered.  I have asked for a refund or replacement with an equivalent computer but all I got after several phone calls, writing Toshiba and loosing approximately 14hrs talking to Toshiba customer reps was an offer of a reconditioned laptop with a 90 day warranty.  I would accept this if the warranty was extended considering the problems I had experienced with the new laptop.  Now I am told again that my laptop part will be late for another 1 month in addition to the 2 months already gone.  I don't know what to do.  Toshiba has got to be the worst laptop company out there.  They are living on past glory.  I will never touch any of their products again!
