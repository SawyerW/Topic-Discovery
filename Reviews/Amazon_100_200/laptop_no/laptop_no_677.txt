I bought this SAMSUNG in July '12 to replace a 16" SONY VAIO from late 2008 so it is definitely thinner and lighter than what I had before.I like the fact that it has an 8 cell battery but I wish it were removable.It has a fan but it doesn't always run and it is quite quiet when it does. You can activate silent mode and force the fan off if it really bothers you.Excellent build quality.It comes with some extra programs but they are useful and for system management so I wouldn't say it has a lot of bloatware.Start-up time is VERY quick. "ExpressCache" and the hybrid 8GB of RAM seem to be responsible for a big part of that.The Tiger Direct product photo (side view) mislabels the mini-VGA port as "mini-HDMI port". SAMSUNG provides an adapter for the mini-VGA.I think some reviews elsewhere mention problems with the track pad but I have found none.Backlit keyboard is great. Key size and spacing are perfect.I really like the matte screen.It is great to have a DVD drive in something so thin and just 4.5 pounds.
