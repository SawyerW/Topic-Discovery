So I bought the laptop after reading all these stellar reviews, and almost as soon as I turned it on, I've decidedly realized that I absolutely hate this piece of crap.- VERY SLOW!! Even as I write this, my new 4430s is constantly freezing up.- Keypad: It feels abrasive to the touch, and the bumps on F and J are are way too prominent. The keys are tiny so it's awkward when you're trying to type quickly. The up and down arrows are TINY and tight packed, which means you're going to be constantly pressing on the wrong key. And the end button is above the pg up button. Um... which genius thought that this was a good idea?- Volume control: you have to hold down fn and hit another key on the top to lower/raise volume. And these keys are not very sensitive, so you really have to press down the entire time. And it takes forever to lower / raise the volume!- Touchpad: It doesn't have the scrolling function. The cursor spazzes ALL THE TIME. The clickers are borderline unresponsive.
