I finally switched to a Mac Book and I'm loving it. I previously owned a HP 9500 model, which crapped out on me recently. It was not under warranty anymore even though there were articles and complaints about the graphics card. Back to the Mac, it's fast, plays well with games with high end graphics such as The Sims 3. The 13.3 inch screen does not feel small at all. It's just right. The Mac Book Pro is simple to use and it's easy to learn all the functions and shortcuts. Also if you service on it, there's an Apple Store willing to help you unlike other laptop brands.
