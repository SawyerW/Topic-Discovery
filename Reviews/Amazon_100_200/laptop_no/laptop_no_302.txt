I have had mine for 4 years and the warranty just expired in those years I had 9 hard drive failures the mother board had to be replaced the cooling system replaces twice the cd  rom replaced and the biometric reader replaced twice. It had never been dropped  and sat on my bed on a laptop table. it has been a nightmare I have had two other dells that I loved a inspiron 1501 and dell inspiron 1520 so I was happy to purchase another from dell but from now on i plan to purchase older laptops that were before dell started making there laptops so light and cheap.
