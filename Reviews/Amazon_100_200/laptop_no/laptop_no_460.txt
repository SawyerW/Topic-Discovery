I bought this computer to replace my 3 years old Dell, I am really happy with it and with the way it works. Changing from a PC to a Mac was a bit of a concern for me but the way it works is really intuitive, I have been using iTunes in my PC for years and using the Mac finder is pretty much the same.A friend of mine decided to start building apps for the App Store and he is using my Mac to do all the programming, I have not had one problem because of this and he is so happy that he is programming in a Laptop, he can't believe how reliable it is.I deeply recommend this product, is one of the best investments I have made in years.
