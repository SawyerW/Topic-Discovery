This laptop does everything as advertised, and well. It is like another reviewer noted a poor mans ultrabook. The battery life is about 6 hours for me on high performance, max brightness, wifi.. (everything that can drain the battery essentially..) mode. which is remarkable. There is no optical drive but that isnt much of an issue since i almost never do use CD's and a usb optical is not hard to find. The touchpad click buttons are rather noisy, and if you really look for it there is minimal keyboard flex, but for the price little things like that are expected. overall it performs extremely well and i am very pleased with this laptop..
