I order this laptop a couple weeks back and decided to do a review. When un boxing the package i noticed that i got the wrong laptop yes a much slower one to be exact its a Pentium dual same model and everything. I did not have time to ship back and wait another week for a refund to go buy another so i just deiced to keep it now let me tell you its not bad for surfing wed ect but it does lag on netflix once in a while if you have any cpu demanding things running like emulators ect. But other than that this laptop is pretty good just gonna save up to get a better one. :)
