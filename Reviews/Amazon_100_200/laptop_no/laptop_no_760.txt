I am new to Mac and don't  have a lot of experience with them other then an Ipad2.  I am learning and I really like the ease of operation but I have one major complaint.  It drops internet connection constantly.  It doesn't seem to be the network as I have two other window based pc's and an iPad that doesn't lose connection, just this Macbook Air.  Multiple calls to Apple still hasn't corrected the problem.  A quick search of google will let you know that this problem has been ongoing for some time with a multitude of user suggestions that just don't work.  It is not a stable platform if you need a constant connection.
