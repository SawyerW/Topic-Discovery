Love mine - had it two years now and it is awesome. The magnetic charging plug however is terrible. The older version I own from 2003 has an RCA jack type of charger connector into the laptop that is 5000% more dependable than this magnetic trash. I hate having to constantly watch the screen to make sure it's actually charging. I've had to clean the receptacle on the computer 100+ times (every other day) just to get the contacts to sit correctly and had to replace the connector once because it had burned /arced a few months ago. Besides that though it is nice to have such a thin portable reliable machine.
