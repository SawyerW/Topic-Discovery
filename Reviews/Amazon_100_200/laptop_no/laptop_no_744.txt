Not many purchases that I can truly say "I Love it", but this MacBook is something you can love. We had a house full of iPads, iPods and iPhones but no Macs, so this my first Mac and clearly no more Windows for me. So easy to learn and use but here are some of my Pros:-quite, doesn't seem to make any noise while running-cool. virtually no heat comes off the MacBook. its gets just a little warm close to the power port, but infrequently-boots in 10 seconds!-lighted keyboard, can see it clearly in dim or no lighting-fast, fast, fast, I never wait for anythingI can't really think of a Con at this time. Very glad I made the shift to a Mac.I was a little hesitant buy a computer from Amazon, I don't know why cau I've purchased dozens of other times but I guess this is consider a large purchase. But the computer arrived packaged extremely well. There was NO receipt inside the box, so say your email or go back to Amazon and print an invoice just in case if you need proof of purchase.
