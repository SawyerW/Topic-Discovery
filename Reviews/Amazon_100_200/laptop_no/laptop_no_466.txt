I recently made the transition from pc to mac, and I love it, the best part it the no nonsense that mac gives, the interface for those who do not understand how computers work is fantastic. For work i still have to use a pc occasionally and I cant believe the difference between the two, and the amount of garbage that you dont have to deal with using a mac compared to pc. I'd been pc my whole life, but after some friends persistent praise of their own mac's i went for it, and could not be more pleased with it. Runs so much better. The transition in software, setup and learing how to run mac os, alternatively to windows, takes a bit of time, but is far worth it.
