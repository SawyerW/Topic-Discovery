I am a software engineer-a big nerd. I bought this MBA directly from Apple via special order. I have the top of the line 1.7G i7, 500G SSD and 8G RAM! :) This configuration might be over kill for most consumer use but hey, I know I will regret it 6 months down the road if I  don't max it out as MBA has zero user upgrade path.The battery life is amazing, I work on it 10 hours on one charge! And it's amazingly FAST and amazingly LIGHT!!! So much computing power in such a small package! Size really doesn't matter in this case. :}As an iOS/OSX engineer, I installed the Mavericks OSX 10.9 DP3, it works small wonder! I looooooooooooooooove it!! :))))))))Even if you are not a nerd like me, get the lesser configuration, I assure you will love it as much as I do. :)
