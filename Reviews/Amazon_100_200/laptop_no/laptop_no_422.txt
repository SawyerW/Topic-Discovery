If you're thinking about buying a Dell laptop (or any laptop), this isn't the laptop you're looking for. The Dell Studio 1558 might run perfectly the first few months you own it, but it becomes a miserable experience after that.Here are just a few of the things my Studio 1558 (running Windows 7) has done in the past year or so that I've had it (and still does), just to prove my point:- The hard drive that came with the Studio crashed and had to be replaced.- The Studio constantly crashes from heat. (For a while, I had to restore my system every time this happened.)- The fan is running nonstop.- A technologically gifted friend of mine put a disk in and had to pry my computer open because the disk wouldn't eject AT ALL.- Dell Support was supposed toI've bought laptops from Dell before. In fact, my previous laptop was a Dell Studio 1721, and I loved it. But because of my experience with the Studio, I'm beginning to doubt that.
