I got this for my job as a reporter and I thought so highly of this laptop that I told all of my friends to go out and buy this thing.  I was wrong.  The motherboard crashed on me after 8 months of owning the thing.  I got the new motherboard but Dell wants to charge me 119.00 to replace the motherboard with MY new one.  You'd think that the computer would last a heck of a lot longer than 8 months but i guess not.  I will continue to use this laptop and save up for a new one.  But if this problem happens again, you can kiss this laptop down the drain.  Dell didn't think this laptop out very well.
