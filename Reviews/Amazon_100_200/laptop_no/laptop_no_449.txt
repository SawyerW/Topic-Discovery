I purchased this product from Amazon in the 20th of November, and I just had it delivered today !!!the product arrived in the estimated date that Amazon promised, in two days, but it has been shipped again to Saudi Arabia and that's why it took this long.Anyway, this product is just great, I'm loving it and it's just fast and nice,very happy with it, and very happy with the deal that Amazon is selling it for !!I recommend anyone who wants this product to buy it through Amazon, and not to be worried about any thing else.The weight and size of this Mac is just fine with me.
