I bought the baseline mac with the intention of replacing the hard drive and adding more ram. I have to say the computer wasnt too bad before the additions. Boot up time was about 35 seconds and the programs were loaded fairly quick. The only drawback is that it became a little warm but not nearly as bad as how others described it. After replacing the stock hdd with a samsung 830 ssd 256gb and 8gb corsair ram, the computer is lighting fast and the temp stays pretty cool. Im very happy with the trackpad and the solid aluminum build. I feel like it was worth the extra few bucks.
