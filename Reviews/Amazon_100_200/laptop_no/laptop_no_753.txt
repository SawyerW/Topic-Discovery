I bought my wife a MacBook Air 11" for Christmas.  Within the first week, screen has been going black. The only way to get it to "wake up" again is by doing a hard reboot. Check out the Apple forums - this appears to be a widespread issue - as I just waded through 51 pages of complaints from users. Seems Apple is telling customers just to change energy settings to avoid the problem - but that reduces power conservation, which is one of the selling features of the Air.  Be prepared for a not-so-wonderful Apple experience, which, as a long time Apple fan, is hard to admit.
