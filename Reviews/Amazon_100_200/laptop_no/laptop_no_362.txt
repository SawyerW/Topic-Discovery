After 2 months of using the Macbook Pro, I can easily confirm that it is a spectacular laptop! Unlike my adware infested PC, the Macbook Pro is lightning fast when it comes down to web browsing, and I love the iPhoto and iMovie features! The Macbook has a very solid build and a modern design, and I personally love the lighting under the keyboard, which turns out to be extremely useful when typing late at night! The webcam is HD, and perfect for Skyping and FaceTime. The speakers sound good while playing music, and the touchpad is very responsive. The only problem I had about the Macbook Pro, was the premium price, after all there are plenty of PC laptops only $500! But, I think the extra cash was definitely worth it, as Macs tend not to get as buggy as Windows laptops, and usually have a longer lifespan!  Overall very happy about my purchase and can't wait to see what the new Macbook Pro will have to offer (besides the HUGE $2,000 price tag)!
