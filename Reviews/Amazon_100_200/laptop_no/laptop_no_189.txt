I love this 15" Macbook Pro, and my only complaint is the display. For the money paid, I would expect to get something with a higher resolution. This model is 1440 x 800, which is average. I have $1200 Thinkpads that do 1680 x 1050. I will say that although the resolution is not great, the display itself has great color calibration and a sharp picture.The quality in these machines is unparalleled. Install Windows using Bootcamp, and you have an awesome machine.UPDATE:I've had this Macbook Pro for almost five years. It has worked flawlessly, and has required no maintenance. I upgraded the RAM to 8GB and installed a 256GB Solid-state drive... and just doing these things has made it perform like a much newer system. I have no desire or plans to replace it. My only draw to the new Macbook Pro is the retina display.
