Cons:For a month or so, I couldn't click on anything until after I pressed ctrl+alt+delete; I didn't have to re-start my computer but just had to kind of jumpstart it just by pressing that combination of buttonsSound is terrible; I listen to music a lot and I always need headphones to get the proper sound (bad treble, bad bass, and bad overall 'loud' factor)Doesn't come with MS Office (apart from the 60-day trial)Pros:Any time I've had a virus problem, a quick virus clean took care of it; computer speed is still the same from the time I got itFast log-on to WindowsScreen is brightOverall, this is a decent laptop.  The battery power is okay (turn off your volume and wi-fi to get better battery power) and it runs fine.  Nothing extraordinarily great or bad about this computer.
