This is the sixth Dell computer I own for work or home. I also own a couple macs and Thinkpads at work. This computer was purchased in Jan. 2008 and the mother board has been replaced three times, and the power adapter twice. None of the other computers I own have even needed service, just one Dell desktop that needed the hard drive replaced. Luckily on both I purchased the 3 year warranty (a must with Dell products). But the replacement and repair is slow and given the millions of problems experienced by other XPS 1330 owners just like or worse than mine--Dell is negligent in still marketing this product.  Please don't waste your time or money.
