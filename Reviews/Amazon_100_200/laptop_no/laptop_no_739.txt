When I got the laptop I had to contact Lenovo because it was not factory reset and I was not certain what to do. Lenovo was easy to get in touch with and I was not given any hassle to be assisted.I like many of the programs they place on the desktop that are unique to other manufacturers. I hope I find a WiMax tower to see how that function works.The description says the laptop is 750GB but was only 500GB, which is what the description shows.I love having 3 USB ports, most at this price only have 2 USB ports.This was a gift to my mother and so far she says she loves it.
