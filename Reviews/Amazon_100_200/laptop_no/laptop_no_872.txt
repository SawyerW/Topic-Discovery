never thought anyone could make something worse than a windows machine, well apple out did themselves with the crapbook pro!ive had a home computer since 1996,this apple is the first one where the power cord has shorted out and has poor wiring...its that cheaply madethe track pad has malfunctioned, never had that with gateway...eventhe keyboard also goes rougue out of nowhere, again never had that problem...one of the usb ports has also stopped working when i first got this thing the battery life was 6-8 hours...its down to 2-3 hours fully charged!I think i need to put this review on amazon.com! the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS! wish i didnt have to wait that long! YEs APPLE sucks that bad!All you people that praise apple must never be talking about the laptops! Love my iphone and I pod touch(knock on wood) or you've been seduced by the dark side of the force! ive gotta back this thing up AGAIN and take it to the galleria....i can SEE why they offer apple care, you'll need it!!!!
