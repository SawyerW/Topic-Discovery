Terrible quality design. I take good care of my things, especially my computers, and after only a few months of use the hinge on the screen broke while opening the laptop. Was impossible to open or close after that, and the whole thing always seemed flimsy and liable to break. Fortunately it was under warranty so I was able to get it fixed, although I had to pay to ship it in, which is absurd. Lenovo's faulty, cheap manufacturing caused the problem and my options are to spend $22 to ship it in or $60 to take it into a shop just to look at. I have sold my used Lenovo to be used as a child's computer, and now have switched to an Asus, a brand I highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable, well-made laptop.
