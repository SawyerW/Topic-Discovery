As its impossible to buy a new computer with windows XP this refurbished model available on amazon is where i went for a backup for my favorite OS.. i have  windows Vista and windows 8 on my other two computers and i can only say those are not improvements ,  they are essentially pointless in my opinion.. particularly windows 8..  this older refurb is fast , has wi-fi and i can find no fault with it at all ..  for 150.  its the best buy i have ever made for a laptop..  if you like windows XP and dont want to spend 500. go for it..  Im totally happy..
