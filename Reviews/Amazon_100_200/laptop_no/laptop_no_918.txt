I love apple products and was excited to get my new computer. However, once I upgraded to ML, my computer has been freezing sporadically - especially when I have multiple windows open. I've been reading online and this seems to be a common problem.  This is NOT supposed to happened. My old mac never crashed randomly. I am very disappointed. I have a few days left, and I think I'm going to return this computer. Apple needs to provide a solution asap. I don't think it's the hardware, but still. I wish I could buy this new computer but have it run SL, which was actually pretty good.
