The model I got is an older model running at 867Mz not 1.67 Gz, which is too slow and the max ram is 1 GB. I think the model advertised at 1.67GZ would have been OK. With the Ram at a slow pc133, this computer just barely gets the job done. It is too slow for YouTube. The optical drive is CDRW-DVDrom combo not a super drive. It was listed it as not fully functioning, to be repaired or used for parts, otherwise I would rate it at even less. Had to spend $12 bucks to upgrade the ram with a 525 MB stick. It now runs, but along with the 10.4 os it is limited to what it does. The screen is fair with decent contrast, it's only good point. If I had known that it was this older model, I would not have ordered it.
