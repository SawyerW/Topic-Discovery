I brought an Apple iBook G3 800mhz 256MB 30GB CDROM 12.1'' w/ Original Airport (WIFI) from East Coast Mac for a christmas gift for my niece, we received it in January.  She tried to use it but it did not work correctly.  It was slow and freezing up if she had more than 2 folders up at a time, the speakers are blown, can't connect to the internet or watch video's on it.  I returned this product in January and as of yet am still waiting for my refund.  This is so annoying, all the time, stress and e-mailing to get my refund does not seem to be paying off.  I think I will have to take them to court.Apple iBook G3 800mhz 256MB 30GB CDROM 12.1'' w/ Original Airport (WIFI)
