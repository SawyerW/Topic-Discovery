This is truly a great machine with a beautiful sturdy design. This is my first Mac. I have owned it for more than 4 months now. It doesn't feel plastic like a PC. It's also much faster and more reliable than any PC I have ever used or owned. Battery life is incredibly long too. Price is high but definitely worth it. If you don't care much about a few extra pixels with the same base specs (4gb ram, 128gb flash memory) as this base MBA that will cost you $200 dollars more on the MBP Retina late 2013, than go with this MBA. The only problem I have encountered was this one time after waking it up from sleep it gave me a black screen in which I had to force a shut down to make it restart and go back to normal again. I hope Apple fixes this problem. Other than that this MBA is perfect for a college student like me.
