I would definitely recommend this laptop for people who are looking for combination of portability and performance. It is also priced very well. I did not get it from amazon though. I got the entire package for $700 + tax from a store. Since I am a student I had office 2010 and free anti-virus from my university.The usage of Magnesium cast alloy makes this laptop sturdy and gives an excellent finish. The key board is a delight to type on. Battery back up is excellent. The speakers are not powerful, but who cares, you never need powerful speakers on a business type laptop. The performance of i3 and windows 7 is excellent compared to my old dell inspiron with vista and dual core processor. The booting time is quick and so is the shut down time. I think this is really neat laotop. I love it.
