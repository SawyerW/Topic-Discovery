We bought this computer as a laptop for the family.  Its main uses are as a computer for the kids and to connect to a 1080p television to stream internet content such as Hulu and Netflix.  We also use it as our primary computer when traveling.  For all these uses, it has been great.  It looks fantastic and has a better Vista score than my quad core desktop that is, admittedly, 18 months old.  It drives the 1080p television without a problem, has respectable battery life even while watching video and is a great value for money.  The multi-media remote control is very useful for the way we use the PC.I found that speakers could be a little louder, but this is not normally a problem.  The 12-cell battery does stick out a bit, but I found that it actually positions the keyboard at a better angle for me.All-in-all a great computer for the $600 we paid for it new.
