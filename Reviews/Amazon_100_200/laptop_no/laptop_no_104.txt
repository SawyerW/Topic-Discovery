Let me start by saying nothing against AMAZON I have been a customer for years now. And I know that this is an older mac. I just feel I was mislead in the description given. Meaning that this iBook G4 I purchased from DR Bargains has a lot more issues and I am pissed off. Luckily my boyfriend is a mac wiz and was able to get me the right updates and I had to get a new hard drive. So now I have everything I need for my school work. But I was just completely annoyed by this situation and this person had the nerve to ask me not to put any negative comments!! Well guess what its going up! And I will not be purchasing from you again!
