I say "near perfect" in my header only because I wish it had a Retina display. However, everything else is amazing! Plus, the screen isn't bad either--it's just not Retina. The battery is incredible. It's better than my iPhone's battery by far. I got the 11" 128GB version and it's seriously perfect. I'm not  pack rat so I have 100GB left still. I have some pics and some stuff for school on here. Also iWork and Xcode. At the store I thought the 11" was noticeable smaller and would take getting used to. But once you get used to it the screen doesn't feel small at all. It feels perfect. Not too big, not too small. Apple is amazing.
