Plenty fast for my needs (email, web surfing, youtube, whatever).One of the better laptops that I've owned.  GF like it better than her more expensive, "faster", ASUS.  She never was hooked on the ASUS keyboard, but really likes this one!  Same here.  I enjoy a smaller laptop.  Ya know they call the laptops for a reason.  Otherwise, they'd call'em lap crushers.  Battery life is still great, but I tend not to leave the Li Ion battery in there 100% of the time.  After it's charged, remove it (leave PC plugged in, in "sleep" mode).  Battery will remain charged for MONTHS.  If U need portability, slide batt. back in, and off you go!  Then repeat!
