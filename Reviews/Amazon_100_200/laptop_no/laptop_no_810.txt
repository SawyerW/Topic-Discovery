I moved from Windows to Mac because I did not like Windows 8.  It was such a right decision.  Mac Air is breeze to use and so light.  The touchpad is class apart and so is all other hardware.  I feel that it will last me 3 times longer than any Windows laptop without any issues.  I ordered it the day it was released and that one had wifi and volume issues and so I returned it back to Apple.  But Apple has fixed the issue with new software.  I bought this one in July 2013 at Bestbuy and no issues at all.  Wifi has never disconnected, it is super fast, and laptop is so easy to use.  Highly recommended!
