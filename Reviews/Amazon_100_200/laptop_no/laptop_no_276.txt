I purchased this laptop from Amazon in March of 2010.  After 2 years of moderate usage I am still happy with the performance.  I only use this for internet and some gaming and watching TV shows via the HDMI output.  I also rarely use it without AC power plugged in, so i can't comment on battery life.  The only thing I would note is that the fan is slightly louder thn it was when I bought it, but living in AZ I know that the dust here destroys laptops!  This laptop is advanced enough to serve my needs so I don't feel I have to replace it yet but when I do I'll probably get another ASUS.
