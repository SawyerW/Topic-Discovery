I bought this computer from amazon last year and believing that i bought a 2012 Macbook pro. Unfortunately, I damaged it yesterday and took it to a store because warranty was gone. They told me my Macbook parts are from 2010. So as a warning buy it from the store because I just got scammed and I dont mind that I damaged my own macbook pro but whats unfair is I paid full price for a 2010 macbook pro. I'm waitin for my computer to get repaired and unfortunately Toomuch time has passed so I can't get atleast part of my intial money back.
