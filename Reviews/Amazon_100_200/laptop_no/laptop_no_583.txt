Good - This is a great laptop with incredible specs. You almost wonder how they fit all that in this small size and still have space for a few expansion slots. I have been using this for the past 4 days and it works great. the keyboard is by far the best i have used (history - Apple Air, Dell E6500, some Toshibas...) Moving to this from my Dell 6500 was great. The weight is almost the same but you get so much more with this. Great value for money.Bad - The charger is really big and heavy...I found that the 90W charger does charge the machine only when its in sleep or its turned off. The two finger scrolling does not work.
