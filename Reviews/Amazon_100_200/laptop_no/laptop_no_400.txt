what part of locking the mouse pad button when typing do people not understand. How difficult can this be.I have had my 5532 for 7 months and absolutely love it.I have upgraded the cpu to a tl-60 and also have added ram for a total of 4gb. all for about $75, but even with the tf-20 cpu it was pretty good for the money.One thing i have noticed is that a lot of laptops have lowered their prices since about may or june. I think they did it in response to this computer, so looking around would not hurt at this point.I have not had any problems with anything being flimsy or cheaply made, but as it is now august i would suggest looking for a more powerful cpu in the same price range of about $350-400 as they are out there now or installing a tl-60 for about $25 if you do it your self. Note the job can be tedious to anyone that has never taken a laptop apart before, but there are several sites that can be helpful.
