I've been shopping for a new laptop for wife and the Lenovo G570 i5-2450M is the best value currently available.  It looks good, has nice responsive keyboard, and the screen isn't too bad.  However, I ended up buying a Dell Inspiron due to following reasons for the 43349KU model:- No HDMI port- No Gig-E port- No USB 3.0 portIf above are not important to you, then Lenovo will be the best value at about $500 and $550 for the Dell.Strongly recommended if you can live without the above shortcomings, especially HDMI which is why I took one star off for this model #43349KU.---- Update 4/1/2012 ----Now I wish I had bought the Lenovo instead.  The Dell Inspiron should be called the "Smudge magnet" since every single fingerprint and palm prints are smudged everywhere you touch to the extend that the laptop looks dirty. I'm not a clean freak, but the plastic material Dell uses needs to be completely revamped for an otherwise a great laptop.Lenovo has it's downfalls, but not this bad.
