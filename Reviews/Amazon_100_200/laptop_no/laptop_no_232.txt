I HAD had this computer for about 2 years, and about 3 or 4 days ago, it died. Out of the package it ran fine, but about 6 or 7 month into owning it, the power cord had to be replaced due to the faulty power input design. This continued (I replaced the power cord 4 times total). In the meantime, the hard drive failed, so I replaced that one, only to find that the computer would run so hot, it would shut itself down about ever 45 minutes on the regular for thermal protection. Then it would stay on any longer than 20 minutes after that. I figure it's electrical problems and/or the motherboard. Regardless, there shouldn't be any reason for this to happen to so many of the same model (my roommate had the exact model I had, and her motherboard fried after 7 months or so). Probably won't be buying another HP again. Lovely aesthetics, awesome entertainment software, horrible infrastructure.
