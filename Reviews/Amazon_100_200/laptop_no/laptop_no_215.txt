I absolutely love the MacAir - it's very light, has many more features than a PC, it's faster,  everyday I find new things that I'm impressed with.  My only complaint is the brief manual does not make going from a PC to a Mac very easy.  I have used computers for many years but I am not a whiz with computers.  I have not gone through the tutorials on line - which I may have to do.  I purchased a book that claimed it explained everything you needed to know about converting from a PC to a Mac - very disappointed.  I like to "read" from a manual/book how to do something specific.  That's the only reason for a 4 Star.
