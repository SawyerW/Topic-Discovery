As far as laptops go, this is very powerful for the price, and seeing as there are a plethora of these available reconditioned, they are an extra good value.  The main problem with this laptop is the windows vista parasite that it ships with.  Luckily, many people feel the same way and there are a number of easy to find guides that will help you with the downgrade to windows xp professional.  The performance difference between the laptop as it shipped and after it was downgraded cannot be overstated.  It was the difference between an old computer laden with spyware and a brand new one.  If you are not tech savvy enough or willing to downgrade to XP, then this computer is nearly worthless to you.  If you are, then I would recommend buying a factory reconditioned one from tiger direct and save $150.
