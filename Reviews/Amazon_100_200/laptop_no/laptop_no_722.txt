A week after i had bought this laptop, it started to give me a hard time. It would slow down and freeze and I would have to restart it alot. I had to call Sony vaio Care a couple of times to fix it for me. So i did system restore and system recovery on it a few times. Even after all this, it would be okay for a while and then go back to its annoying ways. So i was basically going back and forth between the laptop giving me a hard time and me restarting it or calling Sony Vaio. If anyone purchases it, Good Luck with it.
