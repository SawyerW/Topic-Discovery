I got this in 2 days time no hassle. First let me say that it looks great but it is a real fingerprint magnet. the gloss just makes you look like you've just eaten and put your greasy finger all over it. Nothing a cloth can't fix. Thinking about getting a skin and that will solve all the problems. It works like a charm now that I've gotten rid of all the bloatware.Cons: When I first got it, all I got was this mind numbing static, so loud it made the dogs howl. However, after uninstalling all sound drivers, rebooting and then letting windows install new ones, all problems solved. Tech help is a bust but hey, that's why there's genius like mine! maybe I should apply for the job there! JUst a thought. Despite the bumps, I recommend this machine. It's cool, light (despite the 12cell battery) and just pretty to look at. I'm still testing out the battery life so I can't say if it lives up to the hype as yet. Meets my needs....
