I am surprised it is legal to sell these things at this price. This isn't a computer its a toy. There is no power to it, it can't handle very much. For example: I made a quick video of footage I took from xmas. iMovie chugged the whole time, and the video came out all choppy. I used the same footage on my wifes ipad with her imovie and it came out fine!Speaking of imovie this comes with the new version which is awful in my opinion. And you can't downgrade to the older superior version.I could go on forever about this (like the un-upgradable ram, poor performance for games, constant reboots and freezing) but I will end with some pros because there are some....I use this to watch movies and browse the web, I am using it now to type this. The battery life is great and it is amazingly light and slim. And lets face it, apple makes a slick looking product. So if you just need something to browse the internet and watch movies this does a fine job and looks good doing it. However I'd say same your money and get the macbook pro.
