...yup, you'll never go back. The MacBook Pro 13" is a dream come true. I switched from an HP tablet running Vista, and there's really no comparison. I'm in love with the MacBook Pro's sleek, elegant design; fabulous keyboard; amazing screen resolution; great battery life; and snappy performance. I mainly use it to surf the web, watch videos, play video games, and draw comic strips. This machine performs all those operations very, very well.Before the switch, I was concerned about compatibility issues, especially with wifi and Windows programs, but no longer! I got on my home network right away, and there are a lot of great Mac-compatible open source programs out there for your everyday needs: Open Office, VLC, Paintbrush, etc. I also didn't anticipate that the entire track pad was a button, but now I'm using it with no problems. Oh, and the trackpad swipes are pretty awesome.Finally, the MacBook Pro is durable, as evidenced by its remaining scratch-free despite my cat regularly using it as a springboard. This is a solid investment. Highly, highly recommended.
