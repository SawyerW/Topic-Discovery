Hello I have received my macbook pro two days ago and  I absolutely love it!! I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS. I am an Animator, Music Director, And A Computer technician. But I mostly do my work on my Mac (editing, creating, and directing). I have no problems yet on my mac so far, and hope it stays like that. I really love the Super Drive, and the two USB's 3.0 features they really help me out a lot. I would Definitely Recommend this computer to people who are looking for good software for video, music, and Pictures. I still don't say that I am a Mac.
