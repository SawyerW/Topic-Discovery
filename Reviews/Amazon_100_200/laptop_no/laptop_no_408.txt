I bought this Tobisha for my husband for Christmas 2009 and 3 months later he turned it on and it was just a white screen. We tried everything we knew to do and then I called the Toshiba service center. They told me right off that the computer was still under warranty. Then he told me that it would probably cost around 425.00 to fix it. $425.00 to fix a laptop that cost me $279.00. I asked him what good was the warranty if it did not cover anything. All he gave me was the run around. So I now have a $279.00 paper weight. So my advice is stay away from Toshiba.
