I purchased this laptop in December 2011, in February 2012 the motherboard went out of it, so I had to send it back to Dell to be fixed, it was gone for a week.  Then last week the entire operating system went out, so I had to wait to receive a CD to re-load the operating system.  Once I received the CD it took over two-hours to reload the system and I lost all of the items that I had saved on the harddrive including pictures of my family and grandchildren.  I would not recommend this laptop for anyone to purchase, too many problems...I don't think I will purchase another Dell....
