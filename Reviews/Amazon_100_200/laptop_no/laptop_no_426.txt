I have had this computer for about 2 full years and I HATE it. The first couple of months, it was great. Did all the things a college student needed it to do. However, into its first year, it just kept overheating. Even running Word to just type up a paper, within five minutes, it would get uncomfortably hot. Basically every time I am working on an assignment, I have to stop multiple times, shut the computer off, wait for it to cool, then continue. I don't usually write reviews but I really hope I can save someone from buying the worst computer I have ever used.
