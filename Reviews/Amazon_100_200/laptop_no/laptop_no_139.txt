I've owned my Dell Latitude E6400 for about six months now, and have been working with it almost daily -- running a bunch of web development and graphics editing software.  Have not had any issues with this laptop that would make me regret buying it, overall -- very positive experience.  The performance is solid, I had Win XP Pro on it, and now upgraded to Win 7 Pro, and it runs like a charm!  The battery life is very good (I have a 9-cell battery) -- the longeste I've kept the laptop running non-stop is 4 hours, and never needed to plug back in; the screen size (14") is a good balance for travel and working in comfort. The built-in wireless adapted sometimes needs to be restarted (there is a switch on the side -- turn it on and off to restart the wireless, not a big deal at all), but I only noticed that this needs to be done after the system comes out of hibernation.  I bought this laptop with a deep discount (it was refurbished by Dell), had some reservations at the time of purchase, but am a very happy camper now -- no worries!
