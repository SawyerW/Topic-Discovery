None of the programs were installed when i first got it, i had to do it myself, and update everything. The keyboard was dirty and their are a few bad scratches, and at least 2 big dings. The screen also had some weird food or something stuck on it, it definitley was not cleaned. The charger i got with it is a mini one, which is a pain in the ass. I didn't get a book or manuel on how to work it. it also came with all MICROSOFT programs, when it should have MACINTOSH ,but they didn't bother saying anything about that. but other than all that, it works good, and i do like it.
