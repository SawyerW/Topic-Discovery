I bought this laptop refurbished back in April 2009.  After about 4 months the hard drive crashed but not big deal I picked up a new one that was faster for $65.  It came with Windows Vista and it's speed was ok for the first month but after that it literally took 10 minutes to boot up before I could do anything in Windows.  I have since installed Windows 7 and it works GREAT!  It boots up in about 1 minute now and I have the same software installed as I had with Windows Vista (if not more).  I love the HDMI port so I can hook it up to my 42" LCD tv and surf the internet from the couch (as I'm doing right now).  I wouldn't pay $1,000 for this laptop (I paid $550 for it refurbished) but I would recommend this laptop to anyone, no problems here!
