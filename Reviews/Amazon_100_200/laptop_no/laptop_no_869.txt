I bought my Macbook Pro 13" from the Apple Store in New York City, but I feel like a review is needed here on Amazon. This Macbook Pro is fast, powerful, and runs super quiet and cool. I have no problems running this Macbook Pro on my lap for hours. I don't get burnt and it doesn't get hot. The aluminum chasis is fantastic and super durable. Its no like plastic which cracks, breaks, and melts. Aluminum is only subject to scratching and denting for the most part. These computers are so well built and are so speedy that I can almost see why Apple prices their computers at such a high price compared to other computer manufactures. These are worth it. Every penny.
