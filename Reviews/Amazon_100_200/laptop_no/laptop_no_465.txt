What can I say that hasn't been said many times before? This is, dollar for dollar, the best laptop buy in the world! It has the hardware to do everything that a laptop should do and much more. On top of that, Apple's legendary software performs like a well-tuned race car. It easy for anyone to learn to use, yet powerful enough for advanced users. This is the one to save up for, because you won't need to buy a new computer for a very long time. The only draw back for this computer is that there is no anti-glare screen option for this model. When in DIRECT bright sunlight the screen turns into a mirror, so if the sun is shining right on you just move (it is a laptop after all).
