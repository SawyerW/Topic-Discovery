Fry's had this on sale today, the 2GB version for $249.  I picked one up since my X61 was getting temperamental.I figured for $249, how bad could it be?  Well...with Windows 7 (and I'm a Mac guy as a rule) the computer is just fine for general use.  Quick enough loading web pages, and, unlike the usual assortment of crapware that most computers come pre-loaded with?  Office Starter (Word and Exel) for free!I'm just a happy little guy-I would have easily spent more on a used computer, not had the most current OS, not had the upgradability (I bet when I move this to 8GB of ram it will fly!) and really, for my purposes I think this was a great buy! Highly recommend..
