While I do enjoy having this laptop at a good price, my "con" is that the touch pad is on the left side. This slows me down since I often have to reclick and move fingers over on keyboard as well. I have always typed by touch and this makes it much slower.The laptop is excellent in all other ways but I find myself waiting till I get to work to type long responses. Since I basically got this laptop to check email and grade my online students using Blackboard, it is fine.I guess the bottom line is that if you type a considerable amount and right handed, this could be an issue.
