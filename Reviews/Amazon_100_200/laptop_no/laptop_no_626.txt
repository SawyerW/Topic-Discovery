I've had the laptop for about four months now and have had a generally decent time; however, I began to realize after installing a few graphics intensive programs that the "smart-switching" graphics weren't switching to the ATI card. Supposedly there is a work around but Samsung hasn't posted it in any of their tech support areas and hasn't pushed the info to the tech support folks. After spending about an hour and a half chatting with tech support (who initially told me that the ATI card could not work because "you can only use the card built into the computer") the tech support genius told me to re-install the graphics drivers. Seriously Samsung - piss off. I buy something with the expectations that it will work and if it has a flaw like this one that the vendor will make a reasonable effort to fix the problem, not push the work off to the customer.Facebook link to group campaign to get [ ... ] to fix the problem.[ ... ]
