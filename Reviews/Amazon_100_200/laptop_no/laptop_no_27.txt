I am blown away at the professionalism of this seller!!! They were wonderful to me!!! I have not been a Mac user and was a bit of a pain in the neck I am afraid. I was treated as I would have never imagined possible. I had to cancel my first order to upgrade after I already ordered. No problem.I received a very nice email instead of attitude. It made me want to find something they had for sale. It has been so refreshing to be put before the almighty dollar.I STRONGLY recommend buying from these guys!!!  I would pay more to buy from these people if necessary, but that is not the case!! Their prices were also the best!!! I am 100% satisfied and know that you will be too!!!!
