Dell studio 1555, purchased in 2009 for 650 dollars, 9-cell battery, maxed the ram.I hoped I am purchasing a good solid machine for 3 years to last. Did not.Within 6 months the HD failed. Lost data during final exam. It was hell.Screen developed vertical lines. Need new screen.All of a sudden, stopped turning on.I have an extended warranty, and under this "warranty" they asked me 400 (four hundred) for the repair!!!Needed a computer, bought a new Toshiba for the same money.I took DELL apart and found 2 broken wires. They connect the blink-blink power-on button to the MB. Every time you open the laptop these wires twist and finally break. This problem never happened with older computers. Dell invented a new way to fail the laptop. You pay the price for the flashy blink-blink button.I found a new power-on button for 4 dollars on the ebay! This fixed the 400 dollar repair under the "extended warranty" plan. A new screen can be bought for about 60. Set of hinges - 5 dollars. Dell is not what it used to be. Sorry.Did anyone notice, that DELL logo and Enron logo look the same? CROOKED "E".
