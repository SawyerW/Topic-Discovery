Although I don't usually comment on products, this piece of garbage pushed me to the wall. It is by far the worst laptop I had so far. With owning it for about 10 months now, it runs slower than my old inspiron 6400 dell (which still functions perfectly but old). The battery doesn't last up to 30mins anymore, the mouse is the worst ever. Why be an apple wanna-be if you can just function well being your old self. This is a piece of ish, I might put it out on the curb for trash, or jus give it out for -100 bucks... please don't buy this CRAP. I would rate it as a -5 if d bar was here.
