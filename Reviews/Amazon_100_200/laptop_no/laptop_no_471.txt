I bought this Mac Book Pro (13.3 inch) b/c I am already a huge fan of Mac. (I have a G5 2005 Mac desktop, which was dropped on the floor and got soda in it early on (6 months old at the time) and still works perfect.)Anyway, this laptop is well worth the money and more GB's than the slightly less expensive Mac Book (only $150 less). I open many windows on Safari, while having several other applications open and have had no problems.Note: More GB's = less struggling, which means you are saving your laptop from working too hard and eventually killing it, before its time.If you want a Mac Book, for school, work (not graphic designers, etc. who need tons of memory), just to play around....then this is the one for you.Once you go Mac....you never will go back (no blue screens of death, icons all over the place after start up, like that other operating system).:)
