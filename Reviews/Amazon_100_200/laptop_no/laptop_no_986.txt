This macbook pro is nothing but pain in the neck. It keeps freezing for no apparent reason. Hours of talks and chats with apple people didn't bring any solution. I don't even use it very hard, only maybe once in two weeks and only for word processing or web surfing and it can't event do such simple tasks. This is my first experience with apple computers and I had honestly expected more. Very disappointed. Apple won't even refund or exchange it claiming that I purchased it from Amazon. Amazon says it is past the return/exchange window time, so I guess I'm stuck with it.
