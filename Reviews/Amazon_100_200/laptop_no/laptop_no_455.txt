I bought my MBP, got it home...and it worked immediately. My only regret is almost three decades of self-imposed suffering using various Microsquish products, from 3.2 through XP...no more unasked-for surprises, worthless 'try-me' money-hook software, memorizing 800-phone numbers to Renton or Bangladesh for help, no endless fights with 'improvements'. The 13" Pro is extremely portable, much more capable than any netbook, and Apple has somehow managed to cram ease of use, rapidity, and functionality into the sensuous uni-body. Yup, I love it. It is the finest writer's instrument I have ever touched. If I could afford it, I'd get another one and hide it away in case the world ends. Or use it for a pillow... Get one: you'll not regret it. Life is too short for MS-masochism.
