The Sony VAIO VGN-Z591U/B 13.1" Laptop arrived in one day as advertised. It operated perfectly out of the box, and connected to my wireless network first try. I have had some difficulty with my XP computers communicating with my one Vista machine. The laptop (with Vista) operates seamlessly (so far) with the Vista workstation.The physical aspects of the machine are what you would expect from Sony, and the wireless mouse is a highly recommended addition.Impressive software included, and I particularly appreciated the setup option to avoid loading unwanted software.When I purchased the machine I did not realize that it will function as a BlueRay player. I will give that a try tomorrow when the cable arrives, and will report any difficulty.
