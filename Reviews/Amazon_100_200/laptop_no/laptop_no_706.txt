Bought this AMD-based Ideapad because it seemed that folks thought its Intel counterpart was problematic.  I'm not the least bit disappointed.  I needed a basic laptop with moderate horsepower.  I replaced the OS with my copy of Windows 7 Pro and it's a fairly fast machine, I won't need more than its 4GB of RAM or an SSD drive.  I use a fast 32GB SD card for Microsoft's ReadyBoost feature but I'm not sure this laptop even needs that.  I use it mostly for web surfing and remote sessions to my more powerful computers downstairs, but like to watch videos every now and then too.  As many have noted, the sound is adequate but could be improved, however I'm hard of hearing and usually use headphones anyway.  The touchpad is textured but it's not distracting, and it's positive and accurate.  I do miss a middle button -- this rig has a single button bar below the touchpad that acts sort of like a rocker for right and left clicks.  Seems strange but it works fine.  Very minor complaints for an otherwise excellent computer, I certainly think my money was well-spent.
