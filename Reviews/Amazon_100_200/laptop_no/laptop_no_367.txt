OK, I haven't drunk the kool-aid.  I was a long time Windows user who needed a feature (firewire) on a laptop that seems to no longer be available on windows laptops while it is available on the Macbook Pro.  So I bought the Apple.  It is a great computer - very well made, with excellent components.  Some of the differences in the platform are just that, different ways of doing the same thing.  I do not experience the Mac as better, more intuitive, or easier.  There are some things that are clearly more difficult to do on the Apple and the tweaking and flexibility that I enjoyed on the Windows computers is either very difficult or not available.  OTOH, the way that everything works together is nice.So, it is a great computer at a premium price.  apples or oranges?  you choose.
