This is pretty much configuartion that I got and performance is pretty good with this laptop.Lighted keyaboard had an impact on decission when I decided to buy this laptop and it is really nice and usefull feature that I was looking some time for it.Pros:- Very stable, no reboots and doesn't get frozen even when moving/shaking it- Good metal construction --> no flexing- Good set of connection slots for perrifferrals- Backlit keyboard- Very bright screen but not the best color rendering- e-SATA external connector- Internal Intel wireless 5300 AGN WiFi card is excellentCons:- LCD display is somewhat washed out although very bright- It gets very hot even just browsing internet after relatively brief period. Poor ventilation.- Somewhat heavy for its size- Average battery life (little bit over 3hr of usage when just browsing internet via WiFi with standard battery)- Proprietary HDMI connector (need to buy separate pigtail adapter)I have it almost for a year now and no crashes or some issues or glitches so far.Overall very good business laptop.
