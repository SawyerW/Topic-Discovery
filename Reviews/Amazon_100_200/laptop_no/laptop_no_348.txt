this is my first time using mac in i don't know why i haven't use it before the macbook is a very sexy,fast and reliable laptop it is worth every penny in the battery life is amazing so far i use six hours with a single charge,there is one thing that gets on my nerves but nothing major when i look at how much battery time i have it seems to never be accurate it jumps from low to high often but thats is not that serious to me i plan on using this laptop of everything goes good though my whole 4 years of college. in the near future i while of course use more apple product in the next i hope is the imac are mac mini...
