I highly recommend you do NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this laptop. If you look around at forums and such, you will find many issues with it being a low quality laptop. Ahead are just a few examples of customers complaining about freezing problems and crashing problems. Other customers complain about blue screens and mouse pad freezes. I have one myself, and I am extremely frustrated as this is my only computer to work with. Every minute or so, the computer will freeze for about 30 seconds and then come back. I have tried many things to fix it, all of them you may find in the following forum posts, but none have worked. Do NOT buy.Any hope for a g62-340us fix?
