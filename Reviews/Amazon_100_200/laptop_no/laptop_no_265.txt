I bought this laptop a year ago, and I regret it with all my heart. It just died, for no reason; never fell down, never spilled water on it, it just died. I wish I could give it five stars, since it was really an amazing laptop, was very stable, powerful in multitasking and visually nice. I was warned not to buy HP because of its overpriced, made-to-fail products, I've rejected to believe so, and now from my experience, I will never ever buy any product from HP. And to make things worse, a crappy customer service. Really, don't buy it. Just don't buy it.
