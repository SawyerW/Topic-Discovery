Bought this for $599.00 at BB and just love it. This is my first lap top.  I found it to be Quick like lightening - and great memory with the DDR3, 4g memory, dual processors, and 5g hard drive. 64 bit Windows 7 is great except fire fox doesn't seem to do well on it. The screen is large, brilliant and easy to look at.  Battery life is about 3.5 hours - a little less than the specs.A video on the webcam turned out great - sent it to my brother in California and he loved it. Put on a couple professional programs that use a great deal of memory and the computer didn't even notice. No problems with many simultaneous programs running.  Please note:  I am not a gamer!Only negative: Key pad is difficult to use - I will go wireless mouse asap. DDR3 memory with 4g is NOT expandable.I took the lap top out on the patio, to the garage, and all through the house and the signal was great.  All in all, for the money, I don't think you can do better.  This seems to have it all.
