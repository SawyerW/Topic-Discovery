Right, the Hp Dv6 with AMD A6 Quad core is a powerful little machine! It lets me do my college work  and also play games at an incredible price! The on board APU is more than adequate for most needs, although you can opt for the AMD Dual graphics too. The battery life is fair to good, I get about 3-4 hours off a single charge in real life. At this price I think people would be stupid not to buy this! paid $499 for a machine which can match and beat machines a lot more expensive from Intel. The AMD A6 3400 Quad core and the 6 gb of DDR3 ram make this a fun laptop which is good for engineering software too.Overall, I see no reason to not recommend this laptop, HP is after all #1 in the world!Thank you,Abhay
