I recently purchased this model of the macbook pro. I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied. It contains a long battery life, incredible specs, and an overall enjoyable performance. Upgrading from a toshiba laptop, I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides. The snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos, as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy. In upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product, hence the 5 star review.
