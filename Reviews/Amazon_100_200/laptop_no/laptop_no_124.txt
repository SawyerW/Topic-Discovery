Great little computer with XP on it. In good condition, well packaged for shipping, great price - however it came with 3 viruses, a Trojan, and 103 cookies on it. Our advice is to turn it on, uninstall whatever virus software is on there and immediately install FROM A DISC either Norton Internet Security or Avast Internet Security or something even more powerful and run it on the entire system to clean it up before you do anything else on it. You might also consider, once that's done, taking it to a serious tech person who can make sure it's not running any spyware your security system didn't catch. Otherwise, you could end up turning all your passwords over to someone you don't even know. Just take the proper steps and precautions when buying used computers and you'll be happy with this purchase ;-)
