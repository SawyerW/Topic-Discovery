The T61 is too hot to handle.  Since it was new, the laptop is too hot to put on your lap and becomes very uncomfortable to even lay your palms on it while typing.  It inadvertently goes into sleep mode at the most inoportune times due to overheating.  I read some of the posts on the web and they suggest cleaning the air intake.  However, I doubt it was clogged when I bought it new and it ran very hot then.  It is so hot, you cannot consider this a laptop as you couldn't possible keep it on your lap.  Makes it very difficult to use.
