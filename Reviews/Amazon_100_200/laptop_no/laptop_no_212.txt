Well. Compared to my previous MacBook Pro (2.0 GHz Intel Core Duo - 1 GB RAM), this one is extremely brilliant in terms of design, speed and value. I've been using it for 2 weeks now, and I can safely and easily say that this laptop is the best device for students, especially with these standard configuration I've chosen. By that, I mean the processing is faster, usage of RAM is good and also opening of most of the applications seems much faster; this can help school/college students to edit, write or design whatever they want comfortably. But there's some bad thing that I've noticed, which is not Apple fault, the DEAD PIXEL; the screen still got this old annoying problem. Apart from that, this MacBook Pro is highly recommended for both "professionals" and students.
