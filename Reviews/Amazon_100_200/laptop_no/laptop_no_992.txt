All is well...very satisfied with the performance and everything else. I will not go back to a regular PC. Thanks Amazon. Follow up: 2 months later and this is by far the best computer I have ever owned. I'm not on it 24/7 so battery life has been great and thanks to the great slip case I got there are still no scratches on the body either. The CD drive runs smooth and pretty quiet as well. I would recommend getting the MAC on here if your state currently is not charged sales tax yet by Amazon. Luckily Illinois still is not being charged sales tax.
