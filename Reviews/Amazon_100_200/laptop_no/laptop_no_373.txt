I'm gonna make it short and simple, mostly because that's all it needs to be. The Macbook Pro 13 in. is the best laptop I've ever had in my life hands down. It's amazing. The screen is bright and definitely shows all the little details. Looks smooth and clear. The basic structure of the computer is amazing, breathtaking even. But maybe that's just because I'm an apple fan. And I especially love the fact that the keyboard is backlit if you want it to be, and you can choose how bright you want it to be. But the only downside is that the keyboard starts getting that shiny look after you type alot on it. But every keyboard does eventually so that's not only specific to this computer.
