It's my first experience with an Apple computer and the transition from PC to it has been really easy.  It's user-friendly out of the box and setting it up has been flawless and simple.  It's not cheap but it feels solid and durable, it's fast, quiet and has a lot of high-end features, it's simple and elegant. The hard drive and RAM can be upgraded,  even the manual shows how to do it in a few simple steps.I love it!  It's worth the money and Amazon gave me the best price for it.  I like it so much that I'm planning to get a 27"Mac for home for my wife and kids. I'm sure they're going to love it as well.
