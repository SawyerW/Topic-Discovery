The two negative reviews are way out of scope for this laptop.  This laptop for the price is hands-down a fantastic laptop.  It runs Windows 7 quite fast and with 3 gigabytes of ram, and a 2.1 GHZ Dual core processor, and a 160 GB SATA laptop hard drive, you get fast application processing power, and a computer that does all of the same great things that others do 3 times their cost.  The resolution is great, the web cam is okay, the CD/DVD burner works well, and the battery life is pretty decent.  THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS LAPTOP IS THAT LENOVO IS A BRANCH OF IBM.  YOU KNOW, THE COMPANY THAT MAKES HIGH END COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. So don't be fooled by the price or superficial reviews, this sweet little gem is truly a bang for the buck.Tech ownership 1 yearTechnical Level High
