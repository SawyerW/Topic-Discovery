I Really like my new computer, Refurbished & working as Good as I could Expect it to. It was Delivered FAST! got it in the mail almost 3 days before I expected it! The computer meets All my expectations & more! It was worth the Spending! It still Surfs the Web & connects Easily to Every source! even my Mobile Sprint LG android Phone! (Although I had to download the Drivers from a WiFi Connection) Anyways I am most Pleased with the Computer, It's In good shape & all the connections such as the usb & even the Modem is in Perfect Shape!
