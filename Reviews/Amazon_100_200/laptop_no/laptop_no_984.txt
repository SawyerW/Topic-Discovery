I was online shopping for a new computer and was pretty determined to get a MacBook Pro (after countless failures with PCs) I wanted a powerful and reliable machine that would last me a couple of years. My last PC from HP lasted less than a year before succumbing to the deadly blue-screen syndrome. Time for change...After several weeks of planning and contemplation, I finally hit a stroke of luck on Black Friday ON AMAZON, finding this gem for $962! (Originally $1,199), which trumps the student discount offered by Apple, widely believed to be the best deal around.... Anyway, I put in the order right then and there and what a great decision it turned out to be... I love it!I have only had it for less than a week but there is nothing about this computer I dont like. The speed, the simplicity, the design.. it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned. I also just purchased 16gb of RAM which I will be inserting into my mac manually within the next few days...another review on that soon to come.If you are contemplating switching from PC to Mac...Just do it. This is a no brainer.
