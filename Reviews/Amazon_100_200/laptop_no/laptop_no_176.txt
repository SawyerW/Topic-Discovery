My wife and I have the exact same unit, aside from the date purchased.  My MBP is a month newer.We both really enjoy using them, and find the size is perfect for our needs which are totally different.My wife does mostly surfing, email, and office administrative tasks which require her to run windows through VMware for their office's Windows based accounting and payroll software.  I, on the other hand, use my machine for editing 1080p video and 21megapixel photos.  To compensate for the size of the screen, I connect my Macbook Pro to a 24" display.What I find strange though is the difference in battery life, heat, and wifi reception of our machines when doing the EXACT same tasks.My MBP lasts 3.5 hours maximum, gets quite a bit warm, and gets really good wifi reception.  My wife's MBP lasts 5.5 hours, stays cool, and gets very weak wifi reception.To be honest, I don't know whose MBP is better off, or whether both units are defective, but nonetheless, we are still quite happy with our machines!
