I added 1GB of RAM (to 2GB) before even booting up out of the box, which I regret now, just for curiosity reasons, but so far I am very pleased with the twin-core MT6840. I had a Gateway MX7118 before and loved the widescreen display, and I wasn't about to spend a thousand or more bucks on a high-end laptop. I realize you get what you pay for usually, but if you're budget-conscious you could do a lot worse than the MT6840. Battery life is roughly 3 hours. Streaming HD TV video from ABC is flawless on the MT6840; the same video still stops and starts on my AMD Sempron desktop with 1.5 GB RAM. And so far, Vista has been a pretty pleasant experience. Like anything else new, it takes some getting used to.
