I got this computer for school and found it to be very practical, affordable, and the quad core processor makes it good for multitasking. It's not stiff like a mac it does have some flex to the slim design, however I have not had any issues with hardware. This computer has been very versatile for home or travel, battery life is around 5 hours so thats a drawback. This computer has been very reliable and sturdy. there are some minor nuances like fingerprint recognition not function all the time so I just disable it, I think it is more of a software issue with windows then the hardware of the device. If you want a powerful little computer that plays good HD and can support multi display with ease this is a good economic alternative. The webcam has good definition and brightness even in the dim lit rooms. Has very good connectability 3 usb's 2 2.0 and 1 is 3.0 hdmi and vga. For the price you can't find a better deal with a good brand name and i5 quad core thats lightweight its been a great experience for me.
