I love this laptop. I can't say enough good things about it. It's sleek, light, fast, with enough RAM to get the job done and I have always preferred an Intel processor to an AMD. The keyboard is a traditional keyboard with a number pad on the right. It comes with really cool face recognition software for logging in. It also comes with Microsoft Office Starter 2010 which is really great. It's not a trial program either. Except that it's missing the ability to track changes, etc. most of the common Word features are there. There was some bloatware but nothing you can't get rid of in fairly short order. I couldn't be happier and this was a good price! I got it cheaper at Lenovo Outlet than what they have here on Amazon and the Outlet comes with a 1 year depot warranty.
