I bought this refurbished laptop for my grandson to see if he could be responsible with one before purchasing a new unit. It arrived promptly but the box was damaged. Unless a packing slip was removed, there was no real problem since the unit was fine. The appearance of the computer was acceptable, no visible dings or damage. Operationally, it started up and worked well intitially. We did run into an issue with the video card in it not being adequate for playing the games he wanted to play and consequently one game wouldn't work at all and the other runs very slowly. After researching the components in the unit, it appears there were parts from a variety of manufacturers which may also have contributed to the incompatibility of the laptop with the downloaded games. Having to go to multiple sites to check on driver updates was a bit complicated and time consuming. I contacted the vendor and am waiting on a return call. The review will be updated after I see what the seller does to resolve the issue.
