Have been an Apple aficionado. Until now. With an iphone, Ipad, Macbook pro and Apple router. I bought a Macbook Pro in July 2010 and bought an extended warranty for 3 years. Recently in July 2013 I had some power problems and I took it to the Apple store on August 8th, 2013. It was found that the battery needs replacement but Apple  refused to replace it because the extended warranty was over by a few days!Two things that mark the new Apple as plebeian and cheap as some other manufacturers - 1. The battery misbehaved exactly after the warranty expired, precise to the day!  2. Apple which earlier would have replaced the battery knowing very well that they sold me a 3 yr warranty that was not misutilized - would have replaced the battery. But they did not.Why pay a premium for Apple service? Furthermore, why buy Apple extended warranty?I chose not to replace my battery. My next machine will be .. not APPLE.
