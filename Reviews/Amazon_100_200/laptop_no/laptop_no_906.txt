The 13" screen is crisp and clear and just the right size for portability. At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" LCD screen, so built in screen size is not terribly important. Intel HD4000 graphics handle web pages, video files, photo editing (Lightroom) all fine, runs Diablo 3 acceptably, but this isn't a gamer's notebook.USB3 is AWESOME, copied from a portable USB3 drive to another portable USB3 drive at 75MB/sec (about 4 times faster then doing the same with USB2 drives.)No thoughts yet on Thunderbolt port, but I like the idea that it kind future proofs notebooks a little. (Thunderbolt is an external PCI-E bus.) Looking forward to affordable capable notebook docking stations built around thunderbolt for simplified home/office docking.About it not being a retina display: I Don't Care. Most of the time I use an external display. I also sit far enough away that I don't see individual dots anyway (internal or external screen.) And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me.)
