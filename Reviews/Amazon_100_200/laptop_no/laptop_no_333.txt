I've had this laptop for 3 years so far and its still running strong. Honestly I love it flaws and all that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Problems so far is the battery sucked never lasted long neither in charge or time I had it so it was not missed when it died, It was my first laptop so I don't know if others have this problem. You have to keep it WELL ventilated if you don't you will have problems if you watch videos they will get choppy or games will lag bad. I've tested this so yea Its a good laptop and can do things like video editing just keep it ventilated.Pros: good for playing old games, good for web surfing, music, or school suff, has hdmi so you can stream to a hd TV like I do. SD card slot and 3 usb, and overall reliable.Cons: Can run hot so keep it well ventilated, Battery sucks it died after warranty expired,
