I was able to buy this laptop for $499 a few weeks back.  I really wanted to purchase a Mac since that is what both my wife and I use at work.  Our tired old Toshiba was ready to go but I just couldn't bring myself to pay 3 times the amount for a MacBook Pro.  This laptop has been a nice addition.  My wife uses it the most but we have used all the features.  The screen is clear and the machine is fast.  My wife really likes the style of the keyboard ad claims it is easier to type.  Anyways, this machine seems to do the job.  Very pleased that I got it for the right price.
