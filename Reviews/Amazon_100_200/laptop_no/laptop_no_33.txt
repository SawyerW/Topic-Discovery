i bought this machine because it was relatively cheap and i wanted something portable with a lot of processing power.  I have never wanted for processing speed, and i can take the thing around places, so my basic needs are satisfied.The problems:A) low battery life.  My battery life is now about 20 minutes.  When i got it, the life was ~1.5 hours.  I'm guessing that this is what happens when you overcharge a battery constantly by having the laptop plugged in all the time.  Apple has solved this problem, why can't sony?B) heavy.  and the ac adapter is HUGE, about the size of a psp/1st gen. gameboy.  Will fit in backpack, but it will weigh you down.  It's fine to carry - so long as its the only thing you're carrying.C) hot.  i highly recommend a centrino processor.  p4s are just too hot for a laptop.  They burn the battery and the computer occasionally shuts off b/c it's too hot.  These problems are endemic to p4 laptops.  Get a centrino.Overall i am satisfied, if not ecstatic.
