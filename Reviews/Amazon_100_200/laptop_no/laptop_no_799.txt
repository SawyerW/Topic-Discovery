Bought this through Amazon Warehouse Deals - while it was described as "used - very good", when it arrived, it looked brand new and in all original pristine packaging. I was a little hesitant at first in buying electronics through Amazon Warehouse Deals but at close to a $100 discount, I thought I'd give it a try. The MacBook Air itself is lightning fast, even compared to my 2012 MacBook Pro, probably courtesy of the SSD drive and it can re-boot in 15-20 seconds once it's been upgraded to OS X Mavericks. Keyboard is not as light as the Macbook Pro and harder to type but I've been using it for a few days now and getting used to it. The best improvement I got, compared to the Macbook Pro is that the Air doesn't heat up. My Macbook Pro heats up after a few hours, to the point, where it is impossible to use it as a "laptop" as it literally burns your lap! The Air doesn't seem to heat up at all and very comfortable to use even after a couple of hours of straight usage. Highly recommended, as it even fits into my handbag!
