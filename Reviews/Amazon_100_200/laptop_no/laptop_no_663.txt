This is an awesome laptop and works great! I am a senior American in my 60s and just wanted a trouble-free system to play games like Skyrim, Diablo III, and WoW. This machine ticks alll the boxes.But why oh why did they put the power connection on the right side in the way of using the mouse for right-handed players? Yes, you can buy the right-angle connector, and I did, but eventually, I started having problems with the power changing over from the power cord to the batteries and back again. This is a major annoyance for me. I am going to buy another power cord with a right-angle plug already on it and see if that helps. To me this should be a no-brainer for the people who design these computers. Please, Asus, don't put the power connection there on your ROG models! Gamers don't use the touch-pad at all. Very bad planning.
