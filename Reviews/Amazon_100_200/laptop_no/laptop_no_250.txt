I think it is very deceptive that in the description from Amazon, it states 4GB BUT it only comes with 1GB from the seller.  How can you feel good about yourself and sell something so misleading BUT then the seller will sell you some more GB for extra money.  I am sure that are several other things in it that I am not aware of.  That is what I get for buying something like a computer from you!  Really makes me think about buying anything from Amazon again.  I have always in the past bought alot of Amazon but I am pissed!
