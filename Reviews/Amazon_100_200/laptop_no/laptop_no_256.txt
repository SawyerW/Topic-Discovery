This a horrible laptop for what they charge for it.  And I am not the only one who has had issues.  In the f'rst year of own'ng the (brand new) laptop, I had to send 't 'n for repa'rs tw'ce, and 't was gone for more than two months.  The f'rst t'me was w'th the f'rst month of ownersh'p, and 'nstead of g'v'ng me a new laptop (wh'ch 's what ' pa'd for), one month later, they sent me a refurb'shed one (wh'ch 's s'gn'f'cantly less expens've).I have owned the Satell'te laptop for just over two years now and have had to have the hard dr've repa'red FOUR t'mes.  And each t'me talk'ng to customer serv'ce 's about as helpful as talk'ng to a recorded vo'ce.Bad Technology AND Bad Customer Serv'ce.  Why would anyone buy th's when the market 's full of many other opt'ons.  Check those out f'rst.
