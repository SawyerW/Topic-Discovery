USB ports are on the left side. Unless you have a wireless mouse, I don't see how I can use a wired mouse for poor right handed people. There is no num pad. I have used it for some graphic intensive applications and experienced problems with adjusting between full screen mode and windows mode. I have run a small test to converto 700+ pdf into windows journal file. Disk IO ran so high to the point of locking up the whole OS. I do not value Laptops that can not multi-process Disk IO intensive app with other application. Maybe too much expectation out of laptop? Well if it is more than 1000 dollars, then yes.
