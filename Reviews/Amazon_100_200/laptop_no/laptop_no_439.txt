Purchased this laptop for my son on 10/31/2010, about 2 weeks ago while at home during holiday break from college, he opens the computer, turns it on and the screen just goes black. I contacted Toshiba and sent the computer in for repairs per their instructions. Several days later I am contacted by Toshiba and told that the LCD is damaged and this is not covered under their warranty because it is considerded customer damage. My argument was how do you damage a computer simply by opening the case and turning it on? In my estimation this computer is a cheap piece of junk, less than 3 months after purchase it is damaged and the company does not stand behind their 1 yr warranty. Avoid at all cost, I will end up having to replace this computer because of the price it cost to repair it. I will go back to HP, Dell or something else, I will not purchase another Toshiba.
