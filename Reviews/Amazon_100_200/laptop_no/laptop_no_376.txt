The mechanics of the MacBook have been reasonable.  The software, for this mostly routine user has been frustrating.During the five years there have been new OS to leopard, snow leopard and lion.  I am perfectly happy with the original tiger which is now poorly supported.  Printers for instance are now mostly requiring at least Leopard.  Changes are not trouble free.  Parallel (to use microsoft occasionally) was more trouble than it was worth.I am now 2 mac 2 dell household and finding the Dells more practical.  There are features like changing mag on the text which work better on the Mac.  Do not pay up to be a cult member. Watch out for expensive razor blades for your expensive razor.
