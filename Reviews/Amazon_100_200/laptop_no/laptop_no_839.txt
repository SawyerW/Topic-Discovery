Apple has outdone itself again.  There is simply no other laptop in the market that can even compete with this.  I had the MacBook Air 11 from 2010 and just upgraded to the MacBook Air 13 one week ago.  I LOVE IT!!  The battery life is just incredible.  I've been using it without power cord for a staggering 2 days already and still have 43% power left good for another 4 hours!  The touch pad is classic Apple and very response.  Why can't windows machines make a touchpad like this???  The keyboard is a joy to use and I love the SSD.  I literally have it on my bed and whenever I need to do stuff, just open it up and there it is ready for me.  Amazing!!!
