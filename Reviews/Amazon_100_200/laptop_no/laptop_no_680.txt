This laptop is simply amazing.  I am a business traveller and it is perfect for my needs. Its design is remarkable(it looks better than the mac book air in my opinion) and the built quality is impressive. It only weights something like 2.5 pounds. The wifi connection is fast and reliable. Windows 7 boots in less than 20s. The matte display is gorgeous and the aspect 16:9 aspect ratio makes this device perfect for watching TV shows/movies. The battery life is good. The keyboard could be better.I have owned this laptop for about than 2 months and I love it so far.  The price tag is a little high but you won't regret it.
