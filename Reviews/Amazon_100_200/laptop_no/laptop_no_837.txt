This computer is just incredible!I bought it to work with some of my personal projects, being one of them djing. I am able to use this laptop with my jig connected through USB for hours. Yesterday I was able to play during 4 hours and still had 3 hours left. I was using a Numark mixer with Traktor consuming some of the battery.Besides that the boot-up is extremely quick due to the ssd as well as the usage of several different software.My advice is to buy the 256 hard drive version. It won't create any problem to you!Beware of the RAM memory usage, though!
