The MacBook Air 2.13 GHz, 4 GB RAM with 256 GB SSD is really a great computer to use. It is really light and faster than expected. The SSD flash drive really makes this a joy to use with the computer turning on very quickly and being very responsive. While being very light is an attribute, the hand rest area can be heard flexing with the slightest of pressure. I recently had to take in the laptop to Apple to have the trackpad replaced because it was acting very erratically after only 2-1/2 months of use. One possibility was that the trackpad area was moved out of alignment because the framing in this area is very thin. Be careful about just holding onto the front edge of the computer where its the thinnest. The other issue with the computer is the fan noise can be rather obtrusive when playing YouTube videos.
