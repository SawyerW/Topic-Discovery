It's worth the money. Small, light, fast, and a long battery life. Little extras: the sound is pretty decent, the screen is very bright, and startup time is literally a few seconds.PC users need not worry that it's going to be a pain to transition; the Mac's user-friendly reputation is earned.I did immediately purchase an external CD/DVD drive to make life a little easier. I've been told that having minimal USB ports might be an issue for some users, so be aware that there are only two.The only drawback I've seen thus far is that it's *so* small and light (literally the size of a spiral notebook, and thinner than that) one might forget it's a $900-plus piece of technology. It almost begs to be treated casually. Those with children/teens, beware: it's toyish in its size and heft, and will invite abuse.
