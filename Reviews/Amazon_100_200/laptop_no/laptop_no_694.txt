First shipping: I ordered it on December 12 and I paid extra for quick delivery, however with UPS I did not receive it before December 24Second: The DVD RW drive does not work. I can open it through a program instruction but it does not open by touch. And it does not start programs up automatically when disc has been inserted.How do I go about this? All my programs have been transferred to this computer and I would really like to return it and get a workable replacement. But if I send it back I will have to start all over. Is there a way of repairing the drive?
