Sleek, lightweight, easy to use. Really liked the size and features, but from day 1 had issues with the power cord being loose and wouldn't consistently charge the battery. A year after purchase, dropped laptop 2 feet onto carpet and screen cracked, took it in for repair and found out cable that connects screen to base also in poor shape (apparently a common problem with this laptop per computer repair place), so after 1 yr use had to replace laptop. Expected more for the money I spent. Disappointed in the issues. Acer customer service won't even talk to you if past product warranty. Very disappointed with this purchase!! Bought a different brand today, after having been a loyal Acer customer.
