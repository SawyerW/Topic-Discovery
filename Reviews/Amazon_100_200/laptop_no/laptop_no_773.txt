I've had Dell and HP computers before buying the MacBook Air.  The HP laptop literally fell apart in 15 months and their support would not fix the problem although obviously a manufacturing defect.  It was difficult for me to justify spending extra money for an Apple, but have absolutely no regrets.  Should have done it much sooner.I am not a techy and do not understand all the internal greatness of these machines, but know from Apple's reputation and family and friends that have them that they have been pleased with the laptop and service Apple offers.  In my unprofessional opinion, this Mac is awesome - lightweight, easy to use, everything I want/need and more.  Buying through Amazon was quick, easy, AND I saved money!  Don't hesitate - buy it!!!
