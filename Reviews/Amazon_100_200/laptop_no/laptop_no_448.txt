I was very happy with my 17" Macbook Pro, it was fast and the operating system is a treat, but after several hardware failures I no longer consider it a worthwhile purchase.  The keyboard has failed, the original battery split wide open at the seams, and the DVD drive stopped working for reading and writing DVDs.  The laptop was repaired under warranty. but now after the 90 "warranty" on those repairs has passed the DVD drive has again failed.  I cannot so much as send an email for help without paying a $49 fee for the privilege of speaking to the company.My next laptop is not going to made by Apple.
