I purchased this laptop in late 2009 for $500.00 brand new. For all its flaws, I could look past them knowing I'd never buy a then new computer that cheap. Not once have I had to take it in for maintenance! It's spared me the grief that a 2 year warranty would otherwise cover. I don't expect to have any serious problems with it. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to Windows 7 home premium, and ditch Vista. Mine came with a free upgrade, and it loads much faster.Pros:-10-Key pad! (This was what ultimately sold me.)-Fast loading at startup and online.-"Classic" desktop theme makes the computer compatible with older games and programs that required Windows XP to run.-"Energy mode" makes the battery life much last for about 6 hours.Cons:-The shell is plastic. Try not to be careless with it.-Portable, but not lightweight. (6.5 lbs)-Unplugged, the battery life while internet surfing can barely make it two hours.-Low end video card. (Nvidia 8200M) Will run "heavy" games like the sims 2, but this is not a gaming computer.
