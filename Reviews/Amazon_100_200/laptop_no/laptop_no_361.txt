I usually have used PC's with Windows 7 so buying a Mac was a bit unusual for me. But when I bought it I found that it was really easy to use straight out of the box, and as a movie producer amateur I found that iMovie was very resourceful and easy to use.I found the OS fired right up and booted up no problem every time.Pros:ease of usereasonable price for softwaredesign (love the aluminum :) )screendurabilityConsprice (i paid the full $1,400.00) yikes!everyone thinks im a mac snob now loloverall i really enjoyed this Macbook Pro and advise it to anyone who wishes to try a Mac.
