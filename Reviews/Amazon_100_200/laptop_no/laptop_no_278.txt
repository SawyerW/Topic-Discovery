I'm a computer science major in school.  I wanted something that would be super powerful and could handle a lot.  I got it!I use a lot of big programs like the Adobe Master Collection and Autodesk products, and it runs them like a charm.i7.  Super good.Speakers, they are great for me!USB 3.0 is a nice touch.It says Dark Brown, and though it looks black, you can see that it actually is brown when there's a lot of light on it.The multi-touch scrolly thing is great too!  I love zooming in on pictures and scrolling with ease.The number pad on the side is WONDERFUL.Lots of crap-ware that comes on it, but that's easy to fix.  Some of it is cool, including facial recognition login.Get it, it's worth it.
