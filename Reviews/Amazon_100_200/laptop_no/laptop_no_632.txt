I bought this computer for about 510 bucks thinking it was worth but i now have some complains and i also have to send it to HP to fix the webcam.1. Is weakly built, and the plastic covers above frontal speakers broke and became difficult to use it.2. The webcam unplugged from the MoBo, and i have to send it to be repaired.3. Extreme overheating with low-res games. Playing GTA SA or RE4 makes the gpu overheat and smells like burned.4. Poor GPU. You can't run smoothly a game. Works Fine with arkham asylum but temps increase inmediately.5. Disk tray screams while reading a dvd.If you want something to play videogames during a trip or at home, don't buy it, just go for a AMD hp or a Sony/toshiba/samsung or another great computer.
