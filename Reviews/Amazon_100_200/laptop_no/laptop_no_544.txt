This is my second Macbook Air and it's amazing.  I went from a 1.86gh/2gb/128SSD (mid 2009) Macbook Air to this 2.13ghz/4gb/256gb Macbook Air and the difference is considerable.Aside from being amazingly light and beautifully designed, this machine is super fast and has excellent battery life.  I loved my old Macbook Air but I felt I had to sacrifice a few things to have such a light computer--with this latest version of the Macbook Air, Apple addressed all of these issues:1. The battery life is about 3X longer than my old MBA2. It charges very quickly--my old MBA seemed very slow to take a charge3. The screen is higher resolution so you have more 'space' in your 13.3" screen4. Now two USB ports and no more port door to deal with.5. The hinges on the MBA were weak--now it's totally redesigned.6. With the 4gb of RAM and faster SSD it's ripping fast.At the risk of sounding like I'm drinking the Apple coolaid, I've got to say this is the best computer I've ever owned by a longshot.
