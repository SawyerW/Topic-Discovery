This laptop is overpriced. It's thin and light, however, the weight of the base is not heavy enough to support the weight of the screen - when tilted, the laptop tips backwards. The brightness of the screen can be improved and the touch-pad is definitely a problem. It's difficult to find the left and right buttons on the touch-pad and the sensitivity is off causing the cursor to jam in place - especially when typing or surfing the web. The battery life dose not deliver on its promise. In my opinion, this laptop is a larger version of a netbook, but with much higher price.
