i bought this laptop with no reason on mind, just a laptop to have it in case of travel or while i stay at home but without use the desktop. I choosed the Intel i5-2450 configuration (wich is almost my i5-2310 of my desktop) and i'm surprised, its fast, it's big (not extremely big but big) and also it's very light, i'm totally impressed how light weight this laptop is, and even better it's a very whisper laptop (almost don't make any noise at all)For someone who wants a fast laptop to explore the internet, to watch pictures or videos, movies, play some games and do some office work, this is your deal! It comes with 4gb of ram and 500gb in the HDD.I'm in love of lenovo and specially this product (i own also a G460 14inch laptop) wich also is great one!.
