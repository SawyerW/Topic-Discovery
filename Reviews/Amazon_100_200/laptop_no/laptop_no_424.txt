I have owned a DELL Lap Top Studio 15 Computer for 3 and 1/2 years and it is the best of 3 lap tops that I have owned. I use mine for one hour during the day and one hour at night. Rheumatoid Arthritic pain in my wrists and fingers prevents longer usage. I purchased mine at SAMS during Christmas of 2008 for a good sale price which has gone up since then. I have found the computer to be very efficient with a high speed internet hook up. The grapics and the screen are very good. I have not had any problem with lock-ups or freezing keys like I have with other lap tops.
