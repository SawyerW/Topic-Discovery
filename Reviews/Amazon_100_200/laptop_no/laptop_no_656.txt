There is only ONE minor detail i can complain about is the touchpad, it kinda comes up on one corner and sometimes interferes with usage, sometimes. Which ALL laptops have crappy touchpads, this has to be one of the better ones(although i use a mouse most of the time for games). as for the way it runs, it does everything i need it to, watch movies, listen to music, play all the pc games i download. it runs really well. even most tower pcs ive had crap out on me when playing certain games. With this i am able to run games at their near highest settings with no lag, Near highest settings because i turn off shadows in games, not really needed IMO. the speakers get pretty loud for a laptop, i hardly ever have it at full volume. I have had it for just about a year so far and it just is amazing :D
