In all honesty, I was really excited when I bought this laptop a few years ago, and it worked really well for me (and this is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one), for about two years. I did notice excessive heating and fan noise when I ran games or movies on it, and I had to use a cooling pad at all times.Then one day, with no warning, the graphics card failed. My computer was left with a common 8 bit VGA graphics adapter. I looked for the fix, did the "blowtorch the graphics card" thing, and it did work. For about a week. Now whenever I try to install NVIDIA drivers for the graphics card, the computer hangs on the windows logo at startup, and I have to go back and restore to pre-NVIDIA driver update.i found out that there is absolutely nothing I can do about this. My warranty is expired and as far as I know HP refuses to deal with this problem. I think there's a lawsuit going on, but I'm just fed up with not being able to do anything that demands graphics performance on my computer.
