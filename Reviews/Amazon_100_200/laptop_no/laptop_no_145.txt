I bought Toshiba M305D-4830 on Sep,2008. I didn't use it until November,08. But as soon as i open it. I want to send it back. These are major problems:1. It can not wireless automatically, I have to buy a wireless USB adapter to go on line.2. The Keyboard 3,e,d,c key won't work  period. so I have to use tablet pad, I call the service get no help, he just give the service number and want me send to bestbuy, because we lost our receive(That the biggest mistake I  made), I google the problem, I am not along, I try all the suggestion people gave still won't work,  anyway since I am the computer person myself so I go on line pay $85 buy a new keyboard.3. Freeze itself a lot, I have MCAFEE Anti-Virus so I know it is not cause by the virus.This machine is a junk.
