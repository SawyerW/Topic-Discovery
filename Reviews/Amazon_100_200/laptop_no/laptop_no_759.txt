Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. I bought this Apple MacBook Air for my sweet wife, and it has broken 3 times already. First the logic board in the first week. A month later, a chip had gone corrupt.  Save your money, go to the apple store directly. Pay a few bucks more and get something from apple directly.  We had the option of returning it, but we decided to bring it to the apple store and try fixing it.  We just got our fixed mac book laptop from them again tonight, the chip has gone corrupt again.  What do the technicians say? Oh, always make sure to buy their apple care.  We've had the computer 2 months.
