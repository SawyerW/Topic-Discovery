I have a core i7 main 15" MBP and I wanted a travel laptop.  I figured for big trips I would need the big boy to take the load.  I was wrong.  I bought the pimped out 11" model and it has handled admirably.  I would like a 256 model as well but I think I will be able to find a bigger flash drive soon enough.  I have been amazed with the ease the 1.6ghz handled everything I threw at it and multitasked like a champ.  I would not do any video editing or encoding on this little guy but I don't really do that on the road anyway.  I think my 15" MBP will be getting a lot of at home time these days.  if you have the money to pay the apple tax you will not be disappointed.
