I have had my Inspiron for a year and am very pleased with it.  I have to use wireless - the most unstable connection to internet and yet this sturdy computer plows through a lot.  Wifi is an option when you go to Starbucks or other public places which may have internet connections.  Not only does this computer pack a punch, I am very pleased with the Dell service.  Excellent software to protect your computer, which updates regularly.  With Dell, you not only get a great computer, but you get connected with excellent service support who are only a click away.  If you are as serious as I am in needing a reliable portable computer to take with you, get this laptop; you will have no regrets.
