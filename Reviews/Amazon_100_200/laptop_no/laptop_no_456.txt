I just purchased this item from a local Apple Retail Store.  I have been nothing but impressed by:1. solid construction2. flawless operation3. speed4. (it's a mac, and if you are from the PC world like I was, you have a whole new world of goodness to discover)5. looks awesome6. keyboard is very easy to type on (if you are from the PC world, there is a small adjustment, notably with ctrl, and backspace)As with my iMac 27", I assume that this computer will be running about as well in a year as it is now.  And 2 years.  And three.My experience with windows has been the opposite.  My experience with consumer laptops has been not very good.  High end Dells are nice (precision mobile workstation), but you pay no less for one of them than a mac like this.I considered an Apple Air, but decided on the MacBook Pro because of the extra speed and features, for a bit more thickness and a similar price.13" sounds small (and it is very portable), but it is so well put together I feel like I'm on a 15".Just some comments that I hope help someone make a decision.
