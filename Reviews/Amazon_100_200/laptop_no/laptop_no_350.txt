The computer arrived in a broken cardboard box, loosely stuffed in newspaper. It was advertised in "As new, excellent condition." but the case had scratches and the battery was corroded, dead and fails to hold a charge.the seller fails top respond to my request for a refund. I could not be more disappointed in the product or service offered by this seller. Now I am out $800 and have a computer with a bad battery that does not work, and no response from the seller. I should have bought a new one from Apple, but stupidly thought I could save a couple hundred dollars. NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS VENDOR. He obviously knew that he sold me a bad battery that was presented as in excellent working condition.
