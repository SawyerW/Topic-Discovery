According the specifications on the right side of the product description: Dimensions:112.9" x 9.2" x 1" (W x D x H)That's right, it says it is 112.9 inches wide, over 9 feet. This conflicts with the specs on the official global asus site:"32.8 x 23.8 x 22.5 mm (WxDxH)"That's right, it now says it is only 32.8mm in width, or just over an inch. And even less in depth and height. Amazingly compact for a 13.3 inch laptop.Amazon's specs also say there are 3 usb2 ports, while asus' site says 2xusb2 and 1xusb3.If asus can't even list the thing correctly, then what makes you think they can design and build it correctly? I tried contacting them about the mistakes, but they haven't even acknowledged my email in over a week, so they don't care about even fixing it.
