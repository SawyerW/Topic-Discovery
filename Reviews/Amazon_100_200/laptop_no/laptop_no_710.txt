The G575 works great except they don't put any locktite on the two hidden screws that hold the hinges on.  As a result the screws fall out after about 8 months use and where the hinges screw into the base snaps.  Every time you open the lid the case opens up along the seam in the back.  You have to go the the fine print in the back of the warranty to find out that hinges and the key board are not covered after 90 days. The rest of the warranty in bold print says basically everything mechanical is covered.  Besides, fan, hinges, keys, battery holder, and plugs what else is mechanical no a laptop.  Bottom line this is a problem they could have prevented by using locktite on the screws like every other manufacture.  No you can't get it fixed for less than the cost of the machine because the damage causes other problems.  No more Lenovo for me.  Customer service is a  joke.
