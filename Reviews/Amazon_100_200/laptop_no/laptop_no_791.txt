Not typically a fan of Apple and their overpriced products, but I decided to purchase this to get familiar with the OSx and see why so many people hate it or love it. It's not bad for the price depending on what you use it for. I have a PC tower I built myself, an Alienware m17x, and now this. The Macbook Air is great for portable web surfing, document editing, etc. which is why I understand why a lot of college students own them. However, I dislike the fact that the operating system is so simple it pretty much thinks for you. Nonetheless, good little computer for what I use it for.
