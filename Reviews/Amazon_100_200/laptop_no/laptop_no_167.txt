My G60 440US ran great right out of the box. After about 10 months I started getting warning messages that my battery was failing. Got a new battery, everything was fine and then one morning shortly thereafter, nothing. Before you buy this machine research online the problems others have had with it. The most common complaint by far is that it won't boot up. It indicates power but you get nothing but a black screen and HP is no help other than suggesting some lame recommendations that involve removing the battery and unplugging the AC adapter, and starting over. A joke. I've bought only HP computers for more than 20 years but this particular laptop has been a complete dud and HP, from all appearances of those who've had similar problems, has nothing to resolve the issue. I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend this machine.
