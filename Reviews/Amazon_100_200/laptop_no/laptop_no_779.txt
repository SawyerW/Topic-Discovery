Another perfect laptop in the Macbook Air line.  It's my 4th Mac laptop and best yet.  The illuminated keyboard wasn't on my 2009 Air and man, did I miss not having it.  Other speed and port enhancements make the Air the finest laptop computer going, be it for home, work, travel or school.  With DVD and CD's on the way out there seems no call to lug the added bulk an optical drive adds.Note: I bought a Square Trade Warrantee this time around instead of Applecare; hopefully I won't need it, but Applecare is overpriced in my view.  It's been helpful for my Mac Pro's, but for a portable product, the Square Trade deal covers possible disasters Applecare omits.
