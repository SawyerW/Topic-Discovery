I spent a considerable amount of time researching what laptop to purchase, I was between a Windows 8 or MBP (non-retina and retina).  I physically went to the Apple store and Best buy to compare, aesthetically and build quality there is no windows based laptop that can touch a MBP and the very few that can are almost the same cost.What sold me on Mac is that you can run windows on it and preserve all your windows based files and software, I run Parallels 8 and love the configuration, its the best of both worlds.Once I decided on MBP I was between the non-retina and retina, I decided on the non-retina due to the upgrading capabilities and the obvious costs difference.The screen on the non-retina is so much better than my older dell it makes a world of difference already (I feel as if I have a retina display!)You cant beat the price on Amazon, between the discount, no sales tax and fast shipping you cant go wrong.
