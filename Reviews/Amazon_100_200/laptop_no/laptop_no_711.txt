I decided to purchase the U400 because it was sleek and has an internal disc drive.  I could go on and on about the slow boot time, the faulty track pad, etc, but the real concern is the overall craftsmanship.  My laptop about a year old and is on its last legs.  The titanium shell has shifted, and has killed the disc drive in the process.  The whole laptop looks like its falling apart.  Today I plugged in the power adapter and saw sparks!  It seems that the adapter is arcing with the metal shell.  Most of the time, it either shorts out, or the sparks fly for only a minute before it either decides to charge or not.  And, for the record, it is true what they say about the Lenovo customer service... Terrible.  They want you to send your laptop to them at your expense for at least 2 weeks just for a diagnosis of their faulty hardware.  If mine doesn't burn the place down in the next couple weeks, its destined to become a boat anchor.  I smell lawsuit on the sparking issue!
