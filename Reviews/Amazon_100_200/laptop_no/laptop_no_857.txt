This is a great deal but Amazon only seems to have the 4 GB in RAM option.  On the Apple store website, you can upgrade this purchase to 8 GB in RAM for $100 more.  I spoke with a customer service rep at Apple and, unlike previous models of the MacBook Air, you cannot add RAM to the new MacBook Air after purchase because the unit is a single body laptop.  So you are basically tied to the 4 GB in RAM option.  I have a $1200 Amazon card code (from Turbo Tax) that I would like to use to purchase this item, but I want to upgrade to the 8 GB in RAM.  Can you please sell the 8 GB in RAM too?
