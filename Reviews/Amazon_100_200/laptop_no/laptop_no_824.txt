A nice and lightweight laptop for checking email on the couch, but unfortunately not much more than that.My biggest gripe with this is that there's two USB ports, but they both go to the same internal USB host controller. This means you can probably ever only hook up a single high-bandwidth device at any one time - as you're really getting one usb port with a hub instead of two ports.It's extremely disappointing and deceptive that they would do this, as almost any laptop I've seen with two USB ports has two USB host controllers. Also it seems no one at the apple store knows the details of these systems, and they don't have specs for these in-store.
