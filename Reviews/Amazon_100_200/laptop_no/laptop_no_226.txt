I bought this MacBook Pro at the nearest military exchange in June 2011. I've been really happy with it. It replaced my desktop, which was given to my daughter. I will never use Windows again. I've been able to run everything that I had on my Windows machine on my MacBook. I just updated the memory as I use photography programs and the memory wasn't enough. I upgraded it with Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339) bought through Amazon. It's screaming fast now, even on the internet. I'm glad I upgraded! I have found that I use a lot of the Mac programs instead of the Windows programs I was used to. I do like Thunderbird for my email vs. the stock Mail program. I also really like how I can put things on the dashboard, that's convenient. I do have Office for Mac, as I really like those programs and I'm used to them. I'm extremely happy with my MacBook and I can see a smaller one in my future if I see a good deal, for trips, etc.
