-GENERAL-The actual laptop is not too heavy, but isn't all that light either.The keyboard is very responsive and feels great tot ype on.The graphics works fine, but you can't play games like "Call of duty" or "Cyrsis". The laptop is not meant to be a gaming laptop, more of an all-in-one.The cooling fan is enough to keep the laptop cool, no extra cooling gear necessary.The webcam is good enough, like most other laptops [1.3MP]. If you are going to be taking a lot of videos, then I suggest another external webcam.The mousepad does not cause any friction and is very smooth, but has a pattern on it.-SPECIAL-The laptop has the mousepad section of it raised, for better ergonomics.-SOFTWARE-The laptop is loaded with lots of Sony's software, bloatware to some people. They are easy to uninstall.Another feature I really liked is the Vaio Gate, which is Sony's dock for easy access to extra applications, folders etc.-CONS-After some time, the laptop takes longer and longer to boot. You may need an internal SSD [which can be quite pricey]-OVERALL-Overall, it is a great all-purpose laptop, which is dedicated towards light multimedia users.
