I've been looking for a PC equivalent of the MacBook Air since...forever.  But so far, nobody has been able to combine light weight, big screen size, and affordability.  I've looked up and down, and only the R705 can beat the MBA.Pro:1) Only a feather heavier than the MBA 13";2) But has twice the specs in CPU, hard drive, and RAM.3) Also has eSATA, SD reader, HDMI, DVD burner, WiMax and one more USB port.  MBA = nada.4) In case you haven't noticed, it's so much more affordable.Con:1) It's not sexy like the MBA.  You're not going to fall in love with it.  Strictly a workhorse.2) Power adapter is still the same brick that Toshiba has been including for the past 10 years.  No innovations there.  Cable management definitely needs improvement.This is THE laptop to get if you need a light but powerful travelling laptop!
