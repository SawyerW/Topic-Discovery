Well I just read some of the reviews and felt an urge to write one of my own. I didn't purchase the lenovo laptop from amazon. I actually purchased directly from lenovo. I bought the i7 500g model.Positive; So far everything is working fine. Boot up time is acceptable and it is quite fast. Also, it runs cool to the touch. Finally, I've had no problem with the battery and connectivity at my house or a friendNegative; I haven't figured out how to type and not touch the track pad. I've just disabled it and I'm working with a mouse. Also, the cd/dvd runs loudConclusion; Overall I give it 4 stars. However I want to say I've only had the laptop since 4/19/12. So hopefully my review will remain the same
