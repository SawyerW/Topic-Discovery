This computer is the second favorite gadget I've ever owned behind my first iPod Touch.  There's just a novelty and a fondness to everything that I could do with that little iPod that I'll not soon forget.  With that, this little laptop is more capable than any other computer that I have ever owned.  It only weighs about a half a pound more than an iPad 2 and gets 2 more hours on a charge (12 hours) thanks to the Haswell processor that was introduced with the mid-2013 update.  This is also my very first Mac and it couldn't be a better choice.  I can't say enough about this machine!
