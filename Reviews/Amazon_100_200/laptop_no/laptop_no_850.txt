Let me preface this by saying I own this and other apple products. They do make a good product. However, there are a handful of things that must be mentioned before dropping a grand on a laptop that probably won't live up to the hype.If you like to play games, this is not the laptop for you.If you want to run most productivity applications, this isn't what you want.The cost of accessories is ridiculous. Don't lose or break your charger, you'll be out the cost of a netbook to replace itIf you're planning to use this for business, you won't be able to do most of what you need to with it. Almost all business applications are written for windows - not mac.It's not as tough as advertised. Mine is kept in a $150 padded backpack case and never leaves my house and somehow it has two bent corners on the cover.This machine can't do anything that a less expensive windows laptop can doThey boot slowHonestly, I gave this to my wife because all she wants to do is facebook, and I bought this instead:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FU83YWS/?tag=theprescat-20
