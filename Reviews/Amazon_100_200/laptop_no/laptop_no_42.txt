I ordered my Ibook on the 5th of Dec.2003 received it on the 10th. Right out of the box it malfunctioned so they offered to repair it.  That was the 10th of Dec.  Now its Jan, 5/2004 still not fixed.  I've talked to so many diff customer service represents, they are all courteous but none of them know whats going on.  For about 15 days in Dec. the laptop was lost!!! they had no idea where it was.  They are always trying to transfer you to another person who is just as unhelpful and would put me on hold hours at a time.  I even spoke to one person who kept on refering to Apple as Phillips and I would correct him every now and then asking him, Dont you mean apple?  I mean come on!! at least know what company you work for.  I tried returning it but they wont let me on technicality and I had it for less than 2 days.  Talk about frustrating experience..go get a dellterrific customer service and you actually get to talk to people who know the name of their own company.
