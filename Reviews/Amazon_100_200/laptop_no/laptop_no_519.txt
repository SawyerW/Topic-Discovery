As a graduate student my main concerns in a laptop are size and weight (I need to carry much more in my bag than laptop/power cord), and battery life (I'm not always in places I can plug in, and I need more than 45 minutes unplugged).  I looked into the netbooks, which would have fit those criteria, but I was given this laptop instead.  I am so HAPPY with it.  It's much better than a netbook, which would be made cheap to be less than a laptop.I don't get the stated 8 hour battery, even after altering the power settings, but I do get about 6, and so far that's plenty for my long days.  The laptop is so light I forget I'm carrying it, and I can still fit several other things in my messenger bag.
