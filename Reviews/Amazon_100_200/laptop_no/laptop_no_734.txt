I bought this laptop back in June and it looked great. Out of the box it was a bit slow, thinking it was due to all the preloaded junk new computers come with, but after I uninstalled some, the computer still wasnt as fast as I thought it would be, considering the specs. Alright, that's ok. Four months later though, I feel like this computer's speed sucks major. To put this into perspective, I don't even have many files on this laptop (everything is on my google drive or google play, so no documents or music files) or any major program (I dont even own microsoft word, sadly), I don't use photoshop or play computer games, I just use this laptop to casually surf the web and use google documents to write my school work. Casually, I can barely go on tumblr because the pages just never load, those gifs or whatever constantly lag and freeze, Youtube is a joke because NOTHING loads, facebook takes forever, and overall.. I am disappointed. Maybe I got a defective laptop shipped to me or something but... this sucks :(
