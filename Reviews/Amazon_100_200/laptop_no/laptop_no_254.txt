I bought two of these D620 laptops when they went on sale briefly at Best Buy for 299.00 a piece.  I bought two 19.00 1 gig memory modules to upgrade them to 2 gig.  The back panel is a little tricky to remove, so be careful.  Otherwise, the design is solid and this D620 is a much better acquisition than a Netbook, in my opinion, as the 4 pound 14 inch monitor is light but not at all bulky.They are well worth the three hundred dollars with DVD read-writable/Vista Home Basic, etc.  They are made of solid plastic and unless you drop them they should be fine.As for selling one for 499.00?  Well, there are probably fifty better laptops in between 299 and 499 you could buy.a D620 only has2 USB ports and no webcam and with only 1 gig, they are a deal at 299.00, not a deal at much more than that.jhA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez
