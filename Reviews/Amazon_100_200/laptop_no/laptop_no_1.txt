I have experience with almost every OS out there.  I purchased Andriod and iPad, looking for the perfect flexible, easy to use PC replacement.  No luck. Even a Bluetooth keyboard its not enough to replace the PC as a heavy typing/real work tool.So I purchased a Samsung 5 550.  I already used Google Apps extensively, and this was a natural extension.CH Rome's book gave me a fantastic look into the concepts and methods of using ChromeOS, as well as a detailed step-by-step method for using it.  It actually changed how I use computers.  My 'My Documents" folder is now my Google Drive folder and I have file access from my PC, Chromebook, iPhone, iPad, and any PC I log into.I use the Chromebook as the heavy typing tool now, as its so fast and easy to start and stop, and stay where I was. I use a wireless mouse with it, and it feels so comfortable!  I could not have known all these capabilities were there without the book.  I can honestly say that less than $6 and a few hours of reading changed a huge aspect of my life.  Not many books can boast that claim.
