If you are a touch typist with adult fingers, you will find both keyboard and mousepad very disappointing.Both features are presented in smooth plastic.  The keys are not concave and are very small.  The mousepad is only slightly rougher than the overall surface.  Owning to this poor quality, a good typist (and I am a good one -- 120 WPM) makes many 'mistakes.'What is worse, the mousepad supports squeezing and scrolling and is hypersensitive to these.  You cannot turn these features off, even if the control claims you can.  So, the cursor flies all over the screen and images fades to unreadable, then to oversize, with no control.Otherwise, the laptop actually works.
