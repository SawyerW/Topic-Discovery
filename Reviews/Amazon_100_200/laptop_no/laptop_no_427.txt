I bought this laptop for my daughter for a graduation gift, she absolutely loves it. This laptop is soo much faster than one that I bought for myself 2 1/2 yrs ago (for the same price). Windows 7 home prem is way better  and more user friendly than the vista home basic that I have on mine. Starting up is super fast and surfing the web is so much more fun when you don't have to wait for the pages to load up. We did have a problem with our USB port, a piece broke off inside...we contacted the vendor and was given a repair # and info and was asked to send it in for repair. Sent it on a saturday, they received it on the following tuesday and we got it back the following tuesday all fixed (we were out of the cost to send it to them $36). I have no regrets buying this laptop.
