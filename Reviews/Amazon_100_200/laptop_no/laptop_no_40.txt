I'd have been beside myself happy if the internet worked faster than it does. With that exception, I love this computer. I bought it for myself so I could write reports. Though my last two computers were not apple, I was raised and used to apple computers nonetheless. I haven't used one though, in many years. However, despite all that time, I eased right back into the comfort of using an apple as if no time had passed at all. It actually felt like coming home.  Anyone who has grown accustomed to working on an apple computer knows exactly how that feels. Regardless of how far they've come, the basics are all there in this ibook. It's very comfortable to work on. All apples are, as I say, are idiot-friendly, that even a monkey could use them. If you're looking for comfort, ease, a wide variety of necessary and extra programs, and versatility for a very low price, you've found it in this ibook. Love it!
