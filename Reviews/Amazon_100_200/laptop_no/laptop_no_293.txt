I bought this laptop from a different retailer several months ago. I am extremely happy with my purchase! The only thing that that could be improved on is the sound which could be a little louder. I LOVE that this has the HDMI port (this was actually the main reason I chose this!) By connecting an HMDI cable from my laptop to TV, I am able to surf the web on a 50 inch screen (as well as watch movies, etc). I noticed that someone commented on the keyboard - personally, I have had no problems. My mom has Rheumatoid arthritis and uses my laptop frequently with no complaints. I think the keyboard is really cool! Plus if you shop around you can get a keyboard skin for under five bucks (The EB series fit perfectly!) I use this laptop for everything - school (Microsoft office), graphic design(Photoshop), and download many things to the hard drive. It has continued to run flawlessly! Also, there is an "assist" button that connects you with live help from Sony 24/7 (It's free, I use it all the time!) I highly recommend this laptop!!
