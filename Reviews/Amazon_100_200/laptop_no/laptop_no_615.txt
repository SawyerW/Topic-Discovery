I got my new HP laptop for day one (it is not from Amazon) and HP tricked me to have a antivirus software installed upon software installation.What really dirty here is they also ship a bunch of software fully of trojan horse and virus in the default software package. So when I try to use the internet browser for the first surf, the antivirus software jumps out like a gang and blocks me from doing anything, including uninstall it!  Every time, I am forced to enter a page asking to pay $69.99 for their stupid and buggy software. Am I going to pay you the $69.99 stupid money that you are begging for?  NO!  I return this crap back to you.It also reminds me another HP printer I had that it expires its ink box after a few months and I cannot print if I don't buy their ink. The reason is to "Guarantee print quality". Come on, it's back ink!HP is running DIRTY business. It cheats, it begs. it sucks. It ties to dishonestly play dirty game with customers.I want to let everyone know, get away from it!  It should go to the hell.
