I got this laptop for college because of the i5 processor (art major), light design, and favorable design. However, within a week the touch pad started acting up. It would stop working for periods of time during class and the only way to get it to work again would be to put the laptop to sleep and then wake it up again. It was not an issue with the lock feature in the corner, the touch pad just became completely unresponsive (buttons and all). I tried changing preferences and settings, but even when the problem was there the computer would not detect something was wrong. I ended up returning it within the week and buying a replacement. This time, it didn't take even 24 hours for the same problem to happen again, this time much more frequently. Not even two days old, I'm returning it tomorrow and getting some other computer. Never again, HP.
