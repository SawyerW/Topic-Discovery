This is the first ThinkPad I bought for myself, the other three that I have been used in the past eight years were provided by the company I worked for.Decision making was easy:1. Overall lowest cost: after deducted the costs for 3-year warranty, high resolution LCD screen, Windows XP Pro, slim and light-weight design and quality material.2. Proven reliability: this means there won't be extra costs to burden my 3-year ownership.3. Excellent technical support (I called IBM technical support once in August, one month after I got T41, and was surprised that the tech. support rep. picked up the phone right the way and guided me step by step to go through the problem I had. They even followed up with a call to confirm the problem has been solved!Yes, I am more than happy to recommend IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) to you. However, the best buy is with $100 rebate from Amazon.
