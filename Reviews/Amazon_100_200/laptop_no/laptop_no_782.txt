I don't usually write reviews, but after owning this laptop for a bit over 6 months I felt compelled to give it the glowing review it deserves. This is simply a fantastic machine.Pros:Speed! With the SSD, everything is so snappy and waking up the laptop is virtually instantaneous.Trackpad is second to none. Make sure to configure custom gestures for common tasks.Battery life is absurdly long under normal use conditions. After 6 months I'm still getting 8+ hours per charge.Great looking screen with high brightness.Lightweight while still feeling really solid & sturdy.OS X is a pro for me.Cons:Bigger SSD is unjustifiably pricey.Speakers are just okay.
