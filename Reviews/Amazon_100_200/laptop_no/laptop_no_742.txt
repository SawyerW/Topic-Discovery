Bought three of these units from Tech For Less, they had great pricing and shipping service. Only later did I discover that in one of them the webcam and microphone were inoperative. After doing most testing it appears that the ribbon cable is not connected properly. Rather difficult to get at and re-insert. May need to go back to HP to be repaired. Notice that this was a complaint in one of the other reviews. Check this if you buy one.Otherwise, and maybe because of the webcam issue, the machine boots very slowly. After booting up, it seems fast enough. TheBeat audio is ok, but the "subwoofer" bass is virtually non-existent and over all the output through the beats  audio system speakers seems pretty weak. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Works fine with headphones...Unfortunately the "Bright Screen" has the typical problems for this type, severe glare in virtually all lighting situations. Anti glare screen is available, but at a very steep price.I did appreciate the 9 cell battery, while it is heavier, the additional available battery life is worth it.  However this laptop is not a lightweight so would not be so great for a true road user.
