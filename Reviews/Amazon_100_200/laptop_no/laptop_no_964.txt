The last time I had a MacBook was the 13" white one that came out in 2007. I LOVED that. After it got stolen a few years later I went back to being a PC user with an HP. I guess I came back to Mac with expectations or something but there's something that's not fulfilling me with this laptop which I don't remember having with the old Macbooks.. sometimes images don't load when I'm using Safari and Chrome. There seems to be a lot of times when the mouse disappears or things just take forever to load or type in programs and the internet.. otherwise I do love it!
