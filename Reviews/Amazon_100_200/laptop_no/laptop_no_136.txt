I purchased this computer in September, 2008.  Though it is vista, I have not had any problems.  The 3 gigabytes of ram are plenty for vista. I have enjoyed the perks that slow down vista because this computer has enough ram that it doesn't slow it down.  I still find it faster than my 1 gigabyte ram XP netbook.  I do not play video games with this computer (only simple games like the ones from addictinggames.com), so I don't know how good it is for that (it is not meant to be a gaming computer), but it is good for watching TV and movies online.  The best part is if you upgrade windows to a 64 bit, you can add 5 more gigabytes of ram!  As I mentioned in my title, my computer has been running great for over 3 years.
