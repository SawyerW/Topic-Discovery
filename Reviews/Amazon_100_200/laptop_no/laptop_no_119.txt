I just got this computer and I love it already. The keys are made from very soft rubber and the size of the letters are big enough for me to push every single individual buttons. The best thing is that it has wifi connection that immediately connected to my router. It has a CD/DVD drive for movies and music. It even has all the microsoft office applications for school or projects. The only problem I have is that it's a Windows 2000(which I will be upgrading to Vista), and the touch pad is not very sensitive to touch so I have to press down on it a little more than on my old computer. I would recommend to someone else though.
