This is the older 11 inch Air, but other than no back-lit keyboard ( which is in the new one )...my biggest gripe with this machine is the weak battery life. I'm not sure what the point of an ultra portable machine is if you have to be close to a plug and carry around the charger. Also, overall the machine just seems cramped and compromised.  It's a very fancy netbook. Which is fine, but possibly not for the cost. This is my first Apple computer. I suppose I'm not used to paying the Apple tax on Apple products, since a similar PC laptop would be easily half the cost.With a better battery life and lower cost, this would be a five star product.
