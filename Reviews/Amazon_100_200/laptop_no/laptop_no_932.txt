The last time I remember using a Mac was back in 8th grade.  It's been so long since I've touched a Mac until now.  I got sick of my PC laptop keeping giving me issue, so instead of buy another PC, I'd decided to switch over to Mac.First impression, it feels so "fluid" when using it compare to PC.  Everything just runs too smooth!  One thing I do notice a difference was the keyboard layout, they're a bit spread out from one key to the next.  For PC laptop, their keys seems to be so close to one another! This will be new for me to adopt to.  Other than that, I decided to upgrade the memory to 8GB from Amazon.  If you're into photo/video editing, I suggest you to do this, other than that it won't be necessary if you use this just to run basic things (music, browse, YouTube, typing).Its not even a week, and all I can say from 10+ years of using PCs is that it's totally worth it.  Very durable and great product to invest in over the time!
