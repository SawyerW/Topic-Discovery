WARNING! Purchased this HP laptop after being told HP corrected their problems with too-hot batteries burning up the hard drive and/or other internal components. This battery is outside the laptop on bottom back and is designed to raise the computer and increase air flow to prevent overheating. IT DIDN'T WORK!!! Technicians tell me consistently to avoid HP computers now (at one time they were the favorite recommended product). HP purchases cheap internal components to build their computers. They break, overheat, and cause your computer to crash. Mine died this week after less than two years (20 months) of light to moderate use. Product worked beautifully at first. After 9-10 months it consistently began to run slower and make noise when it ran. I have limited programs installed and have had computer specialists clean, defragment, etc... numerous times to guarantee the issue is not one of maintenance. NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT. This is the third similar HP laptop experience in our family. We will not be purchasing HP computers in the future.
