The computer worked great for 4 weeks (January 2012), but then completely died on me.  None of the power indicators will light up.  I bought this computer since Lenovo has an international warranty and I knew that I would be travelling overseas.  I called the Australia Lenovo and they told me that they cannot repair since that model is only sold in the USA.  Well, that defeats an international warranty, huh.  Furthermore, I had a friend here in Australia and has a similar model and her computer died within 2 weeks of purchase  (Lenovo Australia was willing to fix that one).  A search on internet brings up many more cases.  Obviously, there is a major defect in this model.
