I got this laptop about 3 months ago and all I can say is that a big SUPERB. I use to be a PC but I found all the things that I am looking for about this laptop but please don't get me wrong ok?. I really love and enjoy it, it's faster which I really like most, very efficient etc. but I need some more knowledge to gain, like I said it's my first time to be a Mac. For all the people who wants a super machine, try this and you won't regret it.Thank you so much APPLE so Good luck......
