Anyone not being honest is you.....People I wouldn't go through this if it weren't true....This man need to tell the truth he sold me a non working computer, I sent it back and he is lying saying he never received it...I can only warn you guys one time so if you still give this man your business beware...If you do make sure you send it back priority mail so you can have a tracking number to follow it...that's the mistake I made by sending it through regular mail...he can deny and use it against you and say he never received it..That's why I am going through this now but, if you feel you need to steal my money you must really need it!...Just know Karma is real and what goes around comes around!
