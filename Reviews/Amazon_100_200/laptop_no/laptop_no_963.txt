I've had so many laptops and desktops and nothing beats a Macbook! I've had my Macbook Pro for two years already and it works just as good as when I bought it. I've always had issues with PCs slowing down and getting viruses, but not with my Macbook. It definitely is expensive but it is well worth it! The Macbook Pro is durable and sturdy. The software is wonderful and easy to use. I have nothing to complain about my Macbook. The only thing that went wrong was my hard drive went faulty after a year but it was so easy and cheap to replace it with a new one. I haven't had any problems since. I hope to get many more years out of it.
