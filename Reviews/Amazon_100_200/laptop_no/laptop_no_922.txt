It was time to replace my 8 year old laptop and I decided to get a "fancy" Mac Book Pro. You get what you pay for, right? WRONG! If you like your Windows 7, Vista or even XP, just stick with it. Any of those are way simpler to use than Apple's Mountain Lion operating system. Mac is complicated and frustrating at moments. I watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough. I'm a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me. Windows operating system is a superior product by far. It's actually very obvious. Just look at a market share between the two concepts. I should have known better. I hope you don't make the same mistake...
