I bought this computer for general use. I talked to one of my friends who works on technology and he suggested the Lenevo brand because as of right now Lenevo is rated in the top 3 laptop brands. I love it! it's light, the speakers are loud, and it is good quality. the backspace and number pad are a little smaller than normal but then again most laptops don't have a number pad. And sometimes the mouse turns into automatic mode..that might be able to be adjusted just haven't taken the time to see if it can or not...It is my first laptop...but have used many other people's and for the price it is great. i did pay $419 on amazon so was a little upset when i saw it was cheaper but oh well. hope this helped
