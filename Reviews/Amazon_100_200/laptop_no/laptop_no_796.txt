I've been hoping my old Dell laptop would die and FINALLY the hard drive crashed so I had my excuse to get what I've been wanting for years - my own MBA.  I love it!  I abhor trackpads on Windows machine so I bought the smart mouse with it.  Well, other than checking to see if it worked, haven't used the mouse since.  The smart trackpad is incredible,  Lightweight, it's not much heavier than my iPad but does a heck of a lot more.  I wish it had the battery life of the newest version but a few hours still isn't all that bad for a laptop.  I'd rate this ten stars if I could.
