I bought this for my 16 year old for his birthday. He destroyed it, it no longer even has a screen. But that wasn't the laptops fault, the boy is reckless. The laptop did stand up to an incredible amount of accidental abuse. And still ran fast, till the poor thing died. If you want something with speed, for downloads, FB and email, this is a very good product. I myself prefer desk top and its the only reason I didn't buy one for myself. As for my son, he is now 18 and I will not buy him another. Next one he gets he'll use his own cash.
