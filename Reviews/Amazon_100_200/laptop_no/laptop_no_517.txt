I received this laptop 5 days ago and I think it is great! I am a student, so laptop's speed and portability were two "must have" qualities.It is very light, fast, screen is very bright and nice as well. The laptop has an eco button that makes the screen less bright and saves energy and battery life. So far I haven't seen anything I didn't like, but I am definitely not a computer pro, so for a regular consumer I think it is a great choice. The only thing some might not like is that the keyboard is glossy and you can easily see fingerprints on it but it doesn't bother me much at all.
