If you are considering buying this notebook you need to know limitations are the hardware and the software.Hardware:  I bought this notebook because I wanted a mirror image of the one given to me by my employer.  What I found out is the one I purchased from Amazon (same model as my employer's laptop) DID NOT come with a built in webcam.  Of course, my work around was to use an old webcam that I had resigned to the back on a drawer.  If would have be nicer if the one I got off of Amazon had the built in webcam.Software: The Amazon notebook machine came with VISTA Business 32-bit OS.  It is ok but one must work overtime to network it with my other machines running Windows 7.  Plus, it is only 32-bit running on an 64-bit architecture.  It works but could be better if the machine came with W7.  When time permits, I'll ghost it with my own W7 professional disk.With W7 professional installed, the two machine will be almost twins (no built in webcame for one).
