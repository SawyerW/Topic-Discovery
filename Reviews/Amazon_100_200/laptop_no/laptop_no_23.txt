Wow.  I'm also surprised at all the negative reviews.  Maybe I just got lucky, but this laptop has done everything I expected it to.  Keep in mind that I've had it since March of this year... so that's a good 9 months of use.  It's perfect for my school assignments.  It runs things I need like MS Visual Studio just fine.  And I can bring it to school without the power cord, knowing that I will have enough power to last me several hours.I even played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and City of Heroes on it over the summer break.  For CoH, I had to kind of tweak the video card a bit... but that appears to be a known issue with customized laptop video cards (Mobility Radeons, to be precise).Overall... I love this laptop.
