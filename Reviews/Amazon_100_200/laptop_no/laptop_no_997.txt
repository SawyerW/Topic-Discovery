I cannot speak highly enough about my new  Apple Mac Pro 15 Inch Laptop - mid 2012 edition. It is quite simply the best. Yes, it's very expensive, but like the old saying goes - you get what you pay for. Apple has made a working work of art. The Mac Pro is simply beautiful and the quality is unmatched. The trackpad is so amazing, that words alone do not do justice to it's simplicity and effectiveness - you have to use it, to fully appreciate it. The design is clean and functional. The aluminum body exudes quality, ruggedness, and coolness. The pre-loaded software is awesome. iTunes alone defies comparison to anything. This laptop is a pleasure to use. It is addictive to use, from the light touch of the keypads, to the beautiful screen, to the ridiculous apps you can download - many free. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who appreciates a very, very high quality product and will take of it. I am a new Mac addict.
