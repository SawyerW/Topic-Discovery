Well, it wasn't a T41, it was a T40...and the Wifi didn't work at all...there was no screw holding the HD in the  case...the RAM was agonizingly low, can't believe that it came from the factory this way, but, after bloat and XP Pro SP3,  it  c r a w l s....BUT, better days ahead!{And Jenny, I absolve you Sister, and beg your pardon, and no, that wasn't a joke...I want your forgiveness at this point...I'm the one who needs it not you...I was very wrong to the way I did, and again no, the money going for other peoples gifts at this stage'Don't worry about the laptop, I have a friend with cancer who might like to play with it or something...he might put a bigger HD in it and use it as a LINUX machine, but, I don't think that will happen; he hates IBM more than he hates working of Fords...Yours TrulyRaymond M.
