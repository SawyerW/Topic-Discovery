I am very pleased with this laptop.  Graphics performance at max video options on all the games I own is flawless.  The cooling system utilizing the rear vents is brilliant, and allows full gaming performance without the laptop becoming a hotplate.  Compared to other laptop models in the same price range the features and performance are head and shoulders above the rest.  I strongly recommend this box to gamers looking for a portable powerhouse.The only downside to this laptop was that I had to wait a few weeks until the order backlog caught up, but it appears that Amazon currently lists it as in stock.
