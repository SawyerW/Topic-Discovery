I purchased this item based on the financing offer of 12 months compared to the 2011 models that are only for 6 months. It is easier to pay off, and I compared the new model to this 2.66 version which loads just as fast as the 2011 level. It is also 350GB space like the 2011 version and the 2.66GHZ speed is great! Even if the new model has Intel 5, it doesn't really matter because the 2011 macbook has a sucky-sucky graphics card compared to the great Nvidia which has crisp bright colors that are just breathtaking! Yes It only has one processor but I am absolutely amazed how fast this laptop is. You have to see it for yourself and video editing is so easy and so smooth! Well Of course all Macbooks are made in the premium line of laptops and this was a great purchase for me! Way lower price and great deal on amazon + great financing offer + discount promotion! = Happy Customer!
