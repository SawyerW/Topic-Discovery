I just bought a 4720 ProBook. The display is not nearly as good as the 6 year old Compaq laptop it was intended to replace. The colors are washed out, and increasing  or decreasing the brightness doesn't help. Also, looking at the screen and moving side to side, the image is OK. But if you change the angle of the screen even slightly, i.e. slightly open or close the lid, the image becomes too dark or too light. I had expected the technology to have improved over 6 years, but in this case it has gotten worse. I wish I had read about this problem in reviews, but I didn't see anyone pointing it out.If you don't care about image quality, the computer is probably fine. If you do, don't buy it.
