While the listed $394 price tag is not that extreme, take that listed "$204 off" from a 599.99 base price with a grain of salt.Overall the reliability record of Toshiba Satellite machines has been quite solid, ranking alongside Asus and Sony in as the best terms of malfunction rates despite some of the lowest prices, so taken from that aspect this is a great budget machine that won't get too hot or eat too much power.That said, the price is somewhat in line with sale prices you can find of machines one step above this in terms of specs (dual core processor's with 3 gigs of RAM).If you can find it for $329 or less and don't have needs much heavier than web-browsing/word processing/maybe playing (if you purchase a pair of speakers or at least headphones) than this could be the perfect machine for you.At $394 however you can probably do better, and if you want to be able to play games a couple years old, use photoshop, mutlitask, etc. then you are probably best of looking for a machine just a touch more powerful than this.
