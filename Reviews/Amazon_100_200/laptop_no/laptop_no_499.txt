Edit August 2013: This laptop has been toast for months now, with the same problem as my previous HP laptop: a bad fan. Unfortunately, you can't replace the fan without ripping the entire laptop apart (I successfully did this with my old one, but it took many hours). I watched my laptop overheat more and more often until a mere flash video was enough to do it. I finally ditched it and built a very nice PC. In retrospect, this laptop only deserved 3-4 stars. It was so cheap for its specs when I bought it that I really didn't expect an amazing machine, but for the 2.5 years before the fan broke, I felt like I got a deal. Would I buy an HP laptop again? Probably not. This is the second one I've owned that has had a fan problem, both in under 3 years. It ran very well until the fan broke, though.
