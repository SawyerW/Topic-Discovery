After reading the reviews on this computer, I just want to say that, compared to other laptops from various manufacturers (Apple, HP, Dell, etc.), this computer is by far the most well built computer I have ever come across. I have taken this computer to school with me EVERYDAY for the last 3+ years and not yet has it slowed down, even by the tiniest bit. I've never had any hardware or software problems nor any of the problems that people seem to be complaining about. (FYI-If you treat any computer like a piece of meat, it will break, regardless of who made it). I just wanted to write a positive review about this computer because I am still very happy with its performance (especially being 3+ years old) and do not intend on buying another laptop anytime soon.
