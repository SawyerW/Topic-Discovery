I purchased this laptop directly from hp. In less than a year the battery died, the left mouse pad button was loose, the key board in the upper right corner became unattached, and the laptop made this weird buzzing sound. Luckily the warranty wasn't up yet so I received free repair. However, it wasn't long after the repairs that it started giving problems again (the same problems minus the keyboard detachment). I've had this laptop for 3 years. The left mouse pad mutton eventually fell out and now the mother board has crashed (not before costing me hundreds of dollars for repairing it the second time). Two of my friends have the same laptop and they both had the same problems as I did (they have also had their laptops for roughly the same amount of time that I have). One of them is still using hers but I doubt that will last for much longer. I definitely would not recommend this laptop to anyone.
