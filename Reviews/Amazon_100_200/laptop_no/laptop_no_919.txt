Well, it is a very good notebook, specially for mac fans. But something I don't like is how it is insanely overpriced.The components that it has don't cost more than $600 dollars... (Considering all of it, screen, keyboard, all)If you are searching for something as fast, but way less expensive go for an outstanding Windows notebook, but then again, if you were considering buying this, then buy a $1000 dollars notebook, not an $400 dollars one. Because many users say Windows is bad, as they buy $200-$300 dollar Notebooks.Now if cash is not a problem for you, then just go experience Windows 8 and Mountain Lion OS, as you just need to know which ones fits you better.
