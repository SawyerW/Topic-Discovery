I bought this computer 12/10/10 and it is still going strong.  I have a little trouble with one of the USB ports on the right side, but if I jiggle it around a bit it starts working.  I used it for work for about 6 months and it performed wonderfully.  I've been using it lately to buy and sell on e-bay and is doing great for that.  I'm not very computer literate, but I know when something works well for me. I also do a lot of gaming and it works pretty well for that, is a little slow for some games.
