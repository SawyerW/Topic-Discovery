I bought a Macbook Pro MD101LL/A from Amazon-- reasonable good laptop-- price ok but not awesomely low.In Indian rupees, price for getting delivered in USA was around Rs.67,000 at that time's exchange rate-- when I had the impression I wont get it in Delhi for anything less than Rs.83,000.Later I met a guy who bought the same from a shop in Bangalore-- 6 months before I bought from amazon (ie: may 2012) for around 63,000.As a machine-- it is ok/good-- reliable, good battery life; but I personally bought apple out of compulsion (needed for ios development) rather than for any love of apple.
