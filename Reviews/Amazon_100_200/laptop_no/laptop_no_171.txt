After doing some research, I purchased this computer based on techs and price.  My last laptop was a Dell.  I thought I had made a good decision only to have a key pop off within 2 months.  To get this fixed, I would have to send the computer back to HP and it was not worth the inconvenience of not having my computer to have it repaired.  My computer is now over a year old and out of warranty.  I just found out that my battery failed and will cost $122 to replace.  The battery has a very short life as it is not an Li-ion battery.  Overall, I wish I had spent a few more $$ to get a higher quality product.
