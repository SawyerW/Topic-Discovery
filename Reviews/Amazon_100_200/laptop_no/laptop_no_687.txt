Dell needs to get their act together. A lot of their laptops no longer work with non-OEM batteries, meaning that when your battery no longer holds a charge (usually happens in a year or two, depending on your use), you have to shell out a hell of a lot of money to buy an original Dell battery. You won't be able to use a non-OEM battery (which would be much cheaper). You will get this error message if you try to use a non-Dell battery in a Dell laptop:"the model number for the primary battery cannot be determined. This will prevent any battery present from charging. Please insert a Dell battery for best system operation."I'm never going to buy another Dell laptop. This is a deal-breaker for me.
