I really like this computer even though I am new to Windows 7.  I love the sound system - so much better than my Sony Vaio.  I like the screen size but its a little heavy due to the battery.  Overall I think I will be very satisfied with this model.  Consumer reports gave it a good rating for this screen size and overall Toshiba has the lowest repair rate - also according to consumer reports.  The missing star in my rating is just because its heavier than I am used to.I had one difficulty and that was my old wireless router wasn't allowing this computer onto the network.  It was found, but it couldn't connect.  I recommend you call the manufacturer of the router because I had to download a newer driver so it could work.  It cost me $98 but Toshiba couldn't have solved this problem for me.This seller was a good seller and I recommend them.  I received the computer faster than I had expected.  And it was in its original factory sealed box, well packed in another box.
