After several weeks I finally recieved the laptop. When I first opened the package and took out the laptop it was covered in dirt and specs. All you had to do was just give a quick clean before sending it in the mail. It was obvious that the person did not care so much for the condition of the device. After cleaning the screen and keyboard I was happy to see it would turn on thinking maybe it's not so bad. However it wasn't until i took the charger out I realize the battery was already dead. So now I need to keep it plugged in at all times or else it would shut down and completely restart then reset itself. Now I have to save up and buy a battery for the laptop. Makes me wonder if I should've just kept saving to buy a new one instead of this one.
