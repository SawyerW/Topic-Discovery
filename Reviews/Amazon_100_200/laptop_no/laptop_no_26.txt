This is a wonderful little machine. Very speedy and the keyboard is absolutely fantastic. The build quality is excellent and the aluminum casing exudes class. Compared to the first 12-inch PowerBook, it runs cooler and is quite a bit snappier. Plus it supports DVI out and USB 2.That said, its battery life and Airport range are not quite as good as an iBook's. So unless you're going to do a lot of serious video/graphics work, you may want to consider one of the new G4 iBooks -- they're great machines for the price.Really, you can't go wrong either way, depending on your needs.
