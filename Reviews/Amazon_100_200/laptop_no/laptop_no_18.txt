I personally love this laptop....it's the best i've seen. 1.33ghz. Great speed. Lots of memory and love the Airport Extreme. One thing I don't like is the case. Your fingerprints will show like crazy but, don't worry about that..It's still good. I'm already burning movies in the first month. Love the Garageband, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD. Great stuff comes with this computer. I just preorded Microsoft Office v. X. I'm sure I'll love it. Anyway, overall...I give this computer 4-stars. If the case was better...5 ALL THE WAY.P.S. Be sure to get the extended warrenty...you may need it. My 800mhz iMac just broke and I was 2 days away from my policy expiration date. Good thing i kept the receipt.
