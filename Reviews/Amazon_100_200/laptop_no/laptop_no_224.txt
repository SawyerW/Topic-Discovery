If you decide to buy a MacBook this one will give you a provide a lot of value and you can get it for a great price. I have used this Mac for over three years now and I am very happy with the product. It has held up physically to the demands I have placed on it - the case provides adequate protection. The software has also held up - the computer continues to function at a high level and I am able to update to the latest and greatest software.This computer has been very functional for me and has allowed me to do everything I have wanted with it. I would highly recommend this version of the MacBook.
