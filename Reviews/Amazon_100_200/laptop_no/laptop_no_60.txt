I bought this Toshiba about a year ago and it is the best laptop I have had. After you have used it for a while you will know what I'm talking about. The speed for the amount of memory amazed me. My roommate has a laptop with 3GB Ram and it is no faster. She was upset because she paid more and has better stats but my laptop is better. Her DVD drive also went out after 6 months of use. This Toshiba is quality. I have never had a problem with it and even though its a little older it runs like new. Decent screen display for a older computer but still not what you will get on a new $800 dollar laptop. Sound quality is decent and gets pretty loud. It just feels sturdy when you use it. It stays much cooler than most laptops under heavy use as well which may have a lot to do with its longevity. I think for the money you couldn't ask for more. If you are looking for a good day to day laptop look no further.
