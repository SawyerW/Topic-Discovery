I used this computer for work for almost 3 years - and another person at the office used it before me for a while.  Absolutely no issues, computer worked great.  I ran some image-intensive programs on it for a while (Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop 32bit), and it handled them fine.  My main issue long term is I ran out of disk space as there is only about 150GB of disk space.  Gets used up when you start filling up your computer with a ton of large image files.  If you aren't doing stuff like that you'll be fine.  Or you could just buy an external hard drive to store your large files on.Anyway, I don't get all of the negative reviews.  Was not my experience at all.  Both of the computer batteries still work great.  It's not a top of the line laptop anymore, but it gets the job done and appears to be a long-lasting piece of equipment.Edit: January 2013-I gave this to my brother so he could have good personal computer and it's working great for him. He mainly uses it for internet, movies, etc., nothing too crazy.
