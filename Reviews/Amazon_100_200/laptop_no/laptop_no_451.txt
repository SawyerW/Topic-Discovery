After using my brand new MacBook Pro 17" for about an hour, I realized that my wrists and hands were hurting in a way that I had not experienced ever before. The edges of the laptop are razor sharp, seriously, and I had red marks along my wrists that looked as if I had been pressing a razor's edge to them - well, I feel practically suicidal after spending close to 3 grand on this horribly designed (but damned good looking!) computer. It is not even a week old and I want to get rid of it, in favor of a plastic bodied MacBook - or maybe even a PC. My old Powerbook G4 is 500 times more comfortable than this thing. Beware - there are a ton of people complaining about this online if you search for 'sharp edges macbook pro.' I wish I had found this information last week. :(
