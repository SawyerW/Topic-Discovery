I recieved the computer around Dec. 10th from [LaptopExperience.com]. It was given as a Christmas gift on 12/24/12. Thats when it was first used. The ad said "factory refurbished". I have 2 other computers that have been factory refurbished & that have always worked good. Factory refurbished from Dell usually has the same warrenty with refurbished as a new one. The computer I got had a very noisy hard drive and was the definition of slow. It functioned this way until it quit in late Feb. I notified the seller on March 2nd, 2013. I was told it sounded like the hard drive and for only $49.00 I would get a replacement. I got the used replacement, which was just as slow & nearly as noisy, I put it in. So when it quit again on April 24th, I was told it sounded like the hard drive, again, and for only another $19.00 I would get another.  When it quit after it's 3rd start up, I was told if I sent the computer back, it would cost only $40.00 to fix whatever is wrong with it. Not much of a deal after all, huh? Factory refurbished? Don't think so.
