For the money, this is a great laptop. I needed a light-weight, quality laptop for work/graduate work/personal use. This laptop replaced an Apple Macbook Pro 15 inch, which I purchased in 2007 and help up through March of 2013 - which is fantastic in my opinion. I even resold the old one for about $100. I haven't found a MS based product that lasts as long and OSX is user-friendly and just works. Additionally, I saved about $50-75 plus no tax and free shipping. This model comes with 4GB memory, easily upgradable for minimal cost (I've read confirmed reviews of people successfully putting 16GB of memory in this laptop on newegg.com). You can also upgrade the HD for around $160, still significantly less than if you configured it that way from Apple. So far, works like a charm.
