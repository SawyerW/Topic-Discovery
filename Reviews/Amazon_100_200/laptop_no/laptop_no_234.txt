I have had my netbook for around a year, running often at over 100 hours at a time. In all of this time with constant use, I have come across very minor problems.Around four months in, the A/C adapter that came with it had burned out, but I replaced it for relatively cheap with an off-brand adapter.Aside from that, my netbook has occasionally stopped responding to its volume commands, but I found that restarting fixes it.Overall, this netbook is very durable and can be used for extended periods of time. I have yet to overheat mine. I do suggest that you are prepared for replacing the A/C adapter, however.
