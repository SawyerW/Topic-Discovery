I purchased my computer new back in the summer of 2008.  This has been one of the best computers I have owned.  I usually replace my computers every three years however this one works so great I see no reason to make the change.  This computer gets heavy use and works like new.  Its on in my household between 2-4 hours a day without a single issue.  This is my 4th Lenovo, replacing my older T61, and I was thinking about a T410 and see no need.  Nothing special (besides tablets) has been developed to justify a new purchase.  I would highly recommend the Lenovo T400.
