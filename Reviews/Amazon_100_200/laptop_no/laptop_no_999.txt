it's  a great laptop, fast, silent - plays Flash HD content without any noise now.What hasn't been improved is battery life - despite the new Intel platform it's actually slightly worse.It's overpriced too - for same or less  money you can get full HD ANTIGLARE screen and better specs from most competitors.Major problem for me is a glossy screen - even in dark room it reflects any light source directly into eyes - this not just annoying, this is officially bad for human eyes. I will have to return this to get anti-glare version, which is another $200 on top of already steep price - this is just a robbery!
