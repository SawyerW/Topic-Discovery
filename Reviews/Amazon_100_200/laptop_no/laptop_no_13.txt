I have never owned one of these computers, but In school we were assigned a research project to find information on the internet. Our teacher allowed us to use some new Ibooks that our school had just purchased. Everyone was so excited because these computers are so cool looking and everyone thought they were fast. We started our project and quickly realized that these were the slowest computers anyone of us had ever used. We were using wireless internet which may have contributed to the computer's slowness, but still it was pathetic. There were maybe 10 people using these computers and about 2/3 of us abandoned the Ibooks to go use the Imacs that our school got in 1998. It also could have been that (even with nortan anit-virus) these computers are very vulnerable to viruses. I'm not sure about how these computers perform in things other than the internet, but if you are planning to buy one of these Ibooks mainly for use on the internet, I would definitly not recommend this computer.
