I'm a 52 year old who just purchased this new in box. I wanted the dvd superdrive built in, dedicated memory and "older features" as they are now called in 2014. I adore this laptop, am a former Windows user and have always hated it. THIS is wonderful, it NEVER catches a virus, has a beautiful display and is super fast. A 15" display was too big for me as I'm a smaller person and wanted to be able to take this with me without using a larger bag. It's perfect! I purchased a full body hard plastic case with rubber key cover in red and get all kinds of compliments. Macbook Air and the others just won't cut it for me as now you have to buy the super drives separately, ext. This was beautiful and ready to go 5 minutes out of the box! <3
