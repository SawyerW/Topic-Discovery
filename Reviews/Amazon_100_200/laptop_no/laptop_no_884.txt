First, let me say that while yes, I do prefer macs over pc- I have primarily been a PC user so I have plenty of past history. I have owned over 6 windows based laptops and several desk tops over the years- everything from Dells, HP, Toshiba, Sonys, and others. I am a heavy computer user. I program, code, design, compile, create, prepare and abuse my machines (unintentionally of course). Regardless of what I do, the PC never seem to last- I have to upgrade, restore, add memory, etc. and now its almost cheaper to just buy new ones rather than fix up something that is 6 months old.I purchased my first macbook over a year and haven't look back. Its stable, clean, lightweight, and I haven't had a single issue that didn't take me just a few quick minutes to fix. I have now have a 13 and 15 inch and don't go anywhere with them.
