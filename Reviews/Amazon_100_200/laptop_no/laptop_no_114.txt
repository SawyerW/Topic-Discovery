I ordered this ThinkPad T400 on Friday night and I received the laptop at 2:00pm on the next following Tuesday. What could I ask for more with the $220.18 high-end laptop, with no tax, free and fast shipping, and especially it runs so much quieter and so much more reliable than my over-$1800-customized-order HP Pavilion dv9700t CTO (it has been crashed like crazy because of the conflict motherboard and Nvidia Geforce GPU, HP has dropped the ball !) ?!-The laptop came with clean installation and a copy of authentic Windows-OS Disc as refurbished condition from Tampa-Laptop.-This was my first time to buy a refurbished laptop and so far the money was well spent! It just reminded me that the experience of buying a high-end or top-of-line-used cars, that is, you would get enjoying the "high-end/ high quality" for a small fraction of the original price.-The courtesy service from the Tampa-Laptop computer was the reason that I wrote this positive comment.Well, all I could say it: "keep up the good customer oriented service, Tampa-Laptop !"Thanks
