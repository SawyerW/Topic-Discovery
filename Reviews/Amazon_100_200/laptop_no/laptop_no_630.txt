Wow, I've owned about 15 laptops & this is the worst.  The mouse stops working for a few soconds everytime I press a key on the keyboard!  This is unbelievable.  I've had IRQ issues back in the early 90's with old 486's, but come on guys, this is 2013 & Sam's Club dares to sell me this POS laptop?  & how is it that this even has 2.5 stars w/ all the 1 star reviews?  What sort of rating system is that?  This laptop is worthless & now I have to take it back & that really sucks.  I've used it for 30 minutes & I can tell this isn't worth using.  Mouse issues are a NO GO.  Other people say the wifi fries after 3 months?  OMG, Heyallll no.
