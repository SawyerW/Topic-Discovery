I've owned this laptop for 1 1/2 years now.  Now, the keyboard keys have worn to the point where they do not work correctly.  The keys have "loosened up" so that you get 2 letters showing when you press the key only once!  So I'm having to constantly retype my work which is a pain as I do quite a bit of work on the computer.  This has gotten to be so annoying that I've decided to buy another laptop soon and it won't be a Samsung! I believed the glowing reviews about Samsung laptops but based on my first and only experience I will never buy a Samsung laptop again!  Lastly, I should mention the delete button(which most people use a lot) is very small and located at the top right corner of the keyboard.  Hard to find!
