I have had my G42 for about 5 months. I like it, but, I have a problem with the keys. Whenever I am typing something, if I accidentally hit another button, oh my God, I lose everything. It just jumps to another page and I lose my work. I have to be really mindful when I am typing on it. I love the clarity with the webcam, can't beat it.Unfortunately, I dropped it. The screen got busted just from a little drop from the chair. I am very upset that the laptop could not handle be dropped from just a short distance. It was my fault, but, still, it should not have been wasted. I just have to buy a new screen since the hard drive is still working, thank God.I bought mine brand new from Staples for $499.  It's worth that much.
