Bought laptop as floor demo model, thus cheap.  Works well so far.  Fast and good screen.  However, it is limited in its use for multiple activities at once (multitasking).  While I can listen to mp3 audio while I work on something, video and other things are a no no, especially web based like Hulu, youtube, netflix, etc.  Not that it won't play well, but you don't want to do many other things.  Due no doubt to its single processor.So, I recommend this for anyone who needs a reliable fast general purpose (non-gaming or multitasking) budget laptop.  Example, I can run Ubuntu in a VirtualBox VM, but as soon as I start opening browser tabs and Windows Media Player, browse the file system, it starts slowing down.  Unfortunately, most computers are similar, so why pay more?Good for college kids.  Fast but not too fast, so they get into less trouble. (joke).
