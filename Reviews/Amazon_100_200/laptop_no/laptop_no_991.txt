i am a teen so obviously i love laptops but this laptop is the best! ive never had a problem with it! i go on tumblr all the time and its amazing and easy to scroll and use and it not too heavy. i suggest getting a case for it because it does get dirty fast. and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it. the keys get dirty and i need to clean mine but i love my laptop! i use it 24/7 and upload my pictures from my camera using it and yes. i love it. might want a used one because these r expensive! but definitely worth it. :))))
