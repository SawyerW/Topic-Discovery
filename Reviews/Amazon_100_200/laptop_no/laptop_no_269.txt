Bought the laptop as a gift for my Dad. He used it for about a month and problems started almost immediately. It would sometimes not turn on with both battery and charger in place, so he tried starting with charger in, battery out etc. for a few days. Eventually it wouldn't start at all. The screen is now completely blank when the power is turned on, and the Num-lock Caps-lock blink in some error code indication. HP's "Global Warranty" is not global enough for India. HP-India said they will not support this model, HP-US says it must be in the US for them to fix it.HP Quality seems to keep getting worse. This model is considered a mid-range product. I wonder what low range HP's and Compaqs are like. Can Amazon please allow -ve stars?
