This is my first mac notebook. Features that are new to me, and I found extremely useful->Built in webcam that acts as an ambient light sensor when it gets brighter/darker in the room.Backlit keys.Touchpad/trackpad gestures that can be real time savers compared to a full keyboard.The magsafe power adapter is like a magnet connection so if you kick the cord you won't break anything, it will just pop out.Overall, I like it. It's fairly light. I wanted something light with good battery life.  I have to question whether I will use the cd drive very much, but I guess it's cool if I need to rip a cd to iTunes.  The colors on this screen are really great. The keyboard has a nice tactile feel to it as well, I really like it and would recommend it highly to anyone.
