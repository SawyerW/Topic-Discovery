At 1st I wanted to buy a mini because I thought of it being more portable. Then I found out that they are quite slow when you start to add programs like Microsoft office because they are mainly for internet, email, etc. plus they don't come with a CD drive (unless you purchase one separately)But the laptops seemed too big and heavy for me to carry around (student).. After doing tons of research I found this computer. The R705-P35 it's super light, might be as light as a mini. It has tons of memory and it runs many programs at once with no problems. It's quiet, it's thin, and it's pretty small! 13.3in!! So, if you are looking for a mini with the memory of a bigger computer, this is the one for you.Can't say much about battery life because I always have it plugged in, but I will make sure to update if there are any issues.
