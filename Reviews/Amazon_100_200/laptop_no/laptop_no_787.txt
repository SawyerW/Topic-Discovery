Not only does this computer feel well built, the battery lasts as long as an iPad.  I am amazed how I only have to charge it once a week for normal browsing.If you are stuck on picking between a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, just ask yourself if you really ever watch physical DVDs anymore...it's not worth it.Computer boots in around 11 seconds, the flash hard drive is killer fast.  Some may say the 128 GB is small, however I no longer really keep stuff on my hard drive due to iTunes Match and iCloud, and you can always insert a large SD card for additional storage.In regards to the 4 GB of RAM, think about the fact that the computer has a solid state hard drive, which it uses for virtual memory.  4 GB RAM may not sound like much, but having a wicked fast solid state drive for virtual memory will not make it feel like a Mac Mini with 4 GB RAM.  I have 16 GB in my Mac Mini and my MacBook Air is faster.
