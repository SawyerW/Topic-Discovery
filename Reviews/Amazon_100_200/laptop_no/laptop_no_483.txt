I owned the model T410s with the 250gb harddrive last Feb. 2011.  One of the reasons, I decided to get Lenovo because of their tough laptop body design,durability,reliability and after watching a youtube video that demonstrates how tough the T series are. But it was a total deception of product quality. After 2 months of use, the palm rest just suddenly crack.  I called Lenovo and was told that it's not covered by a warranty because I didn't bought one. Probably my mistake, but, most computer manufacturers, cover at least 1 year basic warranty, just like my older HP laptop.  After 6 months of use, the screen bezel followed, with crack at the top left of the screen(see photos).  This laptop is a lemon. I don't carry the T410s anywhere, it always stays in my home office.  Very unfortunate and lesson learned, will never buy a Lenovo product again.  I'm very disappointed.
