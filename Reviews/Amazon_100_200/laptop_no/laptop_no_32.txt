I bought this computer recently after I got my old one stolen. As a college student, this computer has proved to be fast and reliable, though the main two reasons why I didn't give it a 5/5 is because:a)It is pretty bulky by today's standardsb)No S-Video port (a must on most of today's computers, but it does have a VGA port so you can still manage to connect it to other audio/video devices).The speakers that the computer include are not that great, but I already had Z-680's so it wasn't a big deal.The graphics on this computer are pretty good, and it has a decent amount of memory. The DVD burner is also a huge +.
