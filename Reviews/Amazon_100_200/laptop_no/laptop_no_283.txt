I've had this laptop for over a year now. Although initially it just ran fairly hot, after about a year it started overheating regularly with any cpu-intensive game, and even with skype. It idles around 75 degrees celsius as a minimum on battery-saving mode. As of now unless I'm in a really cold room with a laptop cooling pad I can't even put it on high performance power mode without running the risk of overheating with anything more resource intensive than firefox.Also, the battery and adapter stopped working just after the warranty expired.Overall, I'm extremely disappointed. What's the point of having high-end hardware if you can't even utilize any of the power without a significant risk of overheating?Don't think I'm buying an Asus again when I save up to replace this awful laptop.
