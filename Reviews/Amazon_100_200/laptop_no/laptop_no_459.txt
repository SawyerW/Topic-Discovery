Been using the mbp for the last 4 weeks and I never new it could be like this. Once you get past the initial shock of the price you realize quickly that the price is justified. The battery life is awesome, and the light weight rugged design is by far superior to anything I have ever used. My only regret is that I waited this long to cross over. As a full time college student the mbp is the only way to go. In short, the thing dominates. The quality also surpasses anything I have ever purchased from Dell, Toshiba, or Asus. Enjoy...
