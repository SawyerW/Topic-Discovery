Laptop is replacement for 2006 XP.  So far, it is great.  Boots fast, is stable, and maintains wireless connection.  I do not like the add-on software that came with it, though (antivirus, cloud backups, etc. with) which persistently pop up and are "in your face" more now than ever urging you to sign up or buy.  I paid for the laptop and that's all I want and I will shop for whatever I want when I want to. I don't appreciate Dell being sneeky about the hype.  I got a good price through an Amazon vendor and fast, predictable delivery when promised. Windows 7 seems fine but is different than XP and will take some getting used to.
