I had an opportunity to use this laptop or attempted to.  I was tasked with removing a suspected virus from this laptop which was thought to be causing BSOD on startup.  Placed hard drive in another PC to scan for viruses.  None found.  Ran complete system recovery to return system back to factory default condition.  System recovery ran to 100% and upon restart would BSOD before even making it into windows 7 pro.  Replaced memory and hard drive with new.  Ordered recovery CD's from manufacturer.  Thought this has to work.  Same results.  I would not buy this laptop.  Even with new memory, new hard drive and factory recovery CD's this system would not startup even on factory recovery completing to 100%.  The only thing left is to send unit to Sony.  This laptop either has poorly engineered cooling properties or is not truely x64 capable.  I would avoid this laptop.  Valueable advice...anytime you get a NEW laptop.  Make your recovery CD's immediately and then run a complete system recovery to ensure the integrity of your new purchase.  If a NEW laptop cannot function after running complete system recovery, it is not worth keeping.
