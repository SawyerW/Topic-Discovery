I got this Macbook because I like the white polycarbonate more than the aluminum. Also because it was more in my price range. This mac has been great since day one! An upgrade to the memory (to 4 or 8GB) is advisable for a smoother experience. Also, don't listen to the people that say you shouldn't try to play video games on it, I play everything from COD MW3, to The Sims 3 on this little guy! (Admittedly, with graphics turned down to medium). Another great thing is bootcamp, Windows 7 rates this laptop at 5.5, Which isn't bad for a 3 year old computer. All in all, this was a great buy. I'll be using this laptop for at least a few more years!
