I purchased this machine because it has a DB-9 serial port that I need to accomplish my work.It arrived in less packaging than I expected but with no obvious damage. It has performed without error since I opened the box. I use a suite of software that other machines have not been able to utilize and it runs all without issue or complaint. The case is in like new condition something i did not expect from a refurbish.I have no complaints or issues with this machine and would recommend it and the service that refurbished it to all who would ask.
