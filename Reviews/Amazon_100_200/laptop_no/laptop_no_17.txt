I just purchased the newest Powerbook G4 with a stunning 17" display, a blazing fast 1.33GhZ processor and I just haven't been able to put it down. This computer is as well packaged as it is designed. The screen is bright and beautiful. The trackpad is responsive and large enough for even the biggest or the smallest of the hands to use. It has a CD and a DVD burner and not to mention Wireless capabilities built right in it. The coolest new feature I have to say would be the sensor controlled illuminated keyboard that just amazes the heck out of me.The machine is the fastest I have owned and with OS X Panther -- this laptop leaves the rest behind.The only drawback is the price which for some people might be a bit over the top, but considering the product you are getting it is well worth it.An absolute must buy.
