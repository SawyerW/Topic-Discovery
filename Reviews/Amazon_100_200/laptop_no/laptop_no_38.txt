At nearly the 1 GHz speed and with identical specs, this is a great value.  Also, while not mentioned here, this does include all the latest software included with more recent, faster models, including  iLife (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand), AppleWorks, Mac OS X Panther, Quicken 2004 for Mac, World Book 2004 Edition, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, and Deimos Rising.  The hardware is identical to more recent, faster models as well.  Aside from these notes, I can say I'm very impressed with the Mac experience, as this is my first Mac.  The quality of the design of the hardware and software is unending and flawless.  This is a great, lightweight (7.9 lbs) laptop for using to create documents or surf wirelessly.  I highly recommend adding the Airport Extreme card, not included.
