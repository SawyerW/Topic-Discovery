I have to say that customer service for this product is excellent.  If you want to try it, you can be sure that they are reliable about taking it back/issuing a refund.  The only thing is, that the product runs an OS that is not one that is familiar to the general public or easy to use by someone without a software background.  The seller is open about this, so I knew what I was getting into.  It was a nice laptop, sturdy and functional.  A little fading on the keyboard, but otherwise worked well.  I had hoped we'd be able to adjust to the OS, but it was too difficult for us.  And there is no tech support; this OS is one where you get tech support from asking for help on message boards.  If the seller would change the OS to Windows 7 even if he has to increase the price by $50, this would be a great deal.
