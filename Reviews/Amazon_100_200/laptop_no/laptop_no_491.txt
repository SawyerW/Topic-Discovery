People complaing about this laptop over heating are the one's not treating it correctly. Not leaving it on surfaces that it shouldn't be on (couches, cloth, etc) or not using cooler pads and running very hard games might cause over heating. Mine personally has never overheated. I run alot of things at the same time, and the computer is always super stable and never hangs up. This laptop has a very nice, sturdy design. It is rather heavy but I also feel like I could run it over with my car and it would still be ok. I like the customizable lights, the design, the durability, and the specs. I have not had a problem running anything on this laptop that I have wanted to.
