Finally retired my Sony Vaio (850Mhz) and made the switch to a powerbook--wanted to do that ever since I realized that Mac OS X is pretty much BSD Unix with a killer desktop.  What a great machine this is. Much better than the comparable IBook...twice the processor cache for starters...and none of the problems that have plagued the 1Gz iBook.  Weighs just 4.6 pounds and is very portable...aluminium case is very scratch resistant.  I get GREAT range with the add-on Airport Extreme card going to a LinkSys 11g access point (there's an antenna in the lid of the unit).  I'm very happy with the battery life, the operating system, and the apps I use on this machine (Office X mostly).  About a month after getting and using this machine I got a G5 for my desktop and I'm quite happy.  If you're looking for a gaming rig, forget Apple but if you're looking for a business-oriented machine that fits in very smoothly with a PC-based office, this is the ticket. Networks much easier than a Windows machine!
