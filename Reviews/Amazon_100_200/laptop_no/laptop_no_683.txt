Bought one of these a few weeks ago to use for a sports club I administer.  Needed a simple machine to do basic tasks- e-mail, web browsing, word processor....and to run a sports meet software.  Great machine for these basis tasks.  Price point is super, cheaper than many tablets or even in some cases a cell phone, and much more capable.  Tested WiFi in an area where most cell phones and computers have trouble with weak signal, and this works great. Runs cool, battery life even with the basic battery is good, and weight is light enough to make it easily used on a...laptop.  HDMI output is great, I hooked this up to my projector with no issues.  Connectivity options for USB, HDMI, eSATA great for this price range.  Overall this is a great price on a premium brand laptop with super solid features.
