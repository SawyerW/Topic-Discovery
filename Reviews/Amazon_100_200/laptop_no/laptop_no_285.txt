Asus boasts of its 24/7 tech support. Just try the number and see if you can get through. Or, if you speak English, if you can understand the person on the other end. Or if they can understand you, or simply hang up on you.My computer freezes whenever I go to device manager. It has installed multiple copies of every printer but won't let me remove them because device manager stalls. Two weeks now and I have yet to get any work done on this thing because of this issue.The seller said update the bios. But to do that, you need to download a special download manager. And to do that, you need to read Korean, Chinese or Japanese.I cannot recommend this machine or Asus.
