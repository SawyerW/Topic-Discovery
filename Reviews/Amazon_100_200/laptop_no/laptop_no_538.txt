I bought this computer as a floor model from Best Buy almost 6 months ago for $459 and I have to say I've got no major complaints. I primarily bought this for web browsing, Microsoft Office, editing photos in Picasa and my iTunes library. I have had 30 windows open, run iTunes in the background and was typing a document and it could handle it all without lag. I have even run Adobe Photoshop CS3 and it does alright as long as the projects aren't too complicated. I did try the photomerge function (in Photoshop CS3) with 20 photos and then the program finally choked. All in all, if you're looking for web browsing, streaming netflix, a computer for your iTunes library and some basic photo editing with Picasa then this is a pretty darn good computer for the value. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or graphics work. Also, the speakers are pretty quiet so you'll definitely need to invest in some speakers. I picked up a pair of compact USB Insignia speakers so I can travel with them and they work a charm! I would definitely recommend this computer to someone.
