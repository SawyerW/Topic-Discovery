When I first bought it, it gets hot pretty often. Later I installed gfxCardStatus to lock it into integrated graphics only when I'm not gaming, and it completely solved the heat problem. Now it runs cool and the battery seems never run out.my favorite about this laptop is it's large hi-res screen, gives me plenty of space. Also the new lion os x add a new function: when you use four finger swipe upward, then move your mouse cursor to the upper right corner of the screen, an"+" button will show up, if you click it, you can create new desktops, and drag-drop different applications to different desktops. This feature just makes organizing and switching between applications really easy.The speakers on this laptop are also great, the sound is even better than using earphones.
