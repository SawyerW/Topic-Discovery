Got the HP-DV6-6110US after a dissatisfied experience with the Toshiba Satellite L755. Returned the satellite and picked this one up. Has a good build quality. The keyboard layout is a bit strange and needs to get used to. Keys feel a bit sticky compared to my macbook(less then half the price who's complaining). The AMD processor takes care of my needs. Surfing, basic pic editing, word documents,netflix streaming and gaming on onlive. A bit too much of bloatware but easily uninstallable. Most of these cheaper laptops have basic Windows 7 which doesnt let you backup to a wireless network drive. Plenty of connectivity options. Cant beat it at the 449 price I got it at the local staples.
