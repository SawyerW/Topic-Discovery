HP laptop build quality is very poor. I have had two dv-4 laptops (slightly older model than dv-6) that have died due to similar problems, after less than two years. The screen attachment mechanism is not strong, and fails after repeated use. My daughter's computer cracked at this hinge after only a year, and my son's laptop had the video disappear a few days ago, with similar looseness in this hinge area. The computers were bought for Christmas, 2009, less than two years ago. I can't speak for current DELL quality, but I have a 6-year old Inspiron laptop that's still working fine, and a 7-year-old Latitude that is also still plugging along -- so HP has no excuse for such dismal performance. HP support offered me a $100 discount on a new laptop when I called, but I expect more than two years of life from these products, and won't be buying another laptop from them. Just some info for your consideration...  - Don
