I love this little machine. So portable and fast. I have a 15 inch mac book pro as well and use it here and there and when I do it seems so big, bulky and heavy comparatively (which it is). I've just gotten so used to the lightness of the air! I LOVE IT! So glad I got it, when I bring it with me to work or random other places I forget I even have a fully functional laptop with me. It's awesome. I bought mine at the apple store. They didn't have any options for hardshell cases which was a bummer, and finding even a sleeve for it wasn't easy. The one I have no is a little big for it. I guess it's just a size they don't have a lot of options for at the moment. Perfect for web browsing and school work and business which is what I got it for. Bottom line: i love it.
