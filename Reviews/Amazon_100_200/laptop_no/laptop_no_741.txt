This laptop seemed like a great idea at the time about 6 months ago; I bought it for about $800. I first realized it was much heavier than I expected. Nevertheless, I kind of liked the specs, they were decent. 1 day I realized the side of the screen was rattling when i moved, and i saw that the wires were hidden by a skimpy millimeter-thick piece of plastic and it was popping off. Also, i realized boot up was VERY slow after about 2 months and i am not a heavy downloader so it wasnt apps or a virus. sharp corners, uncomfortable, not the best laptop BY FAR. not worth $500 today, spend your money on some other piece of s***, because whatever it is, it's better than this one.
