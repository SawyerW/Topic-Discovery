I bought two of these laptops back in September 2009.  The battery life is pretty good with an average of about 3 hours.  the weight and portability make this a good laptop as well.  The programs run smoothly and overall I have enjoyed the laptop.The major flaw of this laptop is that after two years, neither of the laptops will take a charge.  The charging port has become loose and now I have to spend about 45 minutes trying to get this computer to charge.It worked great for a while, but if you are planning on keeping your laptop for more then 2 years I would suggest something else.
