I had been very excited for the new 4th gen Haswell processors, and I was ecstatic when the Macbook Air finally came out, with the new haswell. What surprised me the most was how this completely changed the battery life! The battery life is Amazing! first time I used it, i was literally only using it to see when it will finally die. The battery was decreasing so slowly I was amazed. I did not unpack the charger until the fourth day of using the laptop. (~12+ hours, on low settings)Overall, I love it. I have dual-booted it with windows, (256GB and 8GB RAM) and it works perfectly fine. I am very impressed. Any questions on bootcamp, holler.
