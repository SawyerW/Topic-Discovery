We bought this for our teenager for his senior year of high school.  He needed a Mac, obviously, because he loves all things Mac, but also to sync up with all his other i-things.  He has shown some talent in movie making and a great deal of talent in photography.  It had to be up to his skill level.  No other computer has the range in visual arts that a Mac does.It also had to be portable.  He had to be able to carry it in his back pack like his ipad.The usefulness factor:  this had to be more useful than his ipad.  He was all crazy for the ipad, but it turned out to be marginally useful at school every day.  He can send 10K texts out a month but couldn't function with the qwerty touch deal.  His notes were always slow and painful.We bought both the 2 years extra Apple care and the Square Trade warranty.  It's one thing to trust a teenager but it's one thing to trust a teenager.
