As a lifelong PC lover, I not only hated MACs, but thought they were akin to an instrument of the Evil Empire.After three PC fiascoes in a row - I switched! What did I have to lose?What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief!The MacBook is an author/teacher's dream. I'm sure it is same for any profession. Not only is it fast (furiously fast), but I languish in the comfort of having no interruptions by virus checkers, malware seekers, and updaters. The Mac is a dignified computer that allows the user to do his/her job without interruption - and the ease of finding materials, multiple desktops, multiple Apps, and smooth transitions all combine to make my job easier and more enjoyable.If you're reading this from a PC - you're doing yourself a disservice. Pay the few extra bucks and get a MAC!
