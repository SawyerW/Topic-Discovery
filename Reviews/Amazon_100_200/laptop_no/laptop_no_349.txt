I just picked up a MacBook Pro 13" for my daughter yesterday (not from Amazon).  All the raving reviews are really true - it is a very well-built and fabulously running system.  Bright LCD, great backlit keyboard, very good battery life and MacOS is fast and snappy.  I have installed Windows 7, using Bootcamp, and it also runs very well.  Mine did not come with Snow Leopard so I had to download a 23-Mb update from Apple to get the drivers "right" in Windows 7.  But, caveat emptor, I assumed this MB would be equally nice as the one I bought late last year (from Amazon) for my oldest daughter.  After I brought this one home, I discovered a rub mark (not bad - but noticeable) and a long but small scratch on the aluminum lid.  I will put a nice laptop skin on it to cover both - but an $1100+ system should not have damage like this.  So - if you don't want any scratches/etc - buy from Amazon!  If you buy from a brick and mortar - I suggest that you open the package in the store and check for visible damage.
