I bought this laptop at Best Buy in May of 2010.  It worked fine until June of 2011 when it started running very slow and then last week I started getting a Windows alert that "SMART failure predicted on hard disk and to replace hard disk asap!"  This was when I realized that no recovery disks came with the computer so I created my own.  Then we bought a new hard disk installed it and tried to install recovery disks.  Still not sure what the problem is but the recovery disk did not restore completely so now I have to order recovery disks from Sony.  You would think having to spend $850 for a laptop that it would last longer than 1 year????????
