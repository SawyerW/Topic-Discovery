Pros:Powerful processor makes daily computing fast.Cons:Dual finger scrolling is basically broken.  Worse, it interferes with normal (single-finger) navigation, rendering it extremely unpleasant to use.  I searched all over the internet but none of the suggestions fixed the problem.  And, there seems no way to disable dual-finger completely.Overall:I owned a W500 before having this W520.  W520 is much faster than its predecessor, thanks to the new cpu.  However, I give W500 touchpad a 4-star, but 0 for that on W520.  W520 also loses significant screen height to W500 -- crucial amount that makes viewing high resolution content much more difficult.Aside buying this laptop, get yourself external mouse and monitor so you can really enjoy using it.
