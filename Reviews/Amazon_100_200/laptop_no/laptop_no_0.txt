Google is on to something here, but without a little luck, I would not have known about it. I now own 2 chrome books (one for my wife and one for me) and find the experience delightful. In trying to learn and become more productive with it, I have searched the web for how-to articles, etc. Quite by accident, I came across "The Chrome Book." It is well written, very informative, and a real good overview of the "operating system." It also treats some of the higher level uses.This was my best find yet, and one that I am buying as a reference book. I just hope Google keeps going with this concept with enhancements, improvements, and more advertising. Again, well written book and on target!
