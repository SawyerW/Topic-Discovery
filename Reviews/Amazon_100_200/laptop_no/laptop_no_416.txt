I was given this laptop by the school and I want to say that this laptop is absolutely horrible for its intended purposes.- It is flimsy and cheap. The back light is a constant issue and it heats up at the drop of a pin.- The fan spits out plastic after too long of a usage.- Requires constant restarts due to "internal issues"- The keys fall off.- The whole thing is loosely screwed together, leaving the screws to loosen and fall out.- It crashes and or freezes with light knocks (i. e. putting my books on my desk when the computer is out)I am currently using this laptop to write this review but I would prefer anything over this... thing. In other words, this product is a no go. Get yourself the HP Pavilion dm4-3170se 14-Inch Laptop (Black) or the Lenovo 14" Core i5 500GB HDD 4GB DDR3 Ultrabook. They are cheaper for the value and more funtional. Summary: Don't. Buy.
