If you get this laptop at a reasonable price I would not deter you from buying it, otherwise choose another laptop. I am not against HP's cause I've experienced others that do not suffer from the same 'defects' as this.1)Don't put this laptop on your lap, you will get 2nd or 3rd degree burns2)Do not expect exceptional battery life (although the same can be said about half the pc's on the market today) but expect to be connected to the power cable for the most part3)It may run slowly at times but to be fair be sure the cause of that is not user basedAll in all it is not a bad machine but HP definitely needed to iron out these issues before releasing this product
