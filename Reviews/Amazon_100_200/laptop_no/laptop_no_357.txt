This computer offers no exception to quality. As a traditionalist pc user, I was reluctant to move to the mac, but once there I was hooked. The menus dance and move before your eyes like a pc never could. At first I found adjusting to life as a mac user slow and cumbersome. Once over I was amazed at the multimedia features, entertainment seemed to be live in my room! The audio visual aspects are a joy as is the big screen and the computers power full processors. Also I don't get the same amount of viruses as I did with a PC. Overall its a very solid and reliable computer.
