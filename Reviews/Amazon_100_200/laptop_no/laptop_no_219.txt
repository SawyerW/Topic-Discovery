I am totally loving the MacBook I give it 5 stars but I have to be honest and give Amazon 0 stars! I got my MacBook and it didn't work, it had scratches all over the front. Now I know Amazon sells Used and Refurbished but I paid for a NEW MacBook and they represented it as new as it says NEW right on my receipt.  I drove the 60 miles to the Apple Store to have someone look at it and they told me it was clearly a refurbished computer and had been used before!!! Not right Amazon, so buyers beware when you shop for things through this website.
