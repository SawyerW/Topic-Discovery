I am a college professor and have generally been happy with the computer.  All that changed when I wanted to show a DVD to my class.  On the computer screen it was great.  But when hooked up to a projector (or even other monitor) it gave a copyright error and shut down.  The computer is running XP BUT IT IS NOT AN XP ISSUE.  It is a Lenovo issue after I did a little searching on the web.  This is a major complaint that they will have to fix.The only way around this is to extend the computer to two screens, reconfigure the size and I have other issues from that.  Ergo there are better options out there for the price.On the positive side the battery life is tremendous.
