I used to go with the cheap HP/Dell laptops.  But this time I decided to chance it and go with a nicer model and I couldn't be happier.  I was hesitant to spend so much on a laptop, but Consumer Reports & cnet.com both rank this Toshiba as the best laptop on the market (excluding Macs).  I was a little scared to get a laptop with only a 13.5" screen, but the resolution is so nice I don't even notice.  What I do notice is that the laptop is very lightweight and portable with a very long battery life, which you never get with a large laptop.  I've only had it for about a month, so I may not have run into some of the problems that can occur over time.  But for now I'm very happy.  If I had to give a ding to this laptop, it's the speakers.  I can't listen to music off of it as loud as I'd like, so I'll probably buy a cheap set of speakers.  But with how fast it is and how portable it is, I can easily look past that minor blemish.
