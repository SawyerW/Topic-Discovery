Our school purchased a Latitude laptop for every teacher in our school this year. They are very useful if you are looking for a paper weight or need to flatten out student paintings from art class. Otherwise, they are useless. All of them crash at least once a day, and I mean with the ominous blue screen featuring the ominous fatal error message. Several crash in lieu of a screen saver-- students come in for a class, you teach for an hour and return to the computer to complete you work and, Voila!, the lover blue screened fatal error message. This has happened this morning six times already and it is only 10:26 am. I recommend you spend your money elsewhere, Perhaps in decorative paper weights with the blue bird of happiness instead of this lap top with the blue screen of despair.
