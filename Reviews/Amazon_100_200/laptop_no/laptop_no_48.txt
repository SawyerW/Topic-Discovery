This is a sturdy laptop. After 6 months of struggling with the quirks of having Microsoft 7 Pro Plus not fully meshed with the  physical aspects of the computer's capabilities, and then having to buy a battery, which was kind of expected...Microsoft then tells me my version of their programs are not registered.  The number that was on the program as the key code when I first got the laptop are not a product code, not a key, not anything that matches the requirements. So I contacted the rebuilders I ordered from...they say they will get with me...three times we make email contact, and no getting with me. Either the programs were a trial version installed just to sell the laptop, (does that explain the numbers passed off as the key code?), or the program was an upgrade from XP or something...but either way I ended up with no programs and no help from this seller to rectify the problem!
