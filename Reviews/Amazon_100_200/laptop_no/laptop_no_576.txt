This laptop was a pretty good price for what it includes.Pros: A light for the keyboard (though it is pretty dim), matte screen, mine included Windows 7 which I love and Microsoft Office (not sure they all come with this though). Very sturdy. Lots of metal parts. Nice web cam.Cons: The scratchpad is bulky and doesn't always cooperate (it likes to make the screen zoom in and out when you don't want it to). The laptop is very heavy and a little thick. No HDMI port... my 3 year old cheaper laptop included an HDMI port!  USB ports are hard to use. It is hard to open the CD drive because of the location of the button on a slanted curve. You pretty much have to pick the laptop up to open the CD drive. A backlit keyboard would have been nice... the light doesn't help much at all.
