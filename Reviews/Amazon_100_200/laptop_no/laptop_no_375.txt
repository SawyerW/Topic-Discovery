It's official I hate my macbook Pro.  I bought this computer over a year ago and I wanted to wait to write a review until I had given myself time to adapt to it.  My question now is why did I want to .  I admit I was drawn into the Apple hype.  The promises of better, faster,safer, easier computer use.  The thoughts of using iPhoto, which "sucks" by the way,  sorry.  The Mac makes most things more challenging if you are trying to use Microsoft word.  I have to redo every document I create on  a PC before I can file it.  Before you say anything I did try to get help on line and in person at an apple store to resolve the issues but Hmmm. no one could explain it.  Go figure.  I will keep it until it dies, which alas, may be a while,  but I will never buy another.  Give me a PC any day.  Besides with the strides others are making there's not much that warrants an apple purchase anymore anyway.
