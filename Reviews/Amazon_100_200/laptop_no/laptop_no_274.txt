Purchased this laptop for my wife, who is a college student.  We have not had any  major problems with it.  Everything works and my wife gets her assignments in weekly with no major head aches.  My only complaint is the speakers and I quote, "Delight your senses with rich sound from the Altec Lansing speakers, enhanced by the unique SonicMaster design -an exclusive ASUS design that improves sound projection and quality. "......no not at all.  Aside from that its reliable and does what we need for a very reasonable price. I don't really appreciate getting smoke blown up my keyster, but aside from that, the price is right and it is a very stable running laptop. So knocked it down a star because of the speakers and what I consider to be false advertisement/embellishment.
