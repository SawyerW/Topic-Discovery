I've tried all the Apple products: iPads, iPhones, Touches, iPods, Macbooks, iMacs etc. I purchased the Macbook Air 11" model as a backup for my business when I run out of the office. I also have a Macbook 13" for personal use (my wife mainly). I thought the 11" screen and size would be lame, but I a very happy with my decision. I find myself picking up the 11" air over the 13" Macbook when given a choice for web searching. It is pretty nifty device. The wifi seems a little sluggish, but Apple has told me there are no problems. Maybe it is my home network. I tried the wifi at Starbucks a few days ago...and it worked fine. So besides that...no problems to report. I love the size and weight of this little guy. It is simply awesome! Very happy.
