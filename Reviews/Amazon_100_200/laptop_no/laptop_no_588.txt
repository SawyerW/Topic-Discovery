The shipper sent item with wrong address on it. I had to go to post office to pick it up. I found out the the Windows 7 professional I have is  not genuine, that mean I will never get updates from Microsoft unless I buy a new key code for $149.00. They want me to ship the computer back to check it which I will not do. I have spend too much time on this already. Byers be ware with this seller, sound kinda shady to me.I will make sure not to do business with you anymore. I am on my third computer this month with other sellers and I have been happy
