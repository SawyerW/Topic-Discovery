I bought a Dell XPS 17 directly from Dell. It came with a defective screen. So I called Dell. The screen replacement was on back order, but they said they could ship me a replacement computer with identical specs immediately. I received the replacement computer just two days later. Unfortunately the replacement computer had severely downgraded specifications. 900p screen instead of the 1080p screen, i7-2630 processor instead of i7-2720, gt550m graphics instead of gt555m.In every way possible they replaced my computer with inferior components.I immediately called Dell and proceeded to be put on hold and bounced around for over 6 hours trying to get the issue resolved.As I write this I am on hold yet again with a Dell representative who is completely unable or unwilling to assist me.I cannot speak to anyone in the United States for support without paying an additional $250 for some support package
