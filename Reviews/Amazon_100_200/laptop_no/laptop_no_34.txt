i love sony's but downfall this model number was the wrong model number and who ever had this before us didnt read the system requirements cause some one tried to install windows 7 in it numerous times and not reading it cause if the system requirements were read than would of seen not compatible with windows 7 cause it is an older computer and the other down fall is i got this for my man cause it was cheap and good for my budget and come to find out he could only get on the internet once in a great blue moon. had it since 2011 and only been able to get on the internet with it 2 times but it is good for if you like to play games that you install on the computer using a cd as long as it meets the game requirements and to download cd's on it.
