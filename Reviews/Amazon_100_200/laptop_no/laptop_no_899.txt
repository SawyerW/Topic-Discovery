We picked this up over a year ago now, and are running the iWork, iLife, Microsoft Office for Mac, and Photoshop.  We upped the RAM to 16 GB (just because).  With Snow Leopard it showed 512GB of VRAM and the HD4000 did a decent, but not great, job on the video side.  Mavericks bumped the HD4000 to 1GB of VRAM, and it seems a bit better.  This being said, when the machine is FINALLY up and running, it runs great, but it is pretty show with the built in 5400 RPM drive.  I will eventually put an SSD - in which will boost the performance substantially.  The good thing about this machine is that it is upgradable - RAM and Hard Drive - whereas the new Retina models are not.  Obviously the Retina display is much nicer that this, but the display is adequate.
