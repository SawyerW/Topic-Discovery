When I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.  This was my first Mac so I wasn't familiar with how it was suppose to feel.  After using my friend's computer I knew something was wrong.I took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling.  They tried to tell me that the battery wasn't covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace. They ended up not charging me.Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I'm pretty happy with the computer.
