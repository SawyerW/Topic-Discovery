This laptop ran very well when first purchased.  Other than a very bouncy keyboard I had no problems until Christmas day when I turned it on and got the "black screen of death"!  The power came on, the CD drive engaged but there was absolutely nothing from the hard drive.  I had it checked out to be told the motherboard crashed.  In order to repair I'm looking at about $400-$500.  Since you can get a new laptop for that or just a bit more I'm looking at buying new.  I have another toshiba laptop that is 3-4 years old and other than it running slow (compared to newer ones) it is still humming along fine.  This particular model, L675D-S7016, has died after only 16 months.  I am skeptical about buying Toshiba now.  I'm thinking, maybe, HP.
