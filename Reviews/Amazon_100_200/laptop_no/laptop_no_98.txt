I have given the seller SIX MONTHS to rectify the situation. Now I get NO RESPONSE. Got a lap top with parts missing. I have exchanged messages with the seller every two weeks...they keep putting me off and promising ... and not delivering. After several and many weeks (months from the origial order), they replaced the original machine. Now we have a machine that can't accept any Microsoft updates.  They promised to send a replacement disk for the operating system... as that seems to be the problem... they tell me it is sent but can't send any information and are no longer responding.  The things I have read indicate that the problems are attributed to problems with pirated software.
