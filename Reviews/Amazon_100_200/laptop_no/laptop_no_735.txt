The laptop just wasn't what I expected.  I opened 3 web browsers (gmail, pandora, and amazon) and the pandora music immediately started acting up.  I was hoping for a laptop to use at school but I won't be able to multitask like I'm used to.  The look of the laptop is really nice and sleek and it's super light weight, but the performance was not up to par so I returned it. Unlike some other reviews, the viewing angle wasn't a problem nor was there any bending in my keyboard.  I did notice the left click button was rather load and could be irritating after long use but it wasn't a huge problem.  I think if you know how to upgrade the components of the laptop then it'd be pretty good.  Also be aware the trackpad might have complications.  I've never had issues with other trackpads, but for some reason it wasn't picking up my fingers.  My boyfriend tried it and it worked fine with his so it may have been that I have much smaller fingers than his, but just something to consider and check out.
