This is by far the best Sony Vaio I ever owned. I previously owned a Sony C1MVP Picturebook, Sony Vaio T350P, Sony Vaio SZ110P, Sony Vaio TXN15P, Sony Vaio TZ150N/B. This notebook is by far my favorite one. It has a nice industrial look to it with the brushed metal and keyboard. It very light for a 13.1 inch notebook only .5lbs heavier than my TZ150 I had before. The screen has 100% color saturation and is by far the best screen I ever seen, that coming from a previous owner of a TZ150. Its powerful and runs Vista without a hiccup. Keyboard is nice and responsive. Nice big trackpad and the buttons are not too loud when clicked. If I had a gripe it would be that it doesn't come with the XP downgrade CD as promised. Also the screen is kinda soft meaning it tilts easily back but not forward.
