I have had the MacBook Pro for about 3 years and I have never had any problems with its performance. I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved. I believe that the Newer Pros should have Microsoft office installed as most buyers of this product are students. The HDMI Port could be introduced instead of having customers buy a connection piece which is hard to find, I picked up mine when I was in Japan while in the military at an Apple Store. There is no way you can find the necessary port in a Wal-Mart or Bestbuy and I have Checked.
