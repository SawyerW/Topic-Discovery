The computer runs great - however I just feel the quality is just a notch below where you would expect a Dell to be.  My biggest problem is the keyboard, which feels cheap and it's design of having basically no space between keys giving the feel of a complete flat surface makes me type more cautious(slower) then I would with a competitors keyboard(I bought an acer 15.6 at the same time and the keyboard and speakers are far superior).  The bottom line for me is that yes, it does what it should do well, but I feel there are better made laptops with better features and higher quality components than this one for basically the same price.
