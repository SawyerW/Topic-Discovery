The laptop is damn fast and pretty good to look at....everything on this laptop is good except the trackpad.... so if ur main focus of buying this laptop is for office work imn if u need to type alot don buy this one cause the track pad hampers ur work alot... but if u are a heavy user and want to use it for multimedia use...and u want a pretty damn looking laptop within reasonable price definitely buy this one....Well am not sure about the what Amazon customer is sain cause this is really a pretty damn good looking laptop... I bought it from eBay and am using it since last 3 months everything is fantastic for me except the trackpad may b am still not used to with it
