I have the Dell 1340 and couldn't find it on here, but it looks like this model is similar enough to mine so I can warn people about some of the things that go wrong with similar models.  I do not recommend this machine for those of you who live in dustier locations.  There is no space between the screen and the keyboard when you close it, so if you are in a hurry and have to close it and there is dust on the screen or keyboard, the screen gets scratched up over time.  The screen is just a horrible design.  To top it off, I've had this laptop for about 3 years and the screen is now separating at the right middle edge, so now dust is actually getting behind the screen.  Other than that, I've really liked this machine.  Everything else works great, but the keyboard is now starting to fall apart, too.  The machine components just don't seem very durable for someone who uses it a lot.
