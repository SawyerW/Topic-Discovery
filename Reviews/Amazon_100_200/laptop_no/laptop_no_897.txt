Well...I finally saw the light. I keep asking myself every day how could anyone go back to Windows based systems after experiencing the MacBook Pro. Unless they have a gun to their head of course.It's just awesome!!!! ( multiply that awesome by 15 ).I never used a mac before. Not more than five minutes until I got mine. I've been using computers since 1998-2000.Primarily a web/e-commerce systems designer and developer and linux administrator, I've never had anything better in my life. Yes I longed for it for a long time but could not get it because of price. A project finally availed me the opportunity and I keep asking myself every day even now as I work in bed, How in God's holy name did I survive without this ? I was suffering without knowing it. Plane simple.I did have issues with internet connection the first five days. But that was my router and I since solved it with "connectify me"Save money for a mac. It's worth every Dime. I give that advice to every colleague and employee I have every since. Its worth every Penny. Every kobo. not sure what else to say. there's just nothing like it.
