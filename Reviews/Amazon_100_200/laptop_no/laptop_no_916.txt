Well I edit video, and I've been contemplating an Apple for a while.But at the end of the day, Apple only use the same components that all the rest of the computer manufacturer's use, but they charge twice the price.I bought myself an Asus laptop with similar configuration to this one, but with a 7200 rpm drive, 4th generation core i7 quad processor and the better video card, and I paid half as much for it.ASUS N550JV-DB72T 15.6-Inch Touchscreen LaptopAnd it's touchscreen, too!So why would I buy an Apple?Besides, Adobe make better editing software now than Final Cut Pro.Nope, I won't join the trendy Apple bandwagon. I can think for myself, thanks very much.
