I finally purchased my Macbook Pro last week, and since then I have been very satisfied. With the display on it's lowest brightness, internet, wireless, and Bluetooth off, and the keyboard lights completely off, I can squeeze 10 hours and 40 minutes out of it's sizable battery. However, when I watch online streaming (ex. Netflix), the most I can get is around three hours. I suppose that there is not really any way to improve that, but it is slightly disappointing. Also, the bottom of the laptop and the magsafe adapter get unpleasantly hot. All in all, still an awesome product, with the awesome Hi-Def display and great speed. Also a little disappointing is that the built-in speakers are not on the top, by the keyboard like in the 15 and 17 inch models. But, if they added those, the keyboard would have to be smaller, so that's fine also. As I have said, this is a very satisfying product. Keep it up, Apple.
