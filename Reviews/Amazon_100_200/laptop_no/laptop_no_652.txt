only after looking at the macbook air(cause this one isn't in stores) did I realize that it has no LAN/Network/RJ45 port...so it can only connect wirelessly?  Don't get me wrong it's fine for 90% of what you'll use it for, but what if you need to plug in?  I've been to a bunch of hotels that don't have wireless, particularly overseas.  How do I plug in the LAN cable?  Do they make an adapter?  I know there is an adapter that works with ether net ports(I asked the guy at the mac counter).  The MacAir dosn't have a LAN port and they told me they use an ether net cable.  The S3 only has 2 USB's and HDMI.  I was curious if anyone knows if they make a USB adapter?I was so looking forward to this, its cheap, light, great battery life...perfect for travel.  But, I do a lot of overseas work and if I can't get on the internet its all kinda moot.  If anyone knows the fix to this please comment!
