10 hour legitimate battery life lasts me 2 days.  That was the main selling point of this for me.  Being someone that likes to tinker, build their own computers, overclock, etc. I'm not really a fan of Apple's operating system.  That said, the hardware is magnificent.  This is the best laptop I've ever seen, and like I mentioned, 10 hours of battery life thanks to Intel's Haswell chip.  The flash storage is good, but my storage is half full, and I'm already starting to see signs of slowing.  Really, the only thing that irks me is when I'm watching a video on youtube and the audio will stutter.  This is probably from the 1.8GHz processor, but I really thought the core strength of an i5 would be able to power through that.Overall, this is great.  I love this machine, and I definitely recommend it
