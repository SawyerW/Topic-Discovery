So far so great. I would like start saying this laptop has everything you need: core i7 processor, usb 3.0, wifi N and ATI HD 5730 graphic card. Besides hardware specifications, this laptop offers a multiple range of computing levels. From office computing to gaming or graphic design. The processor and the GPU allows you to play games with Direct 11 suppport or work with heavy load programs. The size of the screen is great for working with multiple windows at the same time and resolution is great (You don't need Full HD 1080p in a 16" screen). The HDMI output permits Full HD when is connected to  a big LCD/LED and looks great. Additionally, USB 3.0 is definitely a "+". The next gen of flash memories and  hard drives will use. The speakers are not that loud as I expected but the sound is clear. Multitouch pad is one thing you really get used really fast and works perfect. Webcam is 2.0Mp but the fps is low so the image will not be smooth.So far I like this laptop and I recommended to all of you. The price is great and the performance is even better.
