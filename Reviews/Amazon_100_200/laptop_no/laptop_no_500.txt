This is a great laptop to experience the i-3 processor by Intel, and HP was caring enough to leave room for the RAM to be doubled from 4GM to 8GM.  If you are planning on owning a machine for a few years after it takes on a bunch of updates, the memory upgrade will become necessary and not all laptop makers are giving consumers this option, beware!  The screen size is HUGE, my wife was able to watch streaming video from overseas fine, and Window's 7 is awesome, with some more functionality than Vista and way more than XP.  Some users may find HP's onboard mouse difficult to "click" though the touch pad is very sensitive both for a double-touch/click as well as for the scroll up/down features (which I haven't used much before).  Definitely a machine you can enjoy using for years to come!
