I purchased the Asus laptop based on a recommendation from my son, who has had an Asus for the last 2 years. The G53SX is a great PC! It was delivered early and was exactly what I had ordered, all parts in place and ready to rock and roll! I wanted a good gaming machine for Lord of the Rings Online, and it is just perfect for it! The HD screen is wonderful. It's a somewhat heavier laptop, but I chalk that up to the fact that it is made out of sturdy, quality, materials. Oh, one thing that I should mention is how quiet this laptop is. Compared to my older HP laptop, I barely know I am running anything, even my hi-def game! And it is super-cool, temperature-wise, too! I've had it for about a month or so and am very happy with it!
