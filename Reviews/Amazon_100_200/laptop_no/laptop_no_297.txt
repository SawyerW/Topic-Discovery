PROS:-Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit runs flawlessly on the dual core processor.-Graphics card is excellent and watching YouTube/DVD videos on full screen is smoothe, even with high definition.-It's 3GB RAM is more than enough for normal use. The usage is usually in the 40% range with normal use, definitely a good thing.-Has a stylish cover to it. (mine is blue, I'm not sure if that's standard or not).CONS:-THE KEYBOARD LAYOUT IS HORRIBLE! I repeat, HORRIBLE. I type at an average rate of 70-80WPM and this is by far the worst keyboard layout.-Does not have a numeric keypad as on the side as most notebooks do.-The shortcut keys available on the keyboard aren't significant and really should not have been placed there to begin with (i.e., quick launch to calculator, email, internet, etc.)-Because of the keyboard, it's comfort rating is "pathetic" on my scale.OVERALL:Excellent choice, given the price and performance. The keyboard will take a LOT of getting used to, but eventually it won't be an issue. I'd highly recommend this product (G62-347NR).
