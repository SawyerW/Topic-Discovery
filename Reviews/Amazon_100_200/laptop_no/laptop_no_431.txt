I got this computer a bit over a year ago, and for the most part it works great. I use this computer a lot for school and in my free time quite a lot, and it can handle most minor and commonplace things without any problems. The one way I feel that this computer falls short of is the lack of a decent graphics card. It has trouble playing any games, even some that have been out for over 4 years. I don't really mind it all too much, but it tends to be a bit of a hassle in the long run.So yeah, for anything other than games, this computer certainly isnt a bad choice.
