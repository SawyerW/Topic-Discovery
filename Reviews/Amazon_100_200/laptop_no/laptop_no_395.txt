I did allot of research on resfurbished laptops because i never bought one before but with limited amount of funds it was a promising buy for me. I never wright reviews but i figured if you are like me this would be some help for you. It is just like buying a brand new computer and i will never go back to buying brand new again. This is above and beyond what i expected. works perfect. I use it for the internet,music,ipod,writing resumes and more. it is perfect you will not be disappointed you went this route. i bought cricket wireless prepaid which is cheap but works great. Trust me i do not work for these people i am just an average 24 year old and this is the best thing i ever did!!!! so happy and you will be too!!
