Having just purchased a similiar laptop with the same exact specs and processor from another manufacturer, I was literally blown away by this laptop's performance.  After uninstalling all the bloatware, downloading the latest bios and drivers from both Samsung and AMD this laptop posts the following WEI...Processor: 6.9 (Just shy of a typical quad-core desktop cpu)RAM: 6.9 (probably due to latency and cpu speed)2D Graphics: 5.9 (far above most on-board graphics)3D Graphics: 6.5 (amazing since it costs $100 or more for a GPU equal to this rating)Hard Drive: 5.9 (standard for any 7200 RPM drive)With all this said, I had to install more RAM and add an SSD on my other laptop to meet this level of performance.  So, I'm very impressed to say the least.Note: To truly see performance gains with this laptop be certain to 1)uninstall all bloatware, 2) update the BIOS and all drivers from samsung.com, 3) use the grpahics card auto-detect from AMD.com and install the latest Catalyst driver, and finally 4) clean the registry.  The laptop will run 20-30% faster than out of the box if you do.
