I've been looking to purchase a new laptop for the past year.  During that time I zeroed in on the 13.3" MacBook Pro and finally took the plunge of owning my first Apple product.  Initial impressions are what most people describe, excellent build quality, very good screen resolution(non-retina), quick boot up, and intuitive controls.  Instead of ridding my hard drive of unwanted garbage that has no use and uses up valuable resources(i.e windows) I'm off surfing the web in literally minutes after taking this product out of the box.  It's fluid, lag-free, whisper quiet, and just so easy to do whatever you choose to do with it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a solid, performance oriented laptop.  It's great resale value only adds to it's long list of attributes.
