I work from home and needed a replacement laptop that was inexpensive until I could afford a better one. The CQ56 serves that purpose just fine. Cons: The computer itself feels tinny when you type and you have to click awfully hard on the mouse buttons. The speakers are not great and it runs a little slow. Pros: It is suitable for light computer work. It connects to wireless networks fine. For the price of a netbook you get a full size screen and keyboard. I think how well you like this Compaq will depend on what your particular needs are.
