PRO: Great Fast laptop. 16" screen. i7 core.  great video card with 1GB.  comes with 4GB of RAM. USB 3.0. 320GB HDD @ 7200rpm. Windows 7. VGA and HDMI outputs. 1YEAR ASUS Accidental Damage Warranty.No tax.free shipping.@ at great price of just $999?Con: not much.  minor stuff like resolution could of been higher.Other Thoughts:  I've been keeping track of this laptop and notice Newegg had the same laptop going for $999.  However, Today Newegg's price jump on this laptop to $1099.  If you are from CA like me, you would have to pay taxes @ Newegg as well... However, Amazon give this baby to me at $999 with no tax!!!!  BUY IT SOON if you havn't!! The price might just get higher!!!!
