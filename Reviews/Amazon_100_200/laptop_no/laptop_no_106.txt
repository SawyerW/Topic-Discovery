I expect a slow machine due to vista ... but turns out not too shabbyHowever when I downgraded it to XP (from a sonystyle sent CD rom) it flies faster ... and its screen is as usual top of the artEverybody likes this model for its size, embedded dvd drive and slim looksI have nothing to add ... except that the LCD rectangle is quite elongated unlike the standard 16:9 format. The keyboard & body is rock solid & almost stylish for my tasteand it amazes me for it does not make noise nor does it become hot that easilyKeep it mind that this model is new ... and pricey for now
