the notebook was purchased for my girl friend and she like the notebook.  however, i hate it!!!  the placement of the built in mic is located on the keyboard.  because the mic is located on the keyboard, the internal fan and other internal noise can be heard when you are using skype (or other voip app).  i also have a hard time understanding her because she is usually typing or doing something while chatting.  because her hands are on the keyboard it covers the mic which make her voice sound droned out and when she is typing it creates additional noise.  so if you are planning to use skype or some other equivalent software even a few times, i suggest you avoid this notebook.  you might not notice anything but the person on the other end will hate it!
