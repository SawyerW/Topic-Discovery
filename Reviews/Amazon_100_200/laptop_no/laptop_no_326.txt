Spent about 4 months shopping and comparing laptops. Have a 5 yr old Dell Dimension laptop and it was time for a new one. I use a laptop for photo editing, word processing, web surfing, and travel with it.  This choice came down to this ASUS and the HP Dvt4.  The HP has better processor power, but I wanted real battery life.  The battery life with the ASUS has been great - at least 6-8hrs even on highest video settings, double most other current laptops. Photos look great on this screen and has plenty of processor power and memory for Photoshop editing and it's light weight!  It has just done everything I want it to.  Minor gripes: The split hard drive partition is a pain; Wish it had a CF memory card reader; and the plastic casing feels a tiny bit cheap - but is plenty firm.  Very good bang for the buck laptop.  Highly recommend it.
