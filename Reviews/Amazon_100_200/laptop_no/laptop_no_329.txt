I studied and read reviews for a year and settled on an ASUS superthin, superlight, 11-hour battery laptop but when it arrived it had error messages on bootup and I couldn't get the two-disk system recovery process that came with it to work beyond the first disk.  Then, after only 8 pushes, the ASUS's Power button quit working.  I was so disappointed.  I returned it and got a Sony VAIO.  The VAIO ran perfectly out of the box, setting up wireless router network was a snap, it doesn't show fingerprints, and it's solidly built.  (Plus, I now have a Blu-Ray movie player!)  It's a bit heavier and the battery life is under 3 hours but it's almost as thin and comfortable as the ASUS, and it WORKS.  It turned out to be a blessing that I had to return the ASUS because this VAIO is exactly what I needed.
