I'm a long time PC user who always ranted about Mac lovers being spoiled brats who needed pretty things that didn't justify their price. Well, when my old PC died on me because of a virus, I was so mad with Windows I forgot all my past ravings and went over to the Mac side.It took me a little time to get adjusted to the Mac, but the computer is great. It's powerful, perfectly sized, with great battery life (maybe not the advertised 7 hours) and yes, a million times better looking than any PC laptop.I still prefer certain things about Windows, but maybe I haven't gotten to know my Mac well enough.The only complaint would be that Amazon took its sweet time delivering.
