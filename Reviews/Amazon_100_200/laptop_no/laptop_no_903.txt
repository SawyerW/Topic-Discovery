Absolutely love it, OS X Mountain Lion is a fun and efficient operating system. It is fast and easy to use. Amazon had this on a real steal deal (!) for only few hours during black friday.  Hardware and operating system are very well designed together, unbelievable how fast apps load up on Mac. With exception of few apps that don't run on Mac, I can practically use this at work. MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it. Windows is a bear compared to OS X. Mac app store and games are cool. Overall very impressed, Thank you Apple and Amazon!
