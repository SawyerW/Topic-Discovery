A lot of these reviews are similar for pros/cons and details about these older model Macbook Pros that most people agree with. However, I use mine in specific manner that is more versatile than the newer Retina MBP models.What I did with my quad i7 2.3Ghz, aside from maxing the RAM to 16GB, was to remove the optical drive, and add an SSD. So, now I have two drives accessible in one machine. However if you do this, you'll want to put the old spinning hard drive in the spot that the optical drive was in, and put the SSD in the original hdd spot. There are cradles/brackets available to do this easily.Now that SSDs are somewhat affordable, this is an idealistic laptop system where the SSD is the boot drive, running system apps and OSX, and the old 500GB spinning drive is all files, movies, music, games, etc. Where shortcut links are used in Docs, Music, and Movies.In my case, I used a Samsung 840 series 250GB SSD, and I get read/write speeds at 490MB/s and 225MB/s. Couldn't be happier with this set up. Try it!
