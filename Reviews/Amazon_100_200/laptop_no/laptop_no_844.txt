Same hardware defect happened for 3 new laptops - audio input/output device no longer detected.- After 30 days, the audio broke.  Apple shipped me a new one.- After 7 days, the audio broke.  Apple shipped me a second new one.- After 1 hour, the audio broke.  With Apple support now - probably returning this.Root cause: I believe it is a hardware design problem.  My speakers (Arctic S111) are powered via USB.  Seems the speaker drains the voltage causing the nearby audio card to break.  That's my running theory.I DON'T recommend buying this laptop - unless you like to waste your time with support and geniuses who spend 5 seconds to verify it is a defect.
