This is what a laptop should be! Starts up super fast like an iPad but works and performs like a high performance laptop. It has an amazing long lasting battery...an all day working battery. I rarely turn the machine off because I can just shut the lid and when I need it, it is up and running before I can get the lid all the way open. My old Windows laptop had to be shutdown when not in use and it took foreeeeeever to startup. And all my other Apple products work together perfectly like one big happy, connected family. Do yourself a favor and buy this MacBook Air!
