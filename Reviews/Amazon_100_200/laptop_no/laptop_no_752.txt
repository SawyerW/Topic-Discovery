I have a pretty strong hatred of Apple and their business practices. However when this device came out as one of the first lightweight laptops sporting the new haswell chip and claiming 12 hours of battery life at a reasonable price, I decided to give it a shot. I am very glad I did, this is a powerful and responsive machine with incredible endurance. I can even play Borderlands 2 on it at a decent frame rate with the on chip HD5000 GPU. (That will eat some battery). I just went to a convention and used the laptop all day each day and went to the hotel each night with 40% battery remaining, it's just incredible. Install homebrew on this and clean out some of Apple's gunk to make it a real *nix machine and you have a powerful mobile device in your hands.
