(This review is written by Sherrie's husband)Bought acer laptop new in may 2010, crashed 6 weeks later.  Sent to their repair facility at shipping and packing cost of $38.  Got back week and a half later, used 3 days, crashed again.  Sent back to Acer at their cost.  Came back 3 days later, said was checked and it was working properly(?!?).  Used 2 days, again crashed, keeps shutting down with blue screen "page fault" and "beginning memory dump",  IE kept shutting off also.Called Acer to request refund, was told to ask Office Depot for a refund!  Stores don't warranty computers, manufacturers do.  Was told a refund was not possible because "this was a repair"  Yeah, a repair from an original problem that was not fixed, therefore not a "repair" issue.Sent e-mail advising I would take only a refund (less than $400).  Went up chain of command, told no refund.Lousy computer, defective, lousy company, care nothing about their customers or their reputation.Avoid these laptops at all cost.
