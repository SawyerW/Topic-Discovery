I bought this 2 years ago at frys for $260. It's been great and super functional for my purposes. 98% I use it for web surfing and email.  I don't do any gaming. I don't know what some of these some of these negative (1&2 star) reviews are about, maybe they got a bad one, happens with all manufactures. The reviewer that said the keys were hard to read must have been blind, the font takes up 1/3+ of the key, makes me wonder what his motive was. I haven't had any wifi connection problems, and I'm at Starbucks and Mc D all the time. The battery life was an issue, 2 1/2 hrs, but I knew that when I bought it. I picked up an aftermarket battery on ebay for $39 and now get 6 hrs. It's not a $1000 gaming laptop, but its been great for the $$$ and my needs. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.
