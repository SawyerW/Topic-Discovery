As long as Apple continues to produce quality laptops, I will remain a loyal user. With Apple, you get your money's worth. Of all the Apple laptops I've owned, this MacBook is at the top. It offers the best in performance, reliability and quality, unlike most Windows-based laptops and computers, which are cheap and cheaply made. You get what you pay for.PROS:Very durable casingFast processorEasy do-it-yourself upgrades (RAM & hard drive)User-friendly operating systemCONS:Battery life is not nearly as long as I had hoped. But it's still better than most laptops. It usually lasts 4-5 hours while I'm just surfing the web. It is also not guaranteed. It's up to 10 hours, which depends on power consumption.
