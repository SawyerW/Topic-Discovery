I buy Dell computers to take to Tanzania to colleagues who can only spend $200 and a little more.  Tampa is amazing.  They are responsive and help with any questions.  These Dell 610-620 stand the test of time.  This one had Windows XP professional which I highly recommend even in the days of Windows 8.  It is reasonably fast.  The hard drive may be small, but you can buy back ups and especially for students where no Apple Store is available, they are definitely worth it.  I am an Apple fan, so I gave my Dell up a few years ago, but this one stands the test of time.  (Know your seller)
