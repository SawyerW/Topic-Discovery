Apple transitioned away from the conventional white (or in some instances, black) plastic bodies of its older MacBooks, to the unibody design in late 2008.  These were marketed from late 2008, until their discontinuation in early/mid 2010.This series features the same performance upgrades of the late-life 'plastic' A1181 MacBooks, such as an improved optical drive, NVIDIA graphics, capability of running Mountain Lion, P-series Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs, etc, but transitions from DDR2 to DDR3 RAM, and cosmetically resembles more closely what Apple has on the market in its retail store locations today in 2012/2013; and in fact, is not too far removed at the moment from the capabilities of those machines.White unibodies can support 8GB; silver unibody/unibody pro's unofficially for these earlier versions 16GB, with a downloadable SMC upgrade.
