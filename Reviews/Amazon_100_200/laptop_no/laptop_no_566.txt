This laptop is a great, standard laptop. I bought mine almost two years ago and it's served me very well in that time. I've been able to run just about whatever I please as long as it's not a higher level game, though most games it can handle fine. The keyboard felt very nice and the touchpad worked very well. My only gripe about this computer is that despite the built-in mechanisms for maintaining the battery's life over time, and taking reasonably good care of the battery in other ways myself, it has still become dependent on its cable. This may be an isolated incident, as I've never seen or heard of a battery degrade to that extent over a 2 year period. Overall however it is a great device and I still recommend it today!
