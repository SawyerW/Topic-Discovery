Macbook was okay- I'm assuming. Didn't get a chance to open the package as I was in the process of moving (homes)when it was delivered. When I finally had time, I realized it didn't come with a power adapter (the portion connecting the computer to the cord that is inserted into an outlet was missing). Call the Apple manufacturer and was told i had to pay for a replacement, as it was after a few weeks and I should have called within a few days. I was upset, angry- especially since the individual was rude. Never again will I purchase a Mac!
