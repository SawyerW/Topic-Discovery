I bought this Toshiba laptop 3 years ago and it worked great for 1.5 years. At the 1.5 year mark, the screen started to flicker and died not long after that. I had to hook it up to an external monitor and used it as a 'desktop' because I figured the repair cost was too much.  It hobbled on for another 1.5 years then died completely. I think my experience with Toshiba's poor reliability is very common, judging from reading many others' similar experience. I would never buy another Toshiba computer based on so many complaints by so many people. By the way, my 8-year-old Sony laptop is still going strong, slow but working still.
