This laptop seems great on paper. It is light (4.4 lbs), it is fast (i5 processor, decent RAM), it has decent hard drive (500 GB). Lots other features such as integrated webcam of decent quality, etc. etc. It has killer looks. It worked great for some time...Then, problems occurred:1. Its screen developed an internal crack. So, I bought a replacement and installed it. Thanks to the good Samaritans who posted the instructions to replace the screen. Warning, it is a little intricate process, and you will end up scratching the aluminum body of the laptop.2. Now, one of its hinges has become detached from the lid.And I use this very lightly at home, primarily as a desktop replacement. I don't even carry around, play games, or mishandle.Very flimsy indeed.
