Pros:Battery life is amazing! 6 hours of full use and charges up again in less than an hour.Full size Keyboard.Good size mousetrack, comfortable position and features apple-like touch controls, zoom in and out, two finger up and down that's great!Very thin body and light weight (except battery)Screen size is great for work and small enough to be portable.Great low price!Cons:Aluminum color is NOT like the picture. Is way darker.Battery is not flat, has a elevated part that helps ventilation, but make the back of the laptop bulky.Mouse click sound is very loud (I'm that picky)Sound comes very low but can be fixed, now it loud enough.This is a beautiful, thin, ultra portable laptop. Great value for the money!
