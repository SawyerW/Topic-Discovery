Let's face it, a rebuilt computer?  Of course there's gonna be some issues, it's to be expected.  I was looking for a really basic laptop for surfing, email, downloading music, etc.,and something that can play/burn cd's and play dvd's, not to mention basic word processing and so on.  Webcams, gaming apps, blah blah, weren't a factor.  I upgraded the g-wireless to g/n with an adapter no problem.  Had some issues with the speaker hardware, but fixed it with ms-support software I found on the internet.  Every now & then the 'net gets really, really lagging, but a reboot tends to solve it.  Again, it's been rebuilt; it's a little rickety in its construction, and it's an old model.  But the problems have been minor, and I am knowledgable enough to know where to go online for answers.  A "new" laptop for less than $200?  I couldn't be happier!
