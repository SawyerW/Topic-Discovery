i bought this cq62 at frys factory refurbished at frys for $300 its a great laptop for the price its only.2ghz slower than my broken hp dv7 3065 i got for $699 and its sound is better also the screen is just as clear and it is not noticably slower than that one either i dont need webcams or sd card slots so not having these doesnt bother me neither does the lack of hdmi slot. the 320gb hard drive is enough space and 3gb of ram is plenty for everyday use such as internet, word processing ect. and the graphics card has good gaming graphics for price as well it has stylish looks to me the processor is out of date but great and the build quality seems good i enjoy this laptop
