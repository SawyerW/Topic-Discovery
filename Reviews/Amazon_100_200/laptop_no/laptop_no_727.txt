So, the first thing I did when I got my new ASUS U32U-ES21 was format the drive and install ubuntu on it.  So far, it's been fantastic!!  I've been a little too busy to play around with the integrated video card yet (and I know Radeon GPUs aren't supposed to work all that well with Linux in general), but it at least plays videos, flash, and streaming videos all seemlessly.  The only downfall of this computer so far is that REALTEK still doesn't have a Linux Kernal 3.0+ driver for it's multi-card reader, but everything else seems to work.  Viewing angles are crap, but I'm used to that and the screen is twice as bright as my last laptop, so I'm not complaining.  What I really love about this laptop is the battery life.  I can work on it continuously for about 6 hours before it dies.  That's truly incredible.
