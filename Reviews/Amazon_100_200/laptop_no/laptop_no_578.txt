My old trusty HP running XP finally threw in the towel. Not a gamer or heavy graphics user so all out power is not necessary...just reliable basic web access and computing...and the occasional DVD/Movie.First off, you can tell this case is used for more than one machine as the HDMI output is blocked off.  Custom it is not. While the keyboard layout is pretty good it does have some "give" which gives it a less than solid feel. The touchpad is quite sensitive and I found myself accidentally having the cursor go haywire. I now disable it when using a mouse.  I do like the dedicated number pad but find it interesting there is no volume control...only on screen.4 USB ports is a bonus plus the built in web cam...something not found on many of the bargain units.  The battery charges very fast and in heavy/constant use I have been getting 2.5+ hours.Speed is fair and likely with a bump in the memory it will increase a bit.  Fortunately you can upgrade up to 8 gig.Not much else to say yet...but if all you need is a basic machine for less than $350 this could be your ticket.
