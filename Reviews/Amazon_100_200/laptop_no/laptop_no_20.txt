I got this Powerbook for my wife and I got a new desktop system.  I just have a few complaints about this PB:Poor battery life - we only get about 1 hour of use if we are using it.  If it's sitting idle the batter last longer, but what good is that?Flimsy case - it's pretty, but we've already scratched it twice and there is a crack on the bottom.  This isn't covered by the warranty, but if they are going to use cheap cases they shouldn't charge so much.Things I love - the screen is very nice and I like having a big hard drive.  (Despite what people say the drive isn't all that loud so go for a big hard drive.)
