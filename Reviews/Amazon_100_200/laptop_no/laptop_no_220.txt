I'm horrible at reviews and easily impressed so hopefully this does good.Its an amazing machine, what more can i say. It does much better than the previous edition of macbook because it now has a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 duo processor,the Nvidia GeForce 320 M graphics processor, and a 10 hour lasting battery which means its as good or even better than the 13 inch macbook pro released last year.Compared with the macs released this year it still does well, the only difference between this and a 13 inch macbook pro is that the macbook pro has an aluminum body, with up 2.66GHz intel processor and 4GB ram. I guess thats where the 200 dollar price difference  comes from.I also like the new unibody.If you require a laptop for regular everyday activities this will be more than great
