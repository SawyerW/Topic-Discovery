After the failure of my last PC laptop  at 20 months I knew there was a Mac in my future-I hadn't owned one in ten years. I do a lot of music and photographic work and needed a quality product and an OS that was user-friendly.  The keyboard has a great touch and I also love how easy the DVD slot is to use. The system boots up quickly and the resolution is fantastic. My previous laptop had  17" screen but I got used to this one in about thirty minutes. Good weight and size and the aluminum finish is really cool and easy to keep clean.My issues with this model are the USB ports-there are only two. That is quite the annoyance since I use a mouse  about 50% of the time and store a lot of files. The single audio I/O jack is "different" but not hard to use once you know how.Overall, I love my Mac and would recommend it highly!
