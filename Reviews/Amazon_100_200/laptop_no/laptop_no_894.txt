Having had the SSD on my 2010 Macbook Air fail twice in a year I was very concerned about the reliability - and fixability - of the Macbook Airs so I traded up to a regular hard drive (750GB) Macbook Pro. I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned... and with 8GB of RAM I can run a Windows 7 guest machine in seamless mode all the time... and it gives me the fastest Windows machine I've ever owned too!I am in heaven.
