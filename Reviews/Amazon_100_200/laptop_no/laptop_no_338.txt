Please save your money.  This laptop had 3 hardware failures prior to the warranty running out including two complete mother board replacements.  After the warranty ran out the battery died and the laptop needs to be plugged into the wall now.  The most recent problem is that it will not boot and will not allow me to perform a system recovery.  The worst part is the lack of support from Gateway.  Absolutely will not stand behind their product.  For a $200 fee they will provide PHONE support through a center in India.  F  these guys.  I hope they go out of business.  Runnnnnn away from this company.  If not for me, for yourself.
