I love my laptop and I really have only had one negative issue with it: the fan.I had my computer tech guy look into the reviews of it and the fan chips have been an issue.After sending it in to have the chip replaced: I have not had anymore issues.I think that it has made me a tad gun shy about purchasing another HP when I up-grade.Really I cannot complain; because I have had it for a year and that has been the only issue.In all fairness to HP, I am on my computer 8-12 hours a day writing and the fan has been the only issue.
