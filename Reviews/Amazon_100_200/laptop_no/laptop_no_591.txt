PROS: Display is nice, weight not too bad, keyboard is good, speakers are awesomeCONS: Extremely unreliable, battery not great, track pad not good, and some serious hardware issuesOVERALL: This product is not worth your money.When I bought it, it wouldn't play dvd's. Had to waste hours of my time dealing with completely lame customer service to get it fixed. Even after that, problems continued to pile up, conveniently right after the warranty ran out. USB ports will stop working randomly. The track pad, which isn't good to start with, sometimes will turn permanently on, making typing difficult, or not work at all. Last of all, using Photoshop makes the graphics card (which is supposedly good) crash my computer on a daily basis.CONCLUSION: I will never buy a Dell again after how I was treated as a consumer.
