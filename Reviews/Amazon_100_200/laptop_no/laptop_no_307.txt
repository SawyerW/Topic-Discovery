This is my first Toshiba Laptop, and for the price it's excelent!It was very fast to set this computer up, connecting to the wireless network and getting online took less than 10 minutes. The keyboard is full sized with nice key action. The screen is big, bright and really sharp. Love it.It has very cool things- A button to desactivate the track pad when using an external mouse- an HDMI port- is light enough for its size- even when the computer is asleep, you can charge your toys like ipad, phone... THIS IS THE BEST!- there is a media card reader slot for a camera media carddrawbacks- the Track pad has a touch feature for expanding and contracting your internet browser, sometimes this can be a headache, cause while you're using it, frequently make the mistakes of expanding or contracting your browser and is a chaos.. but sometimes it can be a easy way to do it. Is the only thing that I don't like very much.But in general is an excelent computer..
