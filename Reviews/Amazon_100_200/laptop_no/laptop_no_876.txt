Love the Macbooks, but the contrast and colors on this screen absolutely sucked a big one. This would have been my third - a gift for my wife. I tried to recalibrate several times with no luck. A little research revealed others having similar issues. Apparently, Apple is using 3 different vendors to produce the panels, each having varying contrast/color IQs - aka the "panel roulette."Comparing this side-by-side with my 2011, 13" Macbook Pro was like night and day. My 2011 has great contrast and is so easy on the eyes. This 2012 has marginally better contrast than my 2010 kindle, which is certainly not a good thing with a backlit screen.What annoys me the most is that Apple is losing a grip on QC. They claim to calibrate each screen individually; and they should considering the entrance fee for these books. No way this thing should have been let out of the factory.My advice is to do a little research and consider purchasing in person to verify the contrast, color and quality of the screen you're purchasing.
