I bought this laptop when I decided to go back to college.  Seemed like it would be exactly what I needed.  Sadly, this has not been the case.  Initially, out of the box, everything was good and had no problems. Past 18 months has been a major pain.First problem:  Anywhere across the bottom of the keyboard can act as a touch pad at times.  Try writing a paper and all of a sudden your cursor is somewhere else and you have to go back and fix it.Second problem:  Could no longer adjust the sound.Third problem:  Screen disappears for no reason and then reappears when you move the cursor.  This also just happened while typing this.Fourth problem:  Overheating!Fifth problem:  I could go on, but you get the picture.Had it to the computer repair shop twice with some things being corrected and other things showing up.  Could have bought another laptop with what I paid out for this one!We use dell at my job and they are also nothing but problems.  Will not buy another.  Shopping even now as I type.
