When I bought this laptop and i got it home it was nothing like the picture. Extremely old, scratches every where and awful. Wasn't very happy but since it was for my daughter and he mainly uses it for Facebook I let it slide. Worked fine for two months then all of the sudden stopped working after only a month and a half. When contacted the seller I was first told to send it back cause they were going to fix it. Then, after waiting for a week with no answered, call the seller and the same person who advice me to mail it then said he couldn't do anything about it. He was not going to fix either return or credit the money. So basically i lost over $200 just like that.Do not get anything from this people. Don't keep buying products from them and keep them in business. They deserve no star at all.
