I purchased this laptop in 2009 and it has been great to me. Here are few things I love about this laptop:The keyboard is great and typing is very comfortable.WiFi connects very well and I've never had a problem anywhere I've gone.The screen is amazing with great quality and graphics for watching movies, doing schoolwork, surfing the web, etc.I love that it is fast, even now four years later, it boots up pretty quick, and (using google chrome) it works very fast even with several windows and tabs open.It has crashed two times because my antivirus wasn't working properly but other than that I haven't had many problems with it. The only thing is that in the past few months the battery started giving out and it only lasts for like 20 minutes now, but again I've had it for FOUR years now. The only reason I'm getting a new laptop is because it weights 5 pounds and it is way too heavy for me to carry around for work and so I need an ultrabook. I'm still keeping it around because it has been good to me :)
