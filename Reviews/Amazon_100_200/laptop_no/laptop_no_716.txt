I bought this lenovo via amazon because it was recommended by a lot of tech blogs. I did see the amazon reviews that said it sucked but didnt pay attention to those. so i had it sent it to Chile where i live.The computer itself its really beautiful but thats it. The usb 3.0 didnt work at all, webcam keep failing (skype or other webcam apps), usb 2.0 sometimes do not respond, dvd keep making an awful noise everytime i turned on the computer, eject disc didnt work from scratch and the trackpad is hell.And now, the case it starting to break.I try to get solutions from the lenovo forum but it didnt work out and i cant spend money to send it back because i dont live in the US.So my advice, trust amazon's customer reviews and dont buy a lenovo product ever again
