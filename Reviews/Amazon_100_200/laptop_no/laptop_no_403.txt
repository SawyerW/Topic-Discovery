Pros:-Buttons aren't too big or too small-Nice, big 16" 720p screen-Easy access-Built-in Wireless adapter-Realtek HD Audio is good for headphone or additional speaker use-Excellent for watching videos-Plenty of RAM and HDD space-SD card slotCons:-Volume adjuster is a bit too retro-Speakers doesn't have a very good quality, compared to other Toshiba laptops-Not made for heavy video gaming(setting graphics to max)-Only 2 USB portsGood working laptop, for media use; not able to keep up on the latest video games, if you set the graphics too high; recommend low graphic settings.Not a lot of bass on the speakers; I recommend using additional speakers or headphones, if you want a good experience when listening to music or watching videos.I won't say anything about the touchpad, since I rarely use touchpads.  However, setting up the touchpad can be fun.  I'll never guess there being a option that adds inertia to the cursor, when using the touchpad, and bounces off the edges of the screen, if I didn't see it on there.
