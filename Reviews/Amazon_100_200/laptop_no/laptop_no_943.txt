My grand daughter attends Kent State University. Seems the whole school... at an academic level... is going paperless. She had a PC. All of her professors and instructors use Macintosh.Knowing that I am a Mac fan-boy, it was a no-brainer that she asked me for this as a Christmas present.When the MacBook Pro arrived, I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive.It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate. However, I always recommend at least 8 gigs, so I ordered 8 gigs from Amazon. When the RAM arrived, all 8 gigs were on one stick. So I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place. The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine. But, hey, it's an Apple. I wouldn't expect anything less!
