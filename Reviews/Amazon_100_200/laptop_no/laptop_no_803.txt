I wanted to post this because I haven't noticed it on Amazon, and I think it's a growing problem that still hasn't been explicitly addressed by Apple.It's happened about 5 times now: I open up the Air and shortly after the screen goes black. I then have to re-awaken it by typing a key. In my case it's happened when operating on battery at lower than 30%. I just purchased it about a week ago from Best Buy, so I'm trying to decide whether I should take it back and avoid the potentially worse problems that could arise in the future, or keep it, and assume that the issue will be fixed.There's already a lengthy thread on it here: [...]And you can see it happen spontaneously in a review on YouTube (when being compared to the Leonovo 11s) here @ 17:29:[...]Anyways, I'm giving the product a temporary score of 3/5 because, besides the very seldom black screen issue, it's still been the best laptop I've ever used. If the problem is resolved shortly, I'll update the score to a 5/5.
