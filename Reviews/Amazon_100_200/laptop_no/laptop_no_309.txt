I had not bought a new computer in about 10 years, so I was a little nervous buying on-line.  This computer was pretty easy to set-up and get going.  I got it at about 4 pm and I needed it for a show that I was going to do at 600, so I was able to quickly install the software and import the files from my old computer to new one in about 30 min. User friendly and quick.  I was a little disappointed it did not come with any software as my previous computers had. But I was able to download what I needed with software I had purchased, but it's nice to get updated software with new computers.  I had a little trouble with the Windows Lived Mail and spent several hours trying to get it to work and sent a question into Microsoft and got it fixed myself before they emailed me a response back 2 weeks later, but this was nothing to do with Toshiba, it's software. It would be nice if the keyboard was back lit, but not too bothersome. Overall it is quick and easy to use for my needs.
