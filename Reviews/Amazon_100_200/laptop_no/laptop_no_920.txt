Can't believe an APPLE is better than I originally thought.  On one hand I'm sorry I waited until I got an Iphone to get the Mac Pro but on the other hand, I have the most powerful machine out there for the price.  A little concerned about the software converters I need now for Mpeg2,4 etc...I knew what to get for Windows but for MAC.  I'll see what the tutorials tell me.  What a product though. Easy to use. Command functions are brand new to me and that's exciting.  I'm using this to perform better movie production and I do expect Rendering to be much faster.Can't wait...Bravo again Apple...I'm not one to critique other critiques but respectfully, if you spill something on a PC....that's it...nothing to do with the product, any product.  Learning Curve with a new product or PC environment also not part of the product rating.Just Sayin........
