I've had this laptop for around a week now, and it's been running very well. It's more than able to handle basic tasks like web browsing and word processing. Video playback speed as well as gaming performance (in Portal 1 and 2) is also excellent. The built-in fingerprint scanner makes logging in to my Windows account as well as my other online account very easy and secure. I would prefer Windows 7 Professional instead of Home Premium, however. The built-in webcam is somewhat below par with a high latency and underwhelming quality. But those are just small gripes that are easy to overcome. All in all, it's a great laptop
