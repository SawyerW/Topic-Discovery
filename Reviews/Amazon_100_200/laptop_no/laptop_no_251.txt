I loved my laptop but now I do not after finding there are some problems with it. I understand it is 3 years old now but I can't afford another one at the moment. Firstly the left hinge is broken, thinking I was alone I went on Ebay to see if I could get a replacement but found 2 laptops with the same problem. After googling the problem I couldn't believe how many people had this problem.I am now afraid to close my laptop and when you pick it up the screen falls flat, I've not mistreated it the hinge just cracked.  Also the laptop gets HOT and I mean really HOT!!I wouldn't buy it again as I now know of the emachines hinge problem. I would not recommend it either.
