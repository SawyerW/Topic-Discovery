Excellent keyboard feel.  Excellent non-glare screen.  In fact for me it has been outstanding in almost every way and is used all day every day.  I liked the first one enough that I bought my wife one to replace her older Toshiba.  For my use it has only two shortcomings which are relatively minor, or perhaps non-existent for someone else: The lid has no easy place to get hold of to start opening the computer.  The second problem I have is that the touch pad seems ultra sensitive and I have difficulty typing emails because my palm gets close to it and there goes the cursor somewhere else.  However I use a trackball and this resolves the problem nicely.  I suspect that those who are accustomed to using touch-pads might not experience my problem.  My wife likes the touch-pad and apparently has no problem with it. I run both linux and windows on it and they both run flawlessly.
