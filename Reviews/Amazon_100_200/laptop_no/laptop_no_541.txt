When I initially purchased this laptop, it looked like a great deal across the board. Would make a nice backup to an older desktop for home use primarily.We returned it without any hassle from Amazon for one simple reason-It's screen and keyboard are too small to work on for extended periods-cramped space and gets uncomfortable to use.Otherwise a decent PC but too much consumer "trashware" fills a substantial amount of it's one hard drive.In short a "No Fly" unless it's for your kids. Ive had multiple biz laptops of a similar size, but all were more accessible-that was the deal breaker here.
