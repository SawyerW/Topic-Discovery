Well built, good speakers, huge hard drive. Aluminum casing is nice to have. HP CoolSense technology really does keep the temperature down while it's running. Screen is just okay but it really wasn't a deterrent for me (and shouldn't be for you either - the screen is more than adequate). Beats Audio software is a major plus when listening to music with headphones. I owned a Dell Studio XPS 13 prior to this and paid about 3x as much for it, and it died after about 2 years, with those 2 years being full of hardware issues. I could not be happier with HP, they make great laptops. I fully intend on replacing this with another HP when the time comes (and I won't be buying another Dell ever again).Bottom line: this laptop is pre-Ultrabook era, so don't expect it to be an Ultrabook. With that said, it's a workhorse. This laptop has accompanied on many Amtrak trips, many mass transit trips to and from college, has been dropped more times than I'd like to admit, and it just keeps going.
