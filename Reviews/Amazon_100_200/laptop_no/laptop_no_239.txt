I wrote a review this morning that bashed this laptop because it didn't have a memory card.  They called my twice before noon and wanted to make it right.  They were very concerned that I didn't get the service or product that I was expecting -- and that has made me change my mind about this company-- to a very positive experience.  I never called them to make them aware that I had a problem -- therefore they didn't have a change to make corrections.  I am sorry about that--next time I will just pick up the phone instead of stewing for days.  So overall, the laptop arrived very quickly, is in great shape, does just what I want it to do and I feel that this company is supportive and respects the consumer.  Thank you!
