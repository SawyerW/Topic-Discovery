This computer replaced a 10 year old Dell desktop system and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's the heart of a wireless system.  Unfortunately, I had a hard-drive failure that occurred just after the warranty expired so I had to pay to have it repaired.  I sent the unit back to HP.  Their customer service department did an excellent job of instructing me on how to send the unit back and even sent a prepaid box for that purpose.  I wasn't happy about the expense but it happens but HP made the experience minimally painful.  As for it's performance, it's exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
