I bought my Air at the Apple store, just so I feel comfortable working with my local folks for when I eventually have to go back in with an Apple issue ( I have lots of Apple items, so building relationships helps <g>).I love Amazon, but I just felt safer this way.The computer is a real dream and very aesthetically pleasing to the eyes.  This is my third MacBook Air.  For my use, I see no reason to go any heavier then 3 pounds, and a 256hard drive works for me.  If your a gamer, you have different requirements.  I just need it for work, with no heavy spread sheet usage.I find I have to carry the Air around a lot, and every pound I save on weight makes a difference.I would not hesitate to recommend this computer to anyone!
