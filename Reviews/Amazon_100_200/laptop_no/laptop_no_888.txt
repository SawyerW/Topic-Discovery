The 15" MBP 2012 is the fastest Mac that I have ever used!I didn't want the Retina one due to most applications don't support yet. In fact I still use manyLegacy programs (Appleworks, FileMaker Pro, Quicken, Photoshop etc)! Because the MBP camewith Lion and included a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, I could not run any of those legacyprograms. I have Pages, Numbers and many other programs that will import the old files, but somecouldn't!The solution was to buy a copy of Snow Leopard Server from Apple for $19 and a copy of Parallels 8 OEMfrom Newegg for $28.I run Snow Leopard in a Virtual Machine on my Macbook Pro and can use ALL of my Legacy programs.I can run any of the current programs on Mountain Lion and run the Legacy programs under Virtualization.I now have the best of both worlds.The USB 3 is FAST!
