The Unibody is really cool and the construction and feel of this machine are unrivaled. A few of the things I don't quite like are the fact that iMovie doesn't let you import raw AVCHD files from an external drive. It has to be from the camcorder...phssst whats up with that? And one other sort of lame thing is the mini display port means your existing hdmi or dvi cables will need yet another accessory to connect. But it could be seen as a good thing because the form factor of the port is small and allows for a flexible connection.Screen is bright, but if you don't like glare get the anti glare coating...
