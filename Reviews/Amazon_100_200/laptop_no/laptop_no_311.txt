I own this model since Nov 2011 the unit itself I have no problem, what I do have a problem with is the battery. If you read the specs from Toshiba it says battery life is UP TO 6.38 hours.  Iam tired of companys lying to the public with false statements to sell there product. At a full charge the most I get out of my battery is 3 hours. After 10 min of non-use it drops down to 1 hour 55 min. If the battery gets 3 hours say 3 hours not 6.38 hours. Toshiba is misleading the public, if I new I would only get 3 hours I would have never purchased the unit. They say that so you would buy there product. I talked to Toshiba and they would not do anything for me, so BUYERS BEWARE....
