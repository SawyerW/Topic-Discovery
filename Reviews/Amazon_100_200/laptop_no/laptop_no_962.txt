I've been an avid Windows user since Windows 95 and have gone to great lengths to trash talk apple products  in the past. I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games.That being said, I use this computer mainly for school. It's not extremely thin and light but definitely on the lighter end compared to most laptops. The backlit keyboard is an excellent feature when writing in the dark at night and the battery life is excellent.The OSX operating system is far more intuitive than I thought. I'm truly impressed and  thoroughly impressed with this laptop.
