I wanted something very portable to use when my ipad air or iphone isn't enough. This is my first MacBook and I don't understand the hype honestly. I can understand the weak processor to save on battery and the low ram, I don't even fault it for the typical Apple overpricing of ssd space. The display however is un-excusable. This thing looks like blurry junk. They can put Retina in everything but the air? My wife was jealous of my new toy until I said you take it. She changed her mind real quick. I will keep it but I'll probably never use it. Mac OS is better than I expected though and I knew the res going in but I had no idea how much I would actually hate it. I'm an overpriced Apple fan through and through because their stuff works, I'm just very disappointed this time.
