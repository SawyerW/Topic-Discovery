I really dont know what others are talking about. Have owned this for 1 day under a week and love it. Battery life is as advertised by Lenovo (about 4 hours). I got a little for than that (4.5 hours). Graphics preformance is awesome with switcable from Intel HD to AMD Discrete 1GB graphics. The i5 processor is quick and 6GB ram is plenty. Hard drive is ok, only 5400rpm. it seems that people are having issues when buying from Amazon. I bought direct from Lenovo.comBreathable keyboard is great and easy to type on. Like i read in several professional online reviews (CNET, Wired, etc.) the touch pad is finicky. after using it for a couple days, i have got the hang of it and it is easy and completely functional. I would reccomend this computer.
