I bought this laptop from Best Buy for $750. Here are my thoughts after using the laptop for a couple of weeks.PROS:* Feels great that I didn't spend a fortune.* Light and sturdy.* Strong performance.* Very nice monitor and graphics.* Stable Internet (doesn't drop my internet connection and it's fast even when I'm 3 rooms away from my crappy wireless router).CONS:* Viewing angle (this probably is a problem with most laptops though).* The speaker(s) are not that great.* Webcam quality is poor.* Touch pad is far from perfect (although the 2-finger scroll does work after some practice).* Battery life is not 8 hours, more closer to 4-6 hours.Overall, the PROS outweigh the CONS for me. I needed a laptop that is light and has solid performance, and this laptop definitely delivered. The battery life is worse than I thought, but still much better than my old laptop. It could be a problem if you travel a lot and need full 8 hours so you can survive through the plane ride. Other than that, you really can't beat the price.
