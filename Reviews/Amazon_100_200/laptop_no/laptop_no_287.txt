Jus got the laptop today and it has been peforming great thus far with no defects, keys offer a good feel when typing however feel kinda flimpsy for my taste but the arragement of keys is good. average speaker audio responsive touch controls and good images from the built in 1.3 mp camera. the LED display is large and bright. hardware got a 4.0 rating from windows 7 with the lowest score of 4.0 for graphics. overall, the material doesnt feel very strong but this gives you the benefit of a light machine that easy to move around with. i'm loving it so far and would recommend it to anyone except hardcore gamers. great price too.
