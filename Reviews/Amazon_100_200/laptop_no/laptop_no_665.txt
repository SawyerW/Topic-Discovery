first off this is a great laptop, i received it yesterday and so far i have set up my back up cd;s and had a chance to play around with it.But theres one problem that is bugging me alot. The left speaker seems to produce much less volume than the right speaker.so for anyone who has bought this asus can you tell me if your experiencing the same problem?Iam trying to figure out wether bang and olufsen desighned the left speaker to be lower in volume than the right speaker for better dynamic purposes? or wether iam just having a hardware or software problem?so please who ever owns this asus can you test your speakers by listening to them in a quite environment and determining wether or not the right speaker is louder than the left?thank you
