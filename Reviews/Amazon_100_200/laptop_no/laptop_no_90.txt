I bought this XPS M1330 in November 2007.  Fortunately, it had a three year on-site repair warranty.  The local repair guy got to know my receptionist pretty well for all the times he fixed this thing.  It's either five LCD displays and four motherboards or four LCD displays and three motherboards, all under warranty.  I replaced the LCD display once myself.Now, the 65W AC adapter is not recognized by the computer and doesn't charge the battery, although a 90W after-market adapter works just fine.  Pradeep, the Dell tech service rep, says the motherboard is at fault.  I'm not sure it's worth the cost or trouble to replace the motherboard since the MTBF has been less than a year.Except for having replaced most everything except the keyboard and hard drive, I really like the computer.  It's the ideal size and weight for what I use it.  It looks good, I like the keyboard and display and it connects quickly to WiFi networks.  It does run a little warm.Too bad it's not reliable.
