I have never love a used laptop before, the way i love this product. I bought this item after going through rigorous research on Google about its specification. But one thing I forgot to check was whether this particular model has a Webcam or not. Though i ended up buying a product with no webcam (although the seller said he described clearly on the product page that there was no webcam), I love it specially because it is so rugged. A Business Notebook PC with all the features a businessman would want in a notebook PC: Smartcard reader (very important feature for online transaction), Business card scanner, fingerprint, bluetooth, wireless, keyboard flashlight (at the top of the screen, just where you would find the webcam) for keyboard visibility while working in dark place), a 3GB Ram with 160GB HDD, in addition to that, a genuine Windows 7 Professional installed by the seller.Wao! I've got nothing much to say but am sorry, I love this PC.
