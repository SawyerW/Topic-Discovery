I have owned an HP DV4-1551dx for about 2 1/2 years now. I bought it on eBay as used like new. This machine has performed extremely well for me while traveling, home office and personal use. It has hundreds of hours of use. It has been used for 125+ Power Point presentations and 200+ Netflix downloaded movies, iTunes radio and music listening. I have used Roxio 2010 to create more than 150 original disks from pictures. It has Skype and works perfectly for call to relatives in Brazil. I have used it to transfer about 100 LP 33 1/3 RPM records to iTunes. This has been an exceptionally durable laptop. I cloned the hard drive recently and replaced it with another 320 GB drive just in case. I have had several hard drive failures in the past on other computers and it it better to replace them before you need to rather than after they crash! I use it on top of a cooling fan for extended use and blow the dust out of the case and fan every 3 months.
