I purchased the Macbook Air 11.6" in July of 2013 and was very excited about it.  I was converting from a PC and loved the machine, at first.  About 7 months after I purchased the laptop the charger stopped working.  I took it inot the ApplE store at Grand Central in NYC, and they informed me that there was extensive corrosive damage to the logic board.  There was no cause for this to happen, and this extent of damage is iexplicable.  Apple informed me that I would have to pay over $750 to fix the machine, despite being covered under warranty.  I am very displeased with this product and considering switching back to a PC.SarahNew York, NY
