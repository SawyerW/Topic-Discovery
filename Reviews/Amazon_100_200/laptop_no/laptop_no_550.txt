I got this free of cost from nvidia-HP settlement after my dual core dv6113us's display broke down. I would advise anyone looking for a laptop to buy a better one from HP even if you pay $100 more. If you open 2-3 applications at one time, it slows down. Does not have HDMI output. My old laptop had s-video output normal for a 2006 laptop. Battery life is very very poor. The mouse buttons are very hard to press (looks like 1990s technology). I am using an external usb mouse. There were a few issues installing Windows-7 updates but I got over it. I like HP but don't buy this one to save a few bucks. I have a HP desktop running Vista and it performs very well. My old HP laptop that ran XP was good too.
