This is great for portability. It runs relatively fast and smooth. Battery life for me is around 7 hours. What I'm most impressed with is that this netbook doesn't get too hot like my other laptops. Normally, when I am on my other laptops for hours, they would get really hot so I'd have to put a fan under them. With this ultrabook, even when I'm streaming Netflix videos for hours, I only gets slightly warm, not hot. The only con I  have for this ultrabook is that the keys are placed in a way where it's uncomfortable to type and I also miss keys when typing.
