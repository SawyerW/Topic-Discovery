I purchased a Dell Inspiron i14RN-1818DBK at a brick and mortar store then when I went online to dell's website I found that you had to virtually remove every screw in the thing and pry the keyboard off in order to upgrade the hard drive, or replace it if it went south.  That alone caused me to return it without even plugging it in and turning it on.  I always like to replace the slow 5400-rpm hard drives with faster ones even if it does cost me a bit in battery life.  That way if the faster drive I select does go south I still have the original one that I can clone again.  When manufactures make replacing hard drives and ram really difficult for me I simply vote with my pocketbook.  I just purchased a Toshiba P745-S4320 at another brick and mortar for almost $100 more. It has 1 less usb port, no e-SATA or bluetooth, but does have a blue ray player and most importantly the ram and hard drive are accessible.
