I have always preferred Windows to Mac, but now that i actually have one i really like the mac. This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more. Very fast compared to the Dells i've always had and very nice display. I love the gestures that the trackpad has. They make the computer so much easier to use compared to other computers and the operating system is very good. i still love the windows operating system but the operating system for this computer is just amazing. The only issue i have with this computer is the price of it but it is worth it especially if you need something that is good for school.
