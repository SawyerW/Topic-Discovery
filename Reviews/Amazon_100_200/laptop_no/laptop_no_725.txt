Both my friend and I bought these from the Microsoft Store (one in Arizona one in Virginia) during the 2011 end of the year sale.My motherboard died within 1 month of use. My friends died after 3 months. Neither of us put the machine through any strenuous activities.I am not sure if its a factory defect or if Microsoft did something to mess things up. Good thing is that you get a 1 year Acer warranty that pays for shipping and repair costs (takes about 10 days).A shot in the dark, id guess it has something to do with the dual video card. The model has HD3000 graphics and Nvidia 240m and alternates between the 2 depending on demand. Sounds like a good balance but it could be messing with the motherboard.Other than the risk of motherboard failure (lol), its a great machine. I use it as a desktop replacement. I really like the ability to wirelessly stream video to an intel Widi enabled TV.
