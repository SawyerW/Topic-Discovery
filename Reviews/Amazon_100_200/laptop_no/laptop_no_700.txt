After tons of reviews, reading everything I could find and just plain procrastinating I went ahead and purchased this laptop. I've had it for about three months now and can say that I'm very pleased with my purchase. The screen is nice and clear, the keyboard feels really nice and the performance is really great for an inexpensive piece. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to spend about 5 bills on a basic laptop.Only cons so far are:Windows updates. Either it sat for a while before I bought it or Windows 7 just has a butt load of updates but twice it's taken about 20 minutes to install them before it would either start or shut down.I got the BSoD once! I have no idea why as I shut it down normally but on start up, there it was. I restarted it and it's not returned but, yeah, not a nice thing to see.
