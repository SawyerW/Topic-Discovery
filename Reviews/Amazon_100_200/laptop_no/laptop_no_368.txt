This is my first Mac.  I purchased it because I wanted to develop for the iPhone/iPad.  Little did I know that it would also make my wife happy as I was able to upload photos that she had been on me about for some time.  iPhoto with its facial recognition is just amazing.  I had about 5,000 pictures to go through, but they seem to go pretty fast for the main part (identify a face and location if i wish).  My next adventure will be iMovie for creating family movies.I've done some learning with it as well with iTunesU.  I've only seemed to confuse the MacBook pro a couple of times, but for the most part it just works and does it very well.  Thank you Apple for making a solid product.
