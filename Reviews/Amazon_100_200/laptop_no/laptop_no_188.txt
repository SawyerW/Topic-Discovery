Holy frijole!! This computer is by far the most amazing device I've ever owned.  I have been a PC user for 18 years, and have recorded full albums professionally on Cubase and Nuendo for years and sworn off the enemy, known as the "Apple Empire".  Well, no more.Apple has finally addressed all the shortcomings of the PC-MAC transition, and you'll wonder why you spent all that time messing around with your custom built Fry's PC and all that Windows drama.There is something to be said about a company that controls the hardware and software production line.  Say what you will, but Apple has built a company that is answering all the dreams of technology and innovation and certainly raising the bar for competition.Best built laptop money can buy, period. Best customer service, best looking, easiest most user intuitive OS.Spend your time being productive instead of tweaking registries and trying to find stuff on your 'puter.MB986LL/A2.8ghz, 4g ram, 500gb15.4"8 hour batterySD slot
