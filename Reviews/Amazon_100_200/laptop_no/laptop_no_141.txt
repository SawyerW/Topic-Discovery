I usually don't buy refurbs but decided to take a chance.  The Dell Lattitude E6400 arrived quickly and was in good shape.  After a couple of weeks something went wrong with Windows 7 and it started freezing up.  I emailed the vendor emphasizing that I didn't really think there was anything physically wrong with the laptop, asking if I could get a windows disk to reinstall the operating system.  Almost immediately, I received an email offering to send a whole new hard drive with Win 7 installed.  It arrived very fast and I would recommend both this model and the vendor I bought it from.
