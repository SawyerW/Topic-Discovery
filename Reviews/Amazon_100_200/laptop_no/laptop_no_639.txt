Finally after months of waiting for Windows Ultrabook laptop, my Acer's S3 arrived.  What surprised me the most was the EASY setup.. it took less than 3minutes to setup the system and I was doing what I needed to do! Acer makes it very simple to cut the B.S. and let user get to do what they want to do.I am blown away from Instant On-- It feels like you are using your mobile phone or TV. It just works.... simple as that.Performance is just AWESOME! and.. don't forget it has 320GB HD!! Vs. SDD! Storage capacity is awesome and I love my new S3!$400 below Macbook air- I was thinking about replacing my 1.5 year old model- and happy made this decision.Acer did again!Cheers,
