I just upgraded from a late 2006 Macbook and couldn't be happier!  I loved my original Macbook and enjoyed using it for the past five years and the only reason I upgraded to the new MBP was that my display on my original Macbook had begun to deteriorate and the battery sucked.  Macs last a long time though, and I'm looking forward to many years with this one.  This laptop, above any others, is just downright beautiful.  I have never seen such craftsmanship and sexiness in a computer before.  It is a joy to own.  I encourage any with the money to pick up on of the 2011 model MBPs and see for yourself!  The new processors are amazingly fast and this 13 inch core i5 is more than I'll ever need!
