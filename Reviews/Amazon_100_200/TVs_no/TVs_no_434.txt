I had been shopping around for a good hd set to use for my xbox 360. I was going to get a 37" sharp aquos that had full 1080p, but considering the significantly lower price of this samsung I purchased this set. After the purchase I began to notice that at all the 360 demo kiosks they have at electronics stores were using this model except smaller. This definitely made me feel confident in my purchase. I've been using it for 3 weeks and just finished Splinter Cell on it, the game looked amazing. My only advice is make sure you have some kind of HD source the first night you get it so you can truly appreciate the picture.
