This is a great TV for viewing HDTV channels.  It's simply amazing the quality of the picture. Viewing quality of non-HDTV channels can vary quite a bit depending on the signal.  Some are pretty bad, but others looks good. It's not the set, but just the way it is with LCDs and non-HDTV channels.  The sound is not so great, but when I want to watch a game, I plug in other speakers.  I think for the money, this set is excellent.One warning though.  If you have a problem with it, good luck getting service with Samsung.  I have a DVD recorder which died after installing the latest firmware to fix a problem with choppy video.  I've called several times, but I keep getting the "we're experiencing an unusual volume of calls" message (yeah sure).  I've emailed service twice, and have yet to get a response.  So I hope my relatively expensive HDTV does not have a problem, because I doubt I'll be able to get Samsung to fix it.
