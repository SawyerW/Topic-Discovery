Finnally Sony is trying to catch up to the competition.  But with a huge price tag more then double their competitors of the same size hdtv set who are they kidding.  And of course this model is not available anywhere.  You can not even find it on sony's web site.  So amazon knows about it but that just means they plan to sell it in the us.  Who knows when, and at $...I don't see them selling to many.  Don't get me wrong I love sony products everything I own is sony, if this product was priced comparably with it's competition I'd be at the store right now picking it up.  Looks like the competition is still got the upper hand on HDTV.  I hope sony corrects this soon as it's almost football season.
