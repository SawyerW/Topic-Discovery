Great TV.  When I first got it, it was grainy beyond belief.  So I put a cable box and a HDMI cable in the room with the TV.  Reception improved.  However, the regular channels still look like crap.  Only the true HD channels, like ESPN HD shows the tv's true potential.  I have a rear projection 47" panasonic in the living room.  The rear projections have better clarity on the regular channels and look slightly better on the HD channels.  The LCD's look awful on regular channels and fantastic on true HD channels.  Not all HD channels are true HD- some are digital, but not really HD.  You can tell when you scroll through all the channels.  But overall I like the TV.  I think when the technology catches up with the TV it will look even better. I do like the Samsung and am pleased with my choice.  I looked at the 1080 Sony but I don't think the $300 increased price was worth it.  Because I ordered the Samsung LCD though Amazon, they also mailed me a free upconverting Samsung DVD player which I thought was a great deal.  I would order from Amazon again.
