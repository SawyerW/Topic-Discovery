Samsung makes the best product for the lowest price point - period. HOWEVER - CAVEAT EMPTOR is a universal truth that should NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!I had issues with my Samsung HD tube TV (different model but this info is still applicable). I was a good little customer - going through the normal processes - but ended up without a TV for two one month periods at a time! I eventually escallated to Samsung corporate by looking up their NJ Offices and asking to speak to the VP of Marketing / Customer Service. I was routed to the specialized corporate customer care group and STILL got the run around. A Samsung Customer Service Manager eventually offered to sell me a TV for MORE THAN I COULD BUY IT IN THE STORE!!!!!!! How INSULTING! UNBELIEVEABLE is the only way to describe how INEPT their Service processes and groups are. They supposedly use the Six Sigma approach to quality... I can tell you with Samsung - they only give lip service to quality and customer service. I have NEVER been more disappointed with a company than with Samsung.
