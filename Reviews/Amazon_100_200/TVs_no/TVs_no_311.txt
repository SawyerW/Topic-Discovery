I'll skip all the good details about this TV - others can cover that. Here's what I found. I'm told by experts it's a good TV, assuming you don't watch something on 4:3 ratio for more than 2 hours at a time. The screen burns lines along the side, showing up when you watch something in wide screen. And get this... it's not covered by the warranty! While Samsung says there are things you can do to help 'fix' this, the fact that this happens should be unacceptable for any consumer. The vast majority of TV programming is still in 4:3 ratio and it's not ideal to stretch everything out just for the sake of the TV's health. I also don't care that this is covered in the manual, common knowledge among TV geeks, or that this isn't specific to Samsung TVs (it may even be common for most plasmas and LCDs). To protect the consumer, there should be an on-screen warning or something far more obvious than text in the manual.So be warned if you intend to purchase this, or any other wide-screen TV for that matter. Don't watch anything in 4:3 ratio.
