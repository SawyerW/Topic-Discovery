I have shopped for 3-4 months for a flat panel tv to upgrade to. After exhaustive research (consumer electronics and cnet )and reviews of recommendations I settled on the Samsung 42 inch Plasma. What a great TV! I am very happy with the purchase. I was bit hesitant about making such a big purchase online but after reviewing Amazon's and the sellers Refund Policy as well as the glowing reports I felt very comfortable. The TV was purchased from Electronics Express and not only was their price signifcantly better than the brick and mortar's (best buy , circuit city) they were very easy to access and accomodiate me via telephone when I called. I purchased the TV online on a Saturday and fully expected to get the TV in a 7-10 days. To my surprise the TV was delivered via FedEx on Tuesday in perfect working order. I can not praise Electronic Express enough for the product, price, customer service, and speed of delievery.The TV is abosolutly worth the price. The 15K contrast ratio makes the colors really stand out. What a great purchase.
