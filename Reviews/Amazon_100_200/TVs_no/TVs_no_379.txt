I received delivery of the tv in late August 2006, it worked for 8 hours and then just died. I called Samsung and they asked me to try something and then something else. Nothing worked. After many no answers and disconnects I finally got through to them(Samsung service), I was told that when people have my problem(vertical lines of differing size and color with only sound) that the display is defective. I was told I would receive a call about the replacement of the set, that was August 28, 2006. I have not heard from them yet. I tried to get some action with my credit card company(Citi) with no luck. This is probably going to the courts so just BEWARE of buying a big ticket item from Amazon, better just go to a brick and mortar store and play it safe.
