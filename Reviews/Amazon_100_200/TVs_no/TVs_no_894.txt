The picture of the Aquos from Sharp makes for a well defined picture with a nice viewing angle. The control settings on the TV allow for a wide range of options. Picture adjustment is first class, with audio configuration having a moderate number of options available. The different viewing modes allow for wide screen content to be viewed without side empty black space on the screen. The PC connectivity with DVI to HDMI is excellent and is easily configured. Built in speakers have a little trouble with bass sound that will cause a slight rattling but provide very nice HD sound. Gaming isn't a problem on this TV with the PS3 or XBOX 360. Finally the built in surround sound provides for an incredible viewing experience with movies with any home speaker system.
