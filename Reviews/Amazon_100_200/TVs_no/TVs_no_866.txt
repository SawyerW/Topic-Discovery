After careful review it came down to this TV and similar Sony.  I have had a few Sony's and while expensive, they are good TVs.  The specifications on this TV could not be matched anywhere, but its how it looks in person that will always carry the day.  After having owned the TV for at least 30 days, I know there are great TVs out there - but, I am sure I made a great decision.  This TV is incredible - if you have the right settings.  Standard TV channels are ok (and you are going to find that on all large screen TVs), but high def channels or DVDs are unlike anything else I can still see on the shelf.  Others have talked about the need to change the settings and that is so important.  I worked for many days tweaking the settings and still find some greens a tad harsh.  But if you are will to pay the price and work with the settings, this TV will redefine your viewing experience.
