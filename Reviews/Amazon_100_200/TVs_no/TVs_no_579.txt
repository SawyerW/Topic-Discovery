We purchased the TV brand new from our local electronics store.After owning the TV approximately eighteen months, we awoke one morning to find the inner screen shattered. Nobody had touched it during the night and it was perfectly fine the night before.The extended warranty we had purchased for the TV was useless as the warranty company refused to fix the TV because they said we must have abused the TV.So, we wasted almost $2000 for a television that lasted a year and a half.We will never buy another Panasonic TV or LCD TV. We went with plasma for the replacement television.
