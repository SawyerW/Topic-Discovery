I've had this TV for about a month and a half and I still can't believe how amazing it is!  The picture quality is second to none. I connected HD cable TV via an HDMI cable and the images are simply stunning. The images are rich and vivid, and once you view HD programs on this set, you won't want to view anything else.  The standard definition channels look good as well. My video games, which i've connected via a component cable, look great.  The only drawback was that it only had 1 component connection, which if you have many electronics that you'd like to connect in a such a way, you'll find yourself limited.  I would easily recommend this TV over any other in its category.
