Wow, this Sony CRT blows away the LCD and Plasma's I've seen from today. If you can live with a 230lb behemoth this TV will not disappoint. The color and clarity with a good DVD player have left me unwilling to upgrade for many years. Computer gamers have known for years that CRT's provide a superior picture to LCD's and this still holds true for the most part. Another thing about this TV is the great sound quality. The benefit of the size of this television is it has REAL SPEAKERS that pump some serious sound. Once manufacturers went with flat televisions they started compromising on speaker quality to fit the small confines. This TV sounds amazing and has the best Base I've ever heard from a TV.
