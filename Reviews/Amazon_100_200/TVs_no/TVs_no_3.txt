I was recently in the market for a larger screen TV set.  The 32 to 36 screen was going to be the perfect size given my family room deminsions. I was considering the Sony WEGA XBR, Toshiba, and Misubishi. Then one day as  I walked through one of the retail stores in my area, I saw the Sony 43'  Rear Projection Set.  The compact size, the Larger Viewing Screen, Picture  Quality, Enhance Digital Features and The Price, were very impressive.  My  search was over.  It's been a week since the TV was delivered to my home  and I can truly say that it has been a wonderful experience.There are a  couple of things to be aware of:  * Getting all the components connected  can take a little time.* Limited space in the Stand for adding  components.Overall I think Sony 43' is a great investment if your  considering 32 to 36" TV's. You'll get excellent picture quality at a  better price point.
