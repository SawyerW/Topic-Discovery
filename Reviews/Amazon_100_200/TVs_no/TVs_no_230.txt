I bought this Zenith plasma tv, exactly 1 year and 8 mos ago from Circuit City. Paid $2400. At he begining everything was awesome, but,...it popped yesterday.Of course, like many others people, I trusted Zenith to be a product of good reputacion and quality, WRONG!!!..I was just another sucker, and by trusting this product, I did not buy any extended warranty.I don't recommend this TV at all, they (Zenith) should have a recall on this BAD product. Sorry for you people that still think it's ok to buy it anyway, you'll regret it later as I do now.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
