I have one of these televisions and after two years a convergence thingie went out on it.  Looked like you were seeing everything in double-vision.  Luckily I had an extended warranty on it as it would have cost 600.00 to fix it.  They had it about a week.  It does have a great picture but I am afraid JVC will not be getting anymore of my money in the future.  I also had a JVC stereo receiver that went out in five years. Every other stereo receiver I have had in my life I had to give it away.  Apparently none of the letters in JVC stand for dependability
