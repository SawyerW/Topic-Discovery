i spent several months reading reviews, going to stores, comparing images, and i finally decided to purchase this television.  ordering with amazon was a breeze, and it was delivered within a few days.  no tax, free shipping, great price.  i upgraded to a satellited hd dvr, connected to an upconverting dvd player, hooked it up to our stereo amplifier,  and our viewing pleasure has catapulted into new territory.  directv says they are going to be increasing the amount of hd channels, so that should add for more selection.  regular sd television just doesn't cut it once you witness hd.  if you don't feel like going to brick and mortar stores and seeing the screens for yourself, go ahead and purchase this television.  you will be very happy with your decision.
