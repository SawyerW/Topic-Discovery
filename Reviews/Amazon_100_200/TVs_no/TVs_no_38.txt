I purchased my unit (KV-40XBR800) Sony Trinitron XBR 40" new in 2003.  Within a year it failed to turn on (makes clicks, flashes the standby light, but does not turn on).  Being under warranty, Sony sent a team of guys (yes, it's that heavy) to load it onto the repair truck.  The unit was repaired, but failed again (this time the warranty was expired) with the same symptoms.  Turns out the reps replaced the defective components with new components, which are plagued with this problem. A quick search on any major search engine for "Sony Trinitron Flash Error Codes" will reveal a vast consumer base plagued with this problem.  There is no permanent fix as the parts needed to fix it are themselves the problem; any parts replaced will eventually result in the same failures due to the problem being in the defective part design and/or manufacturing process.  Sony is aware of this, and is probably thankful the warranties on these units has run out.Do not buy this unless you have a team of guys to move it to a place where you intend to throw it away after it fails. Definitely fails the longevity aspect of TV ownership.
