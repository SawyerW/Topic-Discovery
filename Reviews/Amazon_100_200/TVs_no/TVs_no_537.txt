Just set up last night so I don't know about longevity. But watching TV last night I was very pleased with all aspects of this unit. Channel surfing was not an issue. I'm running off of cable and the set pulls in a number of digital channels that are an added bonus. I tried the DVD and found the picture to be outstanding and really didn't hear the noise that has been mentioned by others. The set has many of the technical advantages (ATSC tuner, 1080i picture) that more expensive sets have and  at a lower cost. Perfect for a smaller bedroom.
