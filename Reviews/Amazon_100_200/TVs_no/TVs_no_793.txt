After living with this TV for over two years, it's still an agreeable experience. The picture remains sharp, clear and correctly colored.Mine had the annoying hissing / whining / squeal noise when it was new. After the Power Supply board was replaced it's been great.The set turns on quickly, has a very good picture for a 720  resolution TV, a great remote and automatically finds and switches to Anynet/CEC compatible DVD / BluRay players.The sound is decent for an LCD TV.  It's weak on Bass which is most noticeable when watching movies.Recently, I went shopping for a larger TV. I was shocked to find that now, in 2010 the LN-T3253 from 2007 still has a better picture than many new TV sets particularly when viewing fast moving scenes or SD content.  The only new TV sets that equalled or surpassed its picture cost as much or more than this one did.That said, compared to a 1080 resolution TV the picture is grainy and BlueRay offers no noticeable improvement over DVD.If you come across one of these in used condition, it's probably worth buying so long as it has had the squeal/hiss problem corrected.Enjoy,Keri
