This is my first HDTV and I have been watching local HD programs everyday for over 2 months. I love it.  I used every single feature of it and all features work very well.  I really like to use it as a 32" PC monitor, so bright and the colors are so beautiful.  Another good feature of this HDTV is it has 2 HDMI inputs. I set one up for my Playstation 3 for games and Blu-ray movies and one for my DVD upconvert for my dvd collection without any hazzle of pluging and unpluging in the back of the TV.  I know this HDTV can only go as high as 720P and 1080i, but this is what we need for a long time.  Most HD channels only offer these two resolutions and I don't think majority of viewers can tell the difference between 720p, 1080i and 1080p.  For the price from amazon with free shipping, it is a good deal for the quality you are getting.  Sure you can go buy a 32" HDTV for $600, but it doesn't have the features that LNS3241D offers.
