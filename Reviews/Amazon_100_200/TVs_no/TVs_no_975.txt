I bought this tv just over a year ago and the picture is now scrambling. This of course happened after the warranty ran out. I contacted Westinghouse customer service and they said to unplug and then plug the tv back in to see if that helped, it did for a day or two. Now I only get a scrambled picture. Westinghouse only has one review on its website and it is of course positive and from a tech review website and no way for consumers to add their own reviews. I'll be checking amazon for reviews before I consider another appliance purchase. I won't be buying another Westinghouse product and I don't suggest you do either.
