I bought this at Sears after comparing it to all of the others on display.  This was our first LCD, after owning CRT and projection TVs.  The Samsung easily outperformed the other available brands in the store.  Viewed next to the higher-contrast model, the difference is obvious, but at home it is by itself and the contrast on this model is adequate.  The best feature is the sound; this is the only equipment I own where I can listen to CDs (through a DVD player) without an audible background hiss.  Be mindful that if it is mounted on an inside wall, the sound will be clearly audible in the adjoining room.
