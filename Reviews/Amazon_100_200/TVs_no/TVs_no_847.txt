This superb high definition TV will accommodate such things as a separate VCR and/or DVD (or two) and yes, a PC. What it amounts to in the latter case is a 26" computer monitor--imagine that with a laptop (which is how I'm using it). The Component inputs provide a superior picture, so use one or more of them if any of your components (e.g. DVD player/recorder) provides Component outputs. The sound is surprisingly good--finest I've heard from any TV, although of course you can route it through your regular stereo system for optimum results. The very thorough manual provides a myriad of instructions for viewing and listening versatility, so take the time to read it to get the most from this well-conceived,  carefully engineered and altogether elegant Samsung.
