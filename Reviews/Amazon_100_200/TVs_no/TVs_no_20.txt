We bought this model in 2003.  It performs today just as it did the day it was delivered to our home.This television (both size and viewing screen) is huge!  We went from a 32" tv to this giant. Images are life-size.  You definitely need to have space between your sofa and the screen.Watching sports games and movies are like you're in the stadium or the theater, so get your hot dogs, nachos and popcorn.I would definitely recommend this model.  We live in a smaller place now, so we're trying to sell our set.  But if you have the space, its a guaranteed winner.
