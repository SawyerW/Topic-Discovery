Our HP-S4253 was bought last Thanksgiving. It was a great plasma TV at the beginning, marvelous HD resolution, vivid color and many useful jacks on the back.However, recently a bright red dot appeared in the center of the screen. This dot is most eye-catching when the background is dark.I called the service center of Samsung and was told that only one dead pixel was not a service issue. Their policy was a seven-dots rule. If you have fewer than seven bright, sometimes flashing red dots on your plasma screen, sorry, that's your own problem.Later I found that every TV manufacturer has its own "pixel policy" to deal with complaints about such dots.Customers at a store can open the box and check the TV on spot. But if you buy a LCD or plasma TV online like I did, you are taking a chance.
