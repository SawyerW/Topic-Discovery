Received TV quickly.  Plugged TV in and setup was easy.  After 5 days we had to unplug the TV and when we plugged the TV back up the TV no longer worked.  There was no picture and no sound.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.  Seemed unbelievable.Brought the TV in for service and the whole board controlling video and audio sound was burnt out and had to be replaced.After only having the TV for 5 days I thought Sharp should have taken the TV back.Sound is satisfactory.  Remote control is easy to use.  Non HD channel's clarity is decent but can't be stretched to fit so there is a black border around the picture.  But that does not diminish your picture watching.Basically, we are happy with the set.I'd recommend the TV to a friend.
