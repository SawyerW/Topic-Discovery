Like just about every other person on here, I too have the loud hissing noise issue.  I had owned a Samsung TV in the past and I also own a 22inch Samsung monitor so I didn't think twice before ordering this Samsung 32inch TV.After waiting 2 weeks and making numerous phonecalls to the service center Samsung referred me to, the guy came out and swapped out the main board and the problem still persists.  I called them today and they are ordering a new Balis and power supply and hopefully one of those two items will fix the problem.I love the TV otherwise but I just can't stand the loud whistling noise.  Samsung definitately needs to recall these TV's or fix them or something!
