I bought the Olevia LT27HVS (I'm posting my review here because that model is not yet available at Amazon) and am quite happy with it. The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the "S" after the model name of the newer sets stands for "single" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.
