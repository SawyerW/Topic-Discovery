For around a grand, this is a top notch product.  HD looks amazing (PS3 source), SD looks OK, and with an upconverting DVD player, SD DVD movies look surprisingly crisp.  The sound this television produces is mediocre, though the surround sound option does create a more 3-D sound ambience. The Game Mode sounds intriguing, although, as far as I can tell, it is fairly useless.  If anything it makes games look worse than they should.  I spent quite a while calibrating the picture settings, and have come up with a pretty good combination that can be applied to all the video formats (dynamic/standard/movie).  Try these out for yourself!Contrast = 85Brightness = 56Sharpness = 65Color = 45Tint = 50G/50RColor Tone = Cool 2These settings seem to make all SD/HD movies look outstanding!I highly recommend this product.
