I did a TON of research before purchasing this HDTV, and I'm not at all disappointed with my decision.  It is an awesome TV for the price with plenty of positives and very few negatives.  One frustration I have is the somewhat debilitated picture in picture - you can only use this feature for certain combinations of inputs.  For example, you can't view from both A/V-1 and A/V-2 inputs at the same time, but you CAN view HDMI-1 and A/V-1 at the same time.  What's that all about?Anyway, I definitely recommend this TV if you're looking for a mid-sized, appropriately priced HDTV with a full set of features and inputs.
