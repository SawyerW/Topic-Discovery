I owned the tv for about 3 weeks, then all of a sudden the tv turned off.  The little red light on the front was blinking and there was clicking sound when I unplugged it and tried to turn it on again.  A service technician came out and ordered a new part for it.Then less that 4 days later the unit made a pop sound and the picture schrunk about 3 inches on the left and right sides - no luck.Luckily, I bought it from a local store and can return it , no questions asked.I suspect from reading other posts that this Toshiba has put a real lemon on the market.
