I rely heavily on word-of-mouth and Amazon's customer reviews are a great place to find out the real deal about a product. We chose this TV after looking at hundreds of options. We even went into the stores to look at them and kept coming back to the Samsung.The HDTV with our cable box is awesome! I also kept in mind the many reviews here. The black on the TV is sharp. The colors are great. And the setup was a breeze.Now comes the shipping part. Eagle is a terrible shipper and if you get them, you might have to wait 2-3 weeks to get your TV. We were so fed up that we drove 15 miles to their facility and picked up the TV. I hope I don't have to deal with them ever again because it was a painful process.
