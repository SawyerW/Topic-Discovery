I purchased this in December 2007, and it came with a standard one year warranty.  After 17 months, the picture died.  The set would still turn on and I could hear the audio, but no picture whatsoever.  I got it fixed at a cost of $294 (new motherboard needed).  Fortunately, VISA paid for the repair, under their free one-year extended warranty provision (check with your credit card issuer to see if it's a feature of your particular issuer).This TV will display a great picture with HD content, but for whatever reason, the video from my 480i/p DVD player (a Sony) looked terrible.  The sound is merely ok.  The design and finish is outstanding; this TV looks great just sitting there.  I'm hoping I can get many more years out of it without any more repair issues, but it's discouraging to see that so many owners have had issues with this set.
