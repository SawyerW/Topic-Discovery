I own a repair shop and I have been repairing TV for years. This TV is great only for it's compact format. On the other hand, the image is just awful. White will shear and bleed at a higher contrast ratio. The high and low lights are also wrong (blue high/low lights). The sound is not great but good for the size of the speakers. Obviously, when there is movement the focus goes way off (common in all LCD, Plasma and DLP) and the image looks even more awful. You can also see the smear(lag,trail) when there is fast movement ( caused by slow LCD response time in the miliseconds). In the end, I have seen 1986 RCA 14" TV's who had a better image quality. Mitsubishi 37" TV 1992 beats this TV by about 10 times and has a response time in the nanoseconds. End of line, this LCD TV has a very poor image quality. I give it 1 star since the menus and remote are very easy to use and the TV has a very compact design.
