Bought my Westinghouse 32" lcd tv in Nov 2008. Barely 14 months later, the tv will not show a picture. When you power it on, the picture shows for about 10 secs and then goes off. Sound still works but no picture at all. Went through all the Westinghouse troubleshooting with them. Now they want me to pack and ship it at my expense to their repair center!!! Westinghouse policy is that 42" and smaller lcd's need to be shipped to their repair center, while bigger lcd's will get a repair person sent to your home to fix it. This policy makes no sense since the size of it should not matter. A better option would be to have the customer take it in to the same local repair people and have them fix it in their shop. Stay away from Westinghouse until they get their customer service working properly.
