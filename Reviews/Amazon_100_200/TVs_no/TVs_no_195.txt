We just took the plunge into HDTV after our good old SONY Triniton died after 18 years. The picture and sound are great, and the price is right. But why oh why does new technology have to be so complicated! (This is not a problem, of course, if your college age son is home from vacation to set it all up, but we weren't so lucky). It took us two visits from the store installation crew and a visit from the cable company before we felt reasonably sure we could get it to work. This is not a knock on this model, only a general comment--getting a product like this into the house and getting it to work is a cumbersome process. If I had to do it over I'd get the TV from the lowest priced supplier around and hire the local electronics store to come around and set it up. Surely there's a better way to do it!
