After months of online and retail store research, my wife and I decided on the Samsung LNT 4053H. What a great TV at a bargain price on Amazon. This was our first big ticket online order and the experience was great. Not only did we get the lowest price, but it came with free white glove delivery - very professional, careful and on time. Would highly recommend buying from Amazon if you know exactly what you want.  The TV picture is great for HD, STD Def. and DVD, and there are tons of adjustments for everything. The TV is located in a bright sunlit room and the anti-glare screen works beautifully.  The piano black finish with swivel base is great, but shows a lot of dust quickly. TIP: Instead of dusting with a cloth, use the pressurized air in a can for cleaning computers. Works great, fast and leaves no residue or scratches. The sound is mediocre, but I hooked it up to a home theater system and don't use the TV speakers.  Sounds great. Overall, a great TV at a great price and a wonderful buying experience.
