Our Olevia is 6 years old, in use everyday and still has a great picture. When we purchased it, it was half the price of the Samsungs and Sonys of the same size and the picture looked better! Its a 720p and the eye can't tell the difference of 1080p until you get to 37". It doesn't have as many inputs as today's TVs do, it only has a DVI input, not an HDMI and 2 component inputs (one HD and one 480p) as well as a cable input. I've used a PS3 with it as well as a Dish HD receiver. When we had cable, I used a splitter and connected one input to the HD component inputs and another to the cable and thus enabled its picture-in-a-picture function. The picture is vivid and sharp. If you can find one of these gems, I recommend buying it for a small room or bedroom.
