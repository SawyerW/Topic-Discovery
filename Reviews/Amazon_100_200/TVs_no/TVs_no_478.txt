After researching LCD TVs of this size for a few days, I decided on this one after seeing it in action at the store.  I came home and checked prices online and realized this TV, brand new, was around $500 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy.  The shipping takes a while if you get Eagle, but the savings is worth the wait.The only big problem I've read about with this TV is that some apparently have dead pixels, but not mine.  The quality is nice.  I have it hooked up to my Xbox 360 and set to "Game Mode" and the graphics are simply amazing.People are saying the sound is lackluster and they are probably right.  I have always used the speakers on my TV so I have no point of reference, but they have served me well.All in all, this is an excellent TV for anyone looking to go high-def without paying the ridiculous prices they charge at chain stores.
