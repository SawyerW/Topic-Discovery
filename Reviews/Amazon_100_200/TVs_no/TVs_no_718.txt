I am so glad that I went with this TV over a smaller LCD or Plasma.  If you don't plan on hanging your TV on the wall I would HIGHLY recommend going the DLP route.  I also feel that the picture is much "smoother" than LCD or plasma.  All-in-all very happy with the TV and Amazon's shipping.  One thing to note, my TV showed up with the picture a bit off center.  At first I thought this was a defect.  However, after searching the net for a bit I found it could be fixed by accessing the service menu.  Now it's perfect!
