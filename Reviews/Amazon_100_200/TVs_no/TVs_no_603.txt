I just received this TV yesterday and set up was a breeze.  Hooked everything up, turned it on and that was it.  Beautiful picture.  I also purchased an up-converting DVD player.  I was a bit skeptical about this but the picture was awesome.  It definitely did what it said it would.  I am having Direct Tv coming today to install HD dish and receiver.  I will let you know more as time goes by.  I would also like to add that my experience with the site HIDEF where I purchased this TV was absolutely awesome.  The price is very competitive and customer service is outstanding.  I highly recommend HIDEF.
