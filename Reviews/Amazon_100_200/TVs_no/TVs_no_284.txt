The black frame looks really nice and makes the plasma look less like a electronic piece. We were debating between this model and the Panasonic 50PX60U. In the store, picture quality looked about the same, the panny may have been a little better, not sure. But, the final deciding points was the Samsung had burn-in protection, better price, and a more pleasing look. So far normal cable channels really aren't bad at all and HDTV is wonderful! The Discovery Channel HD shows have the best picture. If you are going to be 6-8ft away get the 42 inch model save yourself some money but, if your going to be like 9-12ft away get the 50. Sound quality I say is right above average, Panasonic is better, but we watch stuff through our surround sound.
