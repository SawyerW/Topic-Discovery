I bought my LNS4051D before Christmas because the price was veeeeery attractive. The provider actually was Etronics. Had a delay in the shipping and received 4 or 5 days after planned, but it was no big deal to me. Very easy to unpack and install. Set up is easy as well. The quality of the picture is awesome for an LCD. I've been researching over the internet about flat panel TVs for some time before buying this one. I was planning to buy a Sony Bravia, but woudn't like to pay much more just for the brand. I went to this Best Buy store and they were side by side. I played for a while with both remotes and the quality of the image was pretty much the same for me. At that moment I decided to buy this TV. I'm very happy with my purchase, but......as already mentioned for some reviewers there is an issue with the sound. Some buzzing when reproducing low frequencies. I intend to buy a home theater, so I won't have this problem anymore. Anyway, to enjoy the full experience you must have a good sound system.
