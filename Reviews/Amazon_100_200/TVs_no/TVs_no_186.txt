You'll see a circle as a circle only on Aspect 4:3.  The other aspect "zoom" make the circle looks like an egg.  No adjustment in vertical or Horizontal. The manual stated the "ZOOM" will enlarge the 4:3 without distortion. But it is not, it enlarged more in Horizontal than Vertical.  Tech Support said that it is pre-set in manufacture, they can't correct it.  I need the ZOOM aspect to watch the wide screen movie.I compare it with Westinghouse, the Westinghouse is better, more options, easier use on Remote.Some credits I have to give to both TV is that No Dead Pixel.
