My Samsung 26LV67 32" was delivered yesterday and I am experiencing the same high-pitch noise that continues even when muted reported on January 7. I have tried making sound adjustments but have had no luck. I did discover that the noise starts on my TV when it been warmed up after running for about an hour. I just signed on the Amazon site to figure out how to contact customer service to return it when I saw the post about the noise (I ordered my TV on January 6).  Except for the noise (so for the 1st hour of viewing), I love the TV. However when the noise starts is it SO annoying! I think that a dog would run out of the room.  I am very disappointed.
