I recently bought this Tv from Amazon and it arrived 5 days early and in perfect condition..I am blown away by the picture and the sound...Sleek look and easy to setup...Hooked my PC tower up to it and watched my music videos through my suuround sound and it was awesome...Then I called Dishnetwork and went High Definition...Ohh my god what a picture.Couldn't leave the couch the rest of the Day...In my opinion I am glad I bought the Samsung with no complaints so far...Only bad experience I had is when I went to RadioShack to buy an HDMI cable...Get this they wanted $91.00 for it...Paid $39.00 for the cheapest they had and walked away still upset about paying that much for a cable...I will buy form Amazon again.
