I am not 'tv-literate' and did not want to make an expensive mistake when purchasing an HDTV, so I Googled many HDTV comparisions, then read what users thought of them.  This HDTV stood out in the 32-inch range for good picture and reliability:  As good as any for picture; great reliability.  Again shopping Google, this time for price:  For the quality, reliability and performance, only two other 32-inch HDTV brands were as good as this Samsung 32-inch one...and the others were hundreds of dollars more.Our whole family is pleased with the picture, and going from a 24-inch tv to this:  We don't need anything larger; and could not beat the price even when a friend's son offered us a Family Discount where he worked.
