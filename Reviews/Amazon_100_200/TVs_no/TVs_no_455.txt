I bought this in Sept and it worked out good for me. After 6 months of use, I started seeing a blue vertical line. I called the Samsung custserv and they sent out a technician who changed the pannel board and still the issue existed. Then they scheduled it to be replaced and I got a better and upgraded version in that series since this was discontinued.I would recommend LNT3242H which is 7000:1 contrast ratio. The replacement was smooth. I will update you once I have used this TV.I drawback is PIP works only with one component output in the older version. Havent played around with the newer version yet.
