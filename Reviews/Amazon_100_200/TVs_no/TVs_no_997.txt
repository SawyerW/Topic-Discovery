i have read the mixed reviews of owners of Olevia televisions.  But I can say that I am one of the fortunate ones. Ii purchased my 47" from Circuit City on December 22, 2007, and to date I have never, nevr had any issues at all. the TV is usually on everyday, sometimes as much as 18 hours non-stop, especially on Saturdays and Sundays (sometimes no one may be watching it but it does not make sense turning on and off for short periods). The remote works perfectly. I am sure that there are other Olevia owners who can support my review.One thing that is annoying is the fact that there are no numbers when making audio or video adjustments. It would have made life a lot easier.
