I absolutely love this TV.  I purchased it and immediately put it up on my wall.  I use all of the component video in's and the PC in.  I attached my DVD player with the component in using Monster THX 800 cables, some of the best cables on the market. The picture quality shows it.  My other component in is attached to my X-Box, let me tell you, the TV makes the difference while playing the games.  As of right now I do not have HDTV but I do plan on hooking it up.  As for the PC input it is absolutely wonderful.  When I got this TV I also got a wireless mouse/keyboard combo so I can use the TV from my bed and or my Lazy-Boy chair.Pros: Size (fits anywhere on any wall), Picture quality, Video (in's / pc in), Easy useage.Cons: No HDMI input, DVI in, No HDTV tuner, Replacement parts are expensive (Power adapter= $155)Overall Rating of TV:  9.7 / 10
