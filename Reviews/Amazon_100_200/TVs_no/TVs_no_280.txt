This is a really great TV. I bought a SONY 46 LCD (46v2500) few months ago and were not totally impressed with the picture and color.  So I decided to give Samsung plasma a try  when I need to buy a TV for my parents. With more than $1000 lower than the Sony I paid, I am so amazed with the quality of this TV. Color is very vivid and image is so sharp. I had totally changed my impression on Samsung. I am not trying to compare orange with apple but I really feel I am getting much more from this TV than the 1080 Sony LCD.  I purchased online and also registered right away. Samsung provided additional 3 months of warrenty.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
