The picture quality is stunning. It is as good as or better than the Sony Bravia. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am unable to use a DVI / HDMI cable from my Cablevision Scientific Atlanta HD Explorer 4200 cable box. The TV refuses to recognize the connection. I contacted Samsung and they sent a tech out within 2 days. He tried replacing the circuit board, but it still wouldn't work. He indicated that there was a known problem with the Cablevision box's DVI output on the 4200. He said if I wanted to use HDMI I would have to pay Cablevision extra for their TiVO HD box. I will live with the composite connections until Cablevision gets their act together and makes their equipment compatible. That aside, I love the set and Samsung's customer service was excellent.
