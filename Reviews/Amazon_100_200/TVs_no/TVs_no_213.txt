Do not buy Plasma.  This unit, like all others didn't last even 2 years.  It Popped and will no longer work.  Researched internet to find out I bought a lemom (purchased with my house). Also, found out that Plasma tv's are packed full of Printed Circuit Boards, need lots of voltage and produce the most heat compared to LCD's and possibly DLP's.  I don't know much about tv repair, but I know my way around computer repair, and typical repairs include power supply and mother board replacement due to heat and voltage. 2+2 in this case does not equal 5, so take my advice if your dishing out lots of money for a tv you want to last until your kids reach the college age.
