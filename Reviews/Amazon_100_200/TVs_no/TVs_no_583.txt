This was my first LCD and I am very impressed.  Very easy to setup and use.  Up and running in 10 minutes.  HD picture is very good.  I have read other reviews that said the sound isn't very good, but I beg to differ, I find the sound to be very good.  My only complaint is that the box that it came in was almost on it's last leg.  It wasn't damaged, butit was almost ready to fall apart.  If it had to go one more hop, I think the TV would have fallen out.  No damage whatsoever to the TV.  Something needs to be done to keep these boxes together.
