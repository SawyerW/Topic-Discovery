I just purchased my TV about a week ago.  The picture quality is very good, most people think it is a direct TV not projection. The built in screen protector gives the picture more clarity.  And the TV definently  benefits from a digital source such as satellite tv.  Hooking it up is  somewhat confusing if you have a number of components.  For the money I  don't think you could find a TV of this size with better picture quality.  My only complaint is not with the TV, but with the optional matching stand.  The stand is pretty much useless if you have more than two components.  You cannot put two components side by side because the stand is not wide  enough.  And even after removing the shelf, it is not tall enough to stack  components on top of each other.  The stand needs to be about 3"  taller and 4" wider.  Sony's designers obvivously did not put a lot of  thought into the stand when it comes to function.
