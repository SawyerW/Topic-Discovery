I've had this TV for a few months and I have a mixed opinion.  For set-up I've just got the cable plugged directly into the TV, so I just get the network HD channels (our cable company's HD line-up isn't worth the extra $ to get it yet).  The non-HD channels are disappointing and I think my old TV set actually had a better picture.  This is my first HDTV, so I can't say if all non-HD channels look as poor via an HDTV or if it's this particular model.  The HD channels though are excellent.  One downside I've noticed though is if a channel is in 1080i the picture will break up a bit with fast moving action - this doesn't happen with the 720p channels.  With a lot of HD channels I'd rate this 4 stars, but with mixed viewing HD and non-HD it's 3 stars.
