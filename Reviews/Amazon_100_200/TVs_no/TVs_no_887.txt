I've had the television for about a month.  It was 800-something dollars when I got it through 6AVE on Amazon.com  So far it's great.  There is no headphone jack, and there are only 2 hdmi ports as well.  I've hooked up both my computer and my Xbox 360 to it.  When I hooked up my PC through component, it was stuck on 1080i and it was also running at 30 hz.  Since, I'm using this tv for 360 gaming, I really haven't tested it out with my computer to the fullest.  For my 360, it looks great. You have to adjust the visual settings on some games to get it right.  Halo 3 looked somewhat dark and I couldn't see what was going on in the background.  Other than that it's a gorgeous television.  No dead pixels that I could see.  I think the sound is pretty good on the television, and I'm enjoying it so far.  I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a 1080p television that may use it as a monitor at some point.  I don't think the gaming version of this tv is worth the price.
