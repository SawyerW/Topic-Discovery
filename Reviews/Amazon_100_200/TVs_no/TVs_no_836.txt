Excellent tv for the most part, but the slight white haze at the very top of the picture is annoying.  It's not that way on floor models in stores; I've seen them in Circuit City and Best buy at numerous locations (albeit for $50-75 more plus tax) and they were all perfect.  I even got one from Best Buy and took it home but it had the same problem that mine has.  I am getting another one from Amazon any day now (I ordered both on the same day).  I'll see if this one has the same problem and then I'll figure out what I can and can't live with.  I only notice the haze when the image in the screen is dark and still....but I do notice it.By the way, unlike the other reviewer, I think I am able to dial in "10.1" by simply hitting "1","0", "-" and "1" on the remote.I'd give it 5 stars if not for the haze issue.
