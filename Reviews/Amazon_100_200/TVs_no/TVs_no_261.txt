I purchased this EDTV in December 2006 and have LOVED it since day 1!!  I was looking for a 42" HDTV, and those were priced around $2000.00.  I just happened to stumble across this for $699.99, with free shipping!  I thought it was to good to be real!  Well I WAS WRONG!  It was everything I thought and MORE!  Almost a year later the prices of HDTV's have fallen.  I am happy with my EDTV, but now that the prices have dropped so much, I might get an HDTV, take my EDTV from my living room and move it to my bedroom and put the HDTV in my living room.This was a GIANT step up from the traditional analog TV, for ALOT less than an HDTV!!  A great buy for a step (leap) up!  The HDTV prices will continue to fall, so MAYBE you want to wait more and get the EDTV for now?September 2010  TV is ALMOST FOUR years old, no problems and still LOVING it!  Now that the prices have dropped SO MUCH, wanting to upgrade to a 50" 1080, but finding it hard to give up my sylvania!
