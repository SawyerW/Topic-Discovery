first off, i got my set for 720 dollars, same price as the 27" 4:3 model. so i have no room to complain. obviously the quality and features wont match the 2 grand XBR series sony, but for the price and compared to its counterparts, its absolutely brilliant! very easy to use, enough audio/video enhancements and inputs. plus its a sony, you just cant beat its quality. pick this one up to start you off in hd, then in a few years, you can get the XBR when its reasonably priced! oh and also, didnt see much of a difference between the HDMI and component input running LOTR: Return of the King.
