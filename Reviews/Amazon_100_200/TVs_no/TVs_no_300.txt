As everyone else, we did some research, mostly concentrating on quality/price ratio and this TV seemed to fit all of our requirements.  After reading some of the previous reviews, we were concerned about the buzzing noise that a few reviewers heard coming from the back of the TV.  Ours was fine (I was so paranoid, I'd come up to it and listen for some unusual noises periodically).  We love the picture and most of the shows we watch (Discovery, National Geographic) look fantastic when in HD.  Aesthetically, it's very pleasing as well.  Shipping was smooth and quick.  A few days after we bought the TV, it went down 30$ and Amazon credited the difference promptly upon our request - we were quite impressed with their service.
