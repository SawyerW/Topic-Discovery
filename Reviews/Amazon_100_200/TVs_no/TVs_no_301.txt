Buying the TV was easy. However, shipping was horrible. The TV sat in the SF warehouse for 4 days until I called EAGLE. Even with Amazon Prime, it took over 2 weeks. They finally made arrangement to deliver it today. Once unpacked, the unit looked nice. The problem was the loud buzzing noise from the back (upper right, most likely power supply). It was so loud everyone in the family noticed it- essentially making it useless. I have asked for a refund from Amazon and also called Samsung to find out if there is an easy fix. This particular unit was mfg 9/2006 in Mexico.
