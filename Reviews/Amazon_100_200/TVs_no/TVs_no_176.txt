First day of use:the unit's picture is not as sharp as CRT TV.remote is not very responsive. need to be in front of the TV.The worst part is after the TV is on for one hour or so, it turns itself off. May be I have a defective unit.Asked Amazon to return the unit, but amazon policy is:"Amazon.com cannot accept the return of televisions 27 inches and larger after delivery.
