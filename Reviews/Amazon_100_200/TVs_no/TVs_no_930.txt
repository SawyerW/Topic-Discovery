I recieved theplasma tv and hired a company to have it mounted on the wall and they couldn't get the tv to switch on. after 30 minutes, they eventually got it working. Over the next week, the tv switched on intermittently and was very tempermental?? I reported this to samsung customer care and they wanted to send a company to repair a brand new tv. Less than one week old !! anyway after speaking to customer care at least 3 times they eventually sent a fax to a tv repair company in my county. This company took another 3 days to contact me and after playing phone tag with them I gave up on samsung "customer service".Amazon on the other hand after speaking to customer care,replaced the tv within the week well done to Amazon for excellent customer care
