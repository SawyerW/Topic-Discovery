I bought from Amazon in April 2008.  In June 2008, it began making a high-pitched buzzing sound that was most obvious when on mute. I called Samsung customer service, and they sent a local repair person a week later who replaced the SMPS coil (power board). It is now December 2011, and I have never had any other problems with the TV--knock, knock!I was lucky to get one with a sturdy swivel stand.  I LOVE the swivel stand, and the TV is not wobbly at all.  Unless you place this TV on the floor and have a huge dog with a huge wagging tail or unruly brats running around, I'm not sure why the TV would wobble because of the swivel stand.  It's not only convenient to swivel it to a desired viewing angle, but it's also helpful to swivel it when using the connections/ports in the back of the TV.  In fact, I'd like to find another Samsung with a swivel stand, but now they're hard to find.
