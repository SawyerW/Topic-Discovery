I can't recommend this enough.  My husband and I searched for months for a great TV at a good price and figured we'd just go with an average one.  Well...my best friend was trying to get the review for one we had picked out at Wal-Mart on Consumer Reports and it wasn't looking good.  She told me to google this one and check it out...it was Consumer Report's Pick, but it was  out of our price range ($1,200).  Then I looked on Amazon real quick and found it, with free shipping for $1,099!!!  Purchased it as fast as I could on Tuesday and it was here by noon on Thursday.  We have digital cable with HD channels and I can't explain in words how awesome watching sporting events are!  It's better than looking out a window!!!  Can't recommend this enough!!!  My husband and I bought a wall mount to go with it, had it up in 45 minutes, just the two of us.  If you are looking for a 42" flat screen, this is it!!!
