This LCD HDTV would be a great television even at a higher price, but at it's current price point it's hard to see why anyone would buy anything else.  I got mine the day after Thanksgiving, and have been watching it every day since.  I have a good friend with an Aquos, and though it's far more expensive, I can't see any difference.  I sure don't miss my old CRT TV . . .I agree with the criticism that the volume is too high at the minimum setting - but it isn't a major annoyance.  I believe they've fixed the remote-code issue as well, but in case you are still wondering, the volume, on off and channel selection use RCA code 001.Buy it now - once you go flat you'll never go back.
