Satisfied so far, have had it in operation for 3 weeks. No major problems.Have to get used to the delay between channels when you use the remote to enter new channel, not the channel up or down button. Not a biggy. Also the only screen that you can see the ticker tape on the bottom is the full screen. If you use the theater 2 or 3 the top of the heads goes away. Just a little problem not expressed in adds or brouchers.The TV arrived on the day the shipping info said it would, took 10 days as it came from Dallas,Tx to Seattle,Wa to Yakima,Wa to Cle Elum,Wa, and no broken parts!!  Plugged it in, hooked up the anolog cable and great picture.
