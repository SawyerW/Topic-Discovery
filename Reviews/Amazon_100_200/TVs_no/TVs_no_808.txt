I love everything about this TV!  Color and resolution are fantastic.  The depth of the blacks and contrast are terrific.  The on-screen menus are very simple to use and set up is a breeze.  Even the sound system is good- I love the fact that it has a 7-band graphic equalizer.At the same time it has a lot of features, everything about this system is extraordinarily user friendly, right down to the slim universal remote.I would buy this TV again 1,000 times!  The picture is fantastic, it is packed with features, its plethora of input options makes it extraordinarily versatile, and it looks beautiful hanging on the wall even when turned off.Kudos to Samsung!
