I bought this TV last August from Best Buy and two days before it went off. I hear a click sound when I turn on, but nothing comes up. I even use a surge protector power supply.I used to have TVs lasting more than 20 years, but I am surprised to see this Big Brand TV going off in just one year. Unfortunately, I didnt buy the extended warranty. The charges towards fixing this issue seems to be around 40% of TV cost. I called up Samsung also if they can help with my problem. They told the same story what Best Buy told me, that fix up an appointment with technical engineer and I need to bear the whole cost,  as I am out of Warranty. But they keep their mouth shout, when I ask why did this fault happen.So Beware of this problem, before buying this TV. I am totally disappointed with purchasing this TV.
