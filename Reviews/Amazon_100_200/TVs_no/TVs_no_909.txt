After months of extensive reviews and visits to the local electronic Super Stores, I elected to go Plasma vs. LCD.  I heard all of the stories from the local "experts" that provided absolutely no value to my decision.  Thank goodness for Amazon reviews!  Now, four months later, I have zero regrets.  No burn-in, deep blacks, great programmability, extra inputs (3-HDMI) and hours logged of pure enjoyment.Most of the time (over 75%) is spent watching HD cable channels.  But the other 25% is spent watching DVD's and playing Tiger '08 on Playstation3.  Colors are excellent, and as I mentioned, no burn-in.  Just use common sense and don't leave on pause for 2 or 3 hours!A great buy.  Don't be deceived when looking at Samsung at the local SuperStores....they are trying to sell the HPT5054 (one model down) for more money!Had this shipped to my garage in perfect condition.  Only advice I have is to put it on the wall for the best Home Theator effect!
