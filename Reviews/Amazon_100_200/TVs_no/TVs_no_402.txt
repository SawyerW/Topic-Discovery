I normally would never purchase a TV unless I could touch it first, but I looked at the brick & morter, and many other online retailers and decided to purchase with Amazon.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I did alot of comparison shopping at other online retailers and chose Amazon because of the great price.  My LCD was delivered by a shipping company and it arrived in very good condition.  I opted set up myself, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I feel confident that if I make another big ticket/$$ item purchase, that I will get the "goods"... I recommend Amazon!
