Tried to order this TV 4 times.  Each time amazon cancelled the order for one reason or another and said they would credit my cards back for the sale.  3 days before christmas whet to pick up my lay-aways and my credit card is over limet.  Turns out amazon has over $4,000 in holds on my credit card for orders that THEY CANCELD AND HAD NEVER BEEN SHIPPED.  Nine kids and amazon ruined our christmas.PS My credit card said that amazon could cancel the holds put on my credit card in ONE DAY if they wanted.  Of course 4 days later they are still using my money.PSS Forget trying to call amazon slow e-mail only WORTHLESS SUPPORT.RECOMMENDATION:  -FORGET AMAZON-  Do a google search for Target discounts and get a 10 percent off code.  I found one in less than 30 seconds.  Go to target.com and get 10 percent off and free freight. At least they have a phone number for support.
