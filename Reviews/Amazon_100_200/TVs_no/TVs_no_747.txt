I purchased mine one month ago. The first 3 and half weeks were awesome. I was astounded at the quality of the picture just using digital cable. The sound is excellent. But, I have already had a repair person here to check it out, terrible picture even using a Sony upconvert DVD player. The repair person said nothings wrong. Well, going from in AWE to terrible picture, something is wrong. I researched for 6 or more months before deciding on this. I will give it another week or so, going to call Samsung. Another new thing that is happening is the sound cuts out every so often. Just might be returning this one. Very disapointed, I gave this a 5 star at another website at first.
