This LCD TV has a great picture quality right off of coaxial cable (no digital cable needed)!  Both sound and picture quality exceeded my expectations!  It looks even better when viewing DVDs.  I've even connected an HDMI Up-convert DVD unit for fantastic viewing - it displays the entire screen!  The speakers are of good quality and sound great - even at low volume. It is very light and thin when compared to other comparable TV's of the same size.  Color decoding is nice and accurate.  It can be easily adjusted to personal tastes and viewing environment.  The black level is good and better than a monitor.  It has great 170-degree viewing angles!  The specs are also great:  800:1 brightness, 1200:1 contrast ratio, & 8ms response time. This TV is well worth the money.
