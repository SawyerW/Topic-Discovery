I purchased the HL-T5075 and let me tell you it was a great expirence!!  The ordering process, shipping and delivery was flawless!  My TV arrived well before the estimated delivery date given and WHAT A PICTURE!!  I went with the 720p for a couple of reasons.  1. Price - You simply cannot beat the quality this set delivers for the price point.  2. Everything is being broadcast at 720p or 1080i.  The only thing actually delivering a full 1080p is Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.  I haven't decided what type of player I'm getting until the format war is over.  I loved the picture so much with HD broadcasts, that I had to run out and get an up-convert DVD player because I couldn't stand watching my movies from my standard player.  I cannot say enough good things about this TV and will be purchasing a lot more products from Amazon!!
