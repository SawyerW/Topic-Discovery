The picture quality is outstanding, and especially with live HD feeds. I'm a "nub" when it comes to TV picture quality (according to my 16 year-old son). I purchase new TVs about every 5 or 6 years. In this case a new TV was LONG overdue. At first I thought this purchase was a little over the top.But it is the single best electronic purchase I have ever made. This Samsung is sleek and uses the highest quality components. It's super easy to set up and "calibrate" for an optimum HDTV experience (thanks to my son).The price and free shipping pushed me over the edge.I'm extremely happy with the purchase and delivery.The one downside is the sound. I thought (from reading other posts and feedback) the sound would be much better. It's fine for an average viewer/listener. But the unit really needs a sub-woofer or surround sound system (which I hate). I'll probably purchase a sub-woofer to give the TV audio some "meat".
