After purchasing this TV brand new about 5 years ago, I can safely say it still performs at it's maximum potential. I'm probably a believer in the initial 100 hours process of breaking-in the TV because I have had absolutely no problems w/ my TV. My parents purchased a 51" Samsung Plasma just 4 months ago w/ out really breaking it in and they are already experiencing some banding problems w/ the screen. Luckily it's still in warranty.Aside from that, at the time of purchasing my 42" Samsung plasma, I highly favored the extra color settings that the Samsungs had which the Panasonics didn't. This complex calibration resulted in much accurate color tones than the current (at the time) Panasonic plasma line. The black levels on this TV are decent, however after seeing current TV's black levels (which is about 5 years newer than mine) it's obvious this TV wouldn't win in a showdown. Nevertheless, this is still a great TV and I guess I am one of the lucky owners who haven't had problems w/ this TV.
