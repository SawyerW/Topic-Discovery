If you've done your homework, you probably realize that this is an unbelieveably good deal on a tv of this quality and size.  I'm not like everyone else, I don't pay for cable and I was amazed that I can pick up all the main network channels in HD with just a simple antenna!!  Be sure and check out the "energy saving" function - after a couple hours I noticed that the TV was putting off alot of heat and changing the settings seemed to help that.  If you're wondering if you should get it, go ahead - you will be glad you made the plunge!!
