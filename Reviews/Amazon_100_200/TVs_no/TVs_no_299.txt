I would have given it 5 stars if it werent for the few problems I am having.Problem 1.  When using the cable box, there is a high pitch "buzz."  It's highly irritating.  I paid $1491 at Sams Club + $5.00 to extend the warranty for 1 year.  If I have any problems whatsoever I will just bring it to Sams for a complete refund.Problem 2.  Remote control keeps turning off the TV even when using volume, channel, etc.  Called Samsung - They are shipping me a new remote.Colors are beautiful - TV is awesome!If I can get rid of the buzz sound I'll keep the TV.  Otherwise I'll return it and keep looking.
