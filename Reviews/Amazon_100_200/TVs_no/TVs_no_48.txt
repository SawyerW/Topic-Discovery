I got this TV since July 2005, the 1st one broke within 4 weeks due to color black display as red... got it exchanged from Bestbuy for free in 30 days. The 2nd TV is the one I still watching... until 2 weeks ago, it shut down itself after 2.5 hours watched; then just keep shutting down often.So, I noticed there was so much dust, bought an Air canned spray it from the back of penal, the canned didn't work much... I suspect it was over-heat, so I put a fan behind it and it worked but the fan caused too much noise.Finally, I bought an Air Compassor, this time it did a very nice and powerful job to get all the dust away inside the TV electronic boards. Guess what, it fixed the problem, it's working like the way it should be for many hours on without shutting down. I guess it saved me for few hundred if I make a TV service center called.
