I would rate zero stars but the minimum is one. Ours popped 3 months outside the one year warranty. LG(maker of zenith's) has such poor customer service. They said they had to have someone review issue and call me back. No call for 2 wks.I called again and again. No one ever did call me, but on my 3rd callback they said it was out of warranty and we should've bought the extended warranty at the time of purchase. $2800.00 for 15 months of TV use is not something Zenith/LG care about. When I mentioned this was a known problem since it's posted on the internet, they denied knowing of issue. I wish someone would get a class action suit against LG.
