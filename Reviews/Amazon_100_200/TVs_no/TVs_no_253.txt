I've been lookiing for another HDTV for a while, and have been waiting for a good deal. I didn't plan on getting an EDTV, or one this big. Boy am I glad I did! I was also one of the lucky ones that got a free mounting bracket with it. Even w/o the bracket, $799.98 with no tax or shipping was an awesome deal. I actually like this TV so much that I am ordering another. It does not have a ton of input options, but if you are just running TV/DVD through it I think you will be rather pleased with it. This price is so good, I could turn around and sell it for more on Ebay or Craigslist. Also very impressed with Amazon at offering such a good deal, and thankful for the quality customer service I got. I was a bit worried about shipping such a fragile item, but the delivery company they used did a nice job taking care of my TV.
