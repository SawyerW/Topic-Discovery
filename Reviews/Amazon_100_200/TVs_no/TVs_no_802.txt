Great TV with the exception of the power supply problem.  As many others experienced, the power supply started emitting a high pitch noise when it got warmed up.  Absolutely annoying and rendered the TV unusable.It took one 5 minute call to Samsung (including hold time) to get a service technician out to my house with a new power supply three days later.  It took the tech 10 minutes to swap out the power supply and he refused a tip.The problem is solved.  Net cost to me ... a little annoyance and zero dollars.Would have been nice not to experience the problem at all (thus only 4 out of 5) but it was sure pleasant to have the manufacturer resolve the problem quickly with no squabble.
