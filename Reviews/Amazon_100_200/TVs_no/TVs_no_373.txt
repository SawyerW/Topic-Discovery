Considered advice in these reviews, and others. Needed 40" w/swivel base, so was between Sony and Samsung. Did not need 1080P, a waste for my purposes.  Most web reviews and big box techies preferred picture of Samsung, and it also has 2 HDMI imputs (may add DVD upconverter later), vs one for Sony. Side-by-side I liked the Samsung, incl the shiny black piano finish.  And less expensive.  Got a great price from Amazon/ Electronic Express; ordered Saturday, shipped Monday, arrived Wednesday with delivery window coordinated. I already have a theater, this one basically for living room and HD cable.  Had to get the HD/DVR (Scientific Atlanta) to get HDMI connection, HD box alone does not have it.  Simple hook-up with just the HDMI cable. Fabulous HD pic; still playing with SD settings.  Sound is fine for my purposes. Also got the Cables to Go HDMI 2M cable for $20.  Can't imagine the expensive Monster Cables (which I have in theater for analog signals) could provide a better pic/sound. Monster well made but gross overkill for digital signals. We are really enjoying this HDTV (especially football!) and the simplicity of operation.
