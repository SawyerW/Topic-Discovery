I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas. After the initial set up, the TV did not work. We immediately called the Samsung support line. We were referred to a local TV repair shop. They were not able to come to his house for two weeks to pick it up. My boyfriend decided to expedite things and deliver it himself. After five calls we were told that the piece that needs to be repaired was on back order by Samsung. After calling Samsung customer service 3 times and being put on hold for more than 20 minutes or so each time, I have requested a replacement TV. I am being told that a (Saw?) form must be completed by the parts department and once that is done we will be called about getting a new TV. It is now January 18th and we still are without a TV. I am hoping for some better news soon. This process sucks!!!!
