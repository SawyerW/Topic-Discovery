I bought this TV from a different website back in 2004. It has been working great all these years! I adore the PIP options. I can game on one input and watch TV/news on another. It's a great quality image and sound with great sound options. I just love this TV. When and if it ever dies, I'm going to buy another just like it. Only warning I have is don't lose the remote. It's kind of hard to find a universal remote that has codes for this TV. I have found one that worked with it, but couldn't do the PIP options, which was a hugely sad situation! Love this TV forever!
