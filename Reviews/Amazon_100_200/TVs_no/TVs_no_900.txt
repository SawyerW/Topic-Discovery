I've had this TV for about 3 weeks now and LOVE it. Got a really great deal on it ($900) and it's a perfect size for the bedroom. Crystal clear picture even on non-HD channels. 1080 HD channels are breathtaking! Sound is perfect. Exterior glossy black frame is gorgeous! I agree with the other reviewer - remote is quite large...and a few of the buttons underneath a flip panel is confusing (took me forever to find the 'sleep' button). But, if that's the only complaint, I say BUY IT! Now I just need to buy the 42" Aquous for my living room to replace my older Samsung HDTV. I will def purchase another Aquous once I save up for it.
