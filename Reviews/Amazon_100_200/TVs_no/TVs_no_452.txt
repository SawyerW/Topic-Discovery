I dont know how much this will matter, since this TV was released years ago, but I bought mine the day after Thanksgiving in 2006.  I have loved it ever since, and have never had any problems.  A family friend is looking to upgrade from a CRT to an LCD, and in helping them look online and in stores (they only want a 32" and would prefer staying under $600)I am seeing todays "new" TVs coming out with worse secs than this television!  I just bought the Samsung LN52A650 this past weekend, so I will most likey part ways with this terrific set since I am no longer using it, and it will give them a TV for less than current market ones with better performance than they can find in their price range.
