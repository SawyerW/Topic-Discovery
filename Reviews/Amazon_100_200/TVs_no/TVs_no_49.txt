I will say that do not order any big item such as this TV from Amazon. Once your order, you can not return or cancel. Second day after my order, I decided to cancel the order. I was told that I could not cancel it but I can refuse the shipment. Guess what, after I told the shipping company that, Amazon asked me to pay for the shipping twice. Besides Amazon's price not being competitive, the customer support is lacking all the help you can get. Do not order any Projection TV from Amazon, unless you are planning to cancel or change your mind. It is a terrible web experience. I will not order it again from Amazon.
