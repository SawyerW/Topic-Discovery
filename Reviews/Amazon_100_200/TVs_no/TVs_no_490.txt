This TV was very easy to set up.  It comes with a very nice swivel stand, so we decided not to mount it.  However, mounted, I am sure it would look beautiful as well.  The picture looks great.  I was disappointed with the number of channels that are available in HDTV.  When watching HDTV with this television, it is great.  Without HDTV, you can only watch the television with the mode in which grey bars appear to the side of the picture, because if you use the entire TV for the picture, it looks stretched and skewed.  However, I am sure this is the situation with all widescreen HDTV sets....  The TV came in a package wrapped nicely, but it took forever to ship.  We used the Amazon super saver shipping.  You might want to spend a few bucks to get it sooner... it did take forever to get to us...
