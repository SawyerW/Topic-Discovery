The installation was a breeze and the picture quality is excellent. HD channels from cable source are great. At first the SD channels didn't look too good but after my cable company (Time Warner) reset the digital cable box, the SD channels improved in picture quality. Interestingly, I am only using the composite connectivity (3 RCA plugs - 2 Audio, 1 Video) and it's that good. I wonder much better will the picture quality be with HDMI connection. Since all my sources feed through a receiver (home theatre setup) that does not support HDMI or component, I am kind of stuck until receiver technology catches up. The DVD player upconversion to 720p did not have much of a difference over the non-upconversion SD DVD player. I think it's better to wait for the newer HD DVD players once the prices come down.  By the way, I have played around with the settings on the TV and found that the MOVIE mode setting is the best option.
