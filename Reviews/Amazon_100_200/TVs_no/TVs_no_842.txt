I like this TV a lot i bought it to take advantage of my Xbox 360's component inputs and it doesn't disappoint. I also bought it to replace my desktops monitor and i works wonderfully for that also. The fact that i am using it for both stipulated switching between them flawlessly, however there is a flaw, due to the need to make it receive exceptional antenna signals from the TV tuner it always picks up {Air} as one of the current inputs and so switching between them is a bit more frustrating then originally anticipated. This is just me rambling though i still love the TV and think its a wonderful investment for anyone!!!
