After researching LCD televisions for the specs I wanted: 1080p, various input jacks, and all possible tuners (plan ahead for the Feb 2009 transition if you're shopping now) analog over-the-air, digital and HD digital over-the-air and cable (unscrambled 1-135 channels) I started comparing models by actual physical dimensions to fit our entertainment center. This Sharp Aquos model was the largest that would fit the space. I'd seen similar models of Aquos televisions in an Orlando hotel and was impressed. I visited several stores to see this model on display to do side by side picture comparison. It is an excellent device and the price I paid was tolerable (under $900). Setup was easy and only took a few minutes to perform channel search for the tuners. The base plate and stand required a minute to assemble - no big problems there.
