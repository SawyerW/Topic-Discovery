I am very pleased with this purchase.  I got it for the family for Christmas.  The price was $799 and before it shipped, Amazon had dropped the price to $699.  I emailed Amazon to see if I could get the lower price since mine had not shipped.  They happily credited my cc for the $100 plus tax! This made the deal even sweeter.  As an Amazon Prime member, I also got FREE Two Day Shipping! How awesome is that? I was looking for a 20" or so plasma tv.  The prices were about the same as what I paid for a 42".  Just couldn't pass this one up!The picture quality is great.  We added a surround sound system to improve the sound.  We LOVE it!
