The HP-T5064 has proved it's durability and can stand up to the other higher ranked plasma displays. I really enjoy the 3 HDMI ports. The simplicity of One Cord Hook-Ups is a No Brainer. My Onkyo THX Receiver handles the 1.3 HDMI connection from the DV-980H Oppo up-scaling DVD Player then out to the Mighty Samsung on the wall. Of course the Onkyo Handles the Front Bose 501's and the Infinity center channel, 2 Infinity 25es Rear Channel, with a pair of Alpha 50's for the rear surround pair, and you can't forget the Yamaha subwoofer. All for the Theater experience. But I really want an Infinity subwoofer the Cascade model I think. Anyone have any suggestions as to which subwoofer I should think about purchasing, or better yet Giving Me One for Christmas:) One could only dream. Because after all I have spent 98% of my allocated gift money already and I am told it will take me awhile before we can recover from my spending.Thanks ahead of time for your comments, and Happy Holidays to all.
