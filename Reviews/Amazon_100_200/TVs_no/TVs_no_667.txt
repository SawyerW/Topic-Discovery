After many hours of researching for a quality LCD HD TV in a reasonable price range, this is what I bought. The picture is clear, the sound is pretty good(I don't have a home theater and surround sound at this time) and the TV is easy to operate and very attractive. The 10,000-to-1 contrast ratio really makes for a stunning image. Most plasmas in this price range don't even come close to this ratio. Be aware of that when you're shopping for a TV. I've had no problems and I'm very happy with my purchase. Amazon is a great company to buy from. It certainly was a few hundred dollars cheaper than Best Buy and Circuit City, free shipping and no sales tax....plus they gave me 18 months no interest. You can't beat that!!
