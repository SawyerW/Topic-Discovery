I researched TV's for a few weeks before purchasing this one.  I read the pros and cons of plasma vs lcd, and reviews of individual models.Initially, I was concerned about plasmas and elevation.  I read that the higher the elevation, the more work the TV has to work to make the picture, often causing a buzz noise.  Most TV's are rated to 6500 ft, and since I'm at 4500 ft, I thought it would be all right.  There is a slight buzz that can be heard if you stick your head behind the set, but can't be heard otherwise.Picture quality is impressive in HD, as expected.  What wasn't expected was the very good picture quality for SD channels as well.  I have a large rear projection Hitachi HD set as well, and the picture quality of non HD channels is almost embarrassing, especially compared to this Samsung plasma.Shipping through Amazon was very fast and Eagle was great to deal with.  I love buying through Amazon due to free shipping and no sales tax.I recommend this set to anyone interested!
