I purchased a Samsung television about eighteen months ago. Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it. From what I can tell from looking on television repair forums, Samsung televisions look to be pretty flakey.
