this sylvania replaces my 26" phillips which was purchased from sears in october 2005 and now the screen is half black!  anyhow, the sylvania is very light and very easy to set up.  i have a dvd/vcr, direct tv and tivo.  installation of the sylvania was less than 10 minutes.  the manual i found to be easy and simple.  the remote control is bright gray and some buttons are colored-coated.the picture is very clear.  the only adjustment was the tint - too much green.all-in-all i give the LC200SL8 to be a great t.v. for the size and price a 5 star ratings
