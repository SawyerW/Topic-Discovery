I've had this TV 14 months; while my sister was watching it a loud pop and black screen appeared; I have a feeling I'm going to get screwed on this like the other 2 reviewers; the warranty is only a year; I mistakenly had faith in zenith so I didn't buy the extended warranty from CC; I wasn't that happy with it to begin with; the sound is tinny and crackly at times; with a black background there's a lot of varibility in the blacks which is what I think other people are referring to as artefact with a black background; they form these black/grey blotches which is annoying; I don't recommend you purchase this; this is certainly making me question the LG refridgerator and dishwasher that I have bought too; there must be more cases like mine and the other 2 reviewers; zenith/LG's quality control was got to be better
