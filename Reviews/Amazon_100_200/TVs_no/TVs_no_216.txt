Bought the Zenith Z50PX2D in July of 2006. Tonight the infamous POP occured.After doing a search for what the problem could be, I've realized there are TOO many malfunctions with this product.I called the LG support, tech guy basically said too bad. But was kind enough to offer me phone numbers to service centers which are over 100 miles from my home.No way will I pay to have this thing repaired, as so many others have spent more money only to have it POP again within days or months.Not only is it a disgrace for a company to knowinly manufacture such a defective prodcuct, it is a shame on how many tons of trash this TV is adding to our landfills.If anyone knows of a class action lawsuit has been filed, or knows how to start one, please contact me.
