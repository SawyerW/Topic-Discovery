I bought a 46" Toshiba Regaza tv 3 years ago. It started to get vertical colored lines ,when 1st turned on, almost from day 1. Apparently this means the LCD screen will fail as soon as the tv gets out of warranty which mine did.  I have read dozens if not hundreds of complaints about theToshiba Regaza Tvs. They all have a similar sound with the screen failing and the sound still working after a year or two, usually just out of warranty.  In all the accounts I have read, I have never heard of Toshiba even caring about their tv problems. The Toshiba tv was fairly expensive too, approximately $ 1800.00 at the time. It did have a nice picture until it failed. So I guess if you want to purchase a nice tv that will last a year or two at the most then Toshiba is for you.  About six months ago I purchased a Sharp LED 3d tv, so far so good with this tv.
