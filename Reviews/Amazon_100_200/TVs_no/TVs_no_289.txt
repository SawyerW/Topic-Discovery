i bought this tv well aware of the buzzing problem people have been talking about. but thought i would be one of the lucky ones. well i wasn't it buzzed from the first time i turned it on. one thing i did notice is the buzzing is do to the echo coming off the back cover. if you loosin or tightin the screws on the back of the tv the buzzing sound  reduces. but who wants to buy a tv for this much money and then work on it.so after about a week of buzzzzzz sent it back and ordered the samsung 46 inch lcd 1080p. no more buzzz i guess you get what you pay for. i can't beleive a company as big as samsung would allow it's products to leave the plant like this.
