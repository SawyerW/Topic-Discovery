This TV has the best picture I have seen on any TV; when a maintenance man or other person comes into my apartment while I have on scenery everyone takes a 2nd look before they say it is the best picture they have ever seen & this has been on close to 18 hours a day since it arrived.The weak spot is the volume is not loud enough on some stations, I read the same about other new Sharp TV's; Sharp should have fixed them by now...I know this is old & would be difficult to find and with newer connections & speeds it would not make sense except for those who are not after a Swiss Army Knife ... and those that discourage buying a 1080P on a small set I disagree with them & this TV as the picture is just so pristine I wouldn't want anything else for my use.No problem no complaint ... would like another with newer technology.Hooty
