The price was the best we found. Consumer Reports rated the Toshiba 42HL67 highly and delivery and installation went soothly-just follow the steps on wiring from your cable company. The picture is terrific in HD and SD and the remote is not complicated. Anyway, once set, you use the cable box remote.Our only complaint are the speakers which don't seem very powerful or clear but we were planning on upgrading before we bough the TV but decided to wait to make sure whatever we bought was compatible. The set looks nice and sleek in our family room. After tons of research, this set does it for us.
