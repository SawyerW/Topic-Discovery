This is a great tv!  I hooked up an antenna and get all the network channels, a music video channel, and several more for free.  The picture is sharp and the color is great, especially compared to other brands.  Just check them out side by side in the store, and you'll see the difference.  Don't expect great sound from the speakers.  Hook up your stereo instead.  The only issue for me is the time it takes to change channels.  For some reason there's a short delay that takes some getting used to, but for the price, this tv can't be beat.
