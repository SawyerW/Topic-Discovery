Everything is great w/ the TV and Amazon delivered all 5 as ordered on time.  (I needed five to install in retail space)One note - if mounting on a low profile wall mount, you may want right angle coax, or whatever connection used, adaptors, which are found easily online or at a local electronics store...very inexpensive.You may also look for right-angle AC cords.  The plug to the TV is right-angle, but the one to the wall is not.  Unless you countersink the outlet it may push that area of the TV outwards.  I was told by Samsung Parts aka J&J; International, that this TV had a regular computer AC cord...so finding a substitute that was shorter * w/ right-angle plugs should be easier.Again this may only be relevant on very low profile mounts...I used Sanus ML-22's.Someone please create a market for flat panel TV stands...I have eight now.
