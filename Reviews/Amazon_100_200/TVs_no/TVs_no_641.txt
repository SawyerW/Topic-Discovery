This was one of the most nerve racking purchase decisions I have ever made.  I poured over reviews, worried that I would regret not waiting for the next gen product, fretted that I should go for plasma after all.Well, I took the plunge, and now I can't believe I waited so long.  This product is gorgeous.  If you, like me, want to watch your TV, not measure it with test instruments, this thing will surpass your expectations.  Not only that, it will do it at half the price of "this year's model".I studiously input all the settings advised by CNET and didn't like the results.  Then tried those much maligned factory settings (Standard, in a room with the blinds closed), and found them to be perfect for me.There may be better sets out there, but if you are above a "certain age", I'll bet your eyes couldn't see the difference anyway.  So place your order, relax, and think about what to do with the $1400 you just saved!
