I love my TV...  the picture is sharp, the audio is clear.  I have it mounted on a wall across from the treadmill and it sounds great even when running.  The only thing that I don't like is on the remote layout.  The ENTER button needs to be close to the numbers- if you want to change channels by pushing in the numbers, you either have to wait for the delay, or move your hand a long way down the remote.  Overall, this is minor compared the quality of the picture and the audio.  =)I have never been a big samsung fan, but this TV has changed my opinion.
