This is my second Samsung HDTV. I have a 3 year-old 56" DLP that is still working fine. The new LCD makes a much better picture, very high contrast and detail, at less than half the cost. The picture was so bright that I had to turn it down. It is connected to our DishTV HDTV box via a 50' component cable. The very good looking swivel stand and small black frame are nice, but hiding the speakers in back slightly compromised the sound quality compared to my old TV. A little hollow sounding. That minor fault aside, this HDTV just jumped out and said buy me when I went to local video stores and made side by side comparisons. Amazon's price was by far the best. And even the wife loves it.
