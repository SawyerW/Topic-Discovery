I just received this television yesterday.  I was a little concerned about the sound quality as I have seen it being bashed by reviewers. However, bottom line, the t.v. sounds just fine.  You may need a minute to get used to the sound coming from behind or behind/side of the t.v., but I think that has more to do with the reviews warning about the sound, then the sound quality itself.  I must warn you that this is my experience with the t.v., just sitting on a stand AND NOT MOUNTED TO A WALL.  I would reccomend this t.v. to anyone looking for a good deal on a plasma.
