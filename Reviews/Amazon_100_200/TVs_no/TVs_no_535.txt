I bought this TV in the winter of 2008 and was initially quite pleased. The picture and functionality were great for the price. But then summer came and it got warm and, somehow, this caused the TV speakers to stop working. At first the sound becomes slightly distorted and eventually it ends up so muted that you can't hear any of the audio at all - even with the volume turned all the way up.I researched this problem online and contacted Sharp. Apparently this glitch is very typical of this model - and Sharp LCD TVs in general. So...unless you plan to only use your stereo or some other external speaker source when watching, I suggest you buy another make/model of TV.
