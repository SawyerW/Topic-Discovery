I have owned the Toshiba 51H84 since 2004, and I am still very happy with it.  It has performed flawlessly for thousands of hours since then. As for its technology being outdated (RPTV), and its maximum resolution being less than the maximum available (1080i), I think it has taught me to sympathize with those throwbacks who hang onto their vinyl LP's.  As my ears are unable to distinguish between digital and analog sound due to a long history of attending rock concerts, my eyes still function quite well (with correction).  I find that the latest generation of HDTV's, especially with hi-res digital content, yield a very "digital" looking result. I also own a 1080p 120Hz LCD TV which often gives an unreal overly digital looking result. The anachronistic RPTV yields a more realistic experience similar to film IMHO. I will keep watching my RPTV until it quits for good.
