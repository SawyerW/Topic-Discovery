I bought a Samsung HPT5064 in mid August because i thought the picture was fantastic.Mid November it quit.  I'm still waiting on the repair.  Samsung customer service keeps saying they first try to repair.  Have been on the phone with them several times.I think they should have replaced a unit that was only a few months old.Based on the warranty service alone, I'd recommend going with a brand other than Samsung.12-14-07:  They attempted to return my TV and struck it hard enough on the truck to break the front glass.  Took TV back to repair shop.  Samsung keeps referring me back to the repair shop (which refuses to replace it).-Mitch Deason
