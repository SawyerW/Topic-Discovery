I bought it after looking at Sony for consieration. For features and price, this one is lot better and cheaper. Although new Sony 32xbr950 now also has HDMI, but it is $2000 more and 86 horizontal pixels less.I had it hung on the wall, whether it'll be playing VOOM's "Video Art" channel for screensaver before going to sleep, or watching Grand Canyon on Discover Channel HD, I can not cease to admire the pictures this LCD put out. Combine with a up-convert HDMI DVD player like the Toshiba I reviewed (by the way I have no problem playing dvd-r or rw with the DVD player or any other problems people experienced), this LCD rocks!If only it does 1080p...
