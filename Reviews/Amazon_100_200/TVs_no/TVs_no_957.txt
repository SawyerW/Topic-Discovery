I have owned the TV for 6 days. Picture looks great on HD content and ok on SD. Needs adjustment out of box. Do NOT buy for the Picture in Picture feature. To Switch your choice of pictures sound you must pull up menu. Choose sound then input. Now the killer. SOUND has cut out on me way to many times. My older tv (Sony) never lost sound, ever and NO tv should! So it is not my $89.00 HDMI Cable. You expect to make adjustments to a TV, Color, Tint, Contrast etc. NOT to this sound problem. Defective item is being returned. NOT recommended.
