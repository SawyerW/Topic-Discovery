Like most people here, I bought this TV because of the great reviews. The price, you can't beat it.This was the first time I bought an expensive piece of electronic online. I was a little nervous from reading some horror stories w/ deliveries and customer service. After litterally reading all of the reviews I decided to take a chance. Turns out it was the best thing I ever bought online. I ordered late Saturday and received it Thursday. The picture w/ my newly bought Samsung upconverting 5-disc changer w/ SRS is great. SD programming isn't bad either. I'm planning to get HD programming, but still trying to find the best deal. Anyone know the best provider to go with? Dish network, Direct TV, or Comcast? I currently have Comcast as my cable provider.
