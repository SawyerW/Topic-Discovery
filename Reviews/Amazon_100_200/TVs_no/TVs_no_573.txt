I did a lot of reading before deciding what to buy: plasma, dlp or LCD. Brand reputation was also very important.  The website of toshiba had a great explanation on the features of the regza series; together with the amazon great price I made decided to go for regza 42HL167.The TV was shipped faster than promised. It is my first wide screen High definition TV, so I have no references to compare.  However, I am very pleased with the quality  of images, contrast capability, brightness, etc.  The sound is great also.I have been doing some comparisons with similar TVs in stores, and I am still happy with my purchase.Although there is no broadcasting at the highest resolution (1080p) I have a TV for the very near future at a great price.If you read this, it is because you care about what you buy and also the price.  I recommend this TV for its price and quality.thanks
