We purchased this T.V. and placed it in our media armoire.  The picture is great but we find it is very hard to hear.  I don't know if this has to do with the tv being in a cabinet and the placement of the speakers on the TV or if it is just the TV.  Even with the volume high we often miss words or sentences if there is any other ambient noise in the room.  It also seems to lag when the power button is pushed to turn it on.  Sometimes the lag is so long you push the power button again and end up in a cycle of turning it off/on.
