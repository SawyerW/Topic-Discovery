I've had this TV for about two years and it is now experiencing a power on-off cycling problem. The TV continuously powers on and off by itself, never displays a proper picture, and is basically unusable.  The only way to turn the TV off is to unplug it.  I've found many online reviews which describe this problem with all Samsung LCD TVs, and everyone is very dissatisfied with their TV and Samsung customer service.  My TV is out of warranty, so I'm out of luck.  However, I strongly advise not to buy a Samsung LCD TV.*** update - the TV appears to have stabilized and is no longer experiencing the problem. It was not repaired but rather seems to have fixed itself!
