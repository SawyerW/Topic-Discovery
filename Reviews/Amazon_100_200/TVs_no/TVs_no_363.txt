I purchased this TV several months ago and have not been disappointed. The picture quality is great, even without HDTV. The sound is good for the built-in speakers. My one complaint would be the remote control. You must point the remote directly at the center of the TV for it to work.I looked at several TVs before purchasing this one and noticed Samsung consistently had the best overall picture. I do recommend spending a little extra to purchase some high-quality cables so you can get the most out of this TV. Everyone who comes to my house always says something about the TV. Those who watch it, love the clear picture.Of course, this isn't a 1080p TV. However, I couldn't justify spending the money a 1080p TV cost. Especially, when the HD-DVD players cost so much.Overall, for the price the picture on this TV is excellent as well as the design. Samsung LNS4051D 40" LCD HDTV
