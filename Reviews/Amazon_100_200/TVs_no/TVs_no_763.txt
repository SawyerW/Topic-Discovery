All in all this has been a great tv. We have had it for about a month now. I have only noticed two problems with the tv. One is that when a scene changes or a show goes to commerical and the screen goes black there is a residual outline of what was jsut being shown. It does go away though. I'm not sure what causes it but its not that big of a deal. Also the volume control is annoying. You can't push and hold the volume button you have to click ever time you want it to move one space. Oh - and there is an annoying sound that is made when you turn it on and off but we programmed the tv to get rid of that sound.As an FYI to Time Warner Cable users - when you go to chage in your cable box for an upgraded HD box they give you the cables you need to hook up the tv. I had already bought and HDMI cable (which is supposed to be better) but you may want to try the cable the cable company gives you before you buy one.
