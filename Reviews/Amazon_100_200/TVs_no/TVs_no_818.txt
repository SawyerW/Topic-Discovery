Awesome TV - I had gone shopping at the usual places to compare the picture quality of different 32" LCD sets (before purchasing here at Amazon), and in each of the different stores I looked, the Samsung LTN325H had the best picture quality among all of the 32" LCD sets on display. I've had this set for a month now, and I'm still impressed!This TV offers an impressive array of inputs - I'm using HDMI from a Dish Network 722 HD satellite receiver, component from a Sharp DVD player, and good-old RCA from the ancient Sony VCR my wife refuses to give up. Sound quality is excellent at any reasonable volume level.I would highly reccommned this TV to anyone looking for something in this size .
