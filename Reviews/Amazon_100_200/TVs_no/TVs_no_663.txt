I Bought this TV set on December 2007 for the firts 3 years worked just perfect, six months ago,I started to have problems when I turned it on, It didnt wanted to start, and it started to take about 5 to 10 minutes before I could see the Image o the screen, after that it always appear a dark Line on the center of the screen. This Morning, on November 16th 2011, the TV just died. its is not the quality I expected for a TV set that cost me at that time Allmost 1000$, I just wont buy another samsung tv.
