I bought this tv 2 yrs ago when it first came out and there was seemingly nothing else like it availble on the market. I say this because all my friends who had hdtvs could not believe the picture and all preferred mine.When I bought this model it was selling for $3000 pretty much everywhere and to be able 2 buy this unit for just about half of that now is a no brainer 2 me. My friends have all been envious of me ever since I got this tv.I did read one other review here on amazon that said the sound on this tv is terrible and it definitely is. Barely usable for the few days before I got a receiver but my philosopy is that when you buy a tv of this quality surely you intend to add some additional sound.
