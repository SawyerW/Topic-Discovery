Six months and I'm still in love with this TV. Some people mentioned having to pay shipping and handling, but I didn't have to do that. So I paid a total of about $900. The picture quality for HD channels is great---clear, crisp, distinctive colors and gives you an almost "there" feeling. As another reviewer mentioned the sound isn't that great, but for the TV sound that's fine and only a bit of a problem when I listen to music. Another minor issue I have is that the screen seems to continually have marks on it that only show when the TV is off. Other than that I think I got an absolutely wonderful bargain. Other TVs I priced for this size were $400 to $700 more.
