I was a little worried when I ordered this TV from Amazon because I could not find any customer reviews.The shippers were great and unboxed the TV and set it on the table for me. This is the best looking set I have seen, with its sleek shiny black elegant looks.I had it connected to a Dish Network HD satalite system and the picture quality is truely amazing (very bright vivid colors) and this is in a very bright room with a huge picture window where I have always had problems before with my Sony CRT TV. I also ordered a Sanus 49" Natural Stand with cherry finish from DependableResource through Amazon and the stand is perfect for this Samsung TV. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and everyone loves this new Samsung TV.
