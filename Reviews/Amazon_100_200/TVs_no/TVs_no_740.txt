I've had this tv for less than 3 years.  first there was a green bar that went down the center.  then a couple weeks later, when you turn the tv on, it turns on and off repeatedly for a couple minutes before it finally turns on.  I've read online that Samsung used some cheap part and they are aware of this problem.  of course this tv is no longer under warranty so now, we have to figure out how to fix it or just live with it.  I had done research on this tv before purchasing it.  at the time, all the reviews were good.  so i'm very disappointed in this tv and will not buy another Samsung again!  Very sad to say since I'm Korean and I like to support Korean products along w/ U.S. made ones.
