Excellent picture quality...standard def is just as good as i get on any other set powered by cable.  Watching sports are awesome..feel like you are on the court, the ice rink or the football field.  Sound is very good..with a separate Home Theater w/upscaling dvd, the Chronicles of Narnia was great.  I will definitely be watching more dvds! Delivery was excellent through EGL.  They were actually 10 minutes early..delivery person was friendly and helpful.  System setup was easy following straightforward instructions. This is my second Samsung TV.  My older set has an HDTV tuner in it and is a CRT (very heavy and only 27").  Besides those qualities, the HDTV picture is very nice.  This convinced me to try an updated Samsung Product. So far....great.
