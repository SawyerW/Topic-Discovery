If one can find this LCD (actually physically find it, in a warehouse somewhere, from any authorized reseller/retailer/etailer - there are rumors of these things being hijacked from overseas containers in California, which - who knows - could be true), this is a super-value buy for those of us without multiple-thousands of dollars in disposable income.  No it does not quite have the picture of a $4000 or $5000 plasma or more-expensive projection LCD, but, it is simple to set up, has all of the appropriate connections (except an optical audio-out - bummer), and, plays DVD and HDTV beautifully.  For the small picture quality sacrifice (compared to units twice and three times its price), Syntax puts this TV within the financial reach of working-class folks.  Some bemoan the remote - it really isn't that bad.Buy with confidence - but - see it in person if you can before buying to better preset your expectations.  When compared to others in its class (by Westinghouse, Albatron, etc.), this machine rocks.
