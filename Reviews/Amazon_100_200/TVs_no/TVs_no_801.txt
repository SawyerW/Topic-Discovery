this tv is a great value!  it has 3 hdmi ports and an awesome picture!  I have had not had any of the audio drop outs that some of the reviews talked about... i have had it for about a half a year now and i am very pleased with it.  the only con is that the tv does slant to the left slighty but when you have the lights off for a movie you would never be able to notice it.  and all the other features greatly outway this small problem, it is only like 1 degree anyways so unless you are extremly paranoid its not a problem.  this tv is with out a doubt the best value out there.  the swivel stand is also a nice touch, but the coolest thing is the heat sensitive buttons and the cool blue light at the bottom.  i would buy this again in a heart beat!  hope this helped...
