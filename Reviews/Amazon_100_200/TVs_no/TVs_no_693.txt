I bought this product because it had Picture-in-a-Picture capability. However PIP does not work with my VCR - which has a TV channel tuner. It will work with my CD player but since that doesn't have a tuner what's the point!! Even then it's unnecessarily complicated to work - unlike my old Magnavox TV where PIP was so simple and convenient.Of course one doesn't learn this until one delves deep into the manual and even calls Samsung support to learn that PIP does not work with the common RCA connections!Otherwise, it's been good so far. But it doesn't fulfill the main reason I selected this brand. Major disappointment.
