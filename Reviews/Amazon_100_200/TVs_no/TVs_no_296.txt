Bought in October '06 for $2,199 total, no tax, free shipping.  Arrived on time and in good shape via Eagle.  Gorgeous TV, great picture.  Mine does buzz slightly as I am told all plasmas do to a certain degree.  Samsung's are more prone to this vs other brands.  The buzzing is my only complaint, but its so faint that over time it becomes unoticable.  From my research, the noise is coming from the plasma jets that shoot the electrons into  the gas, generating the picture.  Samsung even puts a caveat in the owner manual that this TV will not run silently and a slight buzzing sound is considered normal. Again, thats my only gripe about it.  Im sure you can go spend $5,000 on a Pioneer that runs quieter, but thats too much money for a freakin TV in my opinion. You get what you pay for in this case.........
