Very skeptical of the online purchase through AMAZON.  Most of the reviews I read referenced that the delivery contractor would make sure everything worked, give you piece of mind, etc. Not here!  We also live in the middle of nowhere (western ND), so you wonder how technology can reach us out here on the frontier.  Saved a few bucks anyways and the shipping was free.  I crossed my fingers and made the purchase, everything has gone smooth with the TV so far.  If you can get a HD signal, its absolutely amazing what the picture is like.  Can't wait for the rest of the local channels and satellite companies to change over.  Only gripe is that the delivery actually showed up like 6 days ahead of schedule (according to internet tracking) and the delilvery guy spoiled the suprise since I wasn't home to take care of it.  He didn't really care either, but thats the kind of service we are used to around here.  Anywho, thanks for the great product, I would recommend it.
