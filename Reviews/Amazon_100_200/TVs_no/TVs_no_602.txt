I did a lot of research before selecting this TV. It delivers! Here's what I like best about it:-Sturdy stand (important if you have active little ones)-Great Standard Definition picture (I can't fathom paying a ton for a TV that only looks good in HD, when most of what you watch is not in HD).-HD picture is amazing, of course.-Easy setup, just connected it and looked great right out of the box.-Sound quality is great.Only con is it takes 6 to 9 seconds to come on when you turn it on (this may be a regular LCD TV thing, as this is the only one I've owned).Comes with a 1 year warranty. I called Mastercard and they extend it to 2 years for free. Don't buy a ridiculous unnecessary extra warranty!Protected it with a Belkin Pure AV Home Theater surge protector.
