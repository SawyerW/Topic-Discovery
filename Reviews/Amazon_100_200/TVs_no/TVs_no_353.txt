I love this TV. I love it. It's physically beautiful, fits perfectly in my living room, and has a fantastic picture. In my opinion, the picture quality is as good as sets that cost twice as much. I'm thrilled with the brightness, color, and clarity of this LCD. And I'm glad every time I turn it on during the daytime that I didn't go with a plasma. The matte finish of this LCD shows no glare from the window on the opposite wall, something my shiny old CRT television always had a problem with. Again, I love this TV.---EDIT 12/9/06---I have noticed one weird thing as time goes on. When I zoom a standard-definition source to fill the screen, there is intermittently a horizontal line that moves through the picture. It's as if the picture is being split and the bottom half is being shifted a pixel or two to one side. HD sources don't suffer from this, and SD sources are fine as long as you watch them in 4:3 with black bars on either side.
