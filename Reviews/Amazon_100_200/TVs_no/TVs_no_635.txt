Sylvania's 20-inch "ED"TV with built-in DVD player is a winner. I bought one when I wanted to upgrade our second TV to high definition at the same time I bought our 37-inch Olevia for our living room (ASIN: B000H312RK see my review) and this is turning out to be the best $1,000 I ever spent.The little Sylvania is an "enhanced definition" television. This means it is not true high definition but can accept the high def signal although it won't interpret it exactly as your true HDTV will. But it looks great even in standard definition with an exceptionally bright screen that delivers brilliant colors and high contrast all the time.The 20-inch (diagonal) screen is 16 inches wide and 12 inches deep, giving it a 4:3 picture ratio. This is not HD widescreen but it looks wider than that when you watch. Part of the reason for that is the super brilliance of the picture mated to the enhanced definition picture.The built-in DVD player is on the back left side of the TV on a vertical plane. It's easy to use -- just stick in your favorite DVD and press "play". This is a friendly little television you'll like.
