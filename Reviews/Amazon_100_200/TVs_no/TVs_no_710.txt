Don't get me wrong, HDTV signals, especially those in 1080i look awesome on this TV, but like all LCDs, the standard definition TV looks blurry, not all digital sources are scaled properly automatically.Pros: awesome picture, good black levels, good brightness (too bright, change set from dynamic to standard right away!), Intuitive menu systemCons: still poor standard definition picture (blurry), close captioning sucks (when other remotes are used it turns off cc option, TV must reboot to get cc back), speakers SUCK (worse than an radio alarm clock), TV loses all previous mute and cc status when turned off an back on.  So if you have it muted, when turned back on, the volume will be NOT muted!.They still have not gotten HDTVs right, they take too much work and too many clicks to just watch TV.  My DirecTV DVR takes less work to use than this TV, and it records my shows for me....All in all, I regret my purchase of this set, and would recommend others either check out different brands, especially the SD picture quality, menus, remotes, speakers, etc., before settling on a model.
