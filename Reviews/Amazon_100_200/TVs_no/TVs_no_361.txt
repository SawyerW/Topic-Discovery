This LCD has one of the most attractive pictures with rich colors and excellent contrast ratios compared to any of the other LCD brands .  Menus are fairly intuitive to use to make adjustments and set ups.  Like any LCD there is a slight break up of the picture when the action becomes very fast.  Video of fast moving water seems to create the most problems for breaking up.  Almost all other action is smooth.  For medium and small sized rooms this 40 inch screen seems like a movie screen.  After more than three years, no problems at all with this quality set.
