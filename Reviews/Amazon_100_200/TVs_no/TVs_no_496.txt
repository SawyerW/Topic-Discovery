I did so much research before I ordered this television and, boy, it was really worth every second! The picture is great, the colors are fabulous, and with HD cable and an HDMI cable, it seems like we are part of the picture. When I ordered the tv, it was a week before the SuperBowl. So, when they said that it would take 2 weeks for delivery, I did not doubt it. Before I even had a chance to check to see whether delivery was scheduled, the shipping company was already calling to offer a delivery date. Super service since it was a whole week early! And, at $300.00 better than even Best Buy! Would buy from Amazon again in a heartbeat. And, probably will for the 40" - we are spoiled now!
