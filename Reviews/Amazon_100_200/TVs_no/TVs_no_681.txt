With some trepidation, we ordered this tv from Amazon in January 2008. We received it quickly and with no problems whatsoever.  Great service from Amazon and we fell in love with the television.  It was easy to install and set up, looked fantastic and had a great picture.  Our love affair continued until January 2010 when it started clicking on and off several times before staying on.  I checked the internet and sure enough, there appeared to be a common problem with the capacitors.  We were very unhappy to have a problem with a 2year old tv.  We called Samsung customer service and they issued a repair order for a local service person to come check the tv. They said if the problem was capacitors, they would handle the cost.  The repair personnel came on the 3rd day, put in a new board and left.  Problem solved. We are extremely happy with the support we received from Samsung and it makes us feel better about the Samsung refrigerator that we purchased in November 2009.
