I purchased a 37" Aquos about 3 years ago, paid $2000.00. The sound has gone out and the repair shop says $750.00 for the part plus labor. I already paid $50.00 just to have it looked at. Sharp customer service is a JOKE, the girl told me to try unplugging and plugging back in. I did, that did nothing. I have received no further contact from Sharp in response to e mails and phone calls. After searching online this seems to be be a common problem with many of these Aquos, different sizes and models all the same problem. Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. I now have a 37" dust collector.
