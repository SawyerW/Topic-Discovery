I bought this TV before Christmas when it was on an extreme sale.  I didnt know what to expect, seeing that this was an EDTV instead of HDTV, and that "what you get is what you pay for".  When the TV arrived, i was pleasantly surprised.  It had a better picture than the 42in LCD Westinghouse TV i bought from Best Buy a week before!  I returned the Westinghouse one to BB, and kept this one.  I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to anyone.  I am still working on getting my computer hooked up to it though, as the TV has no VGA or DVI connector :(
