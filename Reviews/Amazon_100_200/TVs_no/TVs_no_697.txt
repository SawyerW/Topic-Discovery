Very happy with this HDTV, excellent value. Easy to set up and use. We were watching TV in less than an hour of set up!! We are able to receive local channels in HD broadcast with just an antenna... awesome picture.  Had heared the sound quality was'nt so great, but we find it to be great quality.  Only draw back is, picture w/o HD broadcast is not so great, a little fuzzy. You get spoiled easily with the HD picture!!! Still have to get our HD receiver w/ Direct TV. We did watch the Super Bowl in HD and it was amazing!!!  Amazon shipped it quickly too!!! Would definately recommend this TV.
