this was purchased as a diversionary tv, so the love of my life could watch whatever she wanted while i watched my stuff elsewhere. I am pretty impressed with the samsung. It hasNice form factorLOTS of inputs, including 2 hdmi inputsCrisp HDTV picture qualityReasonable visibility from an angle (in its current location, that's not really an issue for us)It does not haveout-of-this-world sound (the case is pretty small, so there's not much room for a large speaker array).The only thing i have noticed that i don't like is a phosphorous glow down the vertical edges of the screen when watching 4:3 programs that have a dark background. Not a problem for most programming, but distracting when it does happen.I like this tv so far (three months). It has a bunch of bells and whistles and settings that i have not yet investigated (it has a "game setting" that i don't even know what it is), but the hd and dvd picture quality is good - i generally watch a Sony XBR CRT, and it's not THAT good, but its pretty good. The price-performance ratio of the samsung made it an attractive option, with which i am satisfied.
