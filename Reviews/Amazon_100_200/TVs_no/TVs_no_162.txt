I read most of the reviews here and agree on the following points.1. No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.
