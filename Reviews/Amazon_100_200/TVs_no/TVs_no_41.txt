Ask most video heads, and they will agree Toshiba is the best. I had a 53hx71 that I recently sold, and I bought this set from Amzon last week. The shipping was the only headache and most of that was me wanting some instant gradification.I live in LA and the TV was shipped out 5 hours away... but yet it took a week to get... thats stupid. Its annoying when you track it and it says its at LAX (20 mins away).. I wanted to walk it home!The actual TV is AMAZING.. the regular cable looks great, and this is the first series I have seen that you dont noticed regular tv being stretched!! The HDTV rocks, the only negative thing I can think of is having to adjust all the inputs because its shipped with the contrast at 100!...take that down to about 48...Seriously, this tv is a HUGE bang for a small buck.
