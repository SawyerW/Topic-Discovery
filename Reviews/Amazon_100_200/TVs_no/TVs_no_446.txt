I had this TV for little more then 6 months. I brought it from Bestbuy during thanksgivings sale(799$+taxes) at a very good price. I am very happy with it performance so far. Here are few things that would help you decided about wheather this TV is for you or not.Pros.1. Good colors & contrast i think only TV having better colors is Sony Bravia.2. Very slim and good looking.3. Have 2 HDMI inputs so will be easy to use with any relatively new DVD player or home theater.4. Provide RBG input for pluging in the computer directly. This is one feature I use a lot and I love it.Cons.1. Only provides you 720p resolution.2. Only have 1 component input which can a limitation sometimes.3. Speaker are decent but will strongly recommend to use home theater to enjoy the HD program or movies.4. Feel little (just a little) small now and thought would have been better to buy a 40'' one as now I have a bigger living home.5. Hard to configure the TV's universal remote with other devices( like motorala cable box etc).-Naveen
