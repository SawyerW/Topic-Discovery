Purchased a Samsung LNT-2653H from Circuit City, was happy with the picture, but had a slight buzz during some scenes. Decided to go with the Sharp to match my bedroom Sharp LC-42D62U and I am very happy. Purchased this set from Amazon, shipping was fast and saved a lot compared to the Samsung. Used to be a diehard Samsung fan, but Sharp has won me over. Considering replacing Samsung DLP in living room with a Sharp LCD.One person commented about the lag between changing HD and SD channels with DISH network, have not had any trouble with the DISH Network VIP 211 box I have connected to this TV.
