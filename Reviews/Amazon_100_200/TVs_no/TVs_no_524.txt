My first HDTV purchase, and it was a good deal-Price was $979 + free shipping.  I shopped around-My choice was between this and the Sharp Aquos LC-32D40U.  The Sharp (1200:1 contrast ratio) was cheaper, but the 4000:1 contrast ratio, beautiful piano finish and styling of the Samsung was worth the extra few bucks.  I ordered on 12/27/06 and had estimated delivery date of 1/9/07-1/15/07.  I got it on Saturday 1/6/07 (I tracked the package to Newark, NJ on 1/3/07, and called the number listed on the Amazon site.  Eagle was ready to ship the next day, but I asked for Saturday 11am-3pm.  They delivered at 11:30am.  I bought a Black 2 Meter / 6 Ft. HDMI Male to DVI Male Cable on Amazon for $9 to hook up to my Time Warner HDTV cable box, and within minutes, I was watching crystal-clear HDTV.
