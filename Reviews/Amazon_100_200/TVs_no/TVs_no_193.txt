I actually bought this tv just before it became obsolete in 2005. While it is, as any sony is, a great tv, with the picture quality you expect from a sony, is a huge draw on power when turning on. The sound, the clarity, and most importantly it's durability make this a great tv, it is old and you could do well to purchase a more modern tv and save money on your electric bill. I've had mine 8 years and i bought the floor model. She's tired and has many many hours on her but she still working fine only replacing her because i need to upgrade to a less bulky tv.
