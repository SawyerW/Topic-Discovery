I've had this TV almost three months. I got it about $150 less than Amazon's lowest price.The TV looks great in my small apartment, almost too big. The picture is great-I'm using it with DirectTv HD service. But the one thing that bothers me about the TV is the stand/base. You have to screw the base on manually. After having the TV for a few weeks the TV started to wobble. We had to take it down and tighten the screws, same thing happened a few week after that. My husband used both a hand and power screw diver to ensure a tight fit- but to no avail. The bad base would stop me from buying the set again
