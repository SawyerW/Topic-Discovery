Ordered the TV on Sunday and it arrived 10 days later.  The TV looks good and is working as advertised.  I got a TERK indoor antenna and the local HDTV channels look impressive.  But the regular channels I receive via Dish network look a little worse.  Hopefully in a couple of years all the American channels will be broadcast in HD and some more years after that, the International channels will be broadcast in HD and then all will be well :-)  I played a couple of DVDs and they were awesome.  Photos and mp3 music from an external hard drive worked well.  I'll connect a PC to the TV tonight.  Was the large amount of money on this TV well-spent?  I am not sure.
