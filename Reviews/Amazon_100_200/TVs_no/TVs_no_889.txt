We've had this T.V. since it came out (bought it the first day of release) and it has performed flawlessly. Ours is marked "Made in Mexico" and it has no dead pixels, for what that's worth. The black level issues with the lcd format seem insignificant in actual use with this model-- it looks great! The matte glass is effective at reducing glare and the black glossy finish is nice in the room, kind of adding to the products "stature" in the room. So the overall quality is great, picture and sound, the remote is good, although I'd like to directly enter the imput as opposed to toggeling through 5 different imputs. This is a minor issue to be sure. Overall, we love it.
