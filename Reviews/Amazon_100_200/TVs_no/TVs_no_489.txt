I love the new TV, the colors pop and I just have basic cable. I reccomend this TV. (BEWARE) I read the reviews on Eagle Shipping how pepole had trouble with them, I thought they were a shipping company somewhere else in the country, I never heard of them. Well I too would pay more for express shipping. I tracked the package and it shipped the next day to the nearest city, but it finially got delivered a week later. Don't get me wrong, Eagle shipping did a good job. The package did'nt have a scratch on it, and they followed up with phone calls. Maybe I was impatent. Great Tv though! Used a wall mount and had it set up in about 20 min. Remote is great too.
