After much research, I decided on purchasing this tv from Amazon.  I still haven't found it at a lower price anywhere, and with the free delivery I couldn't be happier!Overall, this tv offers a striking picture in both HDTV as well as regular broadcasting.  I was a bit concerned after reading some reviews about having a grainy picture, but I haven't had that problem at all.  And the high def pictures are purely amazing.As for the sound, I don't have an external sound system and the audio straight from the tv is just fine (not "tinny" as other have mentioned).  Another thing I was concerned about was that some reviewers mentioned that their custom settings wouldn't remain after they turned their TV off, but in the manual, the first thing it says is that the TV has a "store setting" that will reset the setting to factory...to turn this off simply press the power button and hold it for 3 seconds.  That eliminates that issue!I highly recommend this tv!  Happy shopping!
