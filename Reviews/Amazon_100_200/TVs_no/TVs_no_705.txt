I researched HDTV's for nearly 3 years, decided on a LCD based upon power consumption, screen reflectivity, and I feel LCD is a more viable HD technology.  I decided on this TV based upon being highly rated by Consumer Reports, being recommended online by the electronic gurus, and by the electronic stores.  Needless to say I love it.  I also purchased the 46" Samsung LCD from a local retailer.  This was good because of the 30 day price match, since I've now had the price adjusted 2 times to a savings of nearly $500!I would certainly buy a TV from Amazon again, though if I bought my other TV from Amazon I wouldn't been able to get the price reduction as I did at a local retailer.  The shipping was less than a  week, and was very professional. Make sure you have your cell phone listed within Amazon because Eagle will call you to schedule delivery.  The online tracking wasn't very good because it was delivered when it still was listed online as being in Cincinnati.
