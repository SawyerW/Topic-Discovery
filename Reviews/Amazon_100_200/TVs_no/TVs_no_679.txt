I purchased this TV in December 2007 and have not experienced any of the problems mentioned in recent reviews related to the capacitors in the control board.  My TV was manufactured in Sept 2007.  Perhaps I am fortunate but I also have purchased two additional Samsung HDTVs in recent years and have had no problems.  The main reason I purchased the LNT4061 for my den is due to the non glare screen because I have a large window in the room.  At the time this was the only available model with this feature.  All others had very glossy screens.  Based upon my experiences I recommend this product.
