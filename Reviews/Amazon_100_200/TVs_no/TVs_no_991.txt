Out of the box, this LCD seems nice.  Have the slightest problem, like replacing the remote or looking for documentation, and watch out.  Finding a remote for this set has been virtually impossible.  We now have one remote for on/off and another for channel controls.  Olevia has been contacted and the replacement remote does not function properly.In short, I buy a TV with the expectation that little needs to be done to set it up and run it.  I have spent hours of time keeping this set in a functional mode.This is the last Olevia product that ever enters our house. LT32HVM
