I know we had done consumer report reviews and were excited at the time b/c of the price and LG type plasma at a zenith price.MY D/H had seen these reviews 4 mos. ago and was praying it would not happen to us but it did.THE POP reality happened this am.I will never again buy anything with the zenith name.I thought they stood for quality but no more.Count us in on the class action suit for duping all of us that were surprised by such an inferior product that should have never been on the market in the first place.Cathy Naylor
