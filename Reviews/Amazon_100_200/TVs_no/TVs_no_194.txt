I bought this TV around 2007.Maybe the life expectancy is only 5 years, but I was extremely disappointed that the motherboard went out after 5 years.  And maybe I'm used to the old, name brand TVs that lasted for 15 years, but I'm still disappointed.When it was working, it had a beautiful picture.  I had a home that had the insert in the wall for a TV.  The sound system was so good on this TV that I had to turn the stereo sound off, otherwise it would boom against the walls of the home. (I'd turn it on for football, but otherwise, I didn't want the base bouncing off the walls).I give it a firm 3 stars for picture and sound, but it lost a firm 2 stars for the short time it 'lived'.  Yes, the motherboards can be repaired, but because it weighs so much, I'm not going to invest in the transport requirement to get it fixed.
