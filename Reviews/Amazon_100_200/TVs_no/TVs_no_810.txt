I had this TV set up in my bedroom for about two weeks when I began to get the dreaded audio dropout issue. Until that point my fingers were crossed as everything else about the TV was great. Picture quality, the many features, and even the speakers were great. It is absolutely breathtaking with HD content. As soon as the audio cut out a few times, it was back to the store and not with another Samsung given their horrible record of customer service. It was still within my return period, so I didn't want to hesitate given the similar problems faced by so many others.If you have the patience to deal with Samsung or other places for repairs, then I would say keep it. I personally think that it is ridiculous to need to have a 14 day old, $1000 TV repaired. Too bad, because everything else about the set is great. Maybe I'm being to picky, but when I spend that much money on a television I believe it should be flawless.
