I meandered and debated for a long, long time before biting the bullet and getting a new HD TV. The 32" Samsung LNT3253H has been an excellent choice.The tv is connected to a Dish Network HD box and an OPPO DV-970HD Up-Converting Universal DVD Player. The picture quality from both is excellent.The tv is next to a sliding glass window, and the brightness of the tv is great, the is not problems with glare or anything from the light next to the tv.Tons of connections to and from the stereo, I'm using hdmi connections for the dish and dvd.Very satisfied, shipping and delivery was fast & excellent. The price on amazon when I got it was $300 less than any local, big box store. Great deal & tv, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
