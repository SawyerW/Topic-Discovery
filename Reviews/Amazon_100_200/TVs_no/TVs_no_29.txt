We purchased this TV last year. The quality is great, it has a sleek look and has a great remote.  We had some problems though. After the TV was on for a while, we experienced a loud crackling in the sound, then the sound went off and the TV went to a blue screen. I contacted customer service in CA.  They were GREAT.  They were very responsive and they shipped me out a new TV under the warranty.I would highly recommend this TV.  It has good resolution, a great picture, sleek design and a good price.  Their customer service was top notch and very responsive.  This is a high-end LCD TV.
