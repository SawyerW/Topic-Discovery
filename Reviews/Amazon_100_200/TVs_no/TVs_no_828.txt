The first one I received had sound but no picture. Amazon is sort of picky on defective electronics so I had to sit on hold with Samsungs tech support for a half hour or so so they could tell me it was defective and give me a case # so I could get a new one through Amazon. The 2nd tv works fine. I do see some of the light leakage other reviews mention and the viewing angles arent too great but it looks good for what I use it for. I guess its got better features than the cheaper ones and the faults arent too bad for me so Im happy with it.
