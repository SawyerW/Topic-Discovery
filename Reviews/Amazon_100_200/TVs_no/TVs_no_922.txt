The service was just amazing.I got the tv from amazon, and worried about having just the wife at home when it was delivered. They called and set up delivery in just a few days. Brought it in the living room, set it up where my wife wanted, hooked the wiring, turned it on and set it up to make sure all worked fine and even took away all the garbage! And this was with FREE SHIPPING!The TV so far works great. I love the clean design, the anti glare glass and the fact that you can view the screen from all angles!
