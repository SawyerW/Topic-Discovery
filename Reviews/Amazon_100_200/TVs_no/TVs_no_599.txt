This is my first LCD TV and I could be any happier. I have been looking at LCD from different companies, such as Samsung, Vizio, Sharp and Sony, for over 5 month, and I have been waiting for something like this. Before buying this TV, I'd looked at the reviews at Amazon, Cnet, Circuit City, and Newegg. Most of the reviwes are really positive. The reviews for this TV is even better than most of the more expensive Samsung and Sharp TVs. So, I bought it about 3 weeks ago and I am extremely happy with the quality of the TV. This TV has everything I want, great picture quality, good sound, great connectivity, ... . The price for this TV is also unbeatable at this time. I got for $899 from Circuit City. Amazon also sells it for about the same price, but I like the convenience of being able to return it to department store.
