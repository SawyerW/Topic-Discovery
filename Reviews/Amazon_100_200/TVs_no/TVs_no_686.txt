I bought this TV in early April to update my den to HD and have been very pleased w/ the picture. The colors are fantastic! The delivery was fast and efficient. In fact, the email said it was going to be almost 2 weeks before it was delivered, but I go it in about 3 or 4 days. Setup was easy. No dead pixels. It took a little adjusting to get the picture just right, but it was worth it. Once I got it set up it has been flawless.I had looked around at local stores like Fry's, Conn's and Best Buy, both in-store and online, but Amazon's price just blew the rest away. PLUS I got a free Samsung upconvert DVD player. Killer deal!Pros: Great clear picture, vibrant colors, esay setupCons: Remote is a little more complicated than it needs to be and does not run all the functions of the Samsung DVD player, menu is a little difficult to navigate thru, but nothing to keep anyone from buying this item.
