Looks good with component video progressive scan DVD player.  Blacks are a little off, but not bad.Sound is terrible.  Throw out speakers as soon as you get this TV, they are worthless.  I think that is the reason they made them detachable.  If you try and hook up an satalite speakers threw the audio, they will not work.  An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.  For almost as much as the TV, you can get DirecTVs HD equipment - but that will only make HD shows look better.  All the other channels will still look like a blown up JPEG.
