I bought this about two weeks ago. I have found no problems. Dealing with Amazon.Com was a breeze. Amazing customer service. I am not a techie. I just plugged the thing in and hooked it up via hdmi cable to a samsung upconverting DVD player, and its great. I also connected it to my stereo through the headphone jack (maybe there's a better way, but this works great). In other words, I did a 3-5 minute set up on it. I didnt change anything. I do not watch TV on it, just movies, so i can't comment on tv picture, but movies are great.
