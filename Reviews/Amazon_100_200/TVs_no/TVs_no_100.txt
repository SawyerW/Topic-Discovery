I was so excited to get my first flat screen tv; I have been nothing but dissapointed since then.  What they don't tell you ahead of time is that the quality of the image is only good if you have HD.  I called syntax customer service, and they said it would only get better if I got HD, or digital at the least, so they couldn't help me.  Not only that, but Amazon.com would not accept a return since the TV was 30".  Make sure you research this very thoroughly before you purchase it.  I didn't, and I regret it.  I hope this warning helps those of you with basic cable.
