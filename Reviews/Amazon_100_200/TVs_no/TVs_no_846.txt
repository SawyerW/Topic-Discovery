My first LCD TV.  I've read about and discussed with people what they like or dislike about their brands and sizes.  I bought this 26" Model 2653 after demos of this and about twenty others, for a lower price at another reputable sight.  After four months owning, no problems, no high pitched noises, give 4 out of 5 due to short experience.  I'm wondering if the noise some owners have is a result of wiring outlet (house) wiring faults or mistakes.  Incorrect phase, poor grounding, low voltage transformers from other devices, RF interference can cause buzzing and other noises with sound systems that I had to fix. Great picture quality.
