I read all the reviews before I bought this TV, and they were very helpful.  Thank you to all who wrote about it!  This is why I am writing a review (hopefully this will help someone else make his or her decision)  I bought this TV for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  The sound system in the TV is terrible but knowing this ahead of time we put surround sound on the TV and it is great.  I have to say that this TV is excellent for the money.  I have recommended it to my friends and other family members.
