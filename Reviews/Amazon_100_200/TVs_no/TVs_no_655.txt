For months, I knew I wanted to purchase a new HD flat LCD 40 inch television.  After reading the many positive customer  reviews on the Amazon.com site, I knew it had to be Samsung.  It was a very good choice.  I placed the order on October 8.  Amazon said they shipped it on October 9, and it would be delivered by Eagle USA freight service on October 18.  I received a phone call from Eagle USA that the television would be delivered on October 16.  The driver called that he would be late, but he did arrive at a reasonable time.  He removed my old one, unpacked the new television, installed my new one and hooked it up.  Terrific.  You can't ask for more than that.  The picture is terrific and color is dynamic.  It is as good as everybody said it was, and I am happy with my purchase, including the service by Amazon.com. Also, the price was $200 cheaper with free shipping and no sales tax compared to any local purchase, even though, Amazon.com seem to be increasing the price weekly.  This was a good buy.
