11/4 UPDATE - Received replacement TV.  Works great, wonderful TV.  Only complaint is the length of time that it took Sharp to replace the original one.  I'd buy again, would just buy from a store that accept returns.11/1 UPDATE - Service Center was unable to repair, Sharp authorized a replacement.  Have not yet received.I bought this online (not from Amazon).  Set up and have not been able to use because it doesn't work.  Internet store does not accept TV returns - says covered under manufacturer warranty.  Sharp service reps are nice but am going on a month as they replace the main board, now power and some sort of switch.  Would not pay the extra money for Sharp - in reading boards appears they have a quality control problem.
