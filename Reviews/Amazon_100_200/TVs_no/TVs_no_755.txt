I am very happy with this TV.  I hook up the TV with 2.1 virtual surround sound all in one home theater system that up-converting SD to 1080i HD.  I have set my home theater system to 720p and the picture look great on the TV. I got this TV from Amazon for $999.98 with free white glove shipping, and my HTIB cost only $250. With only around $1,250.00, I got myself a great home theater experience with great sound and great picture. I am happy with my 720p resolutions.  We can only tell the different between 720p and 1080p for TV size 37" and above based on the research I did. For me, I cannot tell the different for this 40" TV on 720p and 1080p from 5 feet distance (sofa to TV), so what's the point to spend more on getting a 1080p TV? I am not willing to spend more for a full 1080p HDTV, blue-ray DVD player, PS3 nor blue-ray discs at this point of writing.  This TV allows me to enjoy my existing DVDs with great picture and sound with a lot less.  I highly recommend Samsung brand LCD HDTV to everyone.
