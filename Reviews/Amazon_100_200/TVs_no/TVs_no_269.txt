I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this set at such a drastically reduced price.  We'd been talking about getting a larger TV for the wall, but weren't ready for the extra costs associated with HDTV through Direct TV.  Then we learned about EDTV and thought we'd give it a whirl - couldn't be more thrilled!  The only problem is that I can't get my husband away from the set!  Buyers should be aware that the remote control is not useful by itself.  There are no numbers on it for channel selection and must be used with another box/remote, in our case satellite TV.  Aside from that, this was a wonderful compromise.
