Great set!I bought this TV a couple three weeks ago and it has done all I expected it to do and then some.  The delivery was great and right on time as I was told.  I needed minor technical support during est up and Samsung's tech support was very good.  Two things to remember are that the picture in picture feature will only display the small picture from an analog source and, to display PC material to make sure your graphic card can display 1920by1080 and it can generate that to the second monitor (the TV).  Other than those two minor things it has been very good at a great price.  My wife is even amazed, this is in our bedroom, if sound is important to you, I would remcommend a basic inexpensive surrond sound system.  I am not a gamer so I cannot tell you how it would perform with X box but I am sure it will look great. My first on line purchase and I have been very pleased.
