Once I got the unit set up--two weeks after it was delivered, the unit proved to be asy to install and set up and provides and amazingingly clear picture.Why my delay in installing the LCD?  The answer is that the package didn't include the remote control and I had to call Samsung and then wait 7-10 business day for the remote to be delivered.  Their customer service was easy to contact and responsive alothought the best they could do was to send the missing remote in their normal fashion.  They could not overnight it.I am now very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone wishing a high quality 32" LCD.  I am also happy that I bought it through Amazon because they compensated me for the missing part in lieu of having me return it at their expense for an exchange or refund. It is this type of excellentSamsung LNS3241D 32" LCD HDTVcustomer service that makes me a loyal Amazon.com customer.
