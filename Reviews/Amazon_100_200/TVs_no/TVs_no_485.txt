I can agree with all of the positive reviews so far but I can also add to some of the cons.  In addition to the fact that the HDMI inputs only accept up to version 1.0, you can't change the picture resolution.  The TV automatically selects the best quality for you, even if you don't agree.  PLEASE don't get me wrong, this HDTV is one of the best out there hands down!  I know I may sound picky but I have to bring out all of the problems that I wish I would have known before I bought it.  That being said, if I did know of these issues I still would buy this TV as it is on of a kind and litterally about 4 inches deep.  The 4000:1 contrast ratio makes the picture seem to pop out at you, and I haven't even got HD yet!  I just wish I knew what picture resolution I was watching.  Other than that this is the best TV for the money!
