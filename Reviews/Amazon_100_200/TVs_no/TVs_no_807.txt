This is the second Samsung 32" LCD TV I have purchased. The first lasted just over 2 years. Then no picture but sound. Out of warranty. Fix was quoted at $400 to $450. TV is headed for the trash. New Samsung TV shows up. There is a loud buzzing sound that comes from the TV. Called Amazon. This TV goes back. I have learned my lesson with Samsung TV's. Check out the discussion forum regarding this TV. There is a rather large post regarding problems with the power supply with this TV. Lesson learned. Check the discussion forums.UPDATE: February 18, 2008. Called Amazon & ordered a Toshiba. I am waiting for delivery and was still putting up with the high pitched whistle. Now the lcd went bad and displays a jumbled picture. Read the discussion forum and avoid this TV. The one good thing is if you do decide to gamble on this set Amazon will take care of you if it does go bad. I am very happy with Amazon and their delivery company Eagle.
