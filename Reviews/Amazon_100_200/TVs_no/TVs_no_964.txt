Westinghouse should stick with refrigerators or whatever they use to make. Spend the extra money on some other company like Sony, I know I wish I did.When it did work, picture was nice and 1080P. The detection system was nice when it worked but you can't choose it yourself. And that's where the problem comes in. It comes with 4 HDMI ports, 2 Component Ports, 1 VGA, and a couple others like the standard Red-Yellow-White hook up.Unfortunatly those 4 HDMI ports worked on and off. I called Westinghouse and their suggestion was to unplug the 42in TV so that it would reset itself. It worked on occassion but this shouldn't be an issue in the first place. Try plugging in more than 1 HDMI cable and the TV gets confused and back to square one with unplugging.Things currently plugged into it:1) Cable2) Component 1 - Wii3) Component 2 - Cable for HD channels4) HDMI 1 - Xbox 3605) HDMI 2 - Upcoverter HD DVD playerI wish Bestbuy offered me their protection plan. I think they knew this would be a dud.
