When I opened the box I was suprised to find such little cushioning.  A toaster I recently bought was packed more securely, and I'd imagine that a toaster is a little less fragile than an LCD TV.Once hooked up and turned on my heart sank.  Right there in the middle of the screen is a pixel stuck on bright red.  I went to Amazon's return section, and arranged an exchange, with the new one comming before I sent the old one back.  (Its nice that Amazon does this.)TV #2 didn't fare much better.  There was that lack of packing material again.  When I turned it on it was even worse.  A bright, neon green pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Both TV's were nothing but static on channel 11, too!Amazon was great about taking both back without shipping charges.  It's a shame about the TV, though, I really liked the overall design.  But dead pixels and static have turned me away from this brand.Hopefully this was just a bad batch.  I'd like to think this is a good TV, and that I just had bad luck.
