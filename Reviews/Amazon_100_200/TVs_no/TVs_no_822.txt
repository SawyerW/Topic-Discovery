I purchased this Samsung HDTV a few weeks ago after the TV in my bedroom broke. I did some research and picked this over a similar Sharp TV because of people's quality concerns with the Sharp. I picked the Samsung of the Sony Brevia because I liked the styling of the Samsung better.Picture quality is excellent, as is the styling. I don't tend to crank the sound in my bedroom but this TV seems to have plenty of volume and the sound quality is good for onboard speakers. The TV has inputs on the side and back which are handy.My only suggestion is that they make the base either adjustable, or just shorter. I need to use the base and if it were a little shorter I would be able to snug the TV closer into the corner of my bedroom.Based on my experience I doubt you'd be disappointed with this TV
