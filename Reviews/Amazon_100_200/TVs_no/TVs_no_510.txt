I recently purchased this HDTV by Samsung as an upgrade from a 26 inch Sharp LCD HDTV for my bedroom.  So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.  I was concerned about shipping based on some of the reviews I read, however there were no problems in this area.  Amazon's shipper contacted me to arrange delivery the day after it arrived in my state.  The TV arrived on time and the driver took it upstairs for me and even helped me set it up on the stand.  I connected the TV to the HDMI input on my cable box, and the picture is excellent on both HD and standard definition stations. I used the antenna outlets to hook to my cable and am able to use PIP to view regular cable stations and digital stations at the same time.  I have not yet connected a PC. but plan to do so. I am really enjoying this set and would reccomend it to anyone in the market for a 32 inch LCD set.
