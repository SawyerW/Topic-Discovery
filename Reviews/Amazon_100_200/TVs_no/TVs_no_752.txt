This TV is just a pleasure to look at.  The screen looks great even in a brightly lit room and shows no glare at all from reflections on-screen.I only have two very minor complaints.  First, the remote isn't great.  It's not very intuitive to use I find, and although it is supposed to work with the Samsung AnyNet DVD player I got with it (DVD-1080P8), it is terrible for that (it doesn't even have a "menu" button for the DVD play menu).  So I just use two remotes instead of one.  Not a big deal.My second complaint is even more minor.  There are many inputs in the back of the set (which is excellent), but if you need to change the input source channel, you often have to scroll through several options to find the correct one.  It would be handy if it could autodetect what is plugged in and what is providing a signal, and skip those channels that are not powered up.Overall, a very good set and it looks GREAT.
