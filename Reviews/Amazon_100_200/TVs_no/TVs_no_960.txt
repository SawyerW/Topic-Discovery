Overall I am happy with the price and quality of the TV. I would like to give it a 5 stars but currently I am having problem with DVD playback.I have the TV for more than 2 weeks now and not until recently I tried to watch DVDs with it. The DVD player is few years old but works perfectly with my previous TV. I connected it using component cables to the TV. The problem is the screen kept flashing and said detect video source. Seems like it lost the DVD video source for a second and then got it again. At the beginning I thought it is the DVD (the one my kids watched) so I tried other DVDs and pretty much all of them have the same problem. I wonder anyone has similar problem with DVD player connected using component cables?I tried to look on the Westinghouse web site but cannot find the tech support phone # to call or be able to submit online question.
