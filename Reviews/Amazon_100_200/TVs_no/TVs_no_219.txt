I had this TV for over 2 years and it served us pretty well for the time (good but not great) then my kids were playing a PS3 game and I heard a crack-like popping noise and walking into the room to see that the screen lost it's color (did not go black). I need to find out how to fix this - if will cost a lot I'll buy another Plasma (but not Zenith).  TV's like this should last longer than 2 years.  I see this is happening to  a lot of Zenith large screen Plasma sets -- so stay away and go with a Panny (Too bad Pioneer stopped making sets).
