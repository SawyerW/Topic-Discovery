My first lcd tv, this has been a great buy. It was highly recommended in Consumer Reports for it's quality and (lack of) price. I do believe it has a QAM tuner because as soon as I connected my non-digital cable, I was picking up hd local channels in 1080i.Speaking of which, you can really notice the difference in HD and SD when watching the local news. It seems like the news anchors and title bars (at bottom of screen) are broadcasted in HD, but some of the "man on the street" broadcast signals are SD. When they switch over there is a definite difference.The only reason I rate this 4 stars is due to a single HDMI input. It'd be nice to have 2 so that when I get a digital set-top box, I could switch between the it and dvd more easily. Granted, I bought a HTIB (Onkyo) that has two HDMI in and one out, but most people can't be expected to do the same.
