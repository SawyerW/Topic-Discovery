The good points of this TV are: 1. being able to buy it through Amazon, 2. good owners manual.Unfortunately the bad points are:1. The picture from DVD is very grainy. It is an extremely poor picture. Please read the latest issue of Consumer Reports: you will find the Auqos ranked near the bottom in every screen size (I wish I had that issue several months ago).2. The power button has to be hit several times to turn the unit on.3. The volume from one of the HDMI connections is very low.4. When contacting Sharp Warranty for points 2&3, they "threatened" numerous times that I would be charged if the tech could not find an issue.  The threat of being charged came up so many times & also very rudely, that it came across this threat was a tactic to avoid warranty work.I suggest your read the latest issue of C.R. before considering this TV.
