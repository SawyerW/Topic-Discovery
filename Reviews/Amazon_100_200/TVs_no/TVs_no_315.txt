I really don't know how a flat screen tv or any tv for that matter could show a better picture.  I am elated with my purchase..the look of the set as well as the picture is superb.  I did a LOT of research before I decided on the Samsung, and needless to say I will be purchasing another one!This model rocks!!!!Well needless to say I spoke to soon.  After only 4 months the darn thing went out on me.  First it started flashing rainbow colors then after a day or two NO picture at all.  I've already been w/o my tv for a week now the service people are telling me that the part is on back order and it will be another two weeks at best before it's in.SO, I have to go approx. 3 weeks w/o a tv and Samsung is essentially saying - sorry, tough luck!!Needles to say I'm PISSED!
