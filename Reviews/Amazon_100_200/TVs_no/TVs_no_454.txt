We liked the styling of this Samsung LCD TV and it has a very handy power buttom on the front so it is easy to turn on and off without the remote.  The picture is good and the remote is easy to use with it's color coded buttons. We had some problems initially with the Auto Volume function but a call to Samsung helped walk us through a "Factory Reset" and that solved the problem.  Now it works perfectly.  The delivery was very impressive because they actually took the TV out of the box and set it up for us.  This is very helpful when it comes to large screen TV's.  We would definitely order another TV through Amazon.
