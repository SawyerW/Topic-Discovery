Till 2 days ago, I would have given this TV a 5/5. The picture is great, the price is fair, and it looks sleek.  To comparible TV's it has a good contrast ratio as well.My only problem with this TV is that it does not support widescreen display from a computer monitor (VGA port).  only 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768.  This means, that if you plug in a computer, you are only going to get a 4:3 picture.  You can switch the tv to display the 4:3 stretched, but that is not great looking.Im going to see if i can find another cable (maybe an HDMI adapter or something?)anyway, as long as you dont need to plug in a computer monitor, this is a really great TV.
