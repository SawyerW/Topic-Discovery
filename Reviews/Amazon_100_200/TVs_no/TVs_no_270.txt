For the price this is a great tv.  The audio from the rear speakers is ok,  but that is the only thing I can say is unsatisfactory.  I have owned this product for several months and am very pleased with it's performance.  The picture with HD signal is awesome!  Also I have a progressive scan DVD player and it looks beautiful.  I've had people comment on how good it looks.  My Brother wanted to know when I got the HD DVD player, he was shocked that it was not an HD player.  You won't be dissapointed with this product or the price.BK
