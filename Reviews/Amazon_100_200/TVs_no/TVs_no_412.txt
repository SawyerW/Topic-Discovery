I bought this tv so that I could upgrade to HD, but I also needed to play my recorded shows from my Replay TV which has a SVIDEDO and composite output. After purchasing the tv and hooking it up to my Replay via the SVIDEO input, the picture quality was poor with far to much pixelation. Tried all the different screen modes to no avail. Returned the tv the same day as I am not ready to retire my replay units. This tv may be fine for HD (which is the picture they have on display in the store), but if you are going to hook up older video equipment to it that outputs SVIDEO or composite video, you will be disapointed with the picture. The pixelation on these inputs becomes annoying whether you are 3 ft away or 6. I had much higher hopes for this tv.
