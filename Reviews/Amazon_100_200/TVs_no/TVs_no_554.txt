This is an excellent tv. Crisp, clear picture especially in high def. Plenty of adjustment features to obtain the picture and sound you prefer. Very easy to set-up and customize. Plenty of input/output ports for most tv viewers. Unbelieveable colors and details. Standard definition broadcasts are also improved. I do not have a high def. dvd player, but since it is a progressive scan player the picture quality is very close to high def. with this tv. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a top of the line tv at a great price. I got mine for $900 with free shipping.
