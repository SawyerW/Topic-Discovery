Bought an LC-37D43U from Sears in June of 2007, impressed by competitive price and picture quality in the display room. First purchase of large flat-screen TV.Brought TV home and set it up, TV worked fine. Used in home environment, not abused or used extensively, half-hour to an hour some evenings, kids cartoons on Saturday morning, also hooked up to DVD player. Not a heavy TV-watching household.Forward eighteen months to January 2009, TV is playing daughter's DVD and goes black, completely inoperative. Take it to Sharp authorized service center, diagnosis is fried Main Board, [...] parts and labor to fix.Called Sharp.usa Aquos Advantage service to see if they would comp the new board, cost $280, I felt main component should have been more robust, eighteen months to failure is pretty short in my opinion.No deal. No sympathy for out-of-warranty problems. Will consider more upscale brand for next purchase, will also consider extended warranty, these electronics are looking pretty fragile.
