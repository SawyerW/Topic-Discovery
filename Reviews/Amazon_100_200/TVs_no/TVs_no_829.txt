Great picture, great features, great price. Very happy with purchase. Hooked it up to a mac mini and an HD cable box so I can get premium channels.If you really enjoy your music from Itunes etc. you'll want to get external speakers. Bought a 3 piece speaker set with woofer from Best Buy for $75 bucks and connected them to the output for speakers and it sounds great.Hi def picture from cable is excellent.My one (small complaint) is that the PIP does not work with two hi def inputs (computer and hi def cable). Didn't find this out till I called Samsung but apparently the PIP tuner works only with analog. Had hopes of watching TV in a PIP box with the computer on but can't do it unless I want it in analog...which I don't. Other than that, great monitor, great price, like the glossy black finish.I would buy it again.
