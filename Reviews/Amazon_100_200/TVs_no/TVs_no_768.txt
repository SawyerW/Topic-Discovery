Did a lot of research before picking this TV. So far I am very pleased with this unit and it is meeting the expectations I had for it. This was the first TV that I have ever bought online. I had some concerns about buying a TV online but Amazon's price was $240 less than any local merchant, including the shipping fee. I've bought more expensive computers online with no problems so I figured there was nothing special about buying a TV the same way. Amazon shipped the unit the next day after I ordered it. They quoted almost 2 weeks for delivery but it arrived in a week in perfect condition.  In summary I'm very pleased with the TV as well as Amazon's service and would not hestitate to order a TV online again.
