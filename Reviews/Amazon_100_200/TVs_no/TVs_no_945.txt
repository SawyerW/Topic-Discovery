I researched for over 3 months before buying a TV.  I settled on this one because of the price, looks and the picture quality.  I now have over 150 hours on it, all of them great.  I would highly recommend this TV for someone who wants a "big" high-quality TV but not for a big price.  The 42" fits perfect in my living room - not too big and not too small from a viewing distance of around 12 feet.  Samsung definitely outdid themselves on this one.  The delivery by Eagle was great -courteous, helped me unpack it and it was two days early!  A++++ for this!  Make sure you research burn-in and how to prevent it - this is NOT a big problem, but it can be if you don't know about it.  DON'T let this stop you from buying this TV, as the percentage of having burn-in is EXTREMELY small if you follow easy steps.  Great TV - everything I expected!
