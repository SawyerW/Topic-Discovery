I loved this television when I got it in Feb 2008 and enjoyed using it until it would not turn on at all, no power.  TV was only 17 months old. Of course the warranty expired after 12 months and Samsung thinks nothing of having one authorized repair shop 100 miles away and charges $80.00 to just look at it. I guess Samsung makes products that don't last.  Even though the warranty expired they could offer an authorized repair facility closer that wouldn't charge just to look at it.  I thought LCD tv's were supposed to last for awhile guess not this one from SAMSUNG.
