I held off for a long time on buying this unit, initially looking at 32" until I saw some in store and noted they weren't much bigger than my 1980's 27" I intended to upgrade. Decided to treat myself and the wife for Christmas and have been very pleased. We mostly record programs with MythTV and watch them via an XBox in the living room (running Linux). My daughter bought me an Aeon Flux box set and it looks great on the set. Haven't yet tried a video game. Only complaint is I can't get quite enough volume via the XBox through the set. Looked at some surround systems to enhance the set but was little put off by the prices. In all a great set. I saw my local Walmart had the Sanyo 37" for just a little less than the Amazon price for the Sharp, and looking at them side by side at a store, there's no comparison, the Sharp picture has much more clarity and contrast.
