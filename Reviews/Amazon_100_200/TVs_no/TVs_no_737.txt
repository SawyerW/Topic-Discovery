I just got it a few weeks ago and its the best deal out there, it was much more in the stores.  The shipping and service was really good as well.  HDTV is amazing, speechless, I didnt expect it to be than much better.  I cant believe I have a home theater for a little over a grand, this would have cost 3k a year and half ago probably.  The sound is fine, one thing is you have to get the good dvd cables for a good picture, they are called component cables, the ordinary composite cables gave a mediocre Dvd pic, now w/ composite its rivals the hdtv pic.  They are cheap too.Its seems as if samsung fixed the sound problem, I got mine AUG 1st and have had no problems.
