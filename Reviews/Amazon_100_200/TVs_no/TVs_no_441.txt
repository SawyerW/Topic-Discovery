I live in a small studio apartment in New York City so anything > 32" was outof the question.  After on and off research over a couple of months I decided to bite the bullet.  The Samsung LNS3241D filled most of the requirements with a reasonable price.So far so good:1. easy to set up2. no dead pixels (yet)3. good picture even with my (still) analog cable box and first generation DVD player.A couple of negatives:1. annoying picture in picture function - with a confusing grid to help you decipher with which combination of sources it will work.  Also it takes too many clicks to get the PIP sound to function.2. sound is not great but I play everything through my standard stereo system which is more than fine.
