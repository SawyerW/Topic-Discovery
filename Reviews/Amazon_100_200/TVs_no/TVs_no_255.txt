This monitor is an exceptional value that delivers an incredible picture through its plasma display.  Please do note-this is a monitor, not a television.  It only works when set-up with your cable television.  Also, living in a 1950's home apparently did not provide the correct "grounding" neccessary for the monitor to function properly and without "hum" or lines (a symtom of electronic interference).  To remedy this, just pick up a Monster Power Cable ($80) at your local Best Buy.  With this Monster Power Cable, your cable television gets routed through the Monster Power unit, and then to your plasma monitor, taking care of any electronic interference caused by improper grounding. I hope this little tip on clearing up the "hum" lines helps someone else because I know that after having the power company and cable company out and still having problems, it sure was a savior.
