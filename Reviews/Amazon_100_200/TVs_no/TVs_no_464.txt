Saw this TV in brick and mortar stores, but for $1,699, which means Amazon had it for $350 less, plus no tax.  But I was very suspect about shipping methods after reading/hearing horror stories about on-line stores--problems with shipping damage, returns, and customer service.  Convinced myself to trust Amazon, and I'm thrilled.  While the vendor never sent shipping info, Amazon's on-line tracking did.  TV arrived UPS without incident BEFORE the date promised on Amazon and on the exact date UPS projected.  Set-up was a breeze, and within 10 minutes I'm watching HD-TV with the most amazing picture.  The savings you'll get from Amazon are well worth the [now unnecessary] anxiety you might feel about on-line ordering with such a large dollar investment.  I'd do it again in an instant.
