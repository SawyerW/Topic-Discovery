I'm so happy that I got this for the super low price.  Although the spec of this TV is not that stunning, the actual picture quality is great.  I enjoy watching SDTV on it, actually it performs much better than my other LCD TV with SD source.  It might be a little bit worse than a HDTV when hooked up with HD source.  But I can barely tell the difference when sitting 12 feet away from the TV.Some cons:No VGA or HDMI input so I can't hook it up with my PC.Monitor only so closed caption is not available (some of my family members need the feature)But I can really not complain more with this price.
