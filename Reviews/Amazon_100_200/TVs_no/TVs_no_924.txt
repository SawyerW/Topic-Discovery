The only thing more amazing than the picture on this set is the price.  I shopped 50 inch sets until I was blue in the face and my wife was screaming for me to pull the trigger.  She thinks I take waaaaaaayyy to long to purchase things.  This Samsung plasma has a stellar rating by reviewers such as myself.  Other brands have no where near the satisfied custsomers.  Anyway, I must admit I wasn't blown away with this thing when I first fired it up.  You MUST spend some time setting up the picture settings to be blown away.  I was able to find many posts on other forums as to the optimal set up.  Now I'm blown away.  The finish on the set is gorgeous.  I'm THRILLED with my purchase.  First purchase like this from Amazon, equally as impressed.The only thing I was scratching my head about was the PIP is limited to a coax, over-the-air type source.  That's weak.  I'll deal with it though.
