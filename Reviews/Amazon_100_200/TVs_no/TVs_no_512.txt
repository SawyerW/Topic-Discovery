I have it for about 9 months now.Everything works fine.Excellent picture.One of the sleekest designs for last year models.Bright colors.Wish it would have cable ready slot being  a cable subscriber.Plus cable makes tvs remote & some of the features completely useless as well as cable box remote becomes  handicapped with some features like chaging the volume by pressing once in a time to raise or lower  bars on volume control versus continuous action. 20 watts of power of onboard speaker system  deffinitely not enough for poor channel signal or in the same room with working a/c.Consider buying home theater system with this tv set.However most of tvs stay within the same range of power in this class.Could have more inputs available if you have a lot of gear to link with.Overall very satisfied with picture quality & style.Deffinitely recommend it!!!
