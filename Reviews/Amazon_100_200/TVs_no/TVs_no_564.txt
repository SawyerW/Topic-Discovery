I bought The Toshiba Regza 42HL167 from amazon for 1265 (no tax and free shipping). The delivery company was excellent and the TV set-up was super easy. This 1080p LCD HDTV is a great value. I researched consumer reports and they gave 5 out of 5 for picture quality and they were right on. I have no complaints about this TV. Best Buy was selling this at $1699 on sale. Amazon is the best price out there when you factor in tax savings plus free shipping. There is no need to spend the extra money for a samsung/Sharp aquos or a Sony Bravia.
