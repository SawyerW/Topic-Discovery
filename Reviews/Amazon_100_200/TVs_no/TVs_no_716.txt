My husband and I are so happy with this purchase!  We could not find a better deal on-line or in a local store.  My husband is very tech savy and checked EVERYWHERE and we got the best deal by hundreds of dollars.  The delivery was phenomenal!  They delivered to our door at the time they promised, and even delivered on Labor Day!  The delivery man helped unpackage the television and had us plug in to make sure it worked correctly, he even took the large box and trash with him to dispose of.  The television itself has been incredible.  I would recommend to ANYONE!
