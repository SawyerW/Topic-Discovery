I bought this TV a year ago and I love it and would get it today if I could.  Picture is as good as plasma if not better.  It is a 4:3 ratio, but you should just ask yourself what you watch more of TV or Movies.  Right now the HD media that is coming out is getting to be everywhere.  5 NFL games on Sunday.  4-5 Xbox games in HD.  HBO in HD, ESPN in HD, Discovery in HD, Prime time TV for the most part in HD.  The picture has so much color and detail it is like night and day.  Like putting black and white up against color and this TV is a great product to showcase that.  Only knock on it is it ways 300 lbs so the stand (which has bevel edges) is recommended on carpet.  With the stand anyone could move it anyplace in the room with ease.  Great Buy!
