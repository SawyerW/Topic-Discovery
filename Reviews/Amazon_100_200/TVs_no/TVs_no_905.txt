The picture quality on this TV is excellent, but I would like to highlight two issues with the sound:1. I have experienced, and others as well have reported, intermittent drops in sound using HDMI.  It will cut in and out and possibly totally out.2. Dolby Digital is not supported over HDMI.  You can work around this with more complex cabling, but it would seem to be if you are going to put 3 HDMI inputs on the TV it should support the most common digital sound format.  You can run component cables and digital audio inputs from all of your input sources, but really, what a pain.  HDMI is designed to simplify and consolidate this.
