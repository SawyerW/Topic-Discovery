This is a short review, but here is the deal. The picture quality of this TV is very nice, and you cannot go wrong with 3 HDMI ports. I am using all of them! One is being used with my DISH HD satellite receiver. Another one is being used with my Phillips Home Theater surround sound system. The final one I use is with my Macbook. I plug in a mini-DVI to DVI adapter (at Apple store for 20 bucks), then a DVI to HDMI cable that I bought at Amazon for about 15 bucks. The TV has great functionality, with many different settings you can adjust to your preference. I suggest you look at CNET.com's review of this TV- it is one of the highest rated HD LCD TV's reviewed. [..] Hope this helps
