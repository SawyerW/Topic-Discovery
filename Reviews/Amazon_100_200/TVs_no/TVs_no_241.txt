My Tv started to have sound problems and I sent off an email to Olevia. No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.Oh, and Good Luck!!!!
