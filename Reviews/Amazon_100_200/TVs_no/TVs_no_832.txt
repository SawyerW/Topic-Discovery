I purchased this TV after buying the 26 inch version. Both TV's have been great although with the smaller version it is not possible to turn off the little chirping sound when the TV goes on and off and the smaller one doesn't have PIP. This TV is extremely easy to set up and use. I only use the basic functions but they both have a lot to choose from. As some of the reviews have stated, the smaller TV does or can have a little strip of light at the top of the screen; I fixed this problem by changing the view size. Overall I have been very happy with these models of Samsung HDTV's.
