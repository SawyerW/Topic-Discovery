TV is ok with an analog cable input.  I didn't expect brilliance with this TV for analog signals.  The biggest disappointment with this TV is how limited the PIP is.  If you are viewing an analog signal on the main display, then the PIP only works with an HDMI input source.  If using the AV1 or S-Video input on main display, PIP only works with digital TV or HDMI input.  If using digital TV on main display, PIP only works with AV1, S-Video or Component input.  PIP only has real choices if the main display is showing something from an HDMI input.  So if you are interested in this TV (and it is really good for digital input), then unless you have an HDMI input source, PIP is a useless feature.Also note that if you are using an analog input (such as cable), then channel changes are very slow.  Most TVs have an almost instantaneous channel change.  Here, it takes about 2 seconds to flip to the next channel.  If you are rapid channel flipper (like I am) than you have to learn to be patient with the TV.
