Purchased the Samsung plasma from Amazon after looking at TVs for almost 6 months. This is a great tv - it's our first flat panel and it definately meets expectations. Colors are beautiful, makes normal TV look good, DVDs stand out, and HD broadcasts are just incredible.Also, the tv has a ton of easy to access inputs - for instance, there's RCA jacks on the size for quickly hooking up an XBOX, VCR, etc. Menus in the sw are good, the tv quickly tells you (when you turn the channel) what the resolution is, if it's digital or analog, etc.  Next step is to see how well this programs into a universal remote.Overall, highly recommended. A plasma for $1k? Yes, you need to be careful with burn-in potential, but the color is so much richer than an LCD ever will be.
