After MUCH comparison shopping in retail stores and online, this 40" Samsung from Amazon was an amazing deal because it was less expensive than the 32" Samsung I almost went with from a retail store, and it offers all the same features.  I'm very pleased with the picture, sound quality, and I really like that it doesn't weigh a ton and that it's easy to move.  This TV also doubles as my computer monitor, which is working out great!  My wireless mouse & keyboard make it possible for me to be far away but still clearly see the screen since it's so large.  I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it!
