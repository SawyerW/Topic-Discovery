I bought my first LT30HV LCD TV in December, 2004.  After about 8 or 9 months I would continually lose the picture.  After several discussions with Customer Service (they had me try various things to correct the problem), they decided to ship me a new TV.  I received it in early October, 2005 & everything was fine - at first.  About 10 months later, the set started going black after it was first turned on & I had to turn it off & then on again.  Over the course of the next couple of months, this problem got progressively worse.  Now, I sometimes have to turn it off & on 10 to 20 times before it will stay on.  So, I have had two sets -- neither of which worked a full year.  Also, I found out that the second set that was sent to me was a refurbished set.  I have spoken with technical support and customer service on many occasions but they refuse to do anything about it because it is "out of warranty".
