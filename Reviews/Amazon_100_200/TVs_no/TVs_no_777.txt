The TV tuner on this thing doesn't work correctly. I called Samsung to ask for help in scanning and saving TV channels to memory.  It will not save any channels from my cable signal.  They say I should use a cable box tuner, or VCR tuner, and bypass the TV tuner.  They have no fix available.  It sounds like a defect to me.Also, changing channels on the TV tuner takes 2.5 seconds to go from channel 2 to channel 3.  That makes surfing the channels impossible, and makes the need for storing your favorites necessary (but storing to memory doesn't work, so I am out of luck).Picture quality is quite good.
