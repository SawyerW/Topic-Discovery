I bought this Plasma TV and it it Great, EXCEPT that I cannot view any JPEG images.  What a hassle I went through buying dirrerent memory cards and PC card adapters only to find out that it will not display standard jpeg images and only specific images straight out of certain cameras. I have an older Minolta Digital Camera and these images do not conform, hog-wash. If you want to change the images in ANY way before showing them, red-eye, color balance, contrast, etc., it will not display them either.I have found the same issue is true for their DVD Recorders as well; no jpegs except from specific cameras.
