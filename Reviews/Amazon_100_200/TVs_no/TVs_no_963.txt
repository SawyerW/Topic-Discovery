Purchased this tv less than 3 years ago.TV will not turn on, no picture.no firmware update available so now i have a 42" paper weight.local repair shop says $600, no diceI can purchase a new board on ebay for over $100 bucks and pray that fixes it.Why is it that my 25 year old sony monster still works fine and this $900, three year old flat panel POS is dead in under 3 years?!After researching online it looks like this is a common problem for this tv, Westing house you SUCK !I am sure they are fully aware of the problem and like every other manufacturerare trying to sewwp this under the rug so they dont have to recall or repair.I will never buy another Westing house product..,. EVER !!!
