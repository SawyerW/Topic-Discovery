This is a great LCD HDTV for the money.Awesome picture when viewing HD but not as good in non HD.  Obviously this LCD TV is built for HD.  The built-in surround sound is good and overall sound quality is good from the TV.The only issue I can see is the contrast on non HD broadcasts.  You have to find an acceptable level of contrast and brightness in order to see blacks and whites without washout.  I tuned my screen for HD so when viewing non HD the contrast isnt as good.I am totally satisfied with the unit.  Now I want a bigger LCD HDTV !
