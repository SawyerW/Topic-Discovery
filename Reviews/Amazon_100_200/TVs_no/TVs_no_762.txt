I originally gave this TV a one star yesterday because of the poor picture quality. I called Samsung Tech support and they told me to try inserting the HDMI cable to another port, as the port it was in is probably defective.When I plugged in the HDMI cable to another port.. boy... the picture just came to life. I guess the other port was defective. Take note that this TV has 3 HDMI ports!The picture is simply amazing! The default picture settings suck, and you have to calibrate everything in order to get the clearest and sharpest pictures. I am now keeping this T.V. I got this for 943.00 on April 3, and now it's up to $1,099! I lucked out!Great TV for a great price!
