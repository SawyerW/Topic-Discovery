Within a year of buying this TV, it started to have problems turning on.  I would click for 4 - 6 minutes and then it might turn on with no sound at all or at full volume (which wakes up everyone in the house).  Sometimes when turned on all you see is a stripe pattern or a "tye-dyed" effect.  Lines of pink squares also appear.  The TV has to be turned on and off several times before it corrects itself and is watchable at all.  It has been highly annoying.We paid quite a bit for this TV and bought it as an anniversary present to each other when my husband got back from serving in Afghanistan and it has been nothing but a headache.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand/model.
