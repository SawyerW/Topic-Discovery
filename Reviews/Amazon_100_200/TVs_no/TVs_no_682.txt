I purchased my Samsung 40" LCD LNT- 4061F in June 2007 for $[...]. Last week I started experiencing issues with the TV recycling itself, turning on and off repeatedly. Now all I see are vertical white lines, "that is when the TV actually stays on!". I called tech support and I was walked thru all the steps necessary to recycle the TV to fix the problem, no such luck! I  I did a little Goggling only to discover many other Samsung owners with the exact same issue. So I called Samsung again explaining that this problem seems to be wide spread and if they were aware of the problem and possibly willing to work with those effected. The answer was no and no. So here I wait for the service company to call me back to schedule my [...] buck look-see. This will be my last Samsung purchase EVER!!!
