The NTSC and ATSC tuner make this little TV. IT's a good replacement for a Sony 13" TV that has graced our bedroom for 15 years. When the local signals are good, the picture bright and sharp.However, when you turn out the lights to watch the TV in the dark, the screen also dims and it's difficult to see shadow details. Add to that, there are no backlights to the on-tv buttons, so it's difficult to find them in the dark when you can't also locate the remote.I don't watch long in the dark, so this wasn't enough of a problem to send the thing back.
