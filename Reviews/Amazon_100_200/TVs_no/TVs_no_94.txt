I've researched prices all over the internet for a 27" LCD and this brand was by far the lowest.  It is very sleek and stylish!  It's got all the connections for your gadgets.  I don't have to list the specs you can read it yourself, but the pixels are bright and crystal clear!  Widescreen movies look fantastic! (you'll need to set your DVD player to progressive scan, 16:9 mode, etc...) The sound is very crisp even through the built-in detachable speakers!  If you want to save $$ and want a great LCD TV so you can show off, I mean enjoy, then get this Olevia today!
