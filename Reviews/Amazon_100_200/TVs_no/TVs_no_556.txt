Definitely would not recommend any Aquos TV to anyone! I had this TV about three weeks before a purple line appeared across the screen out of nowhere. I took it back to the retailer who told me it would take at three weeks for them to diagnosis the problem. They couldn't simply exchange it because of a deal they have with Sharp. So after three weeks they told me they were going to exchange it. So far it has taken another three weeks for Sharp to send another unit. Sharp and hhgregg have had my TV about twice as long as I have.
