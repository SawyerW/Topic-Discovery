While I am extremely happy with the quality of the TV the $100 rebate (one reason for ordering it through Amazon) restrictions did not coincide with typical shipping dates (rebate had to be postmarked *before* I got the tv even though I bought it in the right time frame!). And I *just* received the "product and warranty registration" card returned to me in the mail stating "return to sender, attempted - not known, unable to forward". Now keep in mind that the warranty card came *in the box* pre-addressed to Syntax out in "City of Industry, CA". So I have to try to track this down today to ensure they honor the date of my submission on the 1 year warranty!!!
