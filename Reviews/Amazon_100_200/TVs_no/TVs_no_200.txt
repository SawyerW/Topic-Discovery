The GUY COMPLAINING about "HD-ready" being deceptive IS AN IDIOT...  by his argument, he should give every HD-ready TV a bad review.  In fact... very few TVs out there are HD-Integrated, and almost all you'd see in the store are only HD-ready.  This guy probably complains about a car with an AUTOMATIC transmission not driving by itself.This TV has a great contrast ratio, and great black levels.  MY X-Box looks just plain awesome on it - of course, you need a HD Video Adaptor(component video) for it ($20 for the Microsoft adaptor - don't waste your money on a Monster Adaptor, even the EB sales reps advise against the Monster component adaptor, but I digress.)  No signal delay issues with the X-Box.The only thing is that there's no where to put stuff, and when you look at the specs of the add-on shelving unit, it's much wider than the TV, .....  but I just got a glass/metal shelf to put next to it to put my cable-box, X-Box, DVD player on.
