I waited 8 months for last year's $1699 Sony 36 inch TV to go on close out sale.  It finally did, *but* then I saw the new model.  Better picture - a truely amazing picture.  And, imo, much better styling - not that clunky old dark grey box that most TVs have.  Once my wife and I saw shows on the regular cable (non-digital) signal, we couldn't get over how sharp and clear and bright it is.  Popped in a couple of old VCR tapes, and the difference between the new picture and that on our couple of years old Sony 27 inch, in terms of clarity and brightness, was amazing.Couldn't be happier!
