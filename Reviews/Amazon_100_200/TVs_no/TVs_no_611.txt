We are somewhat surprised and extremely pleased with this TV.  My roommate is a Dish network and Directv installer and updates people with new HD sets every day and he believes our 37HL67 has as good a picture as -any- other of any size or any brand that he has seen!  It was quick and easy to set up and it performs great.  The sound from its small speakers is marginal but nobody in their right mind would fail to connect this great video machine to a quality sound system...which is easy to do and rounds it out nicely.  So far we love it!
