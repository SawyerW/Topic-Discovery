I LOVE this TV!!!!! The setup was so easy it took me 10 minutes from the moment I opened the box. The image quality is amazing and the TV reception for my local HD channels (over the antenna) is just as crisp as my digital cable box... I never thought I could find a reasonable LCD with Plasma quality picture. I have a 55" Hitachi Director Series Plasma in my living room and was looking for a nice small TV with great picture for my Bedroom.Well, I found what I was looking for..  GO FOR IT YOURSELF..  I can only recommend this unit.
