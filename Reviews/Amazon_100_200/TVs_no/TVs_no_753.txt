First off, I will need to connect the TV to my aerial to see how it works with true HD. With my ordinary Comcast box, it looks just fine. Its not blurry or anything like that. Some folks reported a problem with sound, but that was not a problem for me. The manufacturer may have fixed that problem.I had the TV delivered in the Oakland area and the delivery was uncomplicated and arrived a little earlier than I thought it would.The only downside is that "Dirty Jobs" is a lot grosser to watch, because now I can *really* see the poo in detail that I had not enjoyed (cough) before.
