I bought this TV back in 2008. Right out of the box, the HDMI would not work so I took the TV in for repair. The HDMI worked but I have always had issues with the various inputs. For whatever reason, sometimes the TV sees a device and other times it does not. I attempted to install the latest Firmware on the TV and the picture was distorted after I installed the Firmeware. I asked if I could revert back to the first Firmware and you cannot. Samsung gave me the name of an authorized dealer for repair that is 35 minutes from my house. I live in SE so it is not like I live in the sticks. Add to all of the hassle that the TV is no longer under warranty so now I get to pay to get the TV fixed. Hopefully, the dealer does not kill me on the cost. No more Samsung for this consumer.
