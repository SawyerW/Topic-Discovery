I have been looking at HDTV's a lot lately and finally came to the conclusion that I wanted an lcd. I thought that would make things a lot easier but there are so many choices. I started with a Westinginghouse 40" with a built-in dvd player. I didn't think it was too bad so I tried it out for about 25 days through my retailer's 30 day return policy. As I got down to the final days, I began doing some more research and found that the Samsung's were rated fairly high for performance. Wow, what a difference! With the Westinghouse I figured that I was going to have to settle for a so-so analog off-air picture on any lcd but boy, was I wrong. The Samsung LN-S4041D is a fantastic set and I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind paying a little more for a whole lot more! I really struggled with spending that kind of money until I tried the Samsung out and now I am more than satisfied! Great set!
