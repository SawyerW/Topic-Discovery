I looked at all the available Plasma and LCD screens in this size range and the Samsung 42" plasma was the absolute best choice. I also looked at retail stores and they were all at least $500 more expensive that Amazon's prices, for the exact same plasma!!Some people say that LCD is better than plasma etc etc, but for this size I think the samsung plasma is superior to the current LCD technology. So I figured that by the time they make LCD better (and cheaper) I might be ready for a new screen, but until then I'm very happy with this one!And it looks so cool mounted on the wall!!!!
