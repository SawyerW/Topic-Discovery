Chose this TV after months on reading reviews, watching friend's TVs and in-store TVs.  Very happy with the Sharp.  Works great with upconverting and normal DVD.  Also was very pleasantly suprised with the clarity of off-air TV with my 20 year old bunny ears - digital stations are so much better than anything I ever got with my old tube TV and very clear w/ RD and HD signals - and I live 20+ miles from the broadcasts.  No prolems at all. Like many other reviewers, the sound is ok, but am happy I got surround sound system in addition to TV (combo DVD, radio/stereo, surround, mp3 input).  Again very happy - and do not miss or regret 1080p at all!
