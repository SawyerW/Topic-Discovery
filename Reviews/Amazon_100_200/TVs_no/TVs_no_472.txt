It is too bad that we hear so much from the small percentage of people that have had problems and so little from the people who have no complaints. I ordered this from Amazon and received it within a few days in perfect shape. No dead pixels.  This is the best 32 inch LCD you can buy right now especially at this unbelievable price. Is it a perfect TV? No, but it's up there. I only wish there was more than one component out. Other than that, I am completely satisfied. The picture quality is absolutely breathtaking. I couldn't have asked for a better TV at this price or for better service from Amazon.
