I purchased this TV for exclusive use of my Xbox 360.  As other have stated, this DOES accept 1080p thru component input as well as HDMI.  This 1080p thru component inputs is key feature for any Xbox 360 gamer.Image is fantastic, no blurring on super fast action racing games.I connected a small UHF antenna and got great HDTV reception in my area.  As a big fan/owner of Sony and Samsung LCDs  - this TV has excellent ink black blacks and the pureest whites.  The color is as good or better as any other 2007 high end LCD TV when compared at side by side at the store.The adjustments setable per each input - for colors, picture, zoom/stretech options.
