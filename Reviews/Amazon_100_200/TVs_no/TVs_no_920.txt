I have owned this TV for 5 months. Once I owned this one I immediately took notice and compared it to other TVs I saw in stores and at friends. I am not for one moment sorry I picked this model. The set has virtually a 180 degree viewing angle and is as bright as or brighter than LCD TVs. The screen is rated to last 60,000 hours, way more than you will get with an LCD or DLP. The color is amazing. It looks unbelievable mounted on the wall. The Amazon service is as advertised, I had my TV within 5 days, no problems. I will say, if glare is at all an issue, the Panasonic may have this model beat with its screen coating. If it is not an issue, I would get this model.
