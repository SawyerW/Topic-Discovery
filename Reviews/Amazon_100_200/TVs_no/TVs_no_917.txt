Ordered this on July 15th ...received it July 26th.  The total picture is amazing.  I may not know much of the electronic jargon but I did my research for almost a year based on consumer research, cnet, customer reviews, etc. and learned a few things.  Samsung plasma tv's is one of the top 5 manufacturers.  My budget was $2000 (with shippimg and no sales tax)....no greater!  I was also trying to save up for some money to get it for my husband since he's been wanting it forever....and also waiting until the pricing decreased to my budget.  This is  definitely a great investment!  Go order one or two, you won't be sorry!
