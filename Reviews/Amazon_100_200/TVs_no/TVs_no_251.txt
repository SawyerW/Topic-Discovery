Ok, when I ordered this television, I did so knowing that it wouldn't arrive before Christmas.  Expecting it the second week in January--according to the information on the order page, I was really shocked that I got the tv yesterday--3 days before Christmas.  The delivery person was great, unpacked the TV, offerred to take the packaging with him, was very neat and courteous.  The picture is Great, and yes, as other reviews stated, the built-in speaker system is lacking compared to what we're used to, but I have several surround sound systems and knew that wasn't a problem, but even without the surround sound, when I watched a DVD, I felt the sound was adequate.  I am VERY, VERY pleased!
