I bought this TV a while ago (as in over a year) and I am very embarrassed to admit it's taken me this long to look up the problem.  While it's a wonderful tv if you can't hear the whistling coming from the it (which is why I gave this tv two stars instead of one), the whistling is enough to make me say it was DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE.It's fantastic to watch for the first 20 minutes to a half hour, but then the high-pitched whistling becomes unbearable until you shut the tv off.  You can hear it from other rooms too, in my house anyway, so walking away won't help either.I'm grateful to others who have posted their problem on here because I will be calling Samsung as soon as I post this review to *hopefully* get it repaired free of charge because of the defect.
