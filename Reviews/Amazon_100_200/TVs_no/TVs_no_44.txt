This is my first large screen TV purchase and I must say it was a great choice. For the money it is amazing what this TV offers especially considering the 51" screen. Today's flat panels in that size are just too expensive and from the testing I did you can't see a difference between flat panels and this when in HD. Maybe once the 1080p stuff takes off but not as of today. The TV was easy to set up, it has small built in rollers and is easy to move around and the instruction booklet was actually easy to follow. I have a HDDVR, DVD player and VCR hooked up to it and have to say the picture quality is excellent especially with the big action DVD's. I would also say that the regular cable, non-HD view on this TV is better than any flat panel out there. If you can get this TV for less than $1000 I would say it's a must if you have the room.
