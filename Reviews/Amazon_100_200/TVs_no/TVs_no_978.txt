We purchased our TV on 2/22/08 and today is 4/6/09. The picture went out and we were only getting sound. When I called the customer service number and spoke to the representative they first told me to unplug the tv for about two minutes and turn back on then he had me press the menu button on the remote. It didn't work of course. "Sounds like a panel issue" per the rep. I asked how long the tv's last and he said about 5 years. I was shocked, I have had TV's for 15 plus years. No care at all about the tv only being a little over a year.
