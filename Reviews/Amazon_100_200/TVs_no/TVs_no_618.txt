This is my first HDTV purchase.  After days of research on-line I decided to go with the Toshiba 37HL67. I couldn't be more pleased!  Right out of the box, it has an awesome picture. (I did have to tone down the brightness a little.) The colors look fantastic and the Black is very good. The tuner is amazing, even with an old "rabbit ears" antenna it managed to pick up most HD channels. I have a new Philips amplified HDTV antenna on the way. I really like the "favorites" channel surfing capabilities and the sound from the set is awesome!  A fantastic HDTV!
