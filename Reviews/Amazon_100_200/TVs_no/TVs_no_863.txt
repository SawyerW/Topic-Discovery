All I can say is this is one incredibly great looking tv. Until you turn it on. Awful reception (on cable). Even tho it advertises a wall mount with it... no such thing. Unless it's very well hidden. Unless they meant the instructions for a wall mount. Got those.So outside of no wall mount and very snowy reception, it's great. Um... huh? I gave it the one star because it looks good when it's turned off.I guess I should point out that I pretty much detest the wide screen format anyway. I rarely watch dvd's so staring at tv shows with the people all stretched out and distorted doesn't really work for me. Yes, you can adjust it for standard screen, but then you've just paid a fortune for, in this case, a 26" tv and you get to watch a 18" tv. Wheeee!  Nope, not for me.
