The 4061F works perfectly in our house and the picture is stunning.  I would have preferred the 4065's higher contrast ratio and 10bit video processor but couldn't live with the shiny screen.  To my eye any gains from a higher contrast ratio and more powerful video processor were wiped out by the annoying reflections in the shiny screen.  I couldn't be happier with the TV.Now for the negatives.  The free "white gloves delivery service" was a cruel joke.  The TV finally arrived after a 3 week litany of bungled orders, lost shipments, 2 wasted days waiting for deliveries that didn't come, hours on the phone attempting to contact customer service and culminated with two clowns tracking heavy grease from one end of my house to the other.  Essentially Amazon didn't know what they had shipped and the carrier certainly didn't know where it was.  The experience was so bad I will never order from Amazon again unless the item is shipped by UPS.  Lost work days, aggravation and carpet cleaning make the "free" delivery very expensive.
