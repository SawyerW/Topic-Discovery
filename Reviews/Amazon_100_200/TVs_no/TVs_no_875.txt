I bought one a week ago.Delighted with if in all particulars except when using analog sources and input cables the picture is excessively grainey, and as someone else mentioned, my Satellite DirecTV/TIVO remote has no code to control power and volume.I just bought a DVD Recorder with an HDMI upconvert feature, and patched my DirecTV signal thru it, so I could use HDMI from the recorder to the TV.  Terriffic improvement in video quality, but now Closed Captioning has stopped working.  Why would a manufacturer make a TV with HDMI quality and Closed Captioning, but not make them work together?It's a puzzlement!. . . I leave CC on so I can have the TV on late without disturbing my neighbors, and to understand the dialog on BBCAmerica thru the occasional thick accents.  Now I have to switch back to analog whenever I need it, and the image suffers greatly.
