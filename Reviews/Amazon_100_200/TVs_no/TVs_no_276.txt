Have read all the reviews on avs forum and amazon about the buzz problem on this set, I still decided that I was gonna take the odds. It has been 3 months since the problem was first reported and I thought Samsung should have come aware of it and fixed the problem.  Well, SO I THOUGHT. There is NO luck on my part! The set buzzes out of the box. You can hear the buzz sound over 10 ft away when there is no dialog or you put the TV on mute. The set was manufatured Nov in Mexico so even the latest ones have this problem! Mine is on its way back.
