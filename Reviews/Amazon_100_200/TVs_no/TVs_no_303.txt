I purchased version HP-S5033 from Sam's club. It looked like a nice TV with sleek design and the necssary PC connections that I was looking for.I connected the power and the cable. The images were really nice. We thought we did the right choice. My family watched the TV for less than 2 hours... And then we heard a "click" sound after which the screen turned into something worse than the dual passive laptop displays of 10 years ago. For those of you who don't know what they are, you really have to get closer to the screen to be able to see. We called Samsung and they weren't sure what happened. They told us that if someone does not contact in the next 5 days, we should give them another call. This is obviously not acceptable: I am buying a brand new TV which cost thousands of dollars and yet I will be was told to wait for some repair service within a week. I had to return the TV to Sam's club the next day. This is the end of the story. Draw your own conclusions. Good luck.Haldun Unalmis
