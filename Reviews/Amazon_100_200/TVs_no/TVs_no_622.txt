I have been very satisfied with this HDTV. I knew when I bought it what I really wanted was at least 46" and 1080P-- but this model saved me a LOT of money and also domestic tranquility (there are things more important than TV). So, the way I look at this purchase is that it is my starter HDTV and in 3-5 years I'll sell it and for what I paid for this set get the set of my dreams. In the meantime I am very happy. My wife enjoys it too, all the more that it does not overwhelm the living room-- she hasn't admitted it, but I think she likes the way it looks.Having had it for a month now, I am convinced that there would be little point in getting any 42" set with 1080P, at least if you sit back 12 or more feet as we do. I appreciate the quality of non-HD content, and of course the HD is stunning. The PC connection is welcome and the output at 1024 x 768 from our laptop is amazingly good. This set also has all the connection options we needed.Highly recommended.
