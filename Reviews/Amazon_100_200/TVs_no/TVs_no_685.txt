I have had this TV for about 8 months now and could not be happier.  When I started looking around I wanted the best quality for the least amount of money.  I looked at several stores (best buy, circuit city, etc) and not one could even come close to the awesome price that amazon has, not to mention the free shipping!  At the time of purchase I paid $400 less on amazon than I would have in the store.  The only complaint I have is the volume when watching HD vs non HD channels.  It seems that I have to turn the volume up pretty high to get the same sound quality.  The picture quality and color is the best.  I can't wait to get the blu-ray home theater to go with it!
