I bought this television because I refused to buy a PS3 and play it on a regular 480i tv.  That being said, I primarily use the set for movies (DVD & Blu-Ray) and of course PS3 games.  The picture quality is definitely comprable to that of other higher priced sets.  I know this because my roomate has a 32 inch Samsung with a PS3 hooked up and when you look at either one of the two, there is no difference in picture quality. Not as far as we can tell anyway.  The sound is decent, but then again if you are buying any television with the sole purpose of having good sound, you are making a horrible move.  Overall, this set gives the most bang for the least buck.
