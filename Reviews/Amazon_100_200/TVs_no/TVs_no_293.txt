This WAS a great TV. Awesome picture and didn't have any problems until about 6 months ago.  Started to have either the bottom half or the top half cut in and out.  With some research I knew I would have to replace the Y boards soon.  Not a huge deal right?  Well just the other week the whole thing died.  No video at all.  I took it down from the stand and what do I see? Without even opening the back cover I can see everything is melted inside.  Disappointing to say the least considering how much was spent on this TV less than 5 years ago.It will cost less to get a new Plasma then to fix this one.
