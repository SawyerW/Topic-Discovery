This is my 2nd tv, after a 20 inch 90's GE CRT TV. I tought i was just buying a generic lcd tv, but nooo this exceed my expextation on sound quality and picture quality. to the guy that give this TV a bad rating, try something called digital cable or even dish! DVD picture is amazing and Playstation 2 games becomes more real. The only downside of this tv probably the design.. hmm what can i say some silver or metalic color will probably makes this tv better looking rather than just plain black. Anyway for 500 bucks after lining up all nite in front of Circuit city on black friday, i think this TV is well off worth my time and money.
