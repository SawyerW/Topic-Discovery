Im sure the other guys were impressed with this unit .Im not.If you can manage to get the picture bright enough be prepared to hear a nice loud humming sound!!Ive used it with all connections tried.Even with the 17 pin connect to my comp it was dissapointing and the sound from any white background is disgraceful!Forget about burn in as well.Its going to happen..Youd better spend the extra money and not cheap out as I did..I kept Myself to spending under 10 thousand bucks to redo my room ,this is just for electronics.I use it for my bedroom cause of lack o space.My SONY bigscreen is best pic Ive seen so far.Ill save my cash and get a sony plasma next..Oh and the heat is insane,No one mantioned this so I doubt if they truly even bought one.I wish I wasnt first to get this TV no reviews were out back then...
