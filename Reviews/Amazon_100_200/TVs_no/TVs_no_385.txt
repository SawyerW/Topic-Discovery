I have been looking at 40" LCD HDTV's for 2 months now and decided on this set. After pricing it at many retail stores and online retailers Amazon beat everyone by $500, no tax and free 3-5 day shipping. I received the TV 3 days after I ordered. The TV is light and took about 15 minutes to set-up. The only thing I am not crazy about is the base does not swivel. I plan on wall mounting so it's not an issue, but the base does feel cheap. Sound is great even without a surround system.I have Time Warner HD service as well as an air HD aentenna from Radio Shack. I can not believe the image and coor quality of this set for under 2k. It is simply amazing. Unfortunately it has ruined any non-hd broadcast. The difference between HD and non-HD is unbearable. DVD's even look poor compared to HD broadcasts, I'll definately be buying a HD-DVD player as soon as I can get one.Bottom line, this is the best deal for the size and quality, I am blown away!
