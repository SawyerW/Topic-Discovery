Its been a good 5 years, no issues except the crappy sound (but i have surround sound) I'm gunna miss ya AMBILIGHT - old friend  Jan 2007 - Feb 2012Original post:I'm totally obessed with ambilight. i love it.had the tv for almost 2 months now...dont know about the overheating thing people talk about.baseball games with ambilight is so nice..the green field goes all behind the tv......1 major fault is the SOUND. It is really bad. Really bad. Your going to need surround sound. I play dvds on my PS2 and i have to bring the sound up to around 95 out of 100.
