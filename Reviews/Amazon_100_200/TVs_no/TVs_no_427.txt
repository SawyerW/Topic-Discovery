I am very happy with this purchase.  Granted no warranty but I checked with about 10 online stores and some brick-n-mortar stores and found Amazon to carry the best price.The only reason I took away a star was because the TV's menu when the channel is changed is so tiny on the top left corner that I have to squint to find out what channel I just punched in Or if I am looking to find out what channel I am on, I have to be very close up to the TV.  This is not nice.Other than that minor detail, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.
