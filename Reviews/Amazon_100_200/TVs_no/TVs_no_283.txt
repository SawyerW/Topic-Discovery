I gotta tell you, I was a little hesitant about purchasing a plasma tv from an online merchant.  To put everybody at ease, Amazon was awesome.  Aside from the fact that the original price I paid was $2079, which has dropped over $250 (Amazon gladly refunded me the difference), the shipping was quick.  I will use Amazon again, and will strongly recomed them.As far as my Plasma TV, it's hands down beautiful.  The picture is fantastic.  No buzzing, thank God.  This was a huge concern of mine.  I have Comcast HD cable hooked up via HDMI, and my Samsung upconvert DVD via the other HDMI.  I gotta tell you they look fantastic.  I realize that the Panasonic overall has better reviews.  One of my closest friends owns that brand, and honestly prefers mine.  It just looks a lot more classy.Hands down, Great TV, Great Price, Great service!
