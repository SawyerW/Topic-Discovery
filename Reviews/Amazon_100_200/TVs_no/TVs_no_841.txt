This item was purchased two Christmas' ago for use in a bedroom.  The TV is not on all day, and maybe an hour or two in the evening.  Three weeks after the warranty ran out, the TV just died.  Was working one minute and the next ...... nothing!I called Samsung as per the directions in the manual and they told me to go to Best Buy to have it looked at and repaired.  They stated it was off warranty and I would have to pay.Took the TV to Best Buy Repair and was told it would be much cheaper to buy new.  (somehow I KNEW that would happen)It would seem to me, that an item which at the time was much more costly than it is now should last more than 2 years.  The workmanship of these electronic "toys" have been terrible and while I will replace this TV eventually, I dragged back in from the garage an old "chubby" tv that is 12 years old and works perfectly.Now I understand why the stores are pushing extended warranties.  Nothing lasts longer than 2 years!!
