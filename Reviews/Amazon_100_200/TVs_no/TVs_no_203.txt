I have it for 2 weeks now, and love it from the day one. The picture is very good right out of the box the HD is simply incredible (I have dish HD package + locals...) For the standard definition you will need a little tweaking to make it look good (just look around on the avsforum.com) For the absolutely best picture you will probably need professional to do the final tuning on each input. The pedestal is OK for me, I still find a place behind TV for a small AV rack. The only slight disappointments for me are the shiny speaker panels on each side, they sometimes reflect to much light in a not so dark room. Overall I think it's one the finest TVs around, and probably is the best for the price
