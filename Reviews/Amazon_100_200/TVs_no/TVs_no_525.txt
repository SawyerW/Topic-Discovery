I had this LCD for about 4 week. The lcd has great picture quality sound is ok...I went LCD cause they save on space but like all LCD's black will never be black but get close and 8ms may be "blazing fast" to some, but not me I see blurring from the responce time while watch normal tv/dvd and gaming ...Which lead me to believe there is not lcd out that dont have this problem. Which is the only down side to the LCD great picture but ghosting is bad imoI seeing ghosing in 60 DLP sony but it no were as bad as this
