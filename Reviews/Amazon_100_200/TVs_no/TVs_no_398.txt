The picture is amazing and the price is even more amazing. The difference between the standard channels and HD channels is night and day. Too bad Time Warner only has 7 HD channels in my area. I was a little worried about the shipping, because I live 45 minutes from a major city with an Eagle office, but I got the TV in 5 days. They called me the day before and gave me a 2 hour delivery window. They even helped set up it. I'm not sure what you would do if your TV arrives with a problem, because the delivery person told me that even if it was broken, they couldn't take it back and I would have to contact Amazon.The only feature that I dislike is the number of component video inputs. My XBox 360, Wii, and cable box all use component, but the TV only comes with one component input. So unless you want to be reaching around the TV every time you want to switch devices, you will need a but a component switch (I found one for $20 at Walmart).
