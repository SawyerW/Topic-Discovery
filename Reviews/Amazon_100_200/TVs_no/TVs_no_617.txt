I think that the other reviewers have said it all...We wanted a 37" flat screen TV which would fit into the space recently vacated by our old "friend" of many years -- a Panasonic 27" CRT based television. The Toshiba filled the bill and, thus far, has been delivering beautiful performance. There may be more advanced TV's out there but I -- and most others -- would probably not be able to detect the difference.I would have liked to buy an American made TV but NAFTA has sent all of those manufacturing sites -- along with their accompanying jobs -- out of the country. The Toshiba will have to do until, someday, this nation gets back on its feet.
