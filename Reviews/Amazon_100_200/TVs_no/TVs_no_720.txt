I bought mine for $899 during the pre-Christmas sales at Best Buy - can't beat that price. The TV takes a little longer to start up (15-20 sec) than I  would like, but once it's going, it has a beautiful picture. Have my Toshiba HD-DVD, HD cable, and my Xbox360 hooked up to it, and the picture quality is AMAZING. It's in a room with windows to the left of the TV, but the picture still looks vibrant and there is little to no reflection off the screen. You  would do well to buy a calibration DVD to work on the contrast, brightness, etc., but overall, it's a great piece of electronics for a great price. Until cable/satellite starts broadcasting in 1080p, there is little incentive to upgrade. If you don't need to hang it on a wall, this TV is the way to go.
