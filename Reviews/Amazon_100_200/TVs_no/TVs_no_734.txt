After reading several of the reviews from other people, I know that I am not the only person whose TV sound got cut off.  At first I thought it was my Comcast cable box's problem but later found out it was the TV.  This has happened to me about 3 to 4 times for the past two weeks.  Going to call Samsung to figure out who is wrong with it.Other than that, this TV looks amazing.  The picture quality is superb, specially when watching Discovery or other HD channels.The design is cyber-looking but the glossy outshell is easy to show dust.After all I am happy with it.
