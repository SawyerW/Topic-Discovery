I shopped around a long time before purchasing this TV and I am glad I did. I went through all the discount stores trying to find the best price for a decent quality HDTV. This one had all the features I wanted and the price was very reasonable considering the picture quality is flawless. I was limited in the size television I could fit into the space it was intended for and was skeptical that the 26 inch would appear small. It does not. If you are looking for a good quality television on a budget do not skimp and go with a lesser brand or contrast ratio. Sure you can get a bargain but you will be missing out on a great viewing experience. The colors pop off the screen, fantastic.
