I've had this TV for a little over a year now, so I've had plenty of time to formulate an opinion.-Pros-*Great Picture in any mode. I have a PS3 and watch Blu-Ray movies and they look incredible!*2 HDMI inputs*Big bang for your buck.*Its been over a year and haven't had any technical issues.-Cons-*Unimpressive sound quality.  It isn't bad until you start turning it up pretty loud.  I like movies rather loud, so thats where I had my issues with the sound.*Doesn't save your audio settings when you change your audio output from internal to external, so every time you turn your tv on and want to use your home theatre for cable/sattelite sound you have to reselect that option on the menu.-Summary-A very good picture with over a year of trouble free viewing.  The cons are really minimal when you factor in everything you get for the price.  I would highly recommend this TV to everyone.
