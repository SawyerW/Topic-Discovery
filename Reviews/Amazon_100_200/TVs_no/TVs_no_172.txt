Had this monitor for 3 months now.  Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor.  Great for xbox using progressive component.  For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video.  Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt.  Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720).  As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back.  I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal.  Overall I like the monitor and for under $1000 it is probably one of the best buys out there for a 27 inch monitor/tv.
