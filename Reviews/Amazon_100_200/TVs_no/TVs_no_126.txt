I bought this item site unseen and was completely surprised as to the quality at such a low cost. The ease of use and the quality of the sound and picture is staggering. I only wish I had bought a larger version. With what they say about the side to side problems in LCD tv's this one shows none of the degridation discribed in reviews of most of them. The sound is crisp and the tones, which are adjustable, are superb for the size of the speaker units that are detatchable. I highly recomend this tv. If you have the money go for the largest one you can afford in this brand, you will not be disapointed.
