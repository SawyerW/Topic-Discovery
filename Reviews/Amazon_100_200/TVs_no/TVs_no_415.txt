I have had this TV for about 3 months in my bedroom and I have it hooked to a Pioneer DV-490V-S Progressive Scan DVD Player with HDMI. Also have a standard sat. tuner through the cable input. The HDMI connection from the DVD player is excellent and the standard cable picture is also great through it pales in comparison to the 1080i from DVD player. Let the DVD player handle the resolution for the best performance, but this is a great pairing.I have also hooked up my laptop on occasion with a wireless keyboarad and mouse and get excellent browsing from my bed.All in all, I am very satisfied with the purchase.
