I agree with the previous comment. I got mine deleiverd over the weekend.  Although it does look good, There is plastic all over the TV.  The setup was a  breeze but the audio started to drop every now and then. I guess the new lot of these TV's are not as good as one made earlier.  One more thing guys,  stay away from these Eagle shipper.  Here in NJ area, they say 'White glove' but all they do is, drop the TV on your doorstop and they refused to open or take away the empty box.  seriously.  Eagle USA might be good at other places but they sure suck in the Central NJ area.  Thank you
