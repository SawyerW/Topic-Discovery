QAM tuner picks up all my HD local channels, plus INHD and TNTHD from my local comcast market. I work at CC, so I got to know the TV really well from how it looked at work. Once I took it home, it looked 10x better once I was done with my calibration DVD. I sit about 10.5 back, so analogue doesn't look bad at all. I must say, this set does analogue stuff fairly well. Local HD stuff looks phenomenal. I don't even like NASCAR, but FOX HD made me feel like I was right there. No uneven backlight issues,no blobs or anything else. Mine came out of the box looking great. For this price, I advise you give this TV a look. Once I hooked it up to a Blu Ray player, it looked GREAT. I highly encourage this TV for small living spaces like mine. My room is probably 12x12, so it looks perfect.
