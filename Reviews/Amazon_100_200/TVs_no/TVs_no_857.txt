Excellent HD quality.  Great looking set - I thought I would have preferred a matte finish, but the gloss is really sharp.  Pretty good sound, but I'll upgrade.  No noise problems.  If you have your direcTv receiver autoselect (native mode) the picture based on the input signal, you won't feel the need to toggle between zoom options.  Might have gone for the 32 inch if I had it to do over, but this is a great set for a smaller room, and a great value.  The set is light weight.  Set up and menu navigation is easy.  You can turn off features such as the set's blue standby light and the start up tune once the novelty wears off.  I'm very pleased.
