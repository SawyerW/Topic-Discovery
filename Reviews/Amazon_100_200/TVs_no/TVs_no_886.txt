We bought this TV for use with our PS3 in the loft and it is awesome.  Yes, the difference between this 32" 1080p and our 32" 760 is very evident and well worth the money.  It's an outstanding TV all around and the most affordable 1080 set that I could find.  I'm selling the 42" 760 set in our bedroom and replacing that one with an Aquos 42" 1080p set.  It is worth the extra money.  Set up is a breeze with this TV too; our other ones require you to change settings for different devices/resolution but this one detected the PS3 with a Blu Ray movie and automatically adjusted to 1080 ... I'm smiling with this purchase!!!
