After searching around, Amazon had one of the best prices around for this TV.  Best Buy, CC, and Tweeter couldn't match it and didn't want to deal.  Initial concerns were around the shipping not displaying as freight forward vs UPS as my preference would have been UPS which based on weight of 32 lbs, one would expect using that vendor.  Amazon had a lenghtly shipping timeframe which caused great concern as to timing and how delivery might work which wasn't notified until post sale.  So far so good and it appears Eagle Freight has done a great job getting the product out even around the holidays even prior to Amazon's initial delivery time period.  I've heard horror stories from other people on freight forwarding.  Dispite having to be around an entire day waiting for delivery, Eagle appears very reputable and so far an excellent freight forward company.  Packages are easily tracked just like Fedex/UPS.  No issues.  Price savings of $200 plus free mount well worth it.  Sony and Samsung are top LCD models.
