I have nothing but good things to say about my TV purchase. Approximately a month ago I purchased the Samsung LNS4051D 40" inch TV at very low price. ie, compared to the local electronic stores.  The TV shows an awesome picture as was advertised. The TV was delivered free to my apartment earlier than expected. The delivery people brought the TV into my apartment and unboxed it. The instructions to set up the TV were not the best but okay.  Within 15 minutes I was watching beatiful HD programs on my Samsung TV. (Note I already had HD service from my cable company).  By the way, the Amazon salespeople were helpful, knowledgeable and courteous.  At first I was reluctant about purchasing the TV over the internet.  However they made they made me feel at ease.There is so much more good things that I could say about my purchase but I have to go.  I leave by saying, there is no doubt in my mine that I made a Great Buy.  I am thorouly satisfied with my purchase.
