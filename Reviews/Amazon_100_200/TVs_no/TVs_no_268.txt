We received the TV with some delay (Shipped during the week before Christmas)but it arrive exactly on the date the carrier had estimated. We had read the reviews posted by others who had purchased this same item, so we did not expect great sound (10 watts). It turns out that in our small area, the sound was just right. The main difference you will notice is that the sound is mono not stereo, but the picture quality is AWESOME! The TV menu give you several choices for picture quality (Dynamic, News and Movie), as well as choices for widescreen, full screen, etc.As long as you are not trying to fill in a large area with sound, the tv alone, if you can ajust to the mono sound, or the tv combined with a not-so-expensive home theatre/surround sound will give you a high quality super plasma tv experience at a fraction of the cost.
