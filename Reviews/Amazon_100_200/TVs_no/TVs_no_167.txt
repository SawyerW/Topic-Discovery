The LCD was delivered last night. And I tried it. Everything works as expected. Picture quality is good but not excellent andis reasonable for its price.I seemed to have a really poor IR receiver module in the LCD. The remote has to be within 5' and straight in from of the sensor; otherwise, it just won't work. It is funny that my old NEC TV has a few remote keys that maps to this Syntax remote control. And, my old NEC TV, though farther and almost at 90 degree angle from the remote, kept turning on and off while the syntax LCD was ignoring the keys. I called Syntax Tech support, and he told me that the IR module is probably defective. They will send a new one to me and send some technician over to replace it. Hopefully it will work fine after that. Will follow up with this post.To Tak Leung, who had previous post about the TV turning itselfoff after an hour or so, while browsing the setups, I saw sleep control where the TV would turn it self OFF after the timer expires. So, check and make sure to turn that SLEEP MODE off.
