So far this has been a great television. I would highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have or doesn't want to spend the money on an expensive 1080p t.v. I can't tell the difference between the two.So far I have been VERY satisfied with my purchase, I highly recommend the TV for anyone shopping for a plasma in the $2000 price range. Only negative thing I could say right now, is the anti-reflective coating on the screen could be much better. I suppose it does reduce some reflections, but I've still seen some glare. Otherwise a really fabulous set with great features and incredible picture quality.
