I had been looking at upgrading my pc monitor and went down the path of LCD TVs to fill a combo role.  Many reviewers said that the PC and console games looked fantastic,  HD TV was good over the air.That and I have purchased from Amazon before so I pulled the trigger.Primary use is PC/console 90% watching TV 10%.Screen is nice and bright and I have been very happy with this TV.I am currently using the PC in from my computer and an OTA HT atennea and both images are crisp.I did buy this for the 'gaming mode' function.  That works fine for the console which I think by nature is darker - but for the PC no way.Mike
