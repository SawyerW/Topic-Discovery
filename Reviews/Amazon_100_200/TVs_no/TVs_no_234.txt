In response to all the reviews about how HDTVs:Many people complain that they spend a lot of money on HDTVs and the only good channels are the HD channels. This is true, BUT keep in the following in mind:The FCC has a new regulation coming into play in the next few years that all channels will be in HD. I repeat, ALL channels will be in HDTV. So if your old TV dies now, your best bet it to probably get an HDTV because as the new regulation goes into place, you'll need to buy an HD converter for your non-HDTV which doesn't make sense. Hopefully your old TV can last a few more years though until prices decrease. Hope this helps.
