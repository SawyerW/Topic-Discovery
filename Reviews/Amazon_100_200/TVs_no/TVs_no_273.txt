This TV has several nice improvements over last year's model (I have one of each).  The menu's are nicer and easier to navigate.  The controls for volume and channel are now on the lower right which makes them easy to reach for a wall mount.The mounting bracket is now centered like most flat panels.  There are 2 component video inputs now that can be used for HD or SD signals.  The picture and sound quality are quite good also.The only complaint I have is that the native resolution is not 1280x720.  The upconverting to 1366x768 cause some quality loss which is impossible to avoid on flat panels.  You can run the video at 1:1 sampling but then you get the black border and a 30" tv for the price of a 32".  The loss of quality is rarely noticable and is never obvious.  I forgot about this issue very quickly.  I've had this TV in my garage for a month and so far the humidity has not been a problem.
