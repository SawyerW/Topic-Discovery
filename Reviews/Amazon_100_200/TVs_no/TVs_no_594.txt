After living with an old 1980's CRT tv for about 5 years, I finally took the plunge and bought my first ever flatscreen, the Toshiba 42HL167.  I received this about 2 hours ago and let me tell you, it's great looking at a black screen!!  After reading many reviews about the greatness of this set, it looks like I got a lemon.  The tv will not come out of standby mode and I can't get it to turn on to save my life.  I know that this tv ranks pretty high, but based on my experience I have to warn people to stay far away from this set.  I should have trusted my gut and went with a Samsung, they have never failed me.
