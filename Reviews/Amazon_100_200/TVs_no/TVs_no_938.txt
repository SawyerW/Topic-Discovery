Great upgrade to HD Era- Plasma better than LCD in my opinion and no need for 1080p when you are only at 42"- Bluray looks great so does the Xbox360 using HDMI Inputs- Speakers are horrible but honestly we are concerned about the Display right? - Using a Logitech Z5500 surround system so I ignore the speakers all together.Light Tv easy for me to move only about 80lbs. lifted it onto my entertainment unit by my self. easy setup - anti burn in works wellBeware of static images for the first 150- hours some people have seen burn in. I havn't exp this yet but I'm always a little worried.Love that there is no motion blur which is typical for LCD with refresh rate.KEEP TV UPRIGHT AT ALL TIMES - You cannot Move it on its back or tilt it Too Far Forward you will break the seal and your plasma tv will RIP!- other than that im VERY HAPPY!ENJOY!
