I purchased a 58inch HP Pavilion HD TV roughly 2 years ago. The computer went out in the TV. HP replaced the TV as they could not fix the problem. The technician, (whom was wearing an HP shirt and name badge), that installed the new TV said that with the new TV my warranty resets. He told me this because I expressly asked "what happens if the new TV ends up having the same problem?" Less than 9 months later the new TV also broke with the same computer problem. I contacted HP technical department and I was told that the warranty explained to me by the HP technician was incorrect. They went as far as to try and say that the technician was from a 3rd party and didn't work for HP. I asked for the 3rd parties name and was told that HP wasn't required to give me that information. I implore anyone that is considering buying a TV from HP to consider Sony or any other product TV besides HP.
