I bought this set a couple of months ago, primarily because of the price vs. the features. For this size at 1080p and given the reviews, I could not find a better value. Picture is great. People who view television from an extreme angle might notice a slight washout. But for normal viewing, it is very good. Also, remote is very good and works well with other devices, including cable box. I have not yet used the HDMI input... old DVD player works and looks great. Nice styling and NO glare on the screen. Sports and standard settings are good, and the "preference" setting lets me specify the picure for special circumstances.
