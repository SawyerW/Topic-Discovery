I am surprised by the reviews of others as their reviews aren't about this particular TV, but about a Digital Picture frame and one even left negative reviews about other TVs he didnt even own. I have this TV and I think it is a very well made TV. Don't pay more than you have to for a TV.  All these manufacturers buy their LCDs from the same place.  So all you are doing is paying for the marketing. I work in the Computer hardware industry and most, if not all companies buy OEM to cut costs. Don't think because you bought a Samsung or Sony that it is any better than the others.
