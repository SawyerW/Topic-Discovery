I spent about 2 months researching both Plasma and LCD TV's.  I discovered this Samsung to be the best bang for the buck.  I couldn't beat the Amazon price (free shipping and no sales tax).  It was at least $300 cheaper than the same TV at Best Buy or CC.  Once I ordered the TV it arrived via Eagle Shipping within about 1.5 weeks.  I opened the box and discovered it had been dropped and one of the corners of the TV was chipped. I called both Amazon and Eagle and they immediately shipped a replacement (free of charge).  I had to wait another week and a half but it arrived in excellent condition.The TV itselft is great.  I don't have HD programming yet and won't for another 6 months or so. Regular programming is good and I can't imagine how good HD will eventually look.  Easy to set up, very light.  The sound is about average for any other TV I've ever had.  DVD look outstanding.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this TV.  You can't beat what you get for the price.
