This LCD has some of the best colors I have ever seen. The contrast ratio makes a difference in a dark room. I use this set in the bedroom and when the lights are out and we watch a dark movie set in a dark rainy night scene you can see all parts of the screen. Not many sets have that ability. I have shown this TV off to all my friends and neighbors, proudly. The HD signal is amazing as well and I find myself watching the PBS channel just to see the quality of the full HD. Buy this set with confidence!
