I bought this TV in June 2005. I have not had any problems with it and the picture quality in HD is awesome. This TV is powered up an average of 6+ hours every day and the bulb is still bright and again never had a problem. Like other reviewers noted the DVI and HDMI inputs are nice to have, the picture quality is very good, it has a bright display, but on the downside the unit is heavy and would need at least two people to move safely and it doesn't support 1080p, which at the time of purchase was pricey and not widely available. Overall I am very happy with the TV and would highly recommend it based on my experience.
