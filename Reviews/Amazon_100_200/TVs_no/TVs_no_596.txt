My dad was looking for a new TV, so we did a lot of research and landed on the Toshiba based on price vs brand quality/reliability.  Now that it is set up the thing looks fantastic and is clearly worth more than we paid for it.  Picture quality is superb, it took no time to set up, and we also have the comfort of owning a quality brand like Toshiba (between the two of us we own 3 other Toshiba TVs and they all look great and have lasted a long time)One thing that really stands out is how well it seems to handle standard def signals from satellite and DVDs, which is a real plus as he does not yet have a high def package.  The picture looks great for an LCD TV, and its easy to mess around with the settings like picture size and so forth to get it the way you like it, though honestly you may not change anything right out of the box.  We also tried an upconverting DVD player using HDMI, and the results, as expected, were beautiful.  Highly recommended!
