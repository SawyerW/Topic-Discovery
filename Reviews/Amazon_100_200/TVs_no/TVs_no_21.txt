We bought ours 5 years ago. If you are into sports and nature TV you can't beat this.  You are right on the field or rink with the players or the wildlife. The one thing I would caution about is that your TV viewing will increase. High Definition makes everything you watch an experience and the size definitely only enhances it. You do need to have 12 to 15 feet minimum of room between your seating and the set to really enjoy this. A room 18 to 20 feet in depth is ideal. A good surround system also makes a world of difference as most high def is also broadcast in 5.1 surround. You can pack a lot of people around this TV and with the Olympics coming up we expect to be sharing our house a lot. In 5 years we have not ever thought of replacing this set as the quality has not diminished.
