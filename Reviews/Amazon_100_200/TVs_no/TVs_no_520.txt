We bought this tv (Samsung LNS3251) in August 2006; less than 2 days after we bought it, the sound broke. It was repaired within a week fortunately. Five and a half weeks ago it broke again - the picture is gone. After about 3-4 weeks of battling with repairmen and customer service, they determined the tv was a lemon and have finally offered to replace it. But with a much lesser model and not a full warranty - just the remaining time on our original warranty. This is outrageous and such a poor example of customer service. Samsung should be ashamed of themselves for such flagrant poor service - not to mention the poor performance of the tv. Good luck with this if you don't mind risking a so-called lemon.
