I love this set. The picture is super clear and the setup was a breeze. I'm receiving the digital signal via a Terk antennae and get a perfect picture as long as the winds aren't blowing too much. That's when I throw on a dvd. ;-)One cool thing to do with this set is connect my laptop via the pc connection and watch Netflix on demand movies or any of the networks streaming content. Also, the iTunes movies and tv shows play and look really good on this set. Now, if I only had an hdmi output on the laptop, I'd be set.My only drawback is the way it programs favorite channels. I think it's a bit tedious and could be done via a button on the remote with one click.Super stylish, great picture, fair sound, easy purchase.
