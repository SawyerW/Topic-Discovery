This is a great HDTV with many connections and great picture. It has a VGA and a DVI port for use as a computer monitor and two component connections for HD 720p. When I first took it out of the box it seemed much larger than 26" and it has a great widescreen. I have never had a single problem with the TV in 5 or 6 years. It looks great mounted on the wall. It is a thin TV for its age, and only weighs about 10 or 15 lbs. Overall I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a reliable decent sized TV with great picture and function. Easily a 10 out of 10.
