I purchased this TV after doing a lot of research.  I thought the sound issue would have been worked out by now.  However, within 5 days of getting this TV and hooking it up, the sound started cutting out.  I contacted Samsung and they stated they would be emailing the patch.  Two days went by and no e-mail.  I called again and still nothing.  Finally, I decided to send the TV back as I was still within the 30 day return period.  Amazon was great about it.  I skipped out on Samsung and got a Toshiba Regza instead as a replacement.  This was a great decision.  The Regza has all of the same features without the problems.  Samsung makes a great TV but they have some issues to work out.  Hopefully this year's line of TV's will not be problematic.
