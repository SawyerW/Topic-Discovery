This was the only 40" LCD which would fit in a cabinet space of 38.5" wide.  The picture is excellent for over the air HDTV content and extremely good using an up-conversion DVD player.  I do notice a visible difference in the picture clarity from a 1080i receiver and the blacks are very defined.The only complaint I have is the inability to use the included remote for controlling the volume of a Pioneer Receiver.  Only Samsung receivers can be controlled with the included remote.  Most users will probably use a separate programmable remote for use with this system anyhow.All in all an excellent purchase
