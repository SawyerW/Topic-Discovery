We absolutely love our new TV, the picture is great, the sound is great-it is an overall great product.  However, the delivery on the other hand was not so great.  The Tv was delivered by Eagle....HORRIBLE!  My amazon account stated the estimated delivery date was 7/20/07, so we sat at home waiting.  We had to call late afternoon to find out that an appointment needs to be set to receive the delivery and that they had my TV in their possession for 5 days and did not bother to call to make an appointment.  The customer service staff at Eagle was less than professional.  I will not order another large product from Amazon if Eagle is delivering.
