At the time of purchase 1080I sets are about $1200 cheaper than the new 1080P.  At the time of this review I have had this unit for 1.5 months and have had no problems yet.  This is my first plasma and first digital television.  I am very impressed with the picture.  The color is amazing.  I have noticed some pixilization during live action but for the most part not bad.  I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a plasma set as long as stations are not sending 1080P signals and the price difference is so great to upgrade to a 1080P set.
