Yes the Plasma looks great and was reliable for the first few years, but the panel went bad a month ago. I paid $2,000 (plus tax)in Nov/2007 and I would need to invest another $1,100 to replace the panel. I've already tried replacing the Y board and the Main board, but the service tech said the panel is bad. Given the fact that Samsung claims the following: It's rated for a 60,000-hour panel life (6 hours of usage a day for 27 years), I'd say that is a reach. I figured it would last 10 years, but 2 1/2? I won't be investing in any Samsung products any time soon.I would recommend an extended warranty as the reliablity claims are worthless if the quality control is terrible. I also heard that the capacitors fail in this model as they were not rated high enough to support the power, thus it is not uncommon for the y/z boards to be replaced after a few years.Good luck,
