Like a lot of people, I was scared to order such a big expensive item online.  Although I'm sure there are horror stories, mine was a great success.The TV arrived quickly, undamaged, and in perfect condition.  From what it looks like it came direct from the manufacturer.The TV's Auto Contrast feature was a bit annoying to me (it's on by default), but it can be turned off.  So if you're wondering why your colors keeps changing, it's the Auto Contrast feature.Be aware that you might want to read the online sellers return policy.  I didn't need to return the item, but I saw that I couldn't even if I'd wanted to.  You have to go through the manufacturer warranty to have it repaired.  If these types of limitations concern you, you may want to think about going through a retail store (and paying about twice as much).
