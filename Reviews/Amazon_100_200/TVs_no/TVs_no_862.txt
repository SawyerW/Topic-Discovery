I was looking for a HD TV monitor that I could hook up with my new home built PC- [which has a Nvidia 8800 GTS card that has DVI connections]. This TV will not work with a PC with DVI. Only the 2007 Samsungs will.The FAQ at the Samsung website says:If you have a 2007 Samsung LN-T LCD TV and it has more than one HDMI jack, you can use the HDMI 1 input jack to connect to your computer's DVI video output jack using a DVI to HDMI cable.No Samsung LCD TV built before 2007 (LN-S series, LN-R series, LT-P series, etc.) has a DVI input for a computer. All models built before 2007, however, have an analog, 15 pin D-Sub (RGB) computer input.Important: Many of Samsung models built before 2007 have a combined HDMI/DVI input jack. You cannot use this combined HDMI/DVI jack to connect your pre-2007 Samsung TV to your computer's DVI video output jack. Samsung TVs built before 2007 do not support DVI to HDMI computer video connections.HTH
