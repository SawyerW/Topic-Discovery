Upon first receiving this product, the video and sound were good. Immediately noticed that their manual was poorly written and did not explain some of the controls at all. There appeared to be only 2 aspect ratio settings: the normal 4:3 and too wide.After about 2 months, finally got around to playing a 4:3 aspect DVD and found that the display is stretched horizontally, resulting in fat people. None of the controls will do anything to fix the aspect ratio - the zoom only makes the images bigger.Sent a message regarding these issues to Mintek's tech support 2 months ago with no reply.Conclusion: the hardware is okay but the software and documentation are very poor. Mintek has a long way to go before they will have a quality product.  I seriously doubt that I will ever buy any Mintek product ever again.
