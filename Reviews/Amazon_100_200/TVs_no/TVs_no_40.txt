I purchased a model 46H84 projection TV in September, 2004. It only worked properly for 2 weeks and then the image became  so distorted, the TV cannot be used. I called the local Toshiba service center on October 28.They came out on November 4th and could not fix it and had to contact Toshiba.On November 9 they called and said the red picture tube was bad and it would take 2 weeks to get parts.On November 17 they changed the estimated time of arrival to December 15.Since November 17 I have been calling Toshiba customer service  and they keep telling me to wait.I have had this TV 10 weeks now and it has worked properly for only 2 weeks. It looks like I won't even have a TV for Christmas.And - these delays have used up 2 months of the warranty.* UPDATE - Jan. 21 *They delivered my TV on Dec. 23, but, without HDTV function. It was picked up again on Jan. 11 and returned on Jan. 14.The TV is now working fine and the picture is good.Be aware that that the matching stand is not included and is only  6-1/2" high inside.
