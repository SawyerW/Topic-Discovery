I have only had this television a week and so far so good. Like some other reviewers I was naive to how SDTV would look, not good, but that is a problem with all HDTVs. I would agree with another user who stated that if you aren't ready to or can't get HD channels I would probably hold off on this purchase. I would also suggest upgrading to an High Def DVD or Blu-Ray player. At a minimum you will definitely want get an upconverter for your SD DVDs or you will be pretty disappointed. I purchased the Toshiba A2 and the picture is awesome with HD DVDs and pretty darn good with my newer SD DVDs. Obviously I can't speak to Toshiba's customer service and I purchased an extended warranty so I probably wont have to deal with them if there is ever a problem. Clearly if you have unlimited funds and your are going to buy a 1080p there are better sets out there but this is definitely fine for your average viewer.
