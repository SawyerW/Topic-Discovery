Amazon botched the shipping with Eagle and gave no help.  Evidently this requires Eagle to call by analog telephone and Amazon failed to give Eagle a phone number. Amazon said they had given Eage the phone number. Delivery took six weeks as I waited and saw the item show up as arriving every day for five of those weeks.  "Arriving" does not mean arriving unless somebody has short-term amnesia.  It means "inventory'ing".  Finally, after I teased apart truth from Amazon lies, I called Eagle and they delivered that day.  The Amazon shipper situation is truly broken and Amazon provided no way to communicate (except this). The HDMI does not work with current DirectTV and there is no information about what to expect if you have HDMI 1.0 or 1.1.  (What happens...how do you know the source is 1.1?) All I know is that the HDMI is flakey.  Aside from these things that I relied on in buying from Amazon and Samsung, the set is OK and would have gotten a 5.  Amazon needs to fix its shipping and Samsung needs to provide a one page "This is how a HDMI 1.1 source behaves on this set".
