I brought this product a week ago from frys.com for 1499, today is 06/18/07. it is an excellent TV. I heard its better counter part 4065f has shiny screen which reflects light-this doesn't have that problem screen is non-reflective. HD channels are excellent-standard definition is not bad from a distance(more than 10ft) but from up close (6-8 ft) it is grainy and patchy. I have no regrets-its an excellent product. Yet to read the manual becoz there are several new features. Dish network gave a free HDMI cable with HD DVR it would cost about $50-$70 for that quality cable. I tipped the dish guy with $20 and he happily gave me a second HDMI cable for free.
