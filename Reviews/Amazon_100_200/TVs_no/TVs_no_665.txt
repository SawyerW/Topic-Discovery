First, I had done a ton of research on HD televisions and had already decided on this one or the LNT4065F.  When this one went on sale through Amazon with free shipping and the free up-converting DVD player it was a no-brainer.  As expected the picture is phenomenal.  The set up with game console, cable, and DVD player were very easy as well.  Good sound, easy menus, and I would suggest getting HDMI cables for your peripherals that use that connection so you can take advantage of the Any-net functionality.Second, the delivery company that Amazon uses is great.  They called to make an appointment for delivery, arrived within the timeframe (4 hours), unpacked the TV, and offered to remove the packaging after we got it plugged in and running.
