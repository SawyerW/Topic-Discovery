Just purchased this TV in May '07 and am very pleased so far with the purchase. I read the previous review and I guess I can see that it's not the most premier picture in the HD universe, but it is still pretty outstanding.The key here for 5 stars is value - for around 1600 with shipping or tax you're getting a 42" flat panel with 1080P (built for the future). It's also Toshiba's 3rd generation technology whereas many of the Bravias and Sharps are still on their 2nd generation.So, while maybe not the top 1% of HD pictures and at times you see some pixelation (very minor, possibly due to the inferiority of the source) it costs less than half of some of those monitors. If you're looking for great value this is the TV - remember that you'll pay about $125 for nice HDMI cables to hook it up properly and you can get the whole package for a great deal.
