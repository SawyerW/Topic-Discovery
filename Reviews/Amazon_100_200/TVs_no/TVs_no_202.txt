I have a 32"WegaXBR...awesome TV, but then won a 42"Phillips Plasma in a contest....was given the chance to take a gift certificate instead.....SHOPPED hard for a few weeks and nearly got the Mitsi 50" DLP until I saw this newest version of the Samsung 50"DLP.Was pleased by the next few comparisons I saw and made the purchase.  Excellent HD pictures on my Comcast HD channels.  The SD channels are not nearly what my XBR had, but the Sammy allows for an auto 4:3 setup for NON HD channels...which helps a bit.Anyone looking to educate themsleves, I'd strongly suggest visiting [...]  Since buying I'm on there all the time.  Just bought the stand for this TV from circuit city and LOVE the contemporary look and hidden wires....next up...might need a DVR.Good luck to all who give this a shot...you won't be dissappointed.DJ
