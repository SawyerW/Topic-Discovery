1st I would like to say that I am a huge fan of Samsung when it comes to HDTVs.  I own a DLP and a Plasma.This one was actually bought by/for my Mom based on my recommendations and looking at the various TVs at Best Buy.  I spoke to her after Christmas once she got it set up.She is in love with TV.  This is her 1st HDTV and she is still in the process of getting the HD box from the cable company so she has not seen the complete wow factor.  She is still amazed by the clarity of the picture, the brilliance of the colors, and the ease of setting it up.I would highly recommend this TV for anyone wanting to make the jump to HD, but doesn't want to jump into the larger, higher price point TVs.
