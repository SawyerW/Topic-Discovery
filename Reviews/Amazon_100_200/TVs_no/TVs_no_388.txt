I was in the market and saw this set on display at several stores and was impressed. The price on Amazon (150 - 300 less than Circuit City and Sears) and NO tax makes this set a no-brainer. If you are looking for a high quality HDTV that is easy to use, bright, lightweight and has plenty of inputs, look no further. Shipping was quick and well done by private courier.I also considered sets from LG, Sony and Westinghouse. Sony Brevia was a little better, but not worth almost double the price.Everyone who sees it thinks that I spent over $2G's on it.If you are wall mounting, consider getting the Mustang Tilt2 mount. It is $70 and well made. I had my set on the wall in an hour. Why pay over $200?If you do buy this set at a big box, pass on the warranty. You can get a 5 year warranty online (frm Repair Master) for about $200. The big boxes will charge you $350-$500 for the same warranty. They will push it on you relentlessly because this is where they make their money.
