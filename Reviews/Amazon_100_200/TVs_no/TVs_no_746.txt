I ordered this TV from Amazon in early October; it arrived soon after via the "White Glove" delivery service as promised.  The man removed the TV from the carton and set it on the cabinet and checked that it powered up OK. I hooked up my six year old standard definition Sony DVD player and was amazed by the beautiful display.  I am renting a DVR from my cable company; connections were made with component cables instead of HDMI. So far everything is working as I had hoped.The HD displays are beautiful and the standard definition picture is very good.  I have had no problems with the sound.  The menu is very easy to navigate. The swivel feature is something I use often and I love it.  The black frame is a design that I feel blends well with traditional or modern decor.  I was afraid that the 40" LCD might be too big for my small living room, I was so wrong about that.  It is the perfect size.Thanks Amazon, you made this buying experience a happy one.
