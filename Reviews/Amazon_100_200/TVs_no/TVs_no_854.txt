I did some research before buying this Samsung 26" LCD HDTV, and couldn't be happier with my choice !, it's worth the price....., I've just tried two sources (HD DVD and PC) and both work great so far!, I read some reviews about a pitch noise coming from the upper side of the TV, and was afraid about it, but everything has worked out fine ....Great picture, great looks... sound could be improved a little but for a small room it works fine. Just one thing... make sure about the size you are interested in, This HD technology it's so impressive that you can easily feel short with a 26" !!, In my case, after enjoying it for less than a week, I'm planning to "upgrade" to the Samsung LNT4065F 40" 1080p !!!,... As always, Amazon was a pleasure to buy from, and people from Electronics Expo did also a great job !
