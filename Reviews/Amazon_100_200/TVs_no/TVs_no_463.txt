let me first start by saying I did ALOT of research before purchasing this TV.  I am very anal when it comes to buying high-priced electronics.  I want to know I am getting the best value for my dollar.That said, I will just say that if you are looking for a 32" LCD HDTV then this is the one for you.  The 4000:1 contrast ratio is superb and the two HDMI hookups are very useful.  I play some video games, so that part was important.  They look great with so much detail I never noticed on other TV sets.  I will warn you that analog signals do not look very good on this TV, but I don't think they look good on any LCD/Plasma.  If you have DirectTv or some other all digital signal then you will be impressed.  Especially HD.  I can't stop watching ESPN in HD.  It is amazing.I am so spoiled and will never be able to go back to regular TV again.  BUY THIS TELEVISION!!!
