I shopped endlessly for an HDTV at all of the retail stores, and I was pretty much set on Samsung for quality and price.  I finally decided on the 50 inch 5064 and I am so glad I did.  It looks beautiful, just mesmerizing. My signal is from Verizon FIOS for the HD with an HD-DVR through HDMI connections.The order was filled within one week and the delivery company called me to arrange a time the next day.  They arrived on time, unboxed the unit, moved my old 36 inch CRT (240 pounds) and set up the new plasma TV, all in about 10 minutes.  The crew was very friendly and professional. All in all I saved money and had a very pleasant purchase experience.The only problem is that I can't stop watching it! It's great!
