I needed a new television since my 15" set wasn't "doing it" for my grandsons and visitors, so after much research I decided upon the Samsung LNS3251D 32" LCD HDTV.  Of course I priced them everywhere and Amazon had the best price until----SUPER BOWL TIME---big TV sales everywhere.The weight was of the TV was easy for me to bring home, and the set-up was so simple even with a separate cable system box and DVD player.  I still needed to call my cable provider for the HD, but I could still watch it without it.  The TV is set-up user friendly as you may notice if you look at the backside.  I've had no problems and the picture is unbelievably clear with perfect color.  I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of upgrading to a larger, or an HD TV.  Samsung LNS3251D 32-Inch LCD HDTV
