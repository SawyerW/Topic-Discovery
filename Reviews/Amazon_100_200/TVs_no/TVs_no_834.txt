Wanted an LCD and was advised to go for a Samsung for quality relative to price.  Not disappointed.  The total height had to fit under kitchen cabinets.  The fit was perfect, set up was relatively easy.  Picture was excellent with some channels and less than brilliant with others, but always clear and crisp up close.  Sound from the speakers is only mediocre but most TV's of this size have small speakers.  Sound was as good as it could be and better than others like Magnavox.  Headphones work very nicely like over a treadmill.  Delivery was quick and it was well packed.  Very light and the black frame and surround is very attractive.  Hope they don't change anything with the new models.
