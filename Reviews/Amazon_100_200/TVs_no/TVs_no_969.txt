I think it would be worth you while to go to AVS Forums and check out the many posts about this TV before you buy this set.Here is why I have grown to hate this set:1. While this set has 5 HDMI ports they are all on the same hub.  So, you cannot your program to go to a specific HDMI port.  If you want to use a Logitech Harmony or similar programmable remote this is a deal killer.  I ended up buying an HDMI switcher, which resulted me in spending all of the money I spent.2. When switching between SD and HD programming this set takes 5 full seconds to display the picture.  Your wife will hate that.3. The set has bad speakers that are poorly placed (bottom of the TV pointing directly down).  So, the sound is bad.4. The spine in the back of the TV (which extends all the way to the bottom of the unit) keeps it from sitting tight against the wall.
