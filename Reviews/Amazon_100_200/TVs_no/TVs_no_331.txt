We purchased our tv in Dec 2006 for $1699 plus tax.  In July 2012, our 5 1/2 year old tv caught on fire.  When the technician came out to look at it- he told me that they no longer coat the part that caught on fire with plastic for this reason. Samsung apologized for our tv catching on fire and was glad that noone was hurt, but that was the extent of their compensation for our tv catching on fire.  The tv had a 5 year warranty and it was just out of warranty.  I think it is horrific that they knew there was a problem, but did nothing to recall the tvs that were out there.  It is extremely scarey to have your tv catch on fire and I am extremely disappointed in the way they handled it.  We dealt with their ECR, which is the executive customer relations.  We will never buy another samsumg product in our household.
