I have been very pleased with my purchase.  The picture on this model is incredible.  I spent a lot of time researching this purchase.  I actually went to Circuit City to compare the picture on this set versus the picture on a comparable Panasonic model and I believe the Samsung TV is superior to the Panasonic.  Also, my brother in law has a 50 inch Panasonic 1080P plasma and the picture on my plasma 720 Samsung is significantly better.  The delivery service was excellent.  I received the set in about a week after the order was placed.  All in all, I don't believe you can beat the Amazon price along with the free delivery.  The biggest problem I have is that now I don't want to watch TV on any other set in the house.
