Out of the box the picture is way too dark.  I mean really dark.  I had to raise BOTH the brightness and contrast to get the picture to look right.  It concerns me that a new TV out-of-the-box should require me to raise the brightness to nearly the maximum brightness.  That's not enducing confidence in this TV for me.My 24inch Dell TV is great at the factory defaults -- with a screen perfectly bright set at the halfway point of brightness.The picture zoom feature is pretty dreadful.  Most LCD TV's have an option to zoom a 4:3 picture but retain the original aspect ratio (makes the 4:3 picture bigger but with only a little stretching of the source image).  With this TV, the zoom options cut off large portions of the edges of the video.  I dont know any other TV manufacturer that makes zoom work like that.  Makes no sense.Buyer beware on this Samsung model.
