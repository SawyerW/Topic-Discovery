I bought two 50" plasma Zenith tv's off of Circuit city.(1080)One in Dec. 2005 and another in August 2006.(same model) No problems after two years and great,picture and buy for around $2000.I also have two 50 " Plasma Panasonic tvs(1080) in upstairsbedrooms. The Panasonic sets were way more expensive($4000) and oneof the tuner boards failed after 3 months use.I think the picture is BETTER on my two less expensive 50" Zenithstv's than the more expensive Panasonics.I'll buy another Zenith whenthey come out with a 60"+ set anyday. Great Buy and good quality,I'vehad no Problems after "TWO" years on BOTH Zenith sets !!!!
