I have satellite TV with 55 HD channels and they all look superb. I thought the SD channels, at first, looked pretty mediocre. But after the TV was broken in for a couple of weeks the SD channels now look very good. The TV did require  a lot of fiddling with the adjustments to get everything just right. But once you get it to your liking it looks great. Love the PC and USB inputs as well as the 3rd HDMI input on the side. I use them all and they all work as advertised. For the money, you can't beat this TV. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
