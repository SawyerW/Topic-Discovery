I bought this TV for my bedroom last Christmas. It has excellent picture quality and is very light weight. The sound quality is good but not great. I use the TV's speakers as a center channel with my surround sound system. This would be a good TV for the kitchen or a childs bedroom but is a bit small for viewing across a large room. It has been reliable so far with no problems. The remote is too small and the buttons make little sense, buy a universal remote you'll be much happier. It is affordibly priced and has better picture quality than a standard TV (the color and clarity is great but not as good as HD) For the price it's a good value.
