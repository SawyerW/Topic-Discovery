I love everything about this TV. Great picture. Great size. Great looking. Great price. Everything I hoped for when I wanted HD TV. I've had it for 6 months and I'm still blown away by it. Especially sports. I'm a big time hockey fan and the difference between this and the picture on a very nice Pro Scan regular TV is unbelievable. It's like having your face up against the glass. Football and baseball too. I had one little problem when I first got it. I sometimes had to turn it on a couple of times to get it to start up, but that problem disappeared after a few weeks and hasn't occurred for some time now. I'd recommend this set to anyone. My brother got a 50 inch LG  and I think they're both about the same quality.
