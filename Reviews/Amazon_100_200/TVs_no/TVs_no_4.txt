I just bought this TV about three weeks ago and it has exceeded my expectations.  The picture is crystal clear and it can be viewed easily from many extreme angles.  In terms of home theater, this model even comes  with component video jacks in addition to the composite and s-video  hookups. If your considering buying the 36" Wega or any other big  screen tube TV, take a look at this model and you'll see comparable picture  quality and a lot more screen for the same money and it about 100 pound  lighter.  If you're in the market, this one is a winner.
