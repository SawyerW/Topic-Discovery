Before purchasing this TV most of my research was online and I've never had an HD tv before, so I don't have much to compare it to "in real life". But I can say that I love it - the SD channels look great, DVDs often fill the whole screen and look wonderful, and the HD is just amazing. As mentioned in other reviews my only criticism would be with the built in speakers - they're fine, but not great. I've had the TV for a month and half now and had no troubles. No problems with Amazon's white glove delivery service either.
