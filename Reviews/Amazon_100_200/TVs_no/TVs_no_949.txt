Outstanding TV... I received this TV on MAR 14th the day after the Amazon estimated delivery date. The delivery guy explained that he was only required to power up the unit. No problem, I hooked up my cable and went directly to the HD channels since the standard channels looked...well Standard.  If you buy this unit or any other HDTV you MUST purchase an HDMI cable.  Not a $200.00 one, a $10.00 cable will do the same job.  The HDMI cable makes a world of difference.  I currently have my 42" plasma screen connected to my High def cable box and, via HDMI, to my PC's video card.I'm very happy with this unit and you will be too.
