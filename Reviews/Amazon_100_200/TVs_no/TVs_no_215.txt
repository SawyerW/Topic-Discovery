We are also victims of this faulty TV scenario. Purchased the Zenith Z50PX2D 50 in. HDTV Plasma Television almost 3.5 years ago. Paid over $3000+ was told this type of tv (at Best Buy) has a life 10+ years. Experienced a loud pop 2x (almost equal to the sound of car backfiring) and the picture goes blank. Was told by a tech that it\'s possibly the Y or Z sus. board. This is a common reoccuring prob. with this particular model. These are all faulty parts that NEED TO BE RECALLED! The manufacture should at the VERY least send us replacement parts at no charge and we will pay the labor! Was turned down after numerous calls to customer service.IF THIS TELLS YOU ANYTHING-THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL ON THE [...] SITE!
