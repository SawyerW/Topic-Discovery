I recently received my television through Amazon's "white-glove service" Eagle Logistics; the package arrived four days prior to the estimated arrival date.  Let me just say that this set is amazing, and so far I have yet to find any problems (i.e. No sound drop-out through HDMI connection, and no bugs reported) with it.  The experience of viewing High-Definition for the first time was amazing, you can actually see the sweat pouring down a pitcher's face in a baseball game.The LNT-3253H's sleek-black exterior matches perfectly with my entertainment center, and while it may easily attract dust and fingerprints, it's worth the extra hassle of cleaning it with the soft-cloth included in the box.  Dvd movies look magnificent on this set, even on a low-def player the "Movie Mode" picture setting helps bring out the true quality.  The ability to fine-tune the black levels, as well as the option to turn on "Energy Saving" with four different settings make the screen render beautifully.  Samsung has made a very fine product here, and those who wish for top quality viewing should look no further.
