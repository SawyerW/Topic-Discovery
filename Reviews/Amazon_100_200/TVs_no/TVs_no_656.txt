I researched this set along with a Sony competitor. The Samsung was less expensive and thought it's picture was as good as the Sony. I was able to save a few hundred bucks buying through Amazon along with no sales tax.The picture on the set is amazing when watching high def channels and DVD's. Playing Xbox games is quit an experience as it really makes use of this set's 1080p capabilities. I will have to admit that analog viewing is somewhat disappointing but heck, it's on it's way out anyway.The highest praise came from my wife an she commented on how well she like the set and was glad I made the spend.
