Before purchasing this LCD, I researched a lot of options. Samsung makes excellent entertainment products, and this LCD is awesome.Some small things are that the internal speakers are very poor, which I knew before purchase, but thought I'd really not notice unless watching something in HD, or a DVD....wrong, just watching everyday TV gets them crackling sounding on certain tones. Another small gripe is gray bars on each side of a 4:3 TV broadcast, I which they have an option to turn them black...it would be much less noticable if it could blend into the rest of the LCD and frame.The connections are great, some of the best for sure, picture is excellent, no glare, viewing angle is very good.Excellent though for sure...you won't be dissapointed if you purchase this LCD!
