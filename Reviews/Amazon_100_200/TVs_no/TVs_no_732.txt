I've been researching LCD HDTV's for some time now and with the advice of my techy friend I decided to purchase this LCD HDTV by Samsung, seeing as it was a great deal, and of course it's the newest model.  First off, it came in a HUGE box, so be prepared.  The TV was packaged nicely by the Office Depot branch I purchased it from.  The TV itself is beautiful, sleek, shiny black exterior, and the plastic see through bottom piece is a nice touch.  Upon setting out television up to standard cable the picture of channels obviously varied because I don't have HD Cable.  But my boyfriend discovered a couple HD channels which looked AMAZING.  We found Discovery Channel HD and the picture was beautiful, it shows the real capabilities of this television.  My boyfriend's an avid XBOX 360 player and we tried out Call of Duty 3, Gears of War, Madden, Forza, and Rainbow Six and they all looked great.  The detailing of the characters and spacing is incredible.  My only complaint is getting used to such a huge TV.  Overall a great LCD HDTV, and a great value!
