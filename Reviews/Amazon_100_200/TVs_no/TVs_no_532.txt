I purchased this TV new in 2006 and was greatly impressed with the Side-by-Side comparisons with other manufacturers.  It was $1200 at the time, and held its own with all but the $2500 Pioneer and Sony sets.As of 1/18/12 it's still going strong, and has recently been relegated to Garage Duty, being that I picked up a new LG.I love ambilight feature.  Some call it Gimmicky, but it does ease eye strain when watching TV.  I with newer sets offered this feature.The one down side is the Audio....quite possibly the worst I've ever heard from a TV.  I have a 5.1 Surround Setup (and a 2.1 setup in the garage), so this was not a concern of mine.  For that, minus 1 star.This has been a great TV and woth every penny that I paid for it.  I can only hope to get another 5 years from it in the garage.MP
