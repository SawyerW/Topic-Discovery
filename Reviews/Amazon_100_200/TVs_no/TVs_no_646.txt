I've had this for about a month now and find it to be an excellent HDTV.  Wonderful color and sharpness.  I bought this instead of the 4065 because of the screen reflectivity on the 4065.  The matte screen is perfect for viewing in the daytime or at night in our sunroom.  Hookup to my Dish HD system and my tuner was easy and straightforward.  I followed the instructions/suggestions about tuning the picture that were provided on CNet.  SD picture is much superior to my old RCA and the sound from the TV, which has gotten complaints, was very good--not as good as through my surround system but good.  Deliver was by Arrow.  They called the day before and then again about 30 minutes before they came. I was able to follow the shipment of the TV via the internet which was nice.  Highly recommend the HDTV, Arrow and Amazon.
