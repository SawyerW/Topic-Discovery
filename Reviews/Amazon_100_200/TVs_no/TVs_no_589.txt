LIKE MOST PEOPLE I HAVE RESEARCHED,COMPARED,AND HIT EVERY ELECTRONIC STORE I COULD FIND.I HAVE READ COUNTLESS REVIEWS FROM OTHER CONSUMERS INCLUDING CONSUMER REPORT.I NARROWED IT DOWN BETWEEN THE SAMSUNG 40" (CANT REMEMBER THE MODEL SINCE I HAD MANY FLOATING IN MY HEAD)AND THE TOSHIBA 42HL167.THE TOSHIBA WAS THE BETTER CHOICE ALL AROUND.FIRST,IT HAD THE 42" SCREEN I LOOKING FOR,THREE HDMI CONNECTIONS,A PC PORT,S-VIDEO,(BECAUSE I CANT AFFORD A BLUE-RAY YET)AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS A FIRST BECAUSE I HAD NOT VIEWED THIS SET LIVE.THE ONLY STORE THAT HAD THIS MODEL WAS BEST BUY,AND THEY ONLY HAD A DVD CONNECTED.I REALLY WANTED LIVE TV. SO, AFTER POUNDING MY HEAD A FEW TIMES I ORDERED THE SET FROM AMAZON.SHIPPING WAS FAST,DELIVERY WITHIN 5 DAYS.I HOOKED UP THE SET WITH MY DIRECT TV W/ HIGH-DEF RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.(WOW)!!! I HAVE MADE NO ADJUSTMENTS,NO TWEEKS,NO COLOR CHANGES OR ANYTHING AND I HAVE TO SAY I AM SUPER IMPRESSED..EASY INSTALL, POWER CORD,HDMI PLUG IN (BAM!!!) DONE. SO, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL SEARCHING FOREVER AND A DAY,BUT I GOTTA TELL YA.YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED AT ALL WITH THIS TV...
