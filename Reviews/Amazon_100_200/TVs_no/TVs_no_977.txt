hen my first westinghouse flatscreen tv lost audio, it took over 9 weeks to get a replacement refurb unit. the new unit promptly lost the picture.in the interim, the company has switched to a non-human farce of a "customer support" system. it's a telephone message that promises a response to email inquiries within 24 hours. well, i'm on 5 days and counting - no response to the web form, email or phone messages.still waiting for that response from westinghouse, as well as for tv #3.there are other brands out there, folks. don't go with westinghouse if you know what's good for you. it would be worth twice what i paid for the tv to have avoided dealing with westinghouse customer service, not to mention a whole series of non-functional televisions.
