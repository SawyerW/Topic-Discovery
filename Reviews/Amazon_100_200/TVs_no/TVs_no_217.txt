Prior to buying the TV we had a 27" CRT TV that lasted 19 years. So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old. So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40" Projection TV with a 2 years extended warranty. The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed "blue shadows" all over the screen.After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence, no success.To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $1,000 dollars, and with prices on TV's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair. It has basically become a disposable TV. We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years. I'm sending it to Goodwill.I'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products. My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand.I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem !!I'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV.
