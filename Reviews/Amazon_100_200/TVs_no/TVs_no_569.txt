I've had this set for about six months and I still couldn't be happier with it.  I was almost suckered by the marketing of the higher priced brands, but this one does all you can ask for from an HDTV.  I haven't noticed any picture fading and the sound quality is excellent.  If I forced myself to find one complaint, it would be how the set defaults back to the smaller size every time you turn it on so you have to hit a button on the remote to make it wider.  Big deal, I'm just lazy.  Great set though, definitely recommended if you have not been brain washed by certain other companies.  cough...s-a-m-s-u-n-g- cough.....
