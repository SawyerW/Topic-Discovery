The picture on this set is quite outstanding, sharp, snappy and capable of incredible detail. The on-screen menu is excellent as well. Connectivity is excellent. it has four HDMI connections!!!, 2 component video connections (YPbPr), a VGA connection, audio SPIDF out, S-Video, numerous analog audio ins/outs etc. The sound system is quite good with a built-in subwoofer.The set has (had) a few flaws:1. You will see some pixel-ating in very dark areas. The picture snaps back when the scene brightens up again. This improves somewhat as the set 'breaks-in'. After about 20 hours of use and adjusting the settings, now, it's a very minor issue for me. ALL LCDs are prone to this to some degree or another.2. I first heard soft popping noises when listening to DVDs (only) with an HDMI connection. The noise would come and go intermittently. This issue went away completely after about 20 hours of use. (I can't explain it). Also, this can be worked around if you use a Home Theater Receiver.You will find that ALL LCDs are going to have some bugs. The TX-42F430S gives you a superb picture at a low price. I recommend it.
