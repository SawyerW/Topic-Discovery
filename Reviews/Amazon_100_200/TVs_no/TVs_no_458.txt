This TV is good in all ways but the ONE thing I bought it for: HD.  I bought the $100 HDMI cable to get true HD and this TV does NOT support HDCP (Copy Protection) when I connect it to my HD-DVR cable from Time Warner in NYC.  Before you buy this or any HDTV, check to make sure it does not block you from getting HD because of HDCP. It varies by specific TV model, and not by brand.  One Samsung TV may allow, while another may block. This information is not readily available on the checklist of features that you use to comparison shop, so find that out BEFORE you buy and get stuck like I did.  I would totally return this TV had I not already thrown away the box.
