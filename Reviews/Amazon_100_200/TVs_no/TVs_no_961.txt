This is the worst TV you can buy.If you pause a DVR ... If you have a menu up for longer than a few seconds ... Etc ... The image will burn into the screen.The HDMI ports fail constantly, at random. Especially when switching between HDMI ports (Tivo, PS3, etc). Most common problem is that you will lose sound. You then have to unplug the TV and reset. It's a pain in the a$$.Most recent problem? I went to reset the TV and it wouldn't turn back on.I'm not the only person experiencing these problems. My brother has the same TV. He has all of the same problems. I've searched endlessly on different websites and there are loads of people that have experienced the exact same problems.Amazon is the only place that I've seen a positive review for this horrible, waste of $, television.
