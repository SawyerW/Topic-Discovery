Out of the box this TV looks great - problem is a flaw in the firmware that makes the the sound drop out every 30 mins or so and you have to turn the set off and on.If you already have one of these sets, Samsung has a fix for this. HOWEVER, if you implement the fix going by the guidelines on the Samsung web site it will KILL YOUR TV - the instructions are incomplete and Samsung "customer service" will suggest that you go pay some service organization to fix the problem. Great picture - extreemly bad attitude towards fixing problems that they acknowledge exist and were their fault.BEWARE OF SAMSUNG Customer Service.Very bad experience!
