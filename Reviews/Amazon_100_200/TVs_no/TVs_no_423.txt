I bought this tv after a lot of shopping around.  It had to best picture by far. It had 2 HDMI ports ,which almost no tv's this size have more than one. The only this that doesn't make it perfect is that there is no Quam tuner. When I bought the tv almost 2 months ago, Samsung did not offer one in any of their smaller lcd tv's, but now they do.  So I would suggest if you want free clear quam HD from your cable company, get one of the new 53 series models.  If this is not a factor this is a great choice.
