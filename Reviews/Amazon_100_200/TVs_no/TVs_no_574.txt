We got this TV last summer and were quite happy watching hi-def cable program (1080i) and up-converted DVD movies.  Now we finally have a blu-ray player, and Wow! the picture quality is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  Color is rich yet very natural feel to it; the picture has true lifelike quality.  We noticed motion blur on 1080i cable programs or up converted DVD movies, however with hi-def blu-ray there is no visible motion blur for our eyes.  Most people who own this TV already know how great this set is, but you will truly appreciate this TV once you've seen true hi-def movies (1080p 24frame Blu-ray or HD DVD) on this TV screen. It really shines!
