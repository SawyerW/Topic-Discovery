I recently decided to retire my old Hitachi HD tube set, and needed something that was reasonably priced. I read the reviews of the Samsung on line, so I went to look at it in the store. I was impressed with the crispness of the picture and the vividness of the colors. I decided to order it from Amazon, because the price was three hundred dollars less than the brick and mortar store I checked it out at. Six days latter, the set was at my house, and I broke open the box and set it up. It set up fairly easily, with only two looks at the manual. I didn't have the HD service from Directv installed yet, so I was initially a bit disappointed with the picture. I got hooked up the next day, however, and was blown away by the clarity and color-- even in shows that weren't broadcast in HD. As for the HD shows-- WOW!! It looks like the action is going to come out of the set. I'm highly pleased with both the quality and the price of this set, I'd recommend it to anyone.
