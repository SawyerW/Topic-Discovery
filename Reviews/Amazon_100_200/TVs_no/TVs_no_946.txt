I am not a 'techie' - just wanted a nice TV. Looking around online, the Samsung looked like the best value for a plasma the size I was looking for , so I went for it. It is great looking and has an excellent picture ( both sharpness and color ), easy to set up - even for a novice. The price was great compared to others remotely similar. The only complaint I have is that the sound is rather mediocre and on occasion the non-HD channels sound a bit 'tinny'. Then again I dont have it hooked up to anything fancy. Overall I'm very satisfied.
