I have had this TV for a week.  It is connected to a DirecTV HD receiver via component cable to one of the TV's component inputs.  I have no real understanding as to why the DirecTV installer did not use HDMI cable and connect it to the TV's HDMI input.  I will not go into the details here because that is a whole other issue.The picture quality for HD programing is FANTASTIC.  The picture quality for non-HD programing is VERY GOOD.  Black's are GREAT.  The only negative I have found is related to the volume of the sound (no additional speakers are connected).  If there is background noise inside the house, I am unable to raise the volume high enough to compensate.We love this TV and only wish that our entertainment center had been able to hold a larger version of the D62U series.Highly recommend!!!
