This television is 720p but it does an exceptional job when combined with a Samsung AR600 dvd player.  Regular DVD's are very pleasing to view using this combination.  However, the upscaling is very good even when playing just plain analog signals.  I am especially pleased with the 8000:1 dynamic contrast which results in nice blacks for an LCD tv.  I honestly do not believe that there is a better 32 inch LCD television currently on the market.  I purchased this television from Warehouse_Deals for $612 + $26 shipping.  Though the delivery date was due after Thanksgiving, Eagle shipping routed it thru another trucking company at my request so I could get it before Thanksgiving.  Exceptional customer oriented service and many kudos to them!
