I originally bought this TV at Best Buy, brand new. Within three months I started having problems with the TV not powering on. Then one day after using the sleep timer to turn the TV off, and try and turn it back on a couple of hours later, nothing. Nothing happened, DEAD. After a hastle with Best Buy and warranty return policies they finally gave me a replacement. Now that I have my "new" replacement I'm still unhappy. I now have couple dead pixels (white spots) on the screen, problems with the TV detecting the HDMI input from my Xbox and DVD player, and worst of all it still has the same problems as the first one powering up. I've tried everything they (Westinghouse) suggested; new power outlets, disconnecting the components, and resetting the TV. Nothing. SAVE yourself the money and hassle, DON'T BUY THIS TV. Take it from someone who has experienced the lack of support and garbage quality of this so called TV.
