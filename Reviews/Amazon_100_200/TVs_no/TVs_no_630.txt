After considerable research I chose the Toshiba Regza 42 inch HDTV.  I was heavily influenced by the Consumer Report "Best Buy" designation and the sale price ($1,100.00) I got at Circuit City.  This was slightly higher than the Amazon price, but, if I got a defective unit, I thought the return process would be easier at a local store.  I chose this unit over the comparable 1080p unit because all reviewers have indicated that there is minimal picture difference in a screen this size.The picture, even with SD input, is excellent.  Also, the sound is surprisingly clear and robust;I don't feel any need to add a stereo amplification and speaker system to improve the sound quality.  The set-up process was simple and intuitive.  I did purchase an upconverting DVD and this provides a significantly better picture than from the SD input.  I will probably wait until the fall, when broadcast programs are back and more HD channels are available, to purchase a high definition signal through my provider.All in all I am very pleased with the television and would highly recommend it to others.
