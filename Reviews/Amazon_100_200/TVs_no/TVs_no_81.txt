A good image if you have a good source.  Something to consider with an LCD TV is that they reproduce the image very well and some of the "fuzz" from our tube TVs really hide any problems you may have with your video source (read bad cable company).  This will show if you are looking close.The remote is very basic and feels cheap, but it works and you can config everything (as far as I can tell) from the unit itself.So if your going to pick up a nice LCD set you should get a nice multi-remote anyhow for the rest of your gear.Again a good buy for the unit, nice picture, ample imputs for average setups, and better sound then I expected from a stock TV
