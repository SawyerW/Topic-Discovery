My wife and I have been waiting a long time for this TV. It is the first 19 inch LCD TV that we have seen with an integrated ATSC tuner which is what we needed. You can't beat the price because last years 19" LCD was slightly more expensive and did not include the tuner. Futhermore this TV has excellent picture. Although the contrast ratio is not as high as the 23", surprisingly it has a higher resolution, 1440x900 as opposed to 1366x768. Having both a PC input as well as HDMI is also a major plus. I also own an older samsung HDTV and there have been several nice improvements sine then. For instance as you change channels it displays the signal type (e.g. 1080i) which wasn't the case with my older TV. It also has all sorts of timers you can set which is perfect for the bedroom. We are using this TV as our alarm clock. Great TV!
