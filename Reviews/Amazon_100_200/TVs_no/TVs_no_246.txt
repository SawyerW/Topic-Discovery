I purchased this television 15 months ago from AFEES.  Now I see I paid too much.  Too bad they only back their purchases for one year.  After intermitant use, mine stopped operating by displaying a flashing light indicating it may come on, but never does.  For the time it did work, it seemed loud when powering up when I turned it on.  I thought that was normal since it was new.  Now I have a monument in my living room with a blank screen.  Once again Sony has let me down.  That's twice in three months.  UPDATE... The technician replaced the $400 lamp and brought the TV back to life.  Since then, I've waited for additional parts to correct the bright yellow appearance of my picture with large fuzzy rings and a lack of all reds and blues.  The hits just keep on coming.
