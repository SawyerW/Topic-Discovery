i purchased this tv from amazon march 18 2008. it was great untill the warranty ran out 12 months later. now it takes about 10 min. to come on and every day is a little slower. i paid $1144.00 for it and to fix this problem is $1200.00 + labor. as long as this is the only problem i have with it i will not have it repaired. i will wait till it wont come on at all and then buy a new tv but not a samsung. 06/05/08 revised--talked to samsung and they extended warranty to cover my problem.i will continue to buy samsung products after all.
