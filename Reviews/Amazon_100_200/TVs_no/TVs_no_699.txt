This is my first HDTV, and i couldn't be happier with my purchase. I did a lot of research, and looked at a lot of tvs, and as soon as i saw this set in action i was sold. I play videogames and watch movies mostly, and i have my xbox-360 hooked up via VGA as my main source, standard def DVD's look WAY better than i expected on this set and i love the way my games look now. The shipping service via Eagle through amazon was great and i have nothing bad to say about this set or my buying experience.
