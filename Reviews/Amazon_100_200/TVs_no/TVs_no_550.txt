I purchased the Sharp Aquos after hours upon hours of reading reviews and THOUGHT I was going to be getting a solid TV. Instead what I got was a $900 piece of junk. The HD channels look grainy at best. The colors in standard definition are terrible. Sure, there are a lot of features that can be adjusted but none of them make the true skin pigment even close to real. If you do get a color setting you are happy with you still have to deal with the fact that people look unrealistic. Every person's face and skin look as though an artist drew them with oil colors. No amount of tweaking can get rid of this problem. Because Tiger Direct does not accept returns, only exchanges, I am now stuck selecting from one of the televisions they carry - none of which I am enthused about. Thanks for nothing Sharp.
