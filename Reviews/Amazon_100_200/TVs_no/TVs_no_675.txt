Others have spoken to the quality of this LCD TV. Clarity, contrast, and vibrancy all are excellent. You do have "Dynamic," "Standard," and "Movie" settings that give one a good start to customize the picture. But each of these three types has special controls the other two do not. And, one can't create new customized settings for specific uses.So, for example, for me, watching TV and photos both require modifying the "Dynamic" picture setting. But, because I can't create a Dynamic 1 and Dynamic 2, I must tweak the Dynamic setting each time I switch media types. And, trying to adapt one of the other two picture modes does not give me the access to the Dynamic controls I need to tweak.Why 5 stars instead of 4? The Wiselink USB connection allows me to use flash drive for slide shows. I have not found another manufacturer that offers this very handy and useful feature. Photos on this monitor look as good as on my MAC. And, if I hook up my MAC to the TV, they ARE as good!
