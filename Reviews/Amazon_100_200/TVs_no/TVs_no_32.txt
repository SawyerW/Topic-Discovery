I have had better quality TV's from the Goodwill store. I bought my Tatung TV about a year and a half ago. Mine was actually a bigger one than this one but same brand. Right from the begining it had problems with the screen going out whenever it had an all white background on whatever show or commercial we were watching. I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves. I would NOT buy anything from this brand ever again. Try Goodwill, you will probably get more for your money.
