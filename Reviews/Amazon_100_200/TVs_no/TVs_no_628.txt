I liked the price of this T.V. I was a little upset that the week after I bought it the price went down $66, but it was still a lot cheaper than the local stores. Out of the box the picture definately needs to be adjusted, but with some tweaking the picture looks about as good as my 61" projection in the living room. The speakers on this T.V. aren't what I expected. I realize that the overall size of the unit makes it difficult to have quality speakers, but if it's turned up more than half way and there is any bass at all coming through it sounds awful.
