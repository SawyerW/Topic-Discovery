The TV arrived within four days of placing my order - way ahead of schedule!  I think this was because it shipped from Dallas and we are near Houston so the TV didn't have to travel very far.  But the freight company was great - they made sure I was completely happy before asking me to sign the delivery papers.  The TV looks great even when it's not on!  The slick black look it exactly what I wanted, instead of matte black or silver.  The picture quality is amazing!!  My friend recently purchased a Toshiba LCD and she swears our picture is better than hers.  We've been enjoying watching our favorite shows and movies in HD...I wish everything was HD!  My husband was concerned that the 42" picture would not be big enough in our family room, he thought the 50" might be better.  Even though the HD format "crops" the screen size on top and bottom, we both agree that the 42"picture size is more than large enough - we are really happy that we ordered this TV!!!  This was my first large Amazon purchase and I cant wait to buy more...I'm a very happy customer.
