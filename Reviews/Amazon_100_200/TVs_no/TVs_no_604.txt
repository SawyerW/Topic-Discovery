I researched this and other 37 in. TV's before purshasing. It was easy to set up, has beautiful picture. color is great.  It took me a while to absorb all the info in the manual.  But it is everything I was looking for and more.  I have my surround sound w/ digital audio receiver/DVD player connected.  I found out I needed an Optical audio cable to enable my TV to play the TV programs through my surround sound.  My old tv didn't require that.  But I figured it out after really studying the manual w/ tv and DVD player.  I was so pleased and the sound is awesome!!!  Also I connected another DVD player w/HDMI connection so I can play my vcd's that I make with my photography hobby.  And they are beautiful too.  So this has been a wonderful unit for me and I am a 64 yr. old lady, and put this together myself.  Just needed a little muscle to get my old very heavy tv. out.I would highly recommend this  product....it is great!!!cam/Dav. Ia.
