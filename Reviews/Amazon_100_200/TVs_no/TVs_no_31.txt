Note: I would rate this product and company with zero stars if given the option!Do not buy this TV.  I owned another Tatung television  and tried to have it repaired under warranty.  The TV, however, must be shipped to the company for repair - at the customer's expense.  So their warranty requires $200+ right off the bat.  So after my first disappointing experience with their customer service, the set quit altogether.  Of course, the warranty period had expired now, but we still had only owned the TV for 2 years.  I contacted customer service again and was told I could have it repaired by shipping it to them and paying a mere $700.  So instead of wasting my money repairing this lemon, I plan to take my money and purchase a TV from a reputable company like LG.Congratulations to those of you who enjoy and appreciate the products and service of the Tatung corporation.  The rest of us suckers now realize we should not waste money on their rubbish.
