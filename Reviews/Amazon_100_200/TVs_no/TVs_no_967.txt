I've owned this TV for 4+ years now.  It's been wonderful.  Color is vibrant, has all the hookups you can ever ask for (every type cept USB).  My only problem (which may apply to all LCDs) is going from HD channel to SD channel and the screen flickers a few seconds.  Also, very very very rare, the screen didn't turn on and stayed black.  Only happened twice over the two years and a simple unplug from the wall, sit for 20 seconds and plug back in typically fixed it.  Sound isn't bad but I have a surround system installed so i'm not using it.  All my perhiperals are hooked through my theater system cept my ps2 which is directly hooked to the tv.  I can even have my computer hooked to the tv.  Oh, the other issue is that the auto-sensing when you connect something to it, sucks.  Sometimes it switches and sometimes it doesn't.
