I rated this at 1 star because there was no zero option. The manual is ridiculous, the supplied cables were defective and their customer service line is absolute torture to get through.You have to sit directly in front of the set to view a decent picture. I had numerous problems with the set not starting properly and finally...when the set was just out of warranty, a circuit board attached to the LCD screen blew. Guess what, the board is not available as a separate item. Philip's wants to charge $4500.00 for the part alone! I paid $1800.00 for this piece of junk. I look at this as tuition for the education I received dealing with this substandard company. Do yourself a favor, buy a SONY. I did and now I'm happy.
