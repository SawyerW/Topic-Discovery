I have had this Plasma for a month now and love the picture. The connections are plentiful and the set itself is nice looking as well. Guess what though I am one of the lucky ones who has a BUZZER. I know you all wish you had one too. Well if you do have a BUZZER then I am sorry. Samsung's customer service is worthless they are deplorable. This plasma would get 5 stars even with the loud BUZZING sound if Samsung's customer service would be helpful to their customers. As of right now I am suppose to get a replacement from Samsung, but no one their will tell me when. I wont get into the whole story, but bottom line their are many BUZZING 4253 and 5053 Samsung plasmas out there and no one at Samsung will admit to it, nor will they help you in a timely manner!!! Stay clear from this plasma and look else where!
