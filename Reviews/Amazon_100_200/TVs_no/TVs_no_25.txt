I've had this plasma display for a little over two weeks now and have been pleased.  I've owned several other Viewsonic lcd displays and all were high quality and lasted a long time.  Out of the box the default colors/settings need calibration, but once this was done the picture jumped off the screen.  The images now look very accurate and life-like.There are ample inputs in the back of the unit to hook up just about any kind of home theater equipment.The only complaint I have would be with the slight buzzing noise the unit makes after warming up.  It isn't very loud and from what I hear this is pretty much standard on most plasma's out there.All in all another great product from Viewsonic.
