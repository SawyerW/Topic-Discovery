I purchased this particular TV because it was the largest I could find that was under 100cm long, since that is the size of our entertainment center.  42" TVs all were too big, and even the lnt4065f is too big.  This fits and has an inch or so to spare.  The picture is fabulous and I can't be happier.  The sound is even decent, though I usually send it through my home theater speakers.  My only wish would be the ability to select the correct input with one button, instead of having to cycle through the list every time to go between things like HDMI, S-Video and component.
