I purchased this TV for my office and never used it for one year because no one at the office had time to watch TV.  We started using it occasionally during lunch time/ breaks for 1 year, it started making clicking sounds when we tried to turn it on.  I called samsung and they asked for model number and when I told them they immediately responded by offering to repair one time for free.  They took my information and told me service tech will contact me to schedule a repair.  No one called for one month.  I called again and they said they assumed I had fixed the problem myself.  When I told them I had this problem with TV, they were very familiar with it and again took down my information.  Do I think they will fix my TV by next month?Well all I can say is  SAMSUCK!
