Well I ordered this TV about a month ago and all I can say is that im so impressed that its hard to explain it. Watching football games in HD and playing video games in 1080i is just great. The speakers are kinda weak but who buys a TV for the speakers!! Its non-glossy screen is great at keeping down the glare and you cant even tell. I wish more TV companies would broadcast in widescreen so I could take better advantage of it but you cant have everything!!! This is an all around awesome TV with an even better amazon price!!!
