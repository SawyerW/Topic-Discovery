this tv looked AWESOME right out of the box.  got a samsung home theater to go with it, in our newly finished basement, and let me tell you, it looks and sounds awesome.  I could not be happier, particularly for this price range ($1100 through amazon).  i find myself down there watching it and not believing i could afford to have this in MY house!  i dim those lights, pop in a DVD and POW! its like being at the movies.  highly recommend it.  i only rate it 4 stars because i like to keep that one star in reserve, NOTHING is perfect!
