I've had this TV for over 3 months now.  No question the picture is extra crisp in HD (though I can't really compare it to but a 20+ year old Sony 27" near flat screen trinitron).  The menu controls are pretty well laid out.  The component plugins in the back and sides were a little difficult to figure out, but trial and error eventually saw me through.  The (universal - nice!) remote is big and the only thing that bothers me so far is that to change the channel, the enter button is 3-4 inches below the number buttons, or you can just wait until 1 or 2 seconds later as it accepts your button presses.  The speakers pretty much tops out at the 50% zone.  If you have a livingroom with 10 people who are talking, your TV will lose out to your guests' volume.  Also on a side note, the lettering on the bezel was scuffed a good bit when I received it, though has nothing to do with performance of the TV.
