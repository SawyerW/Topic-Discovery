I have had this Samsung HDTV (LN-T4061F)for just under two years, and after paying the amount of money I did, I would have expected to have my TV for more years without a problem. But I do have a big problem with not being able to turn the TV on, just sits there and clicks, it used to come on after 5 or 10 minutes of clicking, but now it doesn't even come on.  I have read that the problem is probably the capacitors on the power supply board and that Samsung knew about the problem but because it is out of warranty, they won't fix it.  I just think that Samsung knowing about the problem should pay to get it fixed.
