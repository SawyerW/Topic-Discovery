Got this TV from Amazon. Very good quality set. Looks beautiful even before turning on. Great picture, decent sound. High contrast, good (but not great) brightness. Get excellent off-air HDTV picture quality. DVD looks very good using Panasonic upconverting DVD player connected via HDMI. TV's tuner catches even fringe TV channels well.Amazon gave very good price, prompt shipping. But scheduling the home delivery was a major hassel. When the shippers received the set from Amazon/Samsung, I had to call them every single day for 1 week before getting a shipping date set that was not suitable for me. I had to arrange for someone to wait for them at home as they said they can come to my state only on one day in a week. Then they gave time of 7-10 am but arrived between 1 and 2 pm. But once they came, they did very good job of delivering and setting up the TV set properly in room of my choice.
