This TV is a very good value bargain.I am very happy with it - its colors are vibrant and the picture looks sharp. Very good contrast. I watch HDTV a lot, but it also does a good job with regular TV broadcast (I had experience with Sony 32' Bravia which was terrible with regular TV)Sound is also very good.It fits well in the living room, since it does not look that big (speakers are hidden in the bottom)I also hooked it up to my laptop, and now I have a 40' PC monitor with wireless keyboard & mouse.. amazingThe only complaints:1. Switching from one input source to another (e.g. PC<->Cable) is a little slow2. The price dropped about $130 3 weeks after I bought it ..
