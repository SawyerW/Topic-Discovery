My Sharp Aquos LC32D62U was purchased through one of Amazon's sellers, and they dont accept returns on TV's. So I'm stuck trying to get my defective set fixed by Sharp. The set worked for about 1 day (looked great by the way), but then failed (1/2" wide black line across screen and rest of screen blurry and with double image).Called Sharp 3 days ago to get it repaired. They said to wait 2 days for service center to call me. They never did. Called service center and they said Sharp never contacted them. Called Sharp and was told dispatch center closes early on Fridays. Told to wait 'til Monday to start from the beginning. So I'll be lucky if I get a call from the service center one week after my first call to Sharp. Lets see when they actually show up, and when my set actually gets fixed. I guess that is the risk you take when buying a TV set online. Buyer Beware... you may have a huge headache on your hands even though you spent over $1K on a TV.
