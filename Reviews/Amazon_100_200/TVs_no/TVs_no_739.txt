Very pleased with this TVs quality of picture and features.  I bought it for use with my Xbox 360 and the picture using HD cable and gaming mode is awesome.  I'm very happy with the sound too.  the clarity and acoustics of the built in sound is better than the stereo and speakers I could attach.  The only failing there is wattage, but it's clear enough that you dont really need to turn up the volume.Ordered the TV on Tuesday, got it on Thursday delivered unpackaged by White Glove service.  Free shipping.  Nuff said there.Best Buy appears to have this on sale now too, but for at least $100 more, plus you pay tax and shipping (if you don't pick it up in the store).This is hands down one of the best deals out there.
