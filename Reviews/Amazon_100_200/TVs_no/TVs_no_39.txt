After watching a 25inch G.E.for the last ten years,I wanted to move up to wide-screen T.V.Checking prices in circulars,then reviews on-line,brought me to the toshiba 46H83.Iwound up getting the 46H84 for the same price,and have not been able to figure out what the difference is between the two.The salesperson told me the'84 is a newer model.The picture on amazon for the'84 is not representative of the set.It actually looks exactly like the'83,and that's fine by me.I love the way it looks in my living room.You need a good-sized room to truly appreciate this set.The picture is sharp and bright for a projection T.V. DVD's look crisp and clean,using component video cables,and the sound is good enough that I only use my digital receiver for blockbuster flicks,and then it's total immersion time.For the cost-conscious,this set is energy star compliant.One caveat is that for best viewing one should be at least 8 feet away from the set,so it's not for small rooms.
