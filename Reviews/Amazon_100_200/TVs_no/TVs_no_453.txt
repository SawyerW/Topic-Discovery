Samsung is my personal favorite brand when it comes to HDTVs, though it is so far the only brand that I have owned. The picture quality is excellent and it lives up to the reviews I have read. It's supported HD resolutions are 1080i and 720p.  This does not support 1080p so you might want to keep this in mind if you decide to buy. To be honest I personally can't see a huge difference between 1080i and 1080p unless they are side-by-side, and for my purposes I didn't really need the extra oomph of 1080p.Since this tv was for my bedroom built-in tv shelf I wanted a light tv that fit the space and I wanted HD but didn't need the best of the best. I needed quality and affordability and something that could handle DirecTV HD and a progressive scan DVD player. I think this Samsung fits the bill quite nicely.
