I've had a LN-T3253H for about four years.  Its been reasonably reliable with reasonably good picture characteristics.I run it on Comcast Cable and up until yesterday have been running High Definition in Component Mode,  Yesterday I received a CISCO RNG150N cable box with and HDMI output.  I followed the setup instructions that came with the box and connected HDMI out to HDMI in on the LN-T3253H,  But despite all my efforts I could not get it to work successfully.  The message that displayed on the TV screen was "Not supported mode".  Needless to say Samsung Support did not provide a lot of insight, much less a solution.  I'm bummed.  Has anyone else been successful at hooking the LN-T3253H up in and HDMI-HDMI configuration or am I chasing a pipe dream here?
