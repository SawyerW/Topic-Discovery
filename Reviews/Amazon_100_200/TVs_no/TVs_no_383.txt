I am very disappointed with this product.  I went and saw it in a circuit city and best buy, then found a great price on Amazon and bought it. In the stores, I guess I couldn't pick up on the poor screen quality.  However, it is very hard on the eyes to watch this screen as the images are way too blurry and motion often leaves "trails".  We bought the tv partly based on the exterior aesthetics, as it has a very sleek look and displays well as a room fixture.  But the picture quality is so poor I don't even want to watch it and can't return it due to Amazon's policy.  So much for watching Hi-def football at home this year...I'm better off with my old 30" tube screen in the home office instead of the family room.
