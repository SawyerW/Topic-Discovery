I ordered the TV from Amazon and it arrived in less than 5 working days. One cannot beat the convenience and cost saving (25-30%) of ordering it online. WRT the TV itself, all I can say is wow! I compared this TV to comparable Panasonic, Sony and Pioneer models and I felt this offered excellent quality for the price. In fact I chose this over the Panasonics that were around 10% cheaper as I felt the Samsungs offered a much sharper and realistic image. The Pioneers may have been better, but I felt the difference in quality did not warrant the huge ~30% price difference. The TV also makes design statement and exudes a sense of sophistication with its understated but elegant design. I also did a lot of reading on [...]before making my final decision.I purchased an Oppo 970 upconverting DVD player and am very happy with the combination. One should also add that there is no need to buy the $50-150 Monster HDMI cables. Save your money and buy the $10 cables sold by vendors on Amazon and other places.Finally, I should state that my TV has no buzzing issues. It was a Mexico November 2006 build.
