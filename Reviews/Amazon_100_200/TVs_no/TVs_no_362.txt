For the price, this 720p TV was probably the best deal at the time.  I orginally saw this TV in Best Buy over 6 months ago.  I stood back, and said that one looks the best.A few cons, but none of them show stoppers.  There is some ghosting/shadowing ... but this typcial of LCDs.  However, I am not yet sure if its my provider/content (Comacst) or the TV.  I noticed it less with my 6+ year old progressive scan DVD player.System has only one set of Componet inputs.  Though, not a problem.  I move the comcast box to DVI->HDMI cable.  Will be moving the DVD player to and HDMI version sometime soon.  Only two HDMIs inputs.  This might become an issue later.
