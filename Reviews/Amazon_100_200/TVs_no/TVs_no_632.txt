What can I say???  I am thoroughly enjoying this HDTV.  I too was influenced by the Consumer Reports "Best Buy" tag and picked one of these up at a locally owned area retailer for $999.  Installation in my home was delayed while I decided whether to bite the cable bullet or not (I didn't), but since hooking up a $20 Radio Shack antenna have been wowed on a daily basis.  The OTA HD picture on this TV is fantastic!I've got this hooked up to VHS/DVD combo and picture there is awesome as well.  Have yet to try HDMI...Bottom line--fantastic set.  I LOVE IT!
