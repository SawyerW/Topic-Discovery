God I love this TV.  This is why terrorism will eventually fail.  The masses of this world love good deals that they find on-line and we will outspend them to death.Back to the Samsung. . .If you can't figure out HD-Ready from HD-Integrated then you need to cut back on the white lines.  Picture quality from a clean HD signal is awesome.  Garbage in Garbage out.  If you hook up a crusty old VCR to this beauty it will like crap.This is by far the most bang for the buck for a DLP TV.  Those crafty engineers on the Korean penninsula are busy crafting these beauties.  Let's hope the North figures out that DLP's are better use of their time then making ICBM's. . .peace out, I gotta go buy more stuff.
