The "device" arrived yesterday, and after moderate set-up, was displaying HD images of excellent quality. Clearly, this is consistent with many other folks who shared their experiences in this forum, and several others.The "white glove" service met my expectations, with the Eagle guy hitting his time window for delivery and removal from packaging.For those of you who may be somewhat reluctant to electronically execute a purchase of this magnitude, I can highly recommend Amazon's process. As a bargain hunter, I will be watching this site for the next 28 days to see if the price comes down, to "exercise" their price guarantee commitment.Update: Kudos to Amazon for honoring their post-order price guarantee, twice, during the 30 days after shipment. This saved a total of $124.30.
