We did a lot of research before purchasing the Samsung TV from Amazon.  The brand was also recommended by a family member who works in the TV industry.  We shopped the local stores likes Circuit City and Best Buy; however, we found the "best buy" on Amazon and their "white glove delivery service" was all they said it would be.  We actually had to return the first TV that was delivered, as there was a high pitched sound coming from the TV that was always in the background when the  TV was on.  I called Amazon and advised them of the problem and the customer service rep didn't hesitate.  She immediately offered a replacement and the new TV was shipped out the same day.  We received it several days later and the Eagle delivery truck showed up at my home when it was expected.  The courier unpacked the new TV, we checked it out and he packed up the original TV and left with all the packaging and trash.  The TV has a beautiful picture and we couldn't be happier with our purchase.Thank you, Amazon, for a terrific shopping experience.
