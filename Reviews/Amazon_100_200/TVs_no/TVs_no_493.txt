This is my first HDTV and I have to say that it was an excellent choice.  Everything I throw at it looks good.  I have my Xbox 360 with HD DVD player hooked to it connected via VGA and the picture is phenomenal.  I also have a region-free dvd player (for watching foreign movies, I wish the Xbox 360 was region-free) connected to it via component cables and the picture there is sweet too.  Darks are dark, you can see it from any viewing angle and is extremely easy to configure.  The design is stylish too imo.  Overall an excellent buy.
