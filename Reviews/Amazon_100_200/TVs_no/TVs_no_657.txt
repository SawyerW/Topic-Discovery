Highly recommended.  Out of the box, plugged in, ran through standard set up menus and had a great HD over the air and SAT picture with little to no "tweaking."  Standard Definition picture is not so great, requires adjustments to make it less frustrating to view, especially the SAT feed.  Also have in home a Panasonic and Sharp HD LCDs that do much better job with standard def, but the Samsung picture, if not compared to those sets, is acceptable.  So we just have to wait until Feb 2009 when standard def goes away!  Menu driven features are easy to understand and use.  Remote control is small/narrow, not the best arrangement of buttons, and can be difficult to use initially.  Takes a little more getting use to.  Overall, great value for the investment.
