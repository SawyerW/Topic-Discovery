TV shipped one day after I ordered it, arrived two days later, with a crack in the frame. The shipping company took it back and I called Amazon to send out a replacement. One week later, no TV. It turns out that the replacement request never went through! However, the customer service that Amazon provided to fix this problem was beyond anything I have ever gotten from any other company.As soon as the mistake was acknowledged, a replacement was shipped out and delivered promptly. The white glove service was great. They were going to deliver between 3 and 7. They called my cell phone at exactly 3pm, to tell me they were outside. Great testing of the set and they did not leave until I told them the set was good.The TV itself is gorgeous. The size is perfect and the clarity is unbeatable. I immediately connected it to my Playstation 3 Blu-ray player, and the jaw dropping picture and sound blew me away.Very impressed and I highly recommend it. It's well worth the money and will not disappoint.
