I purchased this tv based off of the many great reviews here at Amazon. I had narrowed my decision down to two tv's, this one and the Sony Bravia (40 in). I have to say that I've been pretty disappointed so far. I had to call the Toshiba service department (who referred me to the local repair shop) to get the sound working right out of the box. Roughly a month later I started hearing the sound vibrate when there is a lot of bass. This occurs regularly now and I'm considering purchasing a speaker system to counter it. I shouldn't have to do that...I regret buying this tv and would love to return it and go with the Sony.April 5, 2008. Since posting this review I've had 4 brush off's from the Toshiba service dept. Additionally, the tv now blacks out intermittently. I'm basically stuck with it at this point as all Toshiba will say is call my local repair shop.
