I was very apprehensive about purchasing this television due to reports about banding; but I'm happy to report:- No banding- No dead pixels so far- incredible pictureMake sure you use a good input source.  I thought that the picture was ok with composite video for the cable box, great with the component, but when I switched to HDMI the picture was incredible.The speakers are adequate for normal viewing (news brodcasts, talk shows), but for movies I'm considering connecting it to my stereo system.  The sound was also much better when using HDMI.Hopefully my experience so far represents the majority of these sets, and not just that I got a "ringer".By the way, I bought this through 6ave due to their good BBB rating.  They were very responsive even though my credit card company initially put a stop on my card because they thought this purchase was suspicious.
