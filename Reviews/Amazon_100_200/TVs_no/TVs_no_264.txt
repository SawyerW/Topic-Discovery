I purchased this Plasma T.V. before christmas, The shipping time was exactly what they quoted when I ordered. The Television itself is so much better than everyone else says it is. My wife and I are extremely happy about this purchase. You wont find a better plasma television for the price of these. The sound is not as bad as alot of reviews have said it is. It does come out of the back like all the reviews says it does, but I think that the sound is still really good with or without some additional sound system. The picture quality is great and the Television itself looks great. I will probably be buying another one of these tv's for my bedroom really soon..
