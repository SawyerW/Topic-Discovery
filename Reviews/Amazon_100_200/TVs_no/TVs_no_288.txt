When I first got this TV it had a terribly loud buzzing noise coming from the back.  I could not watch anything on it.  It was so annoying I've tried everything.  I called Samsung to send the repair guy.  When he came he said that it was "normal" and he couldn't do anything about it.  I tried fixing it myself and when I opened the back panel the sound disappeared.  I left the back panel hanging on the four large screws and the buzz is so low that I can't hear it.  Now I am actually enjoying it.  I think I should call Samsung and let them know about this.  They are probably losing a lot of business this way.
