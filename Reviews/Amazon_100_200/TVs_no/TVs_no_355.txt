20 months after purchase, this LCD TV stopped working...no video, only audio when you turn it on.  Samsung was NO help, and then when I searched the message boards on-line, I found hundreds of similar complaints.  PLEASE do not buy a Samsung TV, as they do NOT stand behind their product.  I feel like I have been completely ripped off by Samsung.  This issue exists mostly in the 40 inch LCDs, but also in the 46 inch and 52 inch models.  PLEASE take my warning seriously and save your hard earned money.  Meanwhile, I'm joining a class-action lawsuit against these criminals ASAP.
