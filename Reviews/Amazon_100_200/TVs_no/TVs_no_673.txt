In terms of color, picture, and resistance to glare, this is hands-down the best LCD I have seen. I shopped around and various stores before placing the order at Amazon (since their customer service is better than Circuit City, etc) and the quality of this set blew me away. There is no clouding or pillaring on my set at all. The appearance of the TV otherwise is also great. My girlfriend thinks it's "pretty" as just a piece of furniture, due to its thin, piano-black bezel. The only problem with the LCD is that it has HDMI hand-shaking issues. This means that when you are using an HDMI device, the screen will occasionally flash green or pink for a split-second, and the signal might drop out for a second entirely. A few times the signal has not come back, but turning the LCD off and on fixes this. Apparently there is a new mainboard (1008) which is being shipped with the new models, and this new board alleviates the problem. Assuming that's true, that makes this the PERFECT LCD.
