We bought this tv at the end of November.  A month later it started making a sqealing noise.  We contaced Samsung and they directed us to a local repair shop.  The tv was in the shop for about 2 weeks.  Within an hour of having it back the sqealing noise started again.  It has now been back at the shop for another repair.  Not sure how this will end.  If we had to do it again we would have spent more money and bought this at a local store for easier return.  Now we have a brand new tv that has had repairs.
