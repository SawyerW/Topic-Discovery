I did a lot of research before buying and I thought this was the best deal for the price.  The TV is the 2007 successor to the highly rated 2006 model.  I bought it brand new for under $800 on Amazon through Office Depot.  The digital channels look very clear.  When hooked up to my Xbox 360, the picture is very sharp compared to my standard TV.  It was even delivered to me in just two days!A couple of complaints: the analog channels look a bit worse when compared to my old television and it takes a long time to power on and off(which I heard is usual for LCDs).Overall this is a great TV and I would buy it again.
