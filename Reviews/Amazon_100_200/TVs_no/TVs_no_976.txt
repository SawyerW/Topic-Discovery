BEWARE: Don't buy a westinghouse tv !!! Their service is terrible. If you purchase a tv and something goes wrong it costs $55.00 to return it to them. Ours arrived defective and they refuse to pay return shipping even if faulty when it is brand new.  The tuners are so problemsome the only repair center in Michigan has refused to repair them any longer. We returned ours and they replaced it with another, which as another person describes took forever.  After a year the tuner started giving us problems and won't hold in the HDTV mode. No one in Michigan repairs them or carries replacement parts. This is probably why the other individual rating the tv's stated that Westinghouse was waiting for a replacement model. Parts are non existant. Please read ratings before purchasing a Westinghouse Tv. They are nice sets but if anything goes wrong you are out the total cost of your tv.
