I LOVE THE TV. I PURCHASED IT, AND I HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH IT.i READ MANY ARTICLES ABOUT THE BUZZING NOISE, AND I TRIED TO BUY THE BEST POWER SURGE SO IT CAN ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM. uNFORTUNATILY IT WASN'T ELIMINATED.i STILL HAVE THE BUZZING NOISE, WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING PLAYING PS3. I AM TOLD THAT POWER STABLIZER/CONDITIONER WILL FIX IT.  eAITHER WAY IT'S SOMETHING WITH THE CURRENT THAT IS GOING TO THE TV. THE NOISE IS NOT COMMING FROM THE SPEAKERS, IT'S COMMING FROM BACK OF THE TV.ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT SAMSUNG MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THEY NEVER HEARD OF THIS ISSUE, OR IF IT'S NORMAL FOR A 2K TV TO MAKE THIS ANNOYING NOISE.>>>>>>>> ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THAT IS.. SOMETIMES IF YOU PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION, YOU SEE DOUBLE PICTURE. eXAMPLE: IF I AM PLAYING BASKETBALL (PS3) AFTER 2 HOUR, I START WATCHING TV, AND AFTER 5 HOUR, I STILL SEE MY BASKETBALL MENUE AS A PICTURE WHICH IT ALMOST FROZE IN THERE. SORTA ANNOYING BUT NOT AS BAD AS THE BUZZING NOISE
