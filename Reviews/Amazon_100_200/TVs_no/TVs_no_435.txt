Keep looking around the show room in Bestbuy and Frys for at least 4 times, I think this one is the best for my budget. Sony Bravia still the king among all LCD HDTVs. But Samsung is the one that has almost the same quality of static image and pretty close video quality compare with Bravia. The remote control is in good design and as well as the TV menu. The only downside is the slow response time and insensitive of the remote, that's why I gave it four stars.Another thing, don't go with the free shipping if the company is called "Eagle". It took me almost a month to wait for my TV, and I found that almost 20days the TV just laid down there in the warehouse which is only several miles from my place!!. \_/
