Purchased this TV from KMart 2 years and 3 months ago, worked OK for that time, then now I come to find out that there is a KNOWN PROBLEM with the right side of the tv, the backlight and inverters on the circuitry board fail, causing the TV to smell like burning wires, then it will only turn on for about 1-2 seconds, then shut off, although the sound still works.THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, AMONG OTHER KNOWN ISSUES WITH THIS TV THAT SUGGEST IT WILL FAIL. THIS TV WILL FAIL. REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, EITHER. I wish I would have done more research before I purchased this piece of crap.
