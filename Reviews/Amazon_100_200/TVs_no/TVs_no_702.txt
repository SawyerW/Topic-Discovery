This TV was an excellent buy!!!! I gave it 5 stars because when used at its full capacity it does have an exceptional picture quality! I had it up and running in no time, no crazy set up features.  I have my PS3 connected through the HDMI cable and it is fantasic! i also have watched Casino Royale on blue ray and WOW!Many of you will read bad things about the shipper and in all honesty the the reviews can scare as they did me, but i had a pretty good experience.I review the TV at 5 starsDelivery i would give 3.5 stars:Reason being!1. The delivery people well very nice and careful!however2. They could not find my house within the inner city of Philadelphia3. If you have someone waiting at your house while your at work be for warned they may just walk in.4. If you have a DOG make sure he is not out running around the house! luckily my dog was out back on my deck
