First, the Flat Screen Samsung LCD 32" is a great purchase.  Hundreds of dollars cheaper through Amazon than other suppliers.  Hookups are easy, remote is functional, programming is simple, picture is superb.  I have it on Satelite and I believe this 32" LCD is better than the 50" Samsung DLP in playroom.  NOW THE BAD NEWS - Ordered 3-09-07 - got it 4-06-07.  After not hearing anything from anybody I finally emailed Amazon and they said that Eagle tried to call but there was no answer.  What they don't know is I gave them my mobile number WHICH I KEEP ON 24 HRS a DAY!  So they lied.  Ultimately, I called them and they arranged delivery.  They did not have directions so I had to meet them and "guide them in."  Still, the 4 week wait is worth this AWESOME FLATSCREEN
