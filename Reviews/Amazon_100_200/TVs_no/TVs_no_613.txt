Finally, I can review a product I am happy with overall in price, shipping, and timeliness of receipt without any problems.  Great overall picture with good clarity, and I really enjoy having a 37" screen. However, I have 2 issues:  1 is that when showing videos on this television, they are very fuzzy and the picture comes out quite badly.  Perhaps I need to read up on screen readjustments for videos, and 2, the volume control seems to not work properly.  At 45, it just seems normally loud, but doesn't get as loud as I think it should.  If I were to put my 27"  Sony that is downstairs at 45, I'd blast the roof off!
