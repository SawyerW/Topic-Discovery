The Samsung 3251 provides a great picture, but will benefit greatly when coupled with a home theater sound system. I wondered what size would be best for my family room and now wish that I had purchased a larger model. The 32 inch widescreen actually becomes a 27 inch size for programs that are not in high definition format. Until all programming is in high definition, it is going to feel a little small. I believe the 40 inch model would have been about the right size for my average-sized family room. With that said, I am very satisfied with the picture quality, variety of inputs, and the appearance of the television. The speakers do not deliver the same quality experience, and I highly recommend running the audio through a surround sound system with an optical cable. There is definitely a pleasing difference in high definition, and even though programming is lacking, it is now sufficient to make the purchase worthwhile.
