Absolutely, the best HD LCD TV I have ever seen.  The Picture quality is superb.  I recently had friends over for a Christmas Party and they were amazed at how detailed the picture looked.  I set my contrast to Hundred, Picture Brightness to 55, and Sharpness to 75 and the result is HD heaven.  Samsung, in my opinion puts out a fantastic product at a reasonable price.  I own three Samsung Tv's.  One DLP and two LCD's.  They all are fabulous.  I would not hesitate to buy this TV or any other Samsung TV.  It is well worth the money.-- an extremely satisfied customer
