Just received my tv today. The delivery of the item almost took a month. The shipper had originally claimed the item lost in transit. I talked to amazon about the shipping delays and they quickly resolved the issue and sent me another tv. The second shipment arrived to me on time without any issues. A+ amazon customer service.Now when I got the tv I plugged it in set up my antenna programmed the tv and in just minutes I was viewing beautiful over the air hd tv programs. After that worked out smoothly I hooked up my brothers xbox 360 and quickly ran the bioshock demo. The picture was beautiful much better then the 19 inch sd tv he plays on. The last thing I tested the tv with was my Philips Upconvert dvd player(Philips HTS3555 Home Theater System with iPod Connectivity (Black)) I picked up some hdmi cables from monoprice.com when i ordered my tv for about 4-5bucks each and used them for the philips. Plugged everything in easily set everything up and the picture was amazing. I would give the tv 5 stars but its still too early to give it that.
