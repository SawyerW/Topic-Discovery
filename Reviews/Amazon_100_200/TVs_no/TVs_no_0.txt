We initially were purchasing a cheaper tv...Well that was until we were educated by tweeter.  This Television is a beauty...make no mistake!!  The picture is clear, crisp and concise.  Set up was not as I read in previous reviews as being easy, it was anything but easy.  But then we(my husband and I) are not techo buffs.  My son has since played with it and is finally set up perfectly.  we love it and that says alot because i am definately not a couch potatoe...but not I cant wait to get home to veg out on the couch with my remote in hand....Incidently we also purchased the sony 5 disc progressive scanner dvd/cd player and love it too
