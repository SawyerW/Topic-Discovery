I have had this TV for about 2 weeks. I bought it over the Sony and LG because of all the positive reviews I have read and the fact that the TV looks great. Buying from Amazon was a breeze and it shipped fast. The picture is great and I like the 16:9. I had been using a 20 inch for the past 10 years and this was a major upgrade.But in my opinion the sound quality is horrible. There is so much background noise it is unbelieveable. If you don't believe me, hit mute on your cable box but not on the TV. You will still hear all of the noise that the TV generates. I have tried playing around with the equalizer which has helped a little but now I need to listen to shows in a very high pitch.I'm sorry for spoiling the five-star party, but I am not in love with this TV as much as I hoped. If someone knows of any suggestions that could help with my problem, please email me at jsull73@hotmail.com Thanks.
