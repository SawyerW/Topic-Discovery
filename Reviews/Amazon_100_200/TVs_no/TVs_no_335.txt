This is a fantastic tv and amazon's service was outstanding. Amazon's delivery service was amazing. They delivered the tv, unpacked it and even connected it to cable to our satisfaction. Only then we signed off the delivery.The TV picture is so cool I can see details in the picture that are missing from old crt tvs. The set is sleek with its piano black finish and looks great even when the set is turned off. The sound system could be a better though. As, you increase the volume, you  can realize the speakers are not able to keep up. However, I am planning to hook up the tv to a home theater sound system. So, this will not be a problem. I compared many TVs like the Sony Bravia (whose aesthetics are equally crappy like the ps3), Panasonic, Sharp Aquos and finally settled on this TV. This set is cheaper than the lns4092d. The lns4092D has a higher dynamic contrast ratio.Initially, I was skeptical about ordering online, but 500 dollars difference in price (at the brick and mortar store) is a lot.
