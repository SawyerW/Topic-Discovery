I ordered this tv, and did not realize I would be getting a terrible experience with delivery.  Amazon uses a third party to set it up in your house.  After I found this out, I thought it might not be too bad, but they never delivered the product.  I got a call more than a week after ordering informing me I would be contacted soon to arrange a delivery.  Well they never called back, and after nearly 2 weeks I got fed up.  It was 4 days after  the delivery estimate and 3 weeks after I ordered.  I had to call and cancel the order.  Now I will not get credit for the the visa payment I already made until this delivery agency returns the TV to Amazon.  Meanwhile I can not buy another tv with regular delivery until I get my refund.Buyer Beware, do not use amazon's white glove service, it is not worth the risk.
