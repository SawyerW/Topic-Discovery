My Toshiba 42" 1080 lasted 7 months prior to losing its picture. It was taken to the warenty repair station and part ordered and back ordered the same day taken in. Today is one month into the repair, no TV and still no part. No excuse for this kind of service on a $2000 product in this day and age. Parts can be gotton anywhere in the world in three days or less, from my experience.The Repair station called today to get me to come pick the TV up to get it out of his way cause its cluttering his work area up. Totally Disgusted with this kind of service, and just want to warn folks against buying a Toshiba product, cause this is what your getting for repair support.  Jamie
