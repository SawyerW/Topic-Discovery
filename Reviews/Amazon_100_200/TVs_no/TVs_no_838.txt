We bought this for the kitchen.  After much research and waiting two weeks for it to ship from Amazon, we were very excited to open it up and get going.  The first problem was apparent before we even plugged it in--no remote in the box.  Then, we plugged it in and proceeded through the setup.  There was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv.  No amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away.  We had to send it back, but Amazon no longer had them.  I will give it one more try from another supplier, but if it has the slightest problem, I'm buying something else.
