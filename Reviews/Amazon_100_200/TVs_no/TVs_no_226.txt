We bought this TV in Dec 2005, after a year (when the warranty expired) we started having a ton of red dot "sparkles"  We fought for 2 years to get LG to pay for the repairs, last week they agreed to extend the warranty and pay for the parts only.  However, right after that the TV "popped" and barely worked.  I was told by several techs that these TVs wil continue to pop over and over again, even after the circuit boards are repaired, because of bad design.  So, I donated the TV and bought a new "Sony"  I would never recommend this TV.  I am thinking the reason it waiting so long to pop is because we only used the cable TV part of it and up until last week never used a gaming system or other devices.  Its as if it can't handle extra work.
