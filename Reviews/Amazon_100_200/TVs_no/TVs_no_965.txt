Just brought this t.v. at Bestbuy for a little under a thousand dollars.  The picture is great.  Since this is my first HDTV, I don't have anything to compare it to.  I have a HD DVR from the cable company so the picture is as good as it can be.  I hooked up both the cable box and my ps3 via HDMI.Con - The remote sucks. But then again I just used the cable remote so that solves that problem.  Next is that the t.v. does read any new input devices well.  I can be watching cable and turn on my ps3 and the t.v. automatically turns to the HDMI signal to view my ps3.  The only problem is once you turn off the ps3, you have to remotely cycle through the other 3 hdmi inputs to get back to the cable box.  But then again I did the same with my standard tube t.v.So far I had the t.v. for three days and haven't had a problem compared to the other reviews for other 42inch models from Westinghouse.  I will try to update you monthly.
