All the information about this TV was accurate on Amazon. A week or so after ordering, two men delivered the TV and took it out of the box. They took about 10 minutes and knew what they were doing. I then plugged in an HDML cable I bought from Radio Shack for $40, plugged one end into the TV and the other end into the HD cable box. It fit perfectly into my entertainment center and has worked flawlessly ever since. I wish there were more programs in HD, but I did watch my favorite college football team play in HD, and it was as good as I could possibly have expected. The whole process from selection to watching went as smoothly as any TV purchase I have ever made.
