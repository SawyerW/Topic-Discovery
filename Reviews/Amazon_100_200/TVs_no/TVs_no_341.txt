I just got this LCD HDTV & i was blown away at how great it looks.The picture quality is the best i seen in any LCD at my local circuit city.....so i order it here & got it 3 weeks later. Everybody that seen my LCD wants one. It just that great.The game mode is great for xbox 360, PS3.This tv support 720p & 1080i resolution.If you not sure whether to get this LCD or the other samsung that support 1080P........i would tell you the same thing that most experts has said, & that is that the human eye cant tell the difference between high resolution & super high resolution. 1080P is only better on paper.save hundreds of dollars & get this LCD & not the other samsung.Which ever samsung you choose........you will be astonish.
