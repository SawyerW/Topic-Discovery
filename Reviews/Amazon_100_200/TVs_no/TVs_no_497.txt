This TV was recommended to me by a co-worker who had recently purchased it. I already had a 20" Magnavox LCD TV that I purchased from a major discount retailer and wanted to upgrade. I'm a dedicated on-line shopper and found the best price on Amazon.com. I paid $[...] with free shipping. That was [...]dollars cheaper that any local electronics store in my area. The 4000:1 contrast ratio is beyond description! I see things that I never saw before. I also purchased an upscaling DVD player that uses an HDMI cable. The DVDs are amazing at [...]. This TV can really deliver and has the necessary connections for high definition. My friends call this TV "sexy" because of its sleek black gloss design. The cabinet seems to disappear in low light. Auto set up was simple and remote easy to operate. Few things in life exceed expectations--this product is one of them.
