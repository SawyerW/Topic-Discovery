Picked up one for the bedroom. Not a bad TV. The built-in HD tuner is nice for over the air HD service. The black finish looks sharp. It does suffer from the small "white band" at the top and bottom of the screen as other reviewers noted, no doubt due to the LCD backlight. Samsung could have done a better job trying to shield this. Also, the low contrast ratio makes the color sort of "red" and not as vibrant as what you might find on some models with a higher contrast ratio. All-in-all not a bad LCD for a small place in a bedroom or kitchen.
