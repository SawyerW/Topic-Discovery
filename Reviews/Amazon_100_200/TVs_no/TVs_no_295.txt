I was a little worried about purchasing a TV online.  However, everything turned out better than I expected.  The TV was delivered within a few days by Eagle shipping.  They unpacked it, moved my old TV, and helped me put the new on in it's place.  They then carried out all the packing materials and trash.  After setting it up, the TV picture is incredible with an HD signal.  It also has a very classy appearance.  There are plenty of connections for my equipment on the back.  Overall I have been extremely pleased with the service, equipment and price (no shipping or tax charges) of this HDTV.
