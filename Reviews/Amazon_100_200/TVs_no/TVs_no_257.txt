I bought this tv in December and it has never worked properly.  The tv emits a high pitched electrical hum that will give you a headache within a few minutes.  I had the tv "repaired" under warranty (this took over 2 months).  When they returned the tv to me, it still had the same issue, so they came back to my house and picked it up (that was 3 months ago), and I still don't have it back.  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and asked my credit card company to refuse payment.  This tv, and Sylvania/Funai Corp are worthless.
