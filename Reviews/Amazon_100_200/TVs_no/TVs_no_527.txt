I received this item on Jan. 18, 2007.  The t.v. was defective and only worked for a couple of hours.  It took a couple of weeks to receive this item.  I should say that amazon was real prompt in returning this item to them for a refund.  To say the least, I was very disappointed with the operation of the t.v. because I couldn't watch the NFL playoffs, the main reason why I bought it. I have since returned the item to Amazon, and went to Circuit City to buy a t.v.  I would really hesitate to make another purchase on amazon again.
