I purchase the 30" Olevia and hooked it up to my receiver and got a fuzzy picture so I up graded my receiver to a Yamaha 5760, but the signal kept dropping and I would get streaks with a momentary blue picture. It turned out that the Yamaha 5760 dosen't handle the video transfer well.  Don't buy this receiver if you want great video and the convienence of switching from DVD to cable or VCR.  When I purchased an onkyo TX-SR702 to transfer the video I could not believe the quality of the picture. I can not believe that any other set could produce a better picture. It takes my breath away! You can spend more money if you want for the brand name, but you will be wasting your money. They didn't have the 32" at the currant price or I may have purchased it. This is just a great buy!
