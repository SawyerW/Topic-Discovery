Samsung LNT4061F 40" 1080p LCD HDTVI have look into these type of TVs for long time and maybe for $200 more I should have got the LNT4071F, but in average there is no difference. The TV and Amazon have been fantastic, shop for the best price and incentives and buy it. I did recommend my nephew and he bought the 4661, I am still waiting my commission from Amazon (joke).One negative, the remote needs to redesign in size and key locations. I turn off the TV often because the OFF key is same size and too close to the # 1.
