I've owned this television for a little over two years and it recently experienced the dreaded pop sound accompanied by the black screen. Overall I was never impressed with picture or sound quality as the colors seemed to bleed, even with the best of cables and the sound would distort on anything past mid level.  In fact the speakers even started buzzing at higher sound levels as if one of the speakers were blown.I would'nt be so quick to rant if I feel I got my money's worth for the short time I had this tv, but the sad part is I only used this television an average of 1 HOUR A WEEK because I rarely have the time to watch. For it to go out with such infrequent use is just a shame in terms of quality.  I've always been a Sony and Panasonic consumer and bought this purely on price (sales and discounts). Big mistake.
