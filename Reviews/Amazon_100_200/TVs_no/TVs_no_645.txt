In a bright room the picture is very visible with excellent 'pop' in 'vivid' mode.  When the room dims a dedicated remote button makes it easy to choose a softer image setting with better gray scale tracking and depth.  In a dark room the black level is clearly visible as a dark grey.  Pretty dark blacks for an LCD set but can't match a plasma for dark room blacks.I like the matte screen of the 4061 model.  Glare is not a problem in my frequently bright room.  You never feel like it's a mirror.The set is very thin at 3" and the rear inputs are recessed allowing me to use a 1" thick wall mount without crushing the connectors.You can attach a USB memory stick with still pictures and the set will display them pretty well.  It's cool but not full 1080p resolution and the big jpeg images from current digicams take maybe 5 seconds to appear after selected.  Pretty slow.  An HDMI output DVD player with card reader should work much better.Sound is OK for a TV.  You need external speakers if you want sound to come anywhere close to complementing the outstanding HD picture.
