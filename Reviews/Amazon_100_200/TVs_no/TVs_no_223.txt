Today I am finally rid of the worst tv ever made.  This P.O.S. finally died.  The first time it happened it was out of warranty by two months. I fought with LG, who owns Zenith, and they agreed to fix it.  The repair company came, picked up the tv, 6 weeks later they come back, within a day it is broken again. Another 6 weeks it is fixed and until yesterday it worked great. I will never buy another Zenith or LG product, there is obviously something wrong with this tv and they could care less.  I now have a Samsung for 1/3 of the price of this tv, it's lighter, smaller, and has a better picture. Good luck to all of you who still have this tv, you are watching on borrowed time.
