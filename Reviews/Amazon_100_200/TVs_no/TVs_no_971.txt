My wife and I could not be more pleased with this TV.  The picture is simply beautiful, whether you're viewing something in HD or not.  When we were picking it out, we compared this TV with other models with the same size, and our choice was obvious.  Everything priced above this model was priced WAY above it, because those models were the top brands like Sony and Sharp.  Everything priced similarly to this model, or below, had clearly lower picture quality.We have used this TV for over a month and have experienced no problems whatever.  The "overfill" mode for non-HD TV stations works great, and the sound quality is what you would expect for built-in TV speakers.  I honestly have no complaints about this TV!If you don't want to fork over the money for the top brands but want a high-quality TV whose picture looks pretty much the same as the top brands, you should give this Westinghouse TV some serious thought.
