After finally plopping the cash down to get this TV, the hardest part about everything was the wait for it to show up, and even the shipping was super fast. Once I got it into my house and made sure that it was working, I started to hook everything up. Xbox 360 looks fantastic over component, things that are in SD, well they don't look fantastic, but what do you expect when you try stretching a image that was 640x480 to 1080x1440 (at 4:3 ratio) with no formal upconversion? Connecting through the PC port was a breeze, and everything just worked. No difficult setups. The TV does a basic setup when you first turn it on, but after that, it is good to go.Nice finish though you will have to wipe it off with the included cloth because it is a dust magnet, but that is honestly the only complaint and I figure a few seconds cleaning it off for a nice handsome set is worth it.I went to several stores to look at TVs and I have been nothing but impressed with this set.
