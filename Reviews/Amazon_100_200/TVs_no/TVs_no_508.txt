I order my TV from Amazon and within 9 days, I was sitting comfortably in my chair watching my favorite movie on it. I was extremely pleased with the timely manner in which my TV was shipped and delivered. I tracked it from Reno all the way to my local delivery service in Syracuse NY. It was delivered the following day without as much as a mark that would cause me to fear damage had come to it. As for the TV, it has a sharp, clear picture, along with a handsome design. To top all this, I saved $400.00 by purchasing it from Amazon.
