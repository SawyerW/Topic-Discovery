I agree with the guy whose TV quit during the football game. Mine has lasted longer than his before messing up. Luckily I won the TV. I was never impressed with the picture. And it does get HOT and makes a noise. Today I've had it almost 4 years and the bulb must have blown out b/c hubby said it made a loud sound (like his did). I will order a lamp, but if it tears up again, that's prolly gonna be it for me. My neighbor has a Panasonic plasma and the picture is unreal. So much better than mine.
