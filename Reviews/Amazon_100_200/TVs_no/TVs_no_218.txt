I've owned the Zenith (made by LG) Z50PX2D for a couple of weeks now and I am still running around telling people how great it is. I spent dozens of hours checking reviews and comparing the different 50" plasma tv's before deciding on this purchase. The quality of this set is at least, if not better than most of the higher-priced plasma tv's.The table stand is plenty sturdy for those who do not wish to hang the tv. It even comes with built-in hooks on the back of the set to anchor it while using the stand (which I did since it sits on my fireplace mantel).Most of the reviews that listed a weakness for this tv were because the case is silver instead of black. For the price difference and the quality of the tv, I believe this is a minor thing. I actually like the silver case (it's not overly shiny or brassy).I'm also extremely impressed with the integrated HDTV. There are a good number of ratio's that allow you to zoom in on the action. Even the analog tv seems to be better on this set.I'm more than happy with this purchase!
