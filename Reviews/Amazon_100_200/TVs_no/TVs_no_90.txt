I didn't want to spend alot for a flat panel tv and I didn't want a glorified comptuer monitor either.  So, I found this 20" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.
