I have this TV in my game room over the garage.  I'll tell you it is the most awesome piece of AV equipment I've ever owned.  The HD Picture quality is breath-taking (I have the HDNet/ESPNHD packages from TimeWarner, the Discovery documentaries shot in HD are just crystal clear and so realistic, feels like you are right there.  Best of all, there is no service adjustments you have to do to make the picture quality improve, it's right out of the box top quality.  I did adjust the brightness and tuned down the sharpness to fit my viewing taste.  I also configured the 1280x702 resolution for my computer viewing pleasure, which is hooked into the DVI port.  I am sitting 10 foot from it and it is like I am viewing it right on my office desk, so clear and sharp.Pros:1.  No service adjustments.2.  Low Fan noise, not noticable at all.  Not much heat.3.  Picture quality is amazing.Cons:1.  Heavy stand, 80 pounds by itself.2.  Not easy to put AV components around.3.  The little shadows sometimes noticable on screen, because the screen hasn't completely heated up yet.
