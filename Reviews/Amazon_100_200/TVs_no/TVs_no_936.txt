We loved this tv until last week when it started making a clicking noise and cycling on and off. Turns out that Samsung settled a class action laws suit regarding this same issue in many of their televisions. They cut corners when manufacturing and installed capacitors that weren't of high enough voltage to last more than a couple of years. Of course, my model isn't included in the settlement. I'm on hold with them right now, but I have a feeling our options are to repair it on our own dime (which could be a few hundred dollars) or replace it completely. I will NEVER buy another Samsung product again. I would not recommend this product or company to anyone. I'd love to get in on another class action lawsuit with other unhappy customers.
