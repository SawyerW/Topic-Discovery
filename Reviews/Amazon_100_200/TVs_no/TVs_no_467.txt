I was going to buy a sony, but was talked into this Samsung instead.  Boy am I glad that happened.  The picture quality is stunning. I'm running though a DVI-D to HDMI cable by monster and both HDTV picture and regular cable are awesome.This thing reproduces black extremely well for a LCD TV.  Its well priced, simple to set up and in almost every way perfect.  Better speakers would have been nice, but it is a LCD so what can you expect.  The sound quality is more than acceptable with a Dolby Digital in, but running it thought a quality sound system will really bring the whole thing home.
