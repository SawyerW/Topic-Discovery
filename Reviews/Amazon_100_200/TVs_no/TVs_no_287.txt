I think it's the cooling fan everyone seems to be complaining about...I hear it but if you turn on the speakers and sound on your audio system and/or TV you won't hear the fan...it's as simple as that.  I saved almost $700 if you include tax from Best Buy or Circuit City prices. The picture and HD picture is one of the best I've seen.  The only rival is Pioneer's Plasma HDTVs in my opinion, but the difference (if any) doesn't justify the price difference. Delivery was good, however I had to coordinate with Eagle for delivery, kind of a pain but not too bad.  But saving almost $700 (at the time of course), this TV on Amazon is now almost $300 less than it was a few months ago when I purchased it.  No complaints here though.  Great HDTV, great size, good deal!
