We bought one and got it home only to find out the built in DVD player wouldn't load DVDs.  Took it back to store and got another one.  The remote did not fully work on the new one but kept it anyway.  My mistake. After three months the DVD player kept a rental DVD and will not eject it.  Mintek said to ship it to them and they will fix in 4-6 weeks.  Unit will not even switch to TV mode with DVD player hung up so we can't even use as a TV.Avoid this unit (and I suspect all Mintek products).
