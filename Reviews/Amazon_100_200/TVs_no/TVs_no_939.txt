Great looking TV, great picture, no complaints whatsoever.  The set itself is very stylish, the sleek black frame looks great making the TV something to look at even when it's powered off.  Great TV, great price.Not being a complete videophile, the stock settings on the TV look surprisingly nice.  You can pick between Dynamic, Standard and Movie mode.  Dynamic gives you the most contrast making the picture look more sharp.HDTV and HD Movies look amazing on this TV.  Xbox 360 looks almost real and the option of digital audio out gives you the option to connect to a digital surround sound system for amazing sounds.TV was delivered by Eagle shipping.  TV was delivered on time.  Once they received the TV in my area, they sent me an email requesting a call to setup an appointment to deliver the TV.  They need a 5 hour window to deliver the TV, but they can call you 30-60 min before the delivery if you want them too.  They called 45 min before the delivery, arrived on time, carried the TV into the desired room, unpacked the TV and assisted me inspecting it for any damage.  Very professional and courteous.
