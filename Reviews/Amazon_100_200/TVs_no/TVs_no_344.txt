Overall Assessment:  Excellent product.Ordering:  No issues.  Same great Amazon order system.Shipping:  The TV showed up on the last forecast delivery date.  The tracking info indicated the unit had been in town for about 4 days.  Probably got hung up in the July 4th holiday rush.Delivery:  No issues.Unpacking:  No issues.  Unit was nicely protected and box showed no signs of external damage.Setup:  Pretty straight forward.  Lots of details to watch out for, but the quick setup guide and manual had all the right info.Operation:  Excellent!  Picture quality is fantastic.  I'm still learning some of the finer details.  I've got a picture discontinuity line that shows up when watching some DVDs...I suspect the issue is with my older DVD player and not the TV.Integration:  Some of the Samsung remote features (the menu button and the menu navigation arrows) do not work with my DVD player.
