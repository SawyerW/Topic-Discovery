This was a great buy and I am extremely impress with this beauty. The picture is flawless when viewing HD channels and from my progressive scan DVD player. It also looks great with my PS2 using the S-video connection. The picture qauality on regular TV is pretty good as well, and varies from channel to channel. The TV also comes with lots of connections for your peripheral equipment. I have it connected to the following, the connections on the TV are in parentheses:A/V Receiver (Audio Out)PlayStation 2 (S-Video)Xbox (A/V)HDTV Cable box (YPbPr)CATV (RF cable connection)Computer (DVI and VGA)DVD Player (YCbCr)The split screen set up is relatively easy, and I was able to view my computer screen on one half of the screen and have a video game running on my PS2 on the other half. All in all, this is a great TV at a very affordable price. I plan to get the 27" for my bedroom, and the 20" for my den.
