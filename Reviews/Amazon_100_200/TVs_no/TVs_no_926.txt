Before I purchased this plasma, I was searching all over the internet and local stores but decided to buy it from Amazon. We're really satisfied with the quality and sound. If you are looking for a plasma TV, stop searching, you will not be disappointed with this TV!  Plenty of inputs, beautiful picture, and reflection is not a problem at all!We use this TV primary as a PC monitor, and the quality is better than the standard PC monitor, however, the optimal resolution is 1024x768.  Watching video, viewing pictures, and browsing the web with Windows Vista on this plasma are exceptionally vibrant and clear.The only problem is that everyone is now fighting to use this tv for everything!
