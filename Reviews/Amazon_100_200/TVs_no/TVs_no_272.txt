This panel, simply put, is beautiful.  Expect the quality of the Panasonic industrial models, but with all the goodies (components).  The speakers are great, too.  They detach if you don't need them-- but give them a try, you might be surprised.  The stand is included and it is attractive, well engineered, and heavy with a capital H.  I worried about the fact that 720p is not native res for this panel, but now that I've enjoyed watching it for about two months now, it's not even an issue-- the picture is alarmingly excellent.  Finally, if you're looking for understated quality and class, this is it.  It is all black, thinly framed, and includes a separate "media center" so you can cleanly set it up.  The led's glow blue.  Love it.
