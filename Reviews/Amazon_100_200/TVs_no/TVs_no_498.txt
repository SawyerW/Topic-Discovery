Execellent TV for small to medium bedroom.  Used primarily with Dish DVR system using antenna/cable connection.  Great picture when viewed at distance of 8-10 feet away for majority of most channels.  Would be better with s-video cable.  Also bought an OPPO 970 upconverting DVD player at same time.  The OPPO gives the absolute best picture at 720P and probably would rival any true HD picture.  OPPO also includes the necessary HDMI cable.  Great combo for Disney/ Pixar movies.Con- The piano black finish is very nice and gives the TV an elegant air, but attracts dust.  Fortunately Samsung provides a cleaning cloth and the TV is easy to wipe down.  The remote also does not have back lit buttons.
