I will first repeat what has already been stated many times...this TV has an excellent picture, on par with the highest priced models. It looks brilliant even in a bright room, where I currently have it employed.  This set is also performing very well as a monitor for my Dell Dimension computer, incredible desktop workspace with 1366x768 resolution...even more is available as I recently discovered upon hitting "F11" (Windows XP). I compose and surf comfortably with my antenna signal as PIP in the lower right hand corner, PIP plenty large enough for any sporting event (maybe not hockey).  Eagle Shipping was impressive. With free shipping, I received a call within 6 days stating my set was ready for delivery.  A 4 hour window was set up the next Saturday (10-2), I called at 09:30 to verify, the service rep radioed the driver, and his truck was sitting in front of my house already, waiting until 10 so as to not arrive too early.  Box and set were in pristine condition.
