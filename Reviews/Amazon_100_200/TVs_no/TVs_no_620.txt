I purchased this tv 3 years ago.  After two and a half years I had trouble with a cold start.  Then it would not start unless I plugged and unplugged it multiple times.  I found people on the internet with the same issue and they said to take if the power saving setting and always keep it plugged in.  Well this worked until I need to move it.  When I plugged it in I spend a couple of hours trying to start it, no luck.  There is a yellow light on the front that just keeps blinking 3 times in sequence.  Found out this is a common problem and requires that the power board mostly needs to be replaced.  Of course Toshiba knows of no problem with this model.  This is the first tv I have ever had that stopped working.  Goggle this model for problems.  KEEP AWAY, DO NOT BUY ANY TOSHIBA PRODUCTS.I finally took it to a repair person and he just updated some firm ware in the TV.  Cost just $50.00.  I was going to throw it a way.  Best $50 I have spent.
