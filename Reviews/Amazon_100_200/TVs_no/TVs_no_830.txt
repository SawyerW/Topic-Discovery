I bought this tv mainly for playing my xbox 360 video games in HD.  And it was worth every cent.  While it's not top of the line by any means it's price can't be beat for the quality of the product.  As for watching regular tv on it it's not so great, the images are usually too dark and you have to do a lot of adjusting but I don't subscribe to hd tv so I can't say that the images wouldn't be improved if I did subscribe to it.  As for gaming on it I love it.  While once again it is a little dark, I've had no trouble with ghosting and the audio is great.  So my recomendation is that if you're a gamer who has a very small space to game in and want to see your games in HD then this tv is a great buy.
