ok, as another person stated, i've also tried expensive lcd and plasma monitors. same issues...blacks aren't quite black enough...ghosting on fast moving images. i finally took a friend's advice and looked at the 30" wega monitor (didn't need the 34"). wow, words can't describe the incredible picture...blows away the best lcd and plasma monitors. the drawback as others have pointed out is the weight...and i'm sure the electrical costs.i didn't think to ask a tv repair person for their opinion given today's disposable-by-design market, but i got the advice another person got...the sony wega hd crt screen is probably THE best high definition monitor on the market. sure, lcd/plasma give you the cool factor, but the bottom line is no lcd/plasma monitor can beat the picture quality or cost of a sony wega hd crt monitor.buy it...marketing hype aside, thes is the intelligent choice.don montalvo, nyc
