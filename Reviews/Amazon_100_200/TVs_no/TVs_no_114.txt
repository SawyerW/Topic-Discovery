this tv is just flat out the best for its price. i compared it to the 30" sharp aquos and the specs on the olevia are so much better than that. i just got mine in yesterday and TV works great, no dead pixels, sound is clear, and works perfectly fine. the only downside on this TV is that you need to buy a seperate HDTV tuner. HDTV-ready does not mean you plug it in and its HDTV. you would need to buy a seperate tuner and thats the only down side of this really. but other than that its just one great machine. i highly recommend you to get this product only because its half the price of the other brands.
