So I'll be the odd man out here:  I didn't purchase this tv through Amazon.  I heard too many horror stories about how the shipping was a hassle with delivery time windows.  Most worrisome, though, were the bad stories about the warranty on the tvs.  You're basically putting your tv's life in the hands of the mfg's.  I didn't want that so i bought mine from BestBuy and got their warranty which works great since I live right down the road and a 4 yr contract was only a few hundred dollars.  So, the tv itself rocks!  It's not the latest model (at the time I wrote this) but it much more elegant looking than the shiny plastic new model right now.  Picture's great, cost is amazing (mine with 2 HDMI cables, warranty, high powered surge protector AND upconverting DVD player was only $2500 from BestBuy).  So, regardless of where you get this tv, it's definitely a great buy.  Kudos Samsung!
