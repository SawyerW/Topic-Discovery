Hooking this up for someone as a montior either primary or a secondary clone.  I read the manual for the TV and it lists the 1360 x 768 as the "Native PC resolution (and the graphics card is fully capable of displaying that resolution) and detects the TV.  However when I switch from 1024 x 768 (which fills the Samsung 32in TV screen to 1360 x 768 I get the black bars on the left & right.NO PROBLEM I THOUGHT>  I'll just adjust the screen dimensions (but in PC mode they are locked.  So WTH?  Why print something as the native resolution for it and have it squished up, Also why lock the picture size option in PC mode?HOPE SOME ONE CHECKS BACK & can tell me what the deal-ee-o is?Do i just have to live with 1024 x 768 (while not the worst... i'd like to compare to a full viewing of the 1360 x 768 if I could.Thank you.
