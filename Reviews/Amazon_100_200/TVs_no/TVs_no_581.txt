I bought this television 4 months ago at circuit city as an open box item for $700. It was an amazing deal, though I cracked the thing last night moving it through the house. Even though I had a three year warranty on it, CC won't cover the crack. It was great while it lasted... Very sharp picture with the ps3 hooked up and incredible color and brightness. I'm going to miss it a lot. Definitely recommend it, but always shop around for the best deal. Do your research and you might just find as good a deal as I did! And make for damn sure that your warranty covers accidental damage!
