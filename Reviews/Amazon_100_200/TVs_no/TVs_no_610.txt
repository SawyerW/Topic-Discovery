I'm very satisfied with my Toshiba Regza 37".  Amazon sold and shipped it, and the whole process went smoothly.  The TV takes only a few minutes to set up, and navigation of the menu is very easy.  The picture is amazingly clear, and the sound is actually rather good!  It looks great with a XBox 360 hooked up; I can finally see everything that is meant to be seen in-game.  Even hooking up a VCR (to watch some History Channel Color of War tapes) looks superb!  The TV picture options make the 1940's color footage look like it was shot to fit the wide-screen.  I researched a lot of other HDTVs, and couldn't help but land on this one because of the overall quality and price.  It's a great looking TV that's perfect for the first time buyer!
