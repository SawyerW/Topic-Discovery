One star for good looks and one star for good price, one more star for nice job on delivery.  However, no picture, sound only with some digital noise, buggy remote, waiting on pickup for trip to repair shop, missed watching my favorite bowl game on HD.  I guess they don't fully test these units before shipping, service man said he was backed up and will get to it as soon as he can, over a month since I ordered it, the delivery process is slow and repairs look slower.  If you are in a hurry, forget it.  I will update this if it gets fixed before the remainder of the playoffs. (- a star for missing nut bowel game)
