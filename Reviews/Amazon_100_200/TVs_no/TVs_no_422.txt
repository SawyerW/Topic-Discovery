Purchased this TV because my wife wouldn't let me get a bigger unit for the Living room. She thought 32" or more would be overpowering. So, as usual, I let her have her way. This TV was well recommended already and I have always had great luck with Samsung Electronics in the past (Video, DVD players, disk drives, monitors). It performs well and for the price is a great set. We have it hooked up to DirectTV and the picture is crystal clear digital and our Playstation 3 performs terrific as a High Definition Blue-Ray player. The only drawbacks are that the screen background is not that black, at least not as black when compared to a Sony high-end set. Also the viewing angles are a little limited and the sound is a little wimpy from the built in speakers. However, most people now have in home theater systems so that point is probably not very important. All in all, a dependable tv for a reasonable price. Not exactly the best, but definitely above the rest.
