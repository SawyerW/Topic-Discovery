This TV is simply amazing.  I originally bought this tv from circuit city as an open box for $1400 with few scratches on the panel.  Their orignal price was $1709 + tax(8.25%)  At the time, it seemed like a real bargain.  2 days later, i went online and found it on Amazon for $1299 Brand new, free shipping and best of all NO SALES TAX!  So i took the chance and made my biggest purchase online.  I called ECL and arranged to have them ship it to me a day earlier so i wouldnt have to take off from work.  They were great!  Nobody was home at the time delivery so they called me and waited outside for 30 minutes until i got back home.  Tv arrived in original MFG box without a single scratch.  So far tv works great!!  My only complain is with the speakers.  But the picture quality is simply great.  I returned the open box tv back to circuit city. Overall, I ended up saving $100 (500+ over regular price) AND got me a brand new tv!!!
