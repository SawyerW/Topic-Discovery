If you want to pay big bucks for the LCD and Plasma craze, then go ahead.  I myself purchased one of these and I'm sorry that I did.  Biggest misuse of funds I've ever made.  The picture quality on digital (non-HD) channels is almost unwatchable.  The HD channels are nice, especially for live sporting events, however there aren't enough true HD channels out there yet.  These LCDs are still quite heavy and you need a haning device the size of TX to hang it from your wall.  I'm going to stick with my large and very heavy CRT.  The picture of any CRT will beat an LCD or Plasma hands down.  I'm sure many will disagree with that statement, but try a side by side comparison for yourself and you will see through the hype.
