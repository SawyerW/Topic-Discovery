I bought this TV in 2005 around holiday season. Initially was very happy with it. However, just like in so many other stories, about 16 months after I bought it, the TV mad a couple of loud popping sounds, and I never saw anything on that screen again. Zenith (LG) support wasn't very helpful, short of directing me to local authorized repair shop.Given that it was out of warranty, I did not expect it would be just taken care of, but I honestly thought they would offer the board, and I'd gladly cover the labor. Given the number of similar reports, this has to be a manufacturing/QC problem, and hiding behind a (fairly short) warranty in these kinds of cases is not acceptable. That may be ok for a Walmart-brand $9.99 alarm clock, but not for $2500-3000 product (which was their discounted retail price at the time of purchase).I'd stay away from this particular model, and LG/Zenith plasmas in general (personally, I will stay away from their products period, but I can see how LCD line may be a different story).
