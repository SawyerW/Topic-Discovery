We just got this cd a week ago and so far we love it. It has all the connections that you need.  As always if you want the best picture use the best connection, in this case the HDMI.  Our cable box works flawlessly with this tv using an DVI to HDMI connector, which sends a pure digital singnal to the TV.The picture is great.  The colors are vibrant and have excellent contrast. This display is bright! Because our bedroom is dark and the tv is relatively close to our viewing area it almost hurt our eyes, we turned on the energy save to low level which decreases brightness and the display is still brighter then others I've seen. That means this TV should function well in well lit rooms as well.If I had any compliants is that the sound quality and output level is not very high.  In our case this isn't a problem because we have it hooked up to a mini-hove theatre system.
