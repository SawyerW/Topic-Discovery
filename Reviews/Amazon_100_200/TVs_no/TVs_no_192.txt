This is my first tv from Sony, and what a doozy it is! I purchased a HDTV for playing my Xbox and Gamecube in high def. Most games on the market right now support 480p, and some games even support 1080i! Even though only a few games support THAT resolution, my console games look really good in 480p. There is such a big difference in picture quality...it's astounding. The major reason though is that the next gen consoles will support HD as well, with all games running in at least 720p. Can't wait for that.Cable looks great as well. Channels that are 1080i in widescreen are freaking increadible. Normal channels...so-so. Sometimes they look pretty good, but the picture is a bit on the grainy side.This is a great HDTV. Even though the price is a  bit steep, I think it's well worth it. Remember to buy component cables to watch tv and other devices in high def. Channels that support HD are amazing, and my games are awesome. Get the 34 inch model if you're in a bigger room though.
