Purchased Dec of 2004 and have been using it for almost 10 years and am currently using it as a large screen monitor for my desktop computer.  It cost me $1350 at the time when LCDs were far more expensive that they are today.  Very nice build and nice design, with attached speakers that can be mounted on the wall away from the computer if desired. Breaking it down over 10 yrs of usage, it cost me approx $135 a year + a one time $80 for an inverter card that I replaced myself.  I did have to replace the inverter card last year 2013 to fix a black screen problem.  Cons of this TV is cheap remote control and low contrast video that cannot compare with the brightness of screens today.  But all-in-all, it's been a very reliable TV and I will continue to use this TV/Monitor until it finally gives up the ghost, who knows when.
