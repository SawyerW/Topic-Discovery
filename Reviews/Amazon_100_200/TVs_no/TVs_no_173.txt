I have to say at this point. I love this TV. Syntax must be listening to their cutomers because they have changed the remote and the new remote is much better than the old one.  I think they may have tweeked the TV a little  so it works better than the older ones. The picture is  much better than expected  from my cable signal. The images are clean and sharp and the colors are great. I found that I had make sure all my wire connections were good to the get a good picture.  The DVD image is also great , but I am more amazed with how nornal cable TV looks on this TV. I have been looking for a LCD TV for some time now  and have been reading tons of reviews and going to several stores and thought I would take a change on the Syntax. I have to say I am more than happy with this TV at this point.  Next I will see how the PC will look on the TV.
