This is my second Samsung.  I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26" Samsung.  Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed.  It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions.  It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit.  Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available.  Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane.  Returned it and bought a 32" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more.  Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing.  HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32" set on the market.  Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32" Samsung.
