got this tv as a christmas gift for my family,  initially there were problems with the set,  when i called samsung,  they were going to send out a service tech to replace some internal mechanism that appeard to be flawed,  but i found this unacceptable to have a "fixed", new t.v.  i called amazon, and with no issues,  was sent out another t.v., and the old one was repackaged by the delivery crew and sent back to amazon.  no problems encountered by me what so ever.  new tv works great,  good picture/sound,  and i love the big screen....so,  i guess not only is it a good tv,  but amazon did me well, too.
