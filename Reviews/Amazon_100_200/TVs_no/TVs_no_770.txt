The technical performance of this TV seems very good. The features clearly make this a very versatile product and the price is right. But be certain to carefully look at a photo of the product before ordering. The design is quite "mod" and I found that the shiny plastic enclosure detracts from the viewing experience; while the picture is great, the black frame reflects any light source that's in the room. I guess from years of having Sony products I was expecting a more subtle enclosure. My fault for not looking more carefully. So if you have a modern house or apartment this set might be perfect. But you might choose differently if you are in a more traditional environment or might be bothered by reflections from the frame.
