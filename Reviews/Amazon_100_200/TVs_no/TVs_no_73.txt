I researched LCD TVs carefully before buying the Syntax Olevia LT30HV.  There's not much info out there on this set.  Fortunately, I was swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon.  This TV has a great picture, looks nice, can be used with or without its side speakers, and is one of the cheapest on the market.  HDTV and DVDs look absolutely fantastic.  Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).  I recommend this TV highly and will definitely consider Syntax when I am ready to upgrade.
