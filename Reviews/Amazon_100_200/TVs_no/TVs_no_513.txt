I'm very happy with my choice of 32" LCD TV.  It looks very smart - shiny black stand and edge of screen, I like how the speakers are hidden away and don't make the TV wider than it needs to be.  The picture is superb with HD digital cable.  I haven't played around with the settings, I found the picture type I like and that's it so far.I ordered it online on a saturday evening, and I had it delivered to me the following Thursday, very impressive, and ahead of the expected delivery date from Eagle couriers.  The only negative point is that they only deliver tues - fri with a window of 12-6pm.
