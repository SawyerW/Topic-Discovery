When I ordered this Samsung HDTV, I had no idea what to expect simply because I had never seen a true HD picture. Boy was I blown away when I turned on the Yankee game and saw the pores on the players' faces and each blade of grass. The set is beautiful and the inputs are numerous. I don't know why Cnet and Consumer Reports didn't like this set very much but I am here to tell you that this set is amazing! The only thing is: Be careful with burn-in. Don't watch it a lot with black bars on the left and right. If you get this plasma, make sure you have HD programming because it is as good as any HD picture out there!
