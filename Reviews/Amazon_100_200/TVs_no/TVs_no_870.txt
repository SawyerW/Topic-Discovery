Good:- Picture looks amazing when true 1080p contents are played- Picture still looks amazing with 1080i upscaled DVD (HDMI)- One of the least annoying LCD monitor for the fast motion- I see no banding- Very flexible inputs (8 total including TV tuner)- Very easy to change settingNot so good:- Sounds horrible (original speaker system and built in amp are practically useless)- Analog station looks annoyingly fuzzy (no way to overcome this yet?)- Less expensive or old DVD player looks annoyingly fuzzy (over S-video or component)- Color reproduction is somewhat unnaturalI take 1 star off because sound quality is totally unacceptable for me. There is no bass and no clean treble. The mid range sounds so distorted with or without surround activated. I took original speaker system removed and connected external amp and small 2 way speakers right away. But this may not be an issue if not audiophile.  I have got everything I expected from Sharp for now and hope this would last for 10 years...very good indeed.
