I bought this TV from a local electronics store.  Seeing as it is a 2004 model, the salesman gave me a GREAT deal.  About $600 less than I've seen it online.  For the money, it can't be beat.  The picture quality is very good, especially with Discovery HD Theater and my Xbox 360.  Setup was easy, plenty of inputs for all my electronics.  Really, the only complaint I have is that the remote with the TV doesn't work with my DirecTV HD Receiver, and the DirecTV remote doesn't have codes for the TV.  Go figure.  But if that's all I have to complain about, then I'm pretty pleased.
