I ordered this from Amazon but it was actually sold and shipped by 6th Ave. Electronics in New Jersey.  Had it at 8 days after ordering.  The TV is amazing...I have it hoked up to a PS3 for full 1080p...Blu-ray movies look better than I expected.  Best part of the deal...paid less than $900 for this unit shipped to my door and everywhere else it sells for at least $1200 plus tax and shipping.  Amazon continues to impress me.One Warning:  Read the return policies before you purchase!!!  Different sellers have different policies.  I found this model TV for the same price from multiple sellers on Amazon.  I ordered from 6ave because they were the ONLY one who had a decent return policy.  See other reviews for details.
