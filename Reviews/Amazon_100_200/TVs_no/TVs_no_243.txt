As usual, I buy something the impress the Mrs, and end up apologizing for not letting her see it before I buy it, although I attempted to explain that the stores are showing the TV's running special DVD's for display, and not local broadcasts.I replaced my 14 year old 27" JVC CRT TV with this LCD and what a dissapointment. When playing DVD's thru the DVI connection it looks great (so would any TV), but the regular broadcasts are terrible. Factory defaults are bland and bright. If you turn down the brightness, skin color turns either a sharp pink, or the opposite, a sallow yellow. No happy medium.Same goes for the aspect ratio. It really only looks fairly decent when you set it to 4:3 and takes the "stretching" effect out.This will probably end up as a "very expensive" computer monitor since watching TV is uncomfortable, or on EBAY.
