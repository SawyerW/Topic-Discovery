This is a great tv. I have never reviewed a product before but i feel like this one deserves it. I bought this tv so that i could play  xbox360 at home and at school. It is an awesome product and shows vibrant color and picture. There is no lag when gaming (that i have noticed), and the game mode on the tv helps with color and picture as well. I am very satisfied with this tv. the only gripe i have with it is that it is very expensive and soaked up half my summer earnings.  this is an great flat panel it is only too bad that i cant mount it on the wall at school. if you dont have the dough for this tv you may want to look at some slim fits, good hdtvs, half the price.
