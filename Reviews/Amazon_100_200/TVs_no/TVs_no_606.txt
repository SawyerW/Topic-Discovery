This LCD TV has an excellent picture and the sound is very good as well. I bought this TV about 3 or 4 months ago, and recently got the HD package with DirecTv and love it! The difference between the non HD channels and the HD channels is amazing, especially with football and movies. You can't beat the price of this TV for what you get and it looks like it has come down about $50 since I bought it as well. The size is very good for those that are used to a 32" TV as the measurements seem to be less than those on a tube TV. It doesn't seem that much larger than a 32" TV, but the picture seems quite a bit bigger since it is 16:9 widescreen. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to spend $1500 for a TV on some of the brands that think they are better and charge $500 extra for the name.
