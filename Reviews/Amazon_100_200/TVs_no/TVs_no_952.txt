This is a great television.It will be beautiful on any entertainment center and the stand that comes with it is more than adequate.  As with any hi-def television, hi-def programing is really what you need to get the best picture.  I'm a huge soccer fan and watch the EPL all the time, but the games are a little grainy (same with football and b-ball).  Movies are fine and dvds are great, but it was the hi-def programming that really makes this television shine.  I know hi-def programming is extra and I didn't want to pay for it at first, but its worth it for this television.
