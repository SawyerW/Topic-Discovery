This television was wonderful (great picture, great black color, nice features) for 2.5 years and then it just QUIT (died) without any warning.  I called Samsung toll free to try to diagnose and they said there was nothing that could be done.  So, at the time of purchase this t.v. cost me $1,000 and it lasted for 2.5 years.  DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.  Beware of this model - walk away from it and buy something else.  I will probably never buy Samsung again because there is no way I could trust the brand after this.  (Coincidentally I also recently bought a Samsung external DVD drive for my laptop and that too did not work - fortunately I was able to return that and get my money back).
