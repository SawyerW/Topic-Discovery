As to the issues with the blue light: it can be set to turn off when powered on, turn off when powered off, turn off all the time, or remain on all the time.As to the issues with the startup melody: it can be set to play at different volumes (or not at all) when turned on.I've had no problems with extra white bars around the screen.The buttons on the side are very cool, just touch your finger to them and they activate, nothing to actually press down.The quality of the picture is very good.The user interface / menu is pretty bad.  There are a lot of simple features that require lots of paging through menus rather than pushing a button on the remote.  If you want to listen to the sound from the Picture-in-Picture, you must walk through several menu screens to change it.Finally, the picture in picture only displays the antenna input when the main screen is in a different mode (PC / component in).  You cannot watch TV on the main screen with your PC input shown in the PIP window.
