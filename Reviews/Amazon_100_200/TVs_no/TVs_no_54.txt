Plasma buyers beware. Before you plunk down the BIG bucks for a plasma TV, look for other ways to spend $ around your house or take a vacation instead. Plasma TVs are underwhelming when all is said and done. Wide-screen programming is virtually non-existent, and resolutions are awful when you try to watch converted analog signals or stretched screens, also very dissapointing to view the dead-zone sidebars when you can't fill the screen. I spent 4Gs on this Panasonic and two months later the entire image skewed off the frame, needed a technician to reprogramme the bios (on site), ughhh, after hours of wasted support calls to both Panasonic and to my cable TV provider (both apparently ignorant about the issue). Wide screen TVs look best in the store.
