I have this TV for about 2 weeks now and watching HD I can say i'ts really amazing picture Quality. I have DirectTV HD and we watched Discovery HD Theater on new Samsung Plasma. It's breathtaking impression of how good picture quality is. SD picture comparably to HD it's like 20 years old Oldsmobile to new Lexus. I just wish to have more channels with HD content.Amazon service and price are very good. They delivered on time, put TV on stand and waited till I turned TV on. Since I purchased TV, Amazon dropped price 2 times and when I called asking for the credit, they credited my Visa, no questions asked. By doing so, I saved another $105, I recommend everybody to check the price for any item you bought on Amazon afterwards; if price dropped, Amazon will give you a credit.
