I bought this TV in 12/06. At that time it was advertised as 1080i resolution and 15,000/1 dynamic contrast. This is what I got. However, I now read where the item is listed as 768 resolution and 3000/1 contrast. Something tells me samsung reserves the right to alter specs on an item after it is released. Needless to say, the TV I received is magnificant regarding video (5-star). The audio would be rated 4-star as I get a vibration if I turn it louder than 1/2 way up. I don't care because I have a 5.1 surround sound system hooked up to it. I hope everyone got the same spec tv I got (1080i-15000/1) but I'm afraid they didn't. If I rated MY tv anything lower than 5-star, I'd be lying. It's a great tv. (LNS4041D)
