And was it ever worth it! This TV is, in a word, incredible! We were shopping for a 32 inch TV and we kept going back to look at this set. Nothing else even comes close. The picture is perfect. We love nature shows, and you will not believe how they look on this set. We got a progressive scan DVD player and, Holy Cow, I am blown away every time I watch a movie. The TV has more features and hookups than you will ever need. I will not get into all the technical jargon, because once you see the picture you will want this set! Definitely the best available right now. My only criticism is that the speakers are small and not all that dynamic, but no matter since this TV begs to be hooked up to an amplifier. Expensive, but absolutely worth every cent.
