I bought the Zenith 50" plasma 14 months ago and from the looks of it, these TVs don't last more than that.  Last night our TV made a huge POPPING noise and that was all she wrote.I now have to battle with Best Buy and convince them to give me another brand or store credit. I bought the warranty for the TV ($399 for 4 years) but I don't want this TV fixed. I want a different brand.I can't believe that their isn't a recall on this item. The internet is full of this popping problem.Wish me luck on getting another brand.
