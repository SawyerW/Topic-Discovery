I just bought this HDTV for around $1270 and all I can say is WOW!!! I saw the same tv in the store for 1599.00 + tax. YOU can't beat a deal like this (and I just checked it out today and the price keeps dropping :/ )If you're looking for a great HD TV you should definitely get this one, it's got the best picture in any HDTV I've seen so far. (I've had 2 others).I highly recommend this TV.Shipping blows though. If you get stuck with Enroute shipping GOOD LUCK. Probably the worst shipper I've ever dealt with, pleasent people but their customer serive bites and you CANT track your package. I also had to pick this package up from a warehouse because it was to large to deliver... :/ whats up with that? Great TV though!
