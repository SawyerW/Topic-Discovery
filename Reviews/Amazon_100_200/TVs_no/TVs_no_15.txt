I've had the tv for 2 weeks now and I love the picture quality especially w/HDTV signals.  Even the look of the tv is great because it doesn't look like a big square against you wall.  I only have two complaints.  1.  When watching an hdtv signal you do not have the ability to adjust the screen size (i.e. 16:9).  Some hdtv stations broadcast signals on their hdtv channel that are 4:3 ratio. 2.  It needs to have at least 2 HD Component inputs instead of one component and one RGB input.  It's difficult finding the RGB harness at an affordabe price.  This only is a problem if you are planning to watch hdtv (with hdtv receiver) and a progressive scan dvd player.  Other then these two issues, this is the best tv for the money.  Highly recommend purchasing.
