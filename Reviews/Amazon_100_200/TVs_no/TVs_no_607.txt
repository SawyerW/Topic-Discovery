After seeing this at Circuit City I checked Amazon and found the price MUCH lower.  The picture was so much better than others in the store, so ordering it here was a pretty easy decision to make.  After a great experience with Eagle, Amazon's shipper, and hooking it up I was amazed at the quality for the price I paid. I was anxious about dealing with delivery, but having someone bring it to my house and help unpack it was less stressful than other TVs I've bought where I had to load a big box in my car, haul it in the house, etc.I use mine to watch digital channels with the QAM tuner.  In addition to the great picture (especially on HD channels) it has great channel handling and flips through channels reasonably quickly.  Overall I'm very happy with this TV and the Amazon experience.
