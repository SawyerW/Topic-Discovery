This is a great TV, especially for the price.  I have an LCD and a DLP, and assumed the picture would be roughly comparable.  Not even close.  This set blows away the others.  For less than $1500 (I think it is now down to closer to $1300), you will be amazed at how remarkable the picture is.  As noted by other reviewers, the sound is also surprisingly good.As between the 5064 and the cheaper model, I would go for this one, even if you don't need the anti-glare screen.  The Wiselink function that works with the USB port is great.  It seemlessly processes .jpg and .mp3 files to create unbelievable slide shows with background music.  Your high-megapxel family photos will look absolutely outstanding on this screen -- clearer than your 8" digital picture frame.Buy this TV.
