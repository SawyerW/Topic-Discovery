The product is great, I have no complaints at all about the TV. The shipping company received my package 5 days from the item will be shipped by date. On the shipped by date I called them to find out what was going on. They acted like they had no clue it was there. Then when they found it they said it would be another week before they could get someone to my house which was only aprox 17 miles away. Long story short I went and picked it up myself. I emailed Amazon about my problems with no responce.Track your package and follow up with the shipping company! The carrier was EGL Shipping AKA Eagle.
