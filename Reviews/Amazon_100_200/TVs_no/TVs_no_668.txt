This is an excellent TV there are no reflection on the screen at all ever!  I would buy this TV again in a second and recommend it to a friend.  There have been some negative reviews and I am suspicious of who is writing them.  I am just a regular shopper, and I did a lot of research and this is the best TV for the money out there.  People who write crap make it a lot harder to make decisions.  For example they talked about reflections of light on the front of the screen, as I said above there are no reflection at all, none.  My old TV is sitting right next to the samsung and it is full of reflections.  Also the sun shines on the screen sometimes and the picture looks excellent and I have it set to max energy save mode.  In conclusion I wish people would tell the truth about products so it is easier to select them.
