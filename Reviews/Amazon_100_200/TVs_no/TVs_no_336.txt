This is my first HDTV.  I didn't see this TV in stores before purchasing it from Amazon. I went by the very helpful reviews and the overall features that fit exactly my needs. I ignored one comment on Cnet "image quality has a hard time keeping up with the best flat panels" and I am glad I did. The image quality is just incredible. The design is so slick, the screen so bright and the colors so real. I tried it with the regular Dish Network "digital" channels adjusting the ratio to 4:3 and the image and resolution is so much better than my old TV 27" Flat screen Zenith projection TV. I also used it with my high def DVD player and the image is just unbelievable. I hooked up my PC and the TV turned into a nice giant LCD computer monitor with a resolution of 1366 x 768.
