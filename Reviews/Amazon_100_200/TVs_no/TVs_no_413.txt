And it seems great.  OK, the analogue input may not be brilliant, but I don't think its worse that what I got on the older TVs we had.  And the picture with the DVD with digital input is fabulous.  Sound is fine also; the controls and the menus are intuitive and easy.As long as it holds up, I'm going to be very glad I got this one.Two small complaints:  the manual left out something about hooking up the dvd that I found on the samsung website - you may need to change the player's mode of output if you are starting with component cables.  AND it took me quite a while to find out how to use the codes for other devices.  OK, you input them, but how??  And what was said doesn't seem to work.  But given the quality of the set, I really don't count these as worth any minus points.If you get stuck at some point, try the samsung website.  Go to this model and look over at the right hand side of the screen and you'll see something like "TV help".  Tons of standard questions, manuals, etc.
