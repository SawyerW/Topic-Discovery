BEST LCD ON TODAY'S MARKET FOR A FAIR PRICE.  EXTREMELY SHARP PICTURE-VIVID SHARP COLORS-NO FADE OR FUZZY PLASMA EFFECTS.  SIMPLE SET-UP AND THE NEW PLASTIC PIANO CASE HAS THE MOST MODERN LOOK OF ANY LCD TV I INSPECTED PRIOR TO PURCHASING THRU AMAZON.DELIVERY WAS FLAWLESS THRU EAGLE LOGISTICS--I PICKED THE SET UP FROM THEIR DFW AIRPORT WAREHOUSE WITH VERY COURTEOUS SERVICE (THEY WOULD DELIVER TO YOUR HOME BUT SOMEONE MUST SIGN FOR THE DELIVERY).THE TV WAS A PRE-ORDER FROM AMAZON, AND WAS SHIPPED A FEW WEEKS LATER THAN THE ORIGINAL SALES OFFERRING.  IT WAS FREE SHIPPING AND ARRIVED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE SHIPPING NOTICE--FANTASTIC!SAVED $600 VERSUS LOCAL CIRCUIT CITY PRICE--THE WAIT WAS WELL WORTH THE SAVINGS--PATIENCE PAYS OFF WITH AMAZON AS INTERNET PURCHASERS ARE LOOKING FOR A DEAL.  AMAZON HAD A PRICE REDUCTION OF $100 DURING THE SALE AND APPLIED IT TO MY ACCOUNT.THE SAMSUNG 4051 40 INCH LCD HAS PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR AN AVERAGE ROOM.
