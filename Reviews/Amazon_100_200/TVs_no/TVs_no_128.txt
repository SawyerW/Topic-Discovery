I bought this around December 2004.  Initially I was happy about it because pricing was good for that time and it had several good reviews.  Performance was very good in the beginning.  After a few months, a problem started, everytime you are watching a bright scene (i.e. an explosion, a really white/bright scene like snow) the screen would turn to blue (like a computer).  It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.  It progressively got worse until turning it off and on didn't work anymore.  Around early 2007 we gave it up for dead.
