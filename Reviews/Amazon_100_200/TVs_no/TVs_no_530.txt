Replaced my rear projection Wega with this unit and I am pleased with the TV except for a few items.The ambilight is wonderful, some people see it as a gimmick but i find the viewing is much nicer and adds to the room.  Maybe a light behind the TV would be as good, but I don't think so.The picture is sharp and crisp and the different formats make viewing non-HD channels that much easier.The speakers are in need of an upgrade they are tinny and have no bottom, if not for the surround system, this TV would have went back to the supplier.  In addtion there is no way to turn them off, with the SONY I could turn off the TV speakers and opt for the output only which helps in TV watching.All in all its a great upgrade.
