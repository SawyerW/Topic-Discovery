I found this TV an excellent choice. It was very easy to set up and the instructions are nice and clear. Using the HDMI connection let me use just ONE cable for audio and video and was well worth the cost to cut down on clutter. I'm not a big AV maven so I was a bit surprised by all the options you have to adjust the picture quality but the  manual explains the choices well.The picture is very sharp especially on DVDs as you would expect. Broadcast quality varies from channel to channel but most HD channels look very good.The design works well too. Having the speakers underneath rather than on the sides saves space and makes the total width very close to the 26" screen. The sound quality is also very good.All in all I am pleased with this purchase.
