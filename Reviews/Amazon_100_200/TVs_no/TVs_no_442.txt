This is our first HD LCD, and we are very pleased.  Great looking unit; easily wall-mounted; versatile; and decent (although not fantastic) speaker sound.  We have encountered a High Def problem with Direct TV -- who indicates they have a compatability problem with Samsung.  According to Direct TV, this unit does not carry the most current chip (which reportedly costs only $[...] more) for the Direct TV HTML feed.  Instead, we were advised to use the composite video connections.  Not sure whether that is the truth, or a Direct TV "urban legend".  As to delivery, packaging, service, etc., Amazon.com lived up to our expectation.  And the price was more than competitive.  We would recommend a "buy".
