This Toshiba projection TV was the best that I found. Nice picture and great sound. The TouchFocus set the conversion just right. It has plenty of inputs of different types. I was a little surprised that it had no digital audio inputs however. I would have expected to find an optical audio or coaxial audio input. However since I was running my audio though a surround sound system as well as the TV, it was no big deal. There is HDMI input instead of the more standard DVI interface. You have to buy a $129 converter cable to use it. The DVI cable is close to the same price.The menu driven interface is easy to use and setup was a breeze. I got it the same day I received the new Star Wars box set from Amazon. I really love it. The main thing that I was a little disappointed with was the thick scan lines. They're really noticeable on a dark screen. Not too bad but it may take a while to get use to it.
