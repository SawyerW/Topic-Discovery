I don't think you can get a better Plasma  panel television for the price of the Samsung. I spent about a month researching and comparing plasmas at local stores and reading reviews before I settled on the #4253 Samsung. All I can say is WOW! The look and feel of this product is right up there with the Pioneer Elite with it piano black finish. I hung my plasma on the wall, so I had to remove one of the most beautiful TV base supports that I have ever laid eyes on. I have not even hooked up a HD feed yet, but the SD channels are clear and crisp. I do not claim to be a videophile, but I do know what looks good and for the amount of money that I spent on this TV I am elated. Once again Amazon.com rules and will always be the first place I shop.
