This is a fantastic TV for both the quality and the money. The 720 actually has a better picture than the 1080. The 1080 blows out the whites quite a bit and didn't have as good deep blacks. It comes with many high-end inputs and the look is great. I would not trade this TV for any of the more expensive ones if someone offered to swap. Frankly, the picture is undeniably sharp and I watch a lot of sports in HD. Let's just say I've really been enjoying the NBA playoffs this year. If anyone is thinking about taking the plunge into the HD world, you can not go wrong with this TV. I'd be happy to respond to any questions but if you go look at this TV and compare, I think you'll be sold.
