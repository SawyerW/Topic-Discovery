While the picture quality is great, the remote is barely useful. The range is like 3 to 4 feet! Thank goodness, I have a Harmony universal remote to the rescue. The IR unit on the LCD unit may me poor. CATV broadcast (not digital but straight out from a coax) is horrible, as expected. However, I will be getting HDTV soon. Hopefully, that'll be better.UPDATE!!!!: Syntax has fixed the IR unit my TV! Now it's working flawlessly from long ranges! They're customer support and on-site warranty repair is awesome! HVTD on this LCD at 720p is great! So if anybody is having problems with finicky remotes, contact Syntax and they'll gladly fix your sets.
