I got the LC37D43U on 5/30/08, by Nov it had a red line thru it from top to bottom. I called Sharp for warranty service, they came out and said the screen needed to be replaced. It would be 10 days. I called them 25 days later and found out they had not even ordered the part yet. In the end it took 7 weeks, they replaced the TV today.Pros:The PQ is fine. Colors good, chrisp imagesGood remote compared to others, easy to use menus.Good sound for TV speakersCons :Quality, it should not fail in a couple of monthsLOUSY customer service, NO follow up, no calls...zeroThe tuner is slow to change channelsThe side HDMI connections are not easy to connect to unless you  have a small handSharp is famous for having banding issues on larger setsReccommend ; The Samsung 37" instead. It is a better TV ( I've seen it ) but was not available when I got the Sharp. Not many choices in 37"
