I bought this TV back in 2003. Just yesterday I got rid of it. Had a descent picture and was one of the best pictures out there in it's time. The 4:3 mode looked best. 16:9 was too small and the border lines were distracting. Hooking up a game console showed it's limitations as scan lines and other anomalies werealways present.About a year ago I started having intermittent problems turning the set on.. No picture just a pop.. but sometimes it would work fine.It got to the point recently where it wouldn't turn on at all.. Found out that sony had a problem with 2 chip sets on the main power board. A common problem.I was deciding whether to fix it or now.. After shopping around.. I purchased anLG LCD 46" TV which BLOWS away the sony in every aspect.. It was 1/4 the price and 1/10 the weight.Tube technology is history.. thank goodness. The weight of this TV is ridiculous. In retrospect.. I would not have bought this TV.
