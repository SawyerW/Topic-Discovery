...For me, this TV is everything I want and more. Great picture? Check. Spend a little time learning how to calibrate it or buy the excellent AVIA disc from Amazon. Great sound? Check. It would sound better connected to surround sound, but it does a pretty good job in my living room? Easy connections? Check. About a million of them, including component video, connections in front for video camera or games, and the (boo hiss) DVI - the latest copy protection [stuff]. But if there is copy protection [stuff] coming, you'd better have it. The TV looks great in any room - not cheap particle board like many. Good remote. Easy to set up. I have nothing bad to say about the JVC ... so if this is what you're looking for, easy and good, you've found it.
