I purchased this television over christmas and I was very dissapointed with this Samsung tv after reading all the great reviews.  The picture leaves much to be desired.  I experienced a significant amount of noise thorugh a variety of inputs including component and hdmi connections.  Edge definition was sharp but was plauged by digital interference.  I calibrated the picture using the nice array of availiable settings but this did nothing to help the poor definition of the picture.  Over the air hd lacked the definition of other sets I've viewed.  The color and contrast was fairly good but clarity is not this television strong suit.Overall the picture is good but plagued by weak noise filtering resulting in a less than perfect picture, and if your going to pay for it, then it should be perfect, nothing less.I purchased a Sony Bravia 40" 720p and though it has its own weaknesses I would recommend it over this set any day.
