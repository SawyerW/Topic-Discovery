I bought this TV for me and my wife's bedroom and it did not disappoint. The HD PQ is amazing. The TV also looks so good hanging on the wall in the corner of the bedroom. Even SD channels look decent. I would definitely have to recommend this TV over any of the 1080i Samsungs that are the same price. I used this wall bracket Sanus VisionMount MF110-B1 - Mounting kit ( wall mount ) for flat panel - steel, extruded aluminum - black - screen size: 15" - 40" - mounting interface: Yes and it worked fantastic. The TV not only gives you an amazing picture but it is a beautiful piece of furniture that will add a modern look to any room of the house.
