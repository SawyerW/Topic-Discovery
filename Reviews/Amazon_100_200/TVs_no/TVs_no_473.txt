I'm not gonna write an in depth review on this thing, but I did want to share my thoughts with those of you who are weary of purchasing a TV of this size with Amazon.  Gotta say that the whole shopping/shipping experience with this TV was pleasent.  The TV arrived about a week after I ordered it, and was delivered in perfect working condition.  The TV itself is beautiful, and blows the Sony LCDs out of the water. My favorite part of shopping with Amazon was the overall 500-600 dollars I saved from getting this baby at Circuit City or Best Buy.  And on top of that, it was tax freaking free!
