I spent 8 months reading and waiting and watching the 3 bext LCD tvs in the 46" arena. And it was SOOO worth the wait!I weighed the LCD TVs in the areas of HDMI connections, contrast ratio, response time, refresh rate, and a few more -but most importantly watched the price every week from August '07 to March '08!The top three brands were Sharp, Toshiba, and Sony using only the top of their lines in the 46" arena -and watched and waited as all three prices dropped significantly after early Feb (Super Bowl) and saved my self over $1,000!Will update this review after 2 months of using the new TV.So far:No banding problemsGreat picture after calibratingVery poor speaker system but adequate if temporaryEasy to assemble stand and speakersAboslutely NO glare at allGreat viewing anglesEasy to hook up: DVD, Cable box, Game system
