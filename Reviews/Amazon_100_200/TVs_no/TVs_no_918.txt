After looking and searching for 2 years for Flat Panel HDTV's, my wife and I decided on the Samsung HPT5064. The television has surpassed all of our expectations. The other thing that was amazing is the service from Amazon. When we ordered this TV, it was offered with free shipping. We ordered the TV on Friday morning, it was delivered to my house Tuesday afternoon--- WOW!!Back to the TV......Some of the reviewers have wrote about certain issues that they have with this product, we have not experienced any problems at all. I would recommend this television to anyone. The design allows us to use this , as the centerpiece in our living room. It has more than enough Inputs. The menu system is very easy to use and configure. Viewing from 9 foot and back, the picture quality is phenomenal. If you are close, 3 feet or closer, you can see a difference between other resolutions (but who watches tv that close??). I watch alot of basketball, the clarity that this brings to my viewing, makes it even more enjoyable.
