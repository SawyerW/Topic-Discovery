Bought this back at end of December.  Worked OK until end of March.  Then electronics failed with buttons on TV not responding nor the remote working.  As only 19inches, warranty repair requires sending this to New Jersey for repair (am on west coast).  So, shipping there was a week, in repair for 2 weeks and then 1 week back.  All was ok for 3 weeks and then the power just goes out at different times!  All that Samsung will do (supervisor, a west coast rep also) is the same repair - this time 3-5 days to just get a shipping label, 1 week to send back, 1-2 weeks for repair, and a week back here.  I asked, what if it breaks again the next day --  send it back again!!  Would stay away from this TV or any TV that requires sending back for repair.
