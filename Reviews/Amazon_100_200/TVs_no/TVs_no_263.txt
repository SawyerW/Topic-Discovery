We bought this TV in February of 2006 and have had it for a year now.  It was side by side with a Panasonic HDTV and the picture was comparable.  Maybe a 5% difference in sharpness but once we got it home you couldn't tell any difference.  My brother has a 46" Samsung HDTV CRT and the picture on my Sylvania is hands down better.  Of course thats comparing CRT to Plasma.  I am running Digital cable with the HDTV package thru it and the picture is stunning.Cons: - Speakers are horrible but I have it hooked up to surround sound.  - The remote is to basic.  It has everything you need to run the TV and adjust it but it just seems cheesy.  - No HDMI connection
