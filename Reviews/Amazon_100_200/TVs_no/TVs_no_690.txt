Picture quality is amazing in HD, standard def can look very good too depending on the signal. The built in QAM tuner is really impressive. If you are a cable subscriber, definately try a direct hookup and scan for channels. I found dozens of digital channels (some I didn't even know existed), basically anything thats unencrypted is yours to watch. I could almost go without a cable box. It also works great as a PC Monitor, but if you are sitting far away you may have to bump the resolution down or increase the font size dpi to make the text readable.Minor annoyances, the remote seems slow to respond. The unit gets hotter than I expected but not hot like a plasma, the black piano finish attracts dust like crazy.  The speakers are not really bad in my opinion. I was able to get a great deal on this set with the free Samsung upconvert DVD player, free delivery and no sales tax. The delivery from CEVA was top notch, no problems. Best electronics purchase I've made in quite some time.
