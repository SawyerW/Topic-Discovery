Hello, This is my first HDtv purchase. I did some research, accually I did a lot of research. I get really fussy if the price is over $50 for anything. I went to many sites: retail, in my neighborhood on the web and sites that reviewed HDTVs. After specing out what I wanted and how much I was willing to spend... I went to the reviews. Samsung fit the bill and Amazon offered the best price!.It's a beautiful piece of furniture when it's not on. And when it's on it's brillant. The colors and sound are great. Again, I did stop by a local store and compared the picture quality with other brands and even higher end units. I found it to be best considering price, size, quality reviews, features. The features such as the 2HDMI , pc input , 2 component inputs and of course its built in ATSC & NTSC Tuner a must. -SUPER [I cant say anything about gaming.]It's been a month and I'm not disappointed. Free Shipping and perfect condition.very happy
