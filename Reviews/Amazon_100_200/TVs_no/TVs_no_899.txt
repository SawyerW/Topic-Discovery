First off, let me say the price I paid from 6th Avenue was a sheer bargain! I looked, and looked again at many many 32s. I narrowed down a couple and then looked some more. I sell Samsung and Panasonic. They don't even hold a candle in the same $$ range, some of the higher $$ units paled as well. Contrary to popular belief, high contrast ratios really do not matter, its a selling tool used by manufactures and SOME retailers. You would be surprised what that 15,000/1 contrast will end up being when the TV is tweeked correctly. This tv looks better than the Samsung LN-T3253@ $1000 and even looks better than the LN-T4065 from Samsung as well@ $1679. The green are more true, the blacks are deeper and I notice much less digital noise. I would put the Sharp Aquos TVs up against Sony and the Boys and day of the week. The sound on this unit is pretty dang good as well. If you are looking for a 32in, and you want 1080P, which are few and far between GET THIS SHARP! I mean it. It's a killer in the $2000 TVs.
