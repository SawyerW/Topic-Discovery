I wouldn't change a single thing.  The thing I was worried about most was how well the T.V. would handle fast moving shots like sports.  It does it perfectly.  My older, 32", Sony Bravia XBR, has little boxes that appear occasionally on fast moving shots, and I have seen several other brands do this as well.  I am happy to say that after 10 days of viewing this new set, I haven't seen any boxes.  The other thing I was worried about was how well regular T.V. (non HD shows) would look.  Some sets can make them look really bad.  Not so with this Sharp.  It makes them look so good that if the TV is in one of its stretch modes, my wife and I frequently have a hard time telling if the program is in HD or not.  Lots of shows look that good.
