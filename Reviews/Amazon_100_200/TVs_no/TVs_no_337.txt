This is a fine looking tv.  When it arrived the delivery men took it out of the box and set it up for me which was a nice service.  I was very suprised at it's high glossy black finish but I immediately fell in love with it.  It gets oohs and aahs from all my friends that have seen it so far.  I have the samsung upconversion dvd player hooked up to it and the picture is incredible.  I haven't got the HD cable box from the cable company yet but I am looking so forward to seeing the HD cable channels on this TV.  My only complaint (and it's not that big of a deal) is that when the dvd is playing the volume goes down quite a bit as compared to the tv volume.
