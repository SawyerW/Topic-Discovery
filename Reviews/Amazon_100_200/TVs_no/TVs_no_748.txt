Do not buy Samsung TVs.  After a year or two (after the warranty expires), I (and many other people -- review online blogs) have had the capacitaor fail on the tv. The result is a clicking noise when you try to power on, as the tv continually tries to recycle. It takes 5 minutes, sometimes more, for the tv to start, and it constantly clicks. Samsung is well aware of the problem and is refusing to fix it, despite numerous complaints from many people. The customer service is just awful. If you buy this or other Samsung tvs, beware, because your tv will last only as long as the warranty and then you are on your own.
