I just received this TV yesterday from Amazon. The "mail order" transaction went without a hitch - ordered on Wednesday and delivered on Monday. The TV is flawless, and the finish is one of the nicest I have seen. I almost bought the LC-46D82U but when I saw it, I hated the plastic thing on the front of it. The "92" has none of that and is a very high end TV.The comments on the speakers is true. I turned up the bass and they resonate. No big deal for me, because I have the TV surrounded with a Klipsch 5.1 system.I'll post a follow-on status after I have played with the TV for a week.
