LG (Zenith) Z50PX2D 50 inch plasma is bad product. Bought mine on Jan 22, 2006 and last night POP! No more picture, just like many others. I bought the 4 year extended warranty from BestBuy (thank goodness). I have mine wall mounted with good ventilation.POP again in early December 2009 - removed wall mount after first time but didn't have any impact. Bestbuy replaced the plasma display and circuit boards this time ($2300 repair) but after they did we can't see anything during dark scenes (like Ironman in the cave - looks like green mud on screen).Now extended warranty is expired and we have zero confidence this will not happen again in another year and a half.
