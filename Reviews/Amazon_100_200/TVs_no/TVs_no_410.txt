I've now owned this TV for 4 or 5 months now. It's great and I wouldn't want to buy any other. I've thought about even getting another one of these tv's (same series by Samsung) for the bedroom.I like that the console (outer shell) is a basic black rather than a glossy black as this does not distract from the picture, but rather adds to it and even makes it look bigger than it really is.With the excellent sound, picture, and adjusting capabilities, I have to note and inform future buyers of this product as a vertical black line (all the way from top to bottom), has appeared on my screen on the right side where the FULL SCREEN black bars would begin. When watching regular television, I like to put the mode in full screen rather than wide since I don't like the stretched out look. However, a line has recently appeared and the it's only on the right side (not the left). Just to pass along some information as I was seriously dissapointed when this occured.
