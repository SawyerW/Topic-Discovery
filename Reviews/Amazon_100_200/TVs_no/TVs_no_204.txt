I GOT THIS TV AT A STEAL FROM  A CIRUIT CITY DISCOUNT OUTLET FOR JUST 890 DOLLARS IT WAS STILL NEW AND IN THE BOX.I HAVE HAD IT FOR A YEAR NOW AND STILL CAN SAY IT LOOKS AND WORKS BETTER THAN THE NEW SETS IN THE STORES FOR 2500 DOLLARS OR MORE.I HAVE MY COMPUTR HOOKED UP TO IT AND THAT IS SO AWESOME I STILL DROOL ON IT WHEN I USE IT THAT WAY MY COMPUTER HAS BLU RAY SO I WATCH BLUE RAY ON IT AND IT IS AWESOME. I HAVE A SAMSUNG HOME THEATER HOOKED UP TO IT AS WELL AND THE ANY NET SYSTEM MAKES THEM WORK AS ONE UNIT THRU THE TV'S REMOTE. WHEN PEOPLE SEE THIS SETUP THEY ALWAYS LOOK DUMBFOUNDED WITH ITS SLICK OPERATION.IF YOU CAN STILL FIND ONE BUY ITYOU WONT BE SORRY.
