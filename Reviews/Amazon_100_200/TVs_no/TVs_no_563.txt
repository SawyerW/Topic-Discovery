My Toshsiba 42" Regza got a black shadow line on the right side of the screen and then got one down the middle of the screen.  My TV is less than a year old and I had a repairman come out and Toshiba refused to fix it under their 1 year manufacturers warranty and my extended warranty told me it was still Toshibas problem.  After haggling with Toshiba for over a month Toshsiba only agreed to pay for 60% of the repair.  First of all for the price of the TV, I should not have had a problem for years and second of all Toshiba should stand behind their product.  I ended up calling the corporate offices of the place where I bought the TV and they agreed to let me take back the TV and get a different one.
