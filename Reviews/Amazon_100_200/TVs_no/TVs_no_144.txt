I bought the TV from CompUSA for 699 (after MIR).I got the product home and since I did not have a HD reception I connected it to my DVD player. Since it was DVD and I know the resolution difference between the DVD and HD, the quality was acceptable.Now that I have HD reception from my cable provider (Comcast), I find that the quality of DVD and the HD channels that I see now, is almost identical.Since one would buy the HDTV for picture quality, if the difference is not significant, then spending the money over such a product in my understanding is useless.I would discourage anybody thinking about this TV.
