-AWESOME- picture.  There is a lag when I change channels, but I don't flip channels much (I use the guide and that works just fine) so I don't really notice it.  I have a Wii and I noticed a lot of lag when not on Game mode, but this tv remembers what mode each input takes so when I switch to the Wii now it goes right into game mode and, while I think there's still a little lag, i don't really notice it once I'm into the game.  Anyway, 4 stars because of the lag thing, but the picture is terrific, and the sound is just fine for in TV speakers.
