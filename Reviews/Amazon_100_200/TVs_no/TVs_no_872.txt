Overall very pleased with this 1080p HDTV.  It works great with Comcast DVR cable box for hi def, it delivers perfect 1080p picture from Toshiba HD DVD player, and the DVI worked fine with my VGA outputs on my laptop using a VGA/DVI adapter plug.  Putting my videophile hat on, in rare circumstance I can spot the "banding" this set is famous for, which reminds me a bit of seeing the northern lights in a dark sky.  But no set is perfect, and that is a small tradeoff for all the other well executed features.  Note there are no side inputs, and speaker does detach which made it fit a spot I had which only had 31" of vertical clearance.
