We have enjoyed this TV for 3 years, and counting.Starting with the "cons", the sound quality could be better as it sometimes has a tin-can tone to it. Switching inputs has a slight delayed response and it sequentially passes through all 7 input types so if you hit the button too many times, you have to go back through the list again (though more slowly). Also, obtaining the remote control codes for universal remotes is a pain in the neck because so few inexpensive remotes support the newer 4 digit IR codes used by Olevia.We like the TV very much and have never regretted the purchase, even despite the cons listed above. The only reason we would not purchase another one is if we needed a different size screen, otherwise, we are totally sold on this model & manufacturer.We've never had a failure on the TV but I have to qualify that by saying I'm an avid believer in using UPS on my expensive high tech items like computers & TV's so the power has been protected on my unit 100.00% of the time.
