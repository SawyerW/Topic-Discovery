The ideal economy HD set. It's chock full of features and has a handsome, non-reflective console. The default picture mode can be a little dim for me, but you can adjust the brightness. It also seems to run a little hot, but that's probably the case for all flat panel TVs. Antenna strength could be better, but heck, at least it has one.Full disclosure, mine broke down after 5 months. But Samsung service has been pretty good. Customer service was pleasant. They sent a repairman out to my home that same week. After replacing some components in the back, it still wasn't working, so they sent me a new set the following week.
