I purchased the 27" Olevia this past weekend at a great price [...].  I had been considering the LCD option, but wanted value for my bucks.  After much research, and reading lots of reviews, I decided it was time.Brought the box home and immediately it was up an running.  The stand is already built-in, and only needed to hook up the cables.  Factory settings are pretty off target.  After some minor tweaking, this thing was blowing my mind!  I knew the images would be better than on regular tube TV's, but I was not prepared for the magnitude of improvement.  The "Two Towers" extended DVD played beatufully on this TV.  I did not imagine how much detail I had missed at the theater!.Today, I hooked up the laptop with the included VGA cable and was able to read an electronic newspaper on this thing from my couch.  Had to set the screen to 4:3 for best rendering.  I'll set up a screensaver of my best family pictures tomorrow.  I can't wait to explore all the features of this great piece of electronic wonder.  So far, I'm ready to throw out the box.  This one's a keeper!.
