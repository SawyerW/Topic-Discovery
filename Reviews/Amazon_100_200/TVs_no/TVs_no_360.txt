Pros - I didn't know that I could get so many High Definition Channels with nothing but a standard UHF antenna, no need for cable, satellite, anything.It's HUGE!!!The picture is excellent!It has a video game mode, and dynamically adjusts the picture size based on what our watching, very cool!Cons - High definition satellite or cable costs ALOT!!!  Way more than I thought.  My dish service doesn't let existing customers use their promotional offers, so I would have had to buy an HD satellite receiver and paid the premium HD programming cost.  But on the good side, standard dish signal looks pretty dang good anyway.DVDs are Beautiful!My existing dish network shows look pretty good.Plasma makes blacks much blacker, but LCDs don't burn in, and they don't degrade over time like plasmas do. And since my kids play video games on it as well as watch TV, I needed LCD.Video Games are HUGE!!!  Now I have my kid's friends over all the time doing "Halo Parties" on the big screen.Definately worth the money.  I'm thinking of getting a second one.
