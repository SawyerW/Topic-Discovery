After looking around for a while, having a good friend recommend this set and then reading every one of these reviews, I was ready for a great picture and maybe less than perfect sound.Maybe I've done something wrong, maybe I expect too much, but inside of three feet this TV seems grainy.  I have a HDMI connection.  I was hoping to see "blades of grass" on the football field, or the clear expression on a college b-ball players face while running for a fast break.  It's not here.While in HDMI mode, the other channels are compressed to an effective 27 inch screen, so you have to switch back to "cable".  I know other LCDs adjust automatically.The manual is not really that enlightening, so I am writing this review hoping someone writes back "that guy is an idiot, and all he had to do was.."But absent that, it feels simply okay.
