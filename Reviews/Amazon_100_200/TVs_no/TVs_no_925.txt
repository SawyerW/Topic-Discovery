I have had this tv for about a month now and it is better than I expected.  There was no problem with the set being delivered, which was my only reservation about ordering something this big.  The delivery service brought it right into the house and opened the box to verify that there were no problems.  They would have connected the set and checked to make sure it functioned correctly had I been ready for it to arrive.  It came 3 days earlier than estimated.I have had no problems with any of the inputs, including the computer and wiselink ports.  They all function with no problems.My only issue would be that the factory default settings really emphasize the greens.  I had to tone them back to get a realistic looking picture, but that was very simple.  This could also be from me being used to a 17 year old, 25" tv.I would recommend this set to everyone looking to upgrade to an HD tv.  Amazons price cannot be beat.
