I have had the same exact problems as CJ.  The first one I ordered developed a very high pitched noise that was very noticeable.  It disappeared when the backlight setting was turned down to 5 or less, but above that the noise was not acceptable.  I called Samsung and they acknowledged that this was a defective product, so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement.  This 2nd product had the same exact problem.  Seeing as how no one else had reported this problem on Amazon or elsewhere, I decided to try my luck with a third one, but this third one had the same problem.  I too tried different outlets, and also even tried taking it to a friend's house to test if it might be my house's wiring, but it still made the noise.  I am going to return it, unfortunately 3 times can't be a coincidence.  Its too bad, because Amazon has the best price on this product, plus no tax and free 1 day shipping with Prime.If it were not for the noise, however, I would give this product 5 stars for its design and quality of picture.
