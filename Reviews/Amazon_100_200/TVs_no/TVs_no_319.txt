I too compared the panasonic and over many weeks made the decision to go with this samsung; I have to say its great!! forget all the mombo Jombo stuff people talk about, like pixation and saturation points.  Basically the picture is so sharp and so clear and so real with colors; its just the best! Buying it through amazon was a pleasure.  If you buy a plasma at the wonderful walmart (sarcasm) they give you curbside delivery; meaning they will drop it at the curb or in a garage and goodbye.  Amazon had it brought into my home; set it up on the stand and took all the boxes and garbage away!! very pleased with amazon and this recent purchase! good job!
