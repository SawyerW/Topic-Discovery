I purchased this TV in August 2006, and it quit working around March 2008. (less than 15 months!) Apparently Olevia utilizes the substandard Darfon V144 back light inverter board.When the board goes, so does the TV. Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $200. But why invest that amount, when you can add another $200, and purchase a new and better TV.I'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand. I guess that's why you see so many of them for sale online. And their either refurbished or open box. I'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability.Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Samsung or RCA product. Trust me; being cheap in the beginning, is really not worth it in the end. I learned the hard way.
