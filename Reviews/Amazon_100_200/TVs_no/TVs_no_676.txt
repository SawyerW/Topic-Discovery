This is a very nice overall tv.  It is very bright, has great contrast and a nice design.  The only problem I've had with it is some blurriness and pixelation with fast motion.  Decreasing the sharpness helped some but I'm not sure if the problem lies in the limitations of the tv itself(refresh rate) or something else like the source of the video (mine is HD cable TV) or some other setting on the tv.  That being said, this is NOT a significant problem.  You have to look pretty closely to notice it and it only occurs with fast moving objects.  Other than that, the TV has a spectacular picture.  I would recommend it and I would make the same choice again.
