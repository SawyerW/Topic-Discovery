I was one of the fools who had to have an HDTV when it first came out. I paid almost $3000 for a 42" Regza. Although I feel like a fool for not waiting for the prices to go down, this is an exceptional tv! No problems what so ever. Not only great for HDTV, gaming and the usual basics, it also has a mount for your computer. I have my pc connected to it with wireless keyboard and mouse, and have hosted many parties using it for music and videos and it's a big hit! Though I paid more than I should've, it is still worth it in the end. If this one breaks one day, I'll buy the exact same model. Superior!
