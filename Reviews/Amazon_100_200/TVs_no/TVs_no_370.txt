I got this tv just before christmas 2006. I got it from circuit city for $1299 + tax (after asking them to do a price match with fry's). I also had a $100 cupon of circuit city so i ended up paying $1199 + tax = $1330 for this brand new TV. It is fantastic. Setup is very simple. Colors are very bright but one problem that i face is with dark scenes. Dark scenes look very dark on this tv. but besides that the tv is excellent. I had to get monster cable to make DVD signal look richer on the television. Two thumbs up for this tv.
