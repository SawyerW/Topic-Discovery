I had second thoughts about this TV, due to some bad reviews out there about the sound quality and HDMI issues, but I have honestly not experienced either issues.I have been researching the 4061 since it first came out, and returned my Sharp Aqous just to get this TV.I ordered through Amazon, which went smoothly, but the problem was with Eagle Shipping.  They had lost the 1st set I had purchased, which of course upset me and I almost went with another store.  But I decided to give it another shot with Amazon.  The 2nd TV came in flawless by Eagle.  The guys were very friendly, and even the box was flawless.  No bends, no tears, not even a single mark!Unpacked the TV and set it up (you can set this up yourself, as the stand is already pre-mounted).  Hooked up the Antennae, Upconvert DVD player, and of course the wii, and everything ran PERFECTLY.  NO dead pixels, NO clouding, just a perfect set right out of the box!
