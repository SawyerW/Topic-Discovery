i can't recommend this if for nothing else because of their technical service. i bought it just 3wks ago. all of a sudden the tv stopped turning on even though it was being powered as indicated by the blue light at the bottom. called into customer support. all i got was a case # & was told a tech rep would contact me to schedule service. took 24hrs for a return call. next available date was 10 days out. they don't service after hrs or on wkends so basically i have to take time off work to wait without any guarantee that they'll be able to fix it onsite. no telling how much longer i have to wait if it needs to be replaced, but you have to wonder how good samsung's product is if their backlogged 10 days for service issues. everyone raves about panasonics & pioneers. maybe there's a reason for that.
