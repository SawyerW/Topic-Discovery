We purchased this item about 2 weeks ago from Amazon for about ~$250 less than we could buy it locally. All the reviews were right. Very sharp picture, just the right depth to black colors, very rapid response time. We previously purchased and returned same sized Olivia, Westinghouse, and Vizio models trying to find a quality picture and decent features. Some other models would not communicate with our satellite remote, others did not have the function to change the screen size. The Sharp Aquos is a far better product. After seeing the super crisp image through regular broadcast, we went and installed an antenna to get local channels HD broadcasts and the images on the Sharp are just incredible! Highly recommend. And recommend Amazon's highly competitive price!
