I've had the Samsung HLT5075S 50" for about 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy with the purchase.  Setting it up was as easy as could be.  The menu system is intuitive.  My XBox360 games look AMAZING on it.  I've never seen a 1080 model, so I can't compare the picture quality, but the 720 is fine by me.Are there any downsides to the TV?  I couldn't find any major problems.  When you turn the TV on, it takes about 30 seconds for the picture to fully light up.  The remote control also seems to respond a tad slow.  But these are minor issues.  Overall, this is a great TV.A friendly reminder: lightning surges CAN travel through a cable TV connection.  Make sure you get a surge protector that can also protect cable and your TV.
