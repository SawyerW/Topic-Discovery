I've had this TV for three weeks or so.  The screen is beautiful and the contrast is super sharp.  Standard def broadcasts look good but HD is absolutely gorgeous.  I've watched more movies in the past three weeks than I have in the previous year.  No kidding!  It is really cool to watch a movie in the original aspect ratio.  I love to watch the Kung Fu Channel on Dish Network.  Bruce Lee like I've never seen him!There are plenty of inputs and two HDMI inputs.  My only complaint about this tv is that I didn't find it earlier.  Go to the store and check out this tv and then come back to Amazon to buy.  I checked prices extensively for two weeks and this is the best deal by a longshot.
