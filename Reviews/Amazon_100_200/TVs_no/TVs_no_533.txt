I bought this tv 5 years ago and has been a great tv, but after 5 years it is time to upgrade.  This tv has seen a lot of hours of use on a variety of viewing settings and held up well.  It just recently started to develop 1 inch long 1/8 inch wide vertical lines at the top of the screen that only show in the dark colors.  That being said the average lifespan for an LCD tv is 5 years so I'm not terrible dissapointed, plus there is a lot better televisions on the market.  I love the ambilight but it really only makes a difference in a dark room or at night but does add to the atmosphere.  I would recommend this product if they still made it.  I had none of the problems described in the previous reviews.
