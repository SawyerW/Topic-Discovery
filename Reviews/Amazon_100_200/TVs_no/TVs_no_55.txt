The picture is very good with cable hd and dvd (both progressive scan and analog component hooked up to AV1). Only one digital input allowed. This is a problem if you have two devices, such as cable box and dvd. However, the digital input only accepts vga or hdmi, so all component feeds must be converted to vga with cable supplied by manufacturer. I think that one could get an analog switcher with video component input and outputs for not too much money. The picture quality degrades with analog signals, even over digital cable. On middle brightness settings, shading and details in dark areas are lost. Correction by increasing the brightness helps to a limited degree, however, you start to lose the deepness of the black and get graying/hazing. There are better LCD TV's out there with better pitcures and two digital inputs, however, they cost a lot more.
