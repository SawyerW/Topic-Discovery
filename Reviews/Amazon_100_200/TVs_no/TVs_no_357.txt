Buying a mail order TV was no problem. Delivery was prompt, (in town and scheduled for delivery in a week) and they took it out of the box and saw that it worked before leaving.  The TV has great features. You can select a screen size so you have no black areas on top or on the sides of the display.  You quickly switch between wide screen, normal, and two zoom screen choices. the picture is excellent and required no adjusting. I am just using regular cable now, not hdtv, but I may feed in a broadcast antenna later, and then I would have hdtv on those channels. We are very pleased.
