This is an excellent television especially for the price. Excellent picture quality from HD, SD, and DVD inputs. Good picture quality with VCR input. Color and contrast is excellent and viewing angle is also very good. This television has an attractive black cabinet with a nice gloss black bezel. Build quality appears to be quite good.Other impressive featues of this television include an easy to use on- screen menu with numerous adjustment options for picture and audio and an abundance of component video and HDMI inputs.I highly recommend purchasing a good quality HDTV cable kit to ease the pain of connecting all of the components to the TV (video games, VCR, DVD, digital cable box, etc.). I purchased a nice cable kit at a local wharehouse club for about $70 which had everying I needed to connect this TV.The TV was purchased from Amazon through their third party Beach Camera. Delivery was through Manna Freight. I had no issues with the service from any of these parties.
