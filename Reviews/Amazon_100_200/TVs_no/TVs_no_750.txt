I got this TV a couple years ago.  I'd looked at it in the store, and I thought the picture was OK for what I was willing to spend.  In addition, I have a 1080P Mistubishi, and 3 other 720P TV's in the house (I know - that's a sad commentary on our way of life ...) and this unit has the best picture of the 720P units (the others being a 40" Sharp a 32" Insignia and a 32" Dynex).  Most of our TV viewing is either DirecTV or DVD's.  The Samsung's picture is not quite as good as the 1080P Mistubishi, but its a close second and much better than the others.  For the money, this Samsung was a very good buy.
