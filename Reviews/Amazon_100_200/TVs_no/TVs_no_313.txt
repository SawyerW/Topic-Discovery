Samsung is dropping off a replacement tomorrow 2/18/2006 after service tech said the panel was defective - after 6 good months a buzzing sound could be heard even over nominal audio levels and I have a surround system. Customer service while worked to resolve the issue wouldn't have gotten to this point if I didn't call every week for an update and repeat the story over and over again after sitting on hold for 10-20 minutes.On top of that the 1 year warranty doesn't "reset" with the replacement TV so if this one starts buzzing in 6 months I'm screwed. That's the moment when the service tech pulled out a brochure on  Samsung's extended warranty program - what kind of BS is that?I purchased in July of 2006 was very happy with HD image, not too good with standard digital cable though- My 36" flat tube looks a lot better with standard cable.  Let's hope the replacement keeps quite. Good luck!Bottom line quality is number one in my book so I can only give it 1 stars and that's only because it had a good picture on HD programming
