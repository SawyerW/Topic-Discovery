This Sylvania TV while only a monitor, is a great value for the money.  It is the cheapest model in the 42" size that I was able to find in plasma.  It is my first plasma TV and I am very happy with the quality of the picture.  The sound portion of the TV I would rate as average.  I found a home theater system made the total experience wonderful.  This is a size that would compliment most needs in a typical home.  It can be wall mounted(optional bracket needed) or self standing with the enclosed footing.  I chose to build 15" shelves and have the TV free standing on one of the shelves.  This allows room for the Satellite receiver and the home theater unit and speakers.
