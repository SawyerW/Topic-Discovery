First, kudos to Amazon! My first unit malfunctioned right out of the box and Amazon immediately shippped me a replacement.  Great customer service!As for the television, it is superb. Packaging is very good and protective. Build quality is excellent. Performance exceeds my expectations.I am using it with Dish Networks hi-def service and the picture quality is astounding.  DVDs are crisp and clear when played from our Sony 6800DP Home Theater in a Box setup.We are also running an iMac Mini with Bluetooth KB and mouse into it via the DVI connection and the set functions perfectly as a monitor. We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.  Very nice!The only weakness is the speakers, which I removed since we are using the Sony setup for surround sound.I highly recommend this set.  For the money, you will be hard-pressed to find a better deal.  [...]
