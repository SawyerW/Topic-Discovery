I got this TV after reading the positive reviews here, and at first I was pretty happy with it. It looked nice whether on or off. However, it developped a super bright blinking red pixel in the center of the screen after about 3 weeks of use, which is impossible to ignore and has completely ruined my TV watching experience.I've tried reaching Samsung support but they always seem to be experiencing "very high call volumes". I was finally able to get through, but they refused to do anything about it until at least 10 pixels are dead, "like the warranty says". Sure, it says so, but what would an aribtrary number like that mean in terms of user experience? I would rather throw the TV away than having to endure another blinking red pixel. What this says is that Samsung doesn't care about its customers.
