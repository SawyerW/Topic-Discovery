Most clerks in the big box store will push you to buy hdtv wide screen. They are great but there is so little programming to see and the little there is requires a "STB"  that cost 700 buck. Add in Dish or direct tv plus to access local hdtv station you must put a antenna on you roof. So i  compared the major brand  look at the non hdtv by sony, mit and panasonic. I felt the tosh is cheaper by hundreds of dollar. Also has the best picture to me but you really can't tell until you set it up in your home. Mine's look great even on cable.You can find this tv online or check at bb after a holiday maybe as low as 1100.
