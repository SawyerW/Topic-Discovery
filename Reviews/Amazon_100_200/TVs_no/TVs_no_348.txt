We have had this TV for about two months and have no complaints.  The quality and features are very good.  You could spend a few hundred more if your are a purist, but I doubt that you would see much qualitative improvement. When you are looking at every pock mark and scar on a persons face in closeups, you sometimes think that maybe there is such a thing as too good.  The available media also needs to catch up with this technology.Buy the way, don't let anyone snooker you into an expensive cable. The one I ordered was late so I bought the monster mash at the city.  When mine came - back it went - absolutely no difference.  Likewise with the expensive HDTV antenna at the Best.
