After a long series of struggles on which tv to get, I finally came up to a conclusion by purchasing the lnt 4061. At first, I was hesistant about this tv, since I've read tons of issues about this model. However, for the price of $1200 (price matched by sears, can you believe it?), the decision was too easy for me not to turn down a deal like this. I hooked up my PS3 right away, and was completely blown away. It performed very well. Colors are very accurate although, the blacks can be improved. The one prob that I can point out though, is the blinking problem. This only occur when you use an hdmi. Audio/Sound is pretty lame, but most people buy home theatre system anyways so that would help a ton. I was really impressed with the 4061. Hooked up the upconvert DVD player using 720p still is jaw dropping. HD channels makes you don't want to watch reg channels. Non HD channels are very blurry with this tv. But I only watch HD's so that doesn't bother me.
