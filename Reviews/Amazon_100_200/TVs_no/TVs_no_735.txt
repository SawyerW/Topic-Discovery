I LOVE IT! After researching TV's for many months I finally decided to get this one over a comparable LG model.  Everything about the purchase and product was great.  TV came in 3 days, in perfect condition.  It was beautiful out of the box and setup took less than 5 minutes (after I finished rebuilding my entertainment center).  I decided on LCD because I have a lot of light coming into my family room, and there is never any glare with this tv.  I still only have a standard satellite signal, but it looks great.  The picture is clear and colors look amazing.  My decent DVD player looks great, as does my Wii.  Hooking my laptop up to the PC input allows me to watch anything online on a 40" beautiful screen.  For the price, there is no better TV.  I would recommend this model to anyone.
