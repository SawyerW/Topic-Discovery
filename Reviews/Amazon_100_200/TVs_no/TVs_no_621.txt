Amazon did a great job with my purchase and delivery.The picture is what I expected after reviews that I read on this web page and others.I am hook into Dishnetwork without HD and the picture is fine.I had some old rabbit ears down in my basement and hooked those up and pulled in Hd and digital over the air-nice picture! Then bought the Starship Enterprise from the shack and, it's remote control for an indoor antennna.I am pleased. Weather can effect it like wind depending on where the TV station is located.Might go to outdoor antenna after research but you can get true HD over the air and it is nice.
