What can I say that others havent already said? This TV is awesome, as soon as I hooked up the Monster HDMI Cable to my Cablevision DVR box I was ready to go, the picture is amazing, just a few tweaks here and there and you have gorgeous HDTV. The best programs are on HD Equator and NBC HD News. I also own the Samsung LCD 23" tv, but this one blows it away, the colors are vibrant and stand out above the LCD ( I noticed this at the store! ). I have no issue with the sound like others have complained about, maybe people just like it LOUD!!. I also got a terrific deal at Circuit City ( Around $999.00 ). I did alot of research on TV's before this purchase and I'm happy I did!
