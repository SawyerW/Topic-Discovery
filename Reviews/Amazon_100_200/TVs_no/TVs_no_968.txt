Got this myself about a year and a half ago at the brick'n'mortar yellow tag store. And have to say the value for this has been excellent. Especially after $1,050 I paid. Left some room for my killer 360 Pro w/ HDMI. Absolutely perfect picture, and all the connections are just added bonus.On odd occasion the set may give a fit, but a simple power down and reboot of the system's self test always fixes the bug. Haven't brought myself to flash through it's USB port....don't want to find myself with a 70lb brick. And no big deal hitting a simple switch on the surge protector.Paired with my 22" PC monitor from Westinghouse.....nothing but great value's for the money.Now if they would only come out with a 1080p 32" for my bedroom...
