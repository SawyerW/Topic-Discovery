A lot of the earlier reviews give great information on the TV, which proved correct.  Beautiful picture, no defects.  I thought the swivel function was 'locked' at first but discovered that it is just stiff - which is great because with the weight of cords behind it, it would not stay in place otherwise.  Screen reflectivity has been commented on and I have a window with vertical blinds at 45 degrees to the TV, and don't notice any problem.  Other than the frame, which is high gloss, does pick up highlights from the window and even table lamps.  I'm going to experiment with coating/covering it with something to give it a matte finish.As for tuning the colors, etc. I'm using it the way it came out of the box.  I might get into fiddling with options but for me, it looks great already.Update August 2008Well its already been a year and I still love the TV!  And I never did do anything about the glossy frame - it has "disappeared" from my view.
