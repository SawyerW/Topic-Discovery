So far, so good.  I received the tv about a week ago and I was extremely please with the price, the condition of the unit, as well as the delivery.  They delivered it to my house and were extremely considerate of my schedule.  The tv was as-advertised and so far I have not had any problems.  The picture is outstanding.  So, if you're not planning on hanging your tv on the wall I would recommend this Samsung DLP.  Additionally, it's very light (about 50lbs) so it's not difficult to move or find a place to put it.  I looked at the 1080p model of the same tv and didn't think that the increase in picture quality was proportional to the increase in price.  I think this is the best TV of it's kind for the price.  Not to mention that shipping is free and delivery is flexible and convenient.  I would recommend this product and seller to anyone.  Circuit City was offering the same tv for $500 more plus $60 for delivery.
