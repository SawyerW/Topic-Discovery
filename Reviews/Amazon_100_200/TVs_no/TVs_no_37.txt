I bought this TV when big screens weren't nearly as common.  LCD, plasma, and LED flat-screens just weren't easily available or too costly.  That was 2003.I expected this TV, like most CRT technology TVs, to last for at least 15-20 years.  It didn't.  That's a complete and utter failure by Sony as CRT should easily last decades.As to the performance - it was great sound and picture when it worked.  I have no complaints about the actual performance.  There just wasn't enough of it.That brings me to the real issues.  1) It's impossible to reliably repair.  2) Repairs are expensive even though the parts themselves are under $100 - Sony service is too costly and doesn't come with any useful warranty.  3) This TV is a monster to move or get rid of.  It's 325lbs just for the TV.  The stand adds another 100-ish lbs.  Getting rid of this takes a team of people.  AND - it barely fits through standard room doorways.Be prepared to spend a chunk of $ just to have this thing removed when it does fail.
