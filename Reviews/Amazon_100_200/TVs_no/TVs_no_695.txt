This is my first hdtv I have purchased, I have done a lot of research the last couple months trying to determine which hdtv is suitable for my needs. I wanted a hdtv that was excellent to watch blu ray movies on, but at the same time, I wanted a good hdtv for my ps3 and 360 since I am a serious video gamer. I was curious about the 120hz samsung, to be honest I did not find any difference between this hdtv and the same size with 120hz. I am sure later on in the future there will be a hdtv better than 120hz. But now I am satisfied with this hdtv for now. I have looked at the complaints about the sound being weak in that department, I do find it weak, but average. I will be getting a surround home system sometime anyway. I was originally going to get Sony Bravia series, but I wasn't satisfied with the Bravia as I was with the Samsung. This is a perfect purchase for anyone looking for a hdtv with a good deal.
