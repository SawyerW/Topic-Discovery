Purchased in August 2007... Dead due to faulty power supply April 2012.I called customer service today and inquired about repair, mentioning that I'd read the Class Action lawsuit they settled regarding the same issue in their LCD televisions. I was told they could send out a repair technician, but I would be paying for the call and any repair since my unit is out of warranty and NOT part of the Class Action lawsuit. Mine is this plasma model. (HPT4254) I find it very sad that the company knows about this defective part (used in many of their products) and refuses to support all of their customers. I will not buy Samsung again. I do not recommend anyone spend money on a unit that will likely only last 5 years. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied. Save yourself a headache and keep looking!I gave the two stars based on the performance of the unit until it died, picture quality, features and available input options. Definitely not the best out there.
