The TV is great, minus the fact that I received it with some dead pixels (bright green dot in the picture). I contacted Syntax their warranty policy covers seven pixels, so I contacted the vendor, the people I ordered through and they said I could send it back for a replacement. Oh wait, you ordered through Amazon, we cannot supply a replacement, you however can send that one back for a refund and then order a new one. Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV. My advise, when you buy this TV, BUY IT THROUGH THE VENDOR, not Amazon.
