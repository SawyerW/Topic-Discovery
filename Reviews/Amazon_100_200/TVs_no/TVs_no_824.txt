I love this tv, I usually buy Samsung, I have a 32" 3251D thats great other than crappy built in speakers. This Tv looks sweet and has great Std Def Picture, which seperates it from the cheaper brands. Most HDTV look great with HD signal but a good tv can handle dirty signals as well.This tv is the brand new model that has both tuners built in, I can watch HBO without a cable box cluttering up my bedroom. I thought it was going to be to small even for my small Bedroom but it worked out great. best 400 buvks I ever spend on amazon, they had the best price on this model.Havent had the bleed in problem mentioned, but all lcds have light leakage when no signal is present on an all black screen, its the backlight, this one has a pretty uniform backlight, maybe even better than the previous gen 3251D that I own. I also like the light at the bottom, it glows a nice shade of blue.This tv woudl be perfect at 300-350 dollars but you get what you pay for, much better than the vizio 20" at costco for about the same price....
