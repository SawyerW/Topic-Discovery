Just got this Sharp LC46D92U from a local store. I chose it because, it was at the time of purchase, the latest ASV LCD made at the Kateyama 2 factory in Japan with 4ms response time, 120Hz frame rate conversion and the new 5 wavelength backlight (all latest technology for LCDs). After trying it out for the last few days, I was not disappointed. I played HD-DVD movies at 1080p from an XBOX 360 Elite via HDMI and the picture quality was excellent! The blacks were black and contrast level was amazing. I also had to dial down the brightness because the preset level was at the highest. There were no banding issues seen. I did not see any dead pixels or any clouding issues. I am very pleased with this flat panel TV and would recommend it highly.
