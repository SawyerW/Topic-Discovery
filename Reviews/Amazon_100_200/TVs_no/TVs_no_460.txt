Bought this 3241D at Best Buy online, delivery, setup all OK. TV works well with HD signal, colors are sharp, contrast is good. Slight ghosting when playing back NBC-HD DVR-saved football game. This is a 720i TV, but when I set my DVR to 1080p, the picture becomes a bit clearer. It's a Nice looking TV. Sound is weak, but we'll eventually run it through the home stereo. In the mean time, the virtual surround sound kind of 'warms up' the sound so it's not so tinny. The two HDMI inputs are definitely a plus. I'm still skeptical of the whole HDTV thing. I mean, my 15 year-old RCA can still put out a decent picture, so why should I change? Also, the HD offerings of Time Warner are sparse unless you want to shell out some bucks. My family and I are not couch potatoes, so I may never fully use all the bells and whistles.
