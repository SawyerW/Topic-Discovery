With Hd tvs you need to get a hd box from your cable or satilite company or your pic is not that clear. When I got the tv the pic was not the best but after some adjustments it got better. But on mine after the tv is on for a while the tv makes this noise. The noise is like a long high pitch noise. Can hear it when the volume is low. It must be the something that produces the picture because when I mute the tv the noise still goes on but when i turn off the tv the noise stops. Other than that the tv is great, I got it on time, no problems with delivery, and i recommend that people also buy the warranty because something will go wrong later on in the future.
