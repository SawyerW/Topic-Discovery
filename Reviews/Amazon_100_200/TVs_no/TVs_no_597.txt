After having done plenty of research, I ended up getting this model at an electronics store for less than it could be had for online. It was manufactured in April, and I bought it in May. It's done everything I'd hoped for and more. Using the digital tuner, it can pick up four of the five local channels in HD without a cable box by doing a cable scan. When I purchased it, I declined the 4(3)-year extended warranty because Consumer Reports said that there are very few repairs needed in the first year or two. There wasn't one mention of dead pixels. My chance to get the extended warranty would expire in 30 days, so when I noticed 2 dead (black) pixels on the 29th day, I went out and got the extra warranty because they (UE) provide better coverage than Toshiba would. The pixels don't bother me that much, but knowing it'll be less of a hassle to get it replaced if any more show up gives me peace of mind, despite it costing a couple hundred extra.
