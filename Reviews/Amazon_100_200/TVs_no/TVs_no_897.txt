We purchased this LCD TV for our new 5th Wheel travel trailer.  We had deleted the builder's "upgrade" 26" TV but retained their articulating arm mount.  This unit fits perfectly in the opening in the entertainment center and we can swing it to view from the galley, dining table, or lounge.  In fact, the LC32D62U's viewing angle is so wide, we can watch it from the galley and lounge simultaneously.At the moment we have only a cable TV hookup with one hard drive/DVD recorder and surround sound but will be adding 2 sat receivers, one a receiver/recorder, and full HD programming from Starchoice satellite. We are looking forward to High Def viewing,  however, the analog picture is so good its hard to imagine the HD being better.Highly recommended.
