I'm a typical guy. I work all day and when I get home I like to watch a little TV. Well, with this Samsung Plasma I find myself watching more than a little TV. I bought this model at Best Buy a few months ago and couldn't be happier with the purchase. I compared the Samsung with other models that they had and quickly came to the conclusion that this was the best in it's price range (or out of it's range, for that matter!). The picture is incredible and it offers plenty of connection options including 2 HDMI inputs, and a composite input on the side of the TV if you need to connect your Video Camera.One important feature if you have kids is Pixel Shift. My son loves to play Video games and this helps prevent any burn-in by subtly shifting the screen every few minutes by a few pixels.HD channels look great as expected and setup was quick and easy. Looking forward to the day when ALL stations wil broadcast in HD.Jim
