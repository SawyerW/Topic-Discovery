I am very satisfied with this LCD TV.  It easily matches the ratings and claims I studied before buying it.  The functions, instructions and ease of setup are exemplary.  The picture is very good.I purchased the TV through 6th Street Electronics and was pleased with their performance.  They used DHL for shipping and DHL delivery was later than originally advised and handling was rougher than should be expected.  The product was packaged well enough, however, to withstand the rough shipping treatment.I got an extended warantee from Sharp.  I suggest this approach to anyone who wants such coverage, rather than using a third party approach.
