Bought this TV and loved it at first. About 3 months after purchase It developed a hum in the audio on the component connections. Called Samsung and they sent someone out who took the TV away and repaired it. Came back and had it now had a hum on the output side (going to the receiver) and 4 months later it also developed a problem with the screen (blue spot on the bottom left hand side). Called Samsung again. They sent out yet another (non Samsung Authorized repair center). They've had the TV now for over 15 days and no update from them. My advice to you is don't count on Samsung repair. They are worthless. Also, it should be known that this TV does not support variable output on the sound so you'll always have to adjust at the receiver (just a note). If the TV worked correctly, I'd probably give it a better review. It is nice, but if you have problems at all, you'll be in trouble. Buyer beware!!! Samsung will not take care of you if you have problems!!!!
