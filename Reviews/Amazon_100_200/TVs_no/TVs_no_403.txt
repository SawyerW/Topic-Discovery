I did alot of research before deciding of this samsung tv from Amazon. You will not find a better LCD TV for this price online or at any store. I bought mine directly from Amazon and was delivered in 4 business days. EGL delivered the tv and brought it in the house and placed it where I wanted. The tv looks awesome and the picture is good not great. I bought my tv to play Xbox 360 and I was blown away by the graphics. The sound is average at best so I hooked it up to my surround and sounds superb. The options screen on the tv are easy to follow and browsing is easy. TV has a video game component that makes the games look super real. I have dishnetwork and the channels look average I guess I need HDTV. Everything looks a bit scretched at 16:9. This tv is great overall and I don't mind those little distractions.Great Value 5 stars.
