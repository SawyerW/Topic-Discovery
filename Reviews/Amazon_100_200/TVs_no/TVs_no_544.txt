I recently purchased the 37" Sharp Aquos and am pleasantly surprised with its performance. This tv was a steal for under $900 with free shipping. If you do not have Direct tv with the HD package or an HD antenna you might be disappointed with the picture quality of regular cable television. The picture will look better on a 10 yr. old tv than an lcd. Get Direct HD package. The Aquos has tons of inputs and has a nice bezel. The built in speakers are fine, but if you love movie watching you should pick up a surround sound theater system. The shipping service was great! The package arrived promptly from FedEx home shipping and was well packaged. This tv is a must buy. I would recommend it for anyone who lives in an apartment.
