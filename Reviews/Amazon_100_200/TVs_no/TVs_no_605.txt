We purchased two of these Toshiba LCD TVs after I spent several months researching this brand/model and at Consumer Reports. They rated it as a superior set for quality, reliability, ease of use and overall quality of the picture and sound. We got rid of a JVC and an old Toshiba analog set in favor of this model. All I can say is that I am still astonished and pleasantly surprised at the crystal clear picture and sound! It is so clear compared to the reasonably good picture and sound we had on the old analog tube sets. And, we couldn't be happier with Amazon's good service, discount price and the on schedule delivery of our order which was free. Amazon and Toshiba deserve our five-star rating for this entire transaction.
