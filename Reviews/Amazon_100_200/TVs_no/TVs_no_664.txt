This TV worked great until shortly after the warranty expired.  Then every time the TV is powered on, it began making a clicking a few times before it turned on.  It started with a few clicks about a second apart, then the TV would turn on.  Then the number of clicks began to increase.  Now it clicks about 50-60 times before it turns on, and all you can do is sit there and wait.After doing a bit of online research, it seems that this is a common problem.  Evidently the parts that Samsung used to build the internal power board on are cheap and blow out after a year or so.  The only thing to do is take it in and get it fixed at a repair shop, which will cost hundreds of dollars.  Alternately, you can try opening the TV up and soldering new capacitors onto the board inside the TV, but you are doing this at your own risk.I'm very disappointed in this TV and will definitely go with a Sony next time around.
