I ordered the Samsung 5053 from Amazon and used the free shipping with Eagle USA. The box was in good shape when arrived, but very loose around the TV.  The delivery guy was very nice and unpacked the TV.  The brand new $2400 Plasma TV screen was shattered on both sides clear across the screen. The delivery guy packed it back up and now I have to reorder it, wait for a credit to my account, wait another 2 weeks for delivery.  Not the best situation to save a few hundred $$.  At least Amazon should send another TV by express and not make me reorder it and wait 2 more weeks and have the change of another damaged TV.
