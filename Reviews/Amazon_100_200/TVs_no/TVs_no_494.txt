Just purchased this TV yesterday at Circuit City for $850!, an amazing price. For a day's use I am very satisfied. When hooked up to a basic antenna I receive the local HD broadcasts, and the picture is absolutely stunning. I can't imagine what it will look like when wired to digital cable with HDMI. Analog broadcasts are not as bad as advertised. I actually find the picture to be pretty good, although it's hard to adjust after watching HD programming. The Samsung struggles a bit darker scenes, but this is natural for most LCD's. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and it proves that research and a quality name like Samsung is worth the extra buck. So far no complaints.
