I bought this TV for my own moderately-sized bedroom and I sit pretty close to it.  That said, it still looks amazing.  I'm a gamer and I have Xbox 360 and Wii hooked up in component (red, blue, green cables), Playstation 1 and 2, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, and Xbox hooked up in composite (yellow cable) with a system selector (sold seperately), and a Sega Genesis hooked up in coaxial (RF adapter).  The picture on every console is fantastic, even the Genesis.  The 360 looks especially nice because this TV puts out in 1080p even with component cables, where many TVs, including Sony Bravias, only do 1080i though component.In normal words, the TV looks great, even sitting very close.  Every game system looks amazing and TV and movies look equally fantastic.  There's nothing bad I can say about this TV, and I don't believe I could've picked a better product for my bedroom.
