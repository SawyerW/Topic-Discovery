Before placing review I read others and there were some that said it was a good picture but needed a lot of adjustments etc. I am a senior, I purchased my unit from Circuit City. Wife and I brought it home (back of truck) unloaded it I had it hooked up and running 20 minutes tops with DVD player/recorder and Dish network setup. I did have to spend time getting colors etc adjusted. I have never purchased any electronic equipment that did not need adjusting to suit my needs. When I was done I had a TV that has very good SD viewing through dish and I just added a HD-DVD player to the mix and it is mind boggling. I have no complaints.
