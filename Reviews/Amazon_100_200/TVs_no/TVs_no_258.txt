I got this bad boy for $699 which is the most killer deal ever....they posted the price incorrectly something and after they processed my  order tried to cancel it, I had to reorder it at 899 then they gave me a 200 dollar credit...it's pretty darn sweet TV....as the others said definitely needs surround sound, but for any normal person it gets excellent resolution, for the TV freak, it's not the best of the best....one great thing is that it has great color, 16.3 million and its a plasma so the darks are darker and the lights are lighter.....definitely a good deal for anything under 900 dollarsUPDATE to July 2012:Badboy is still rocking...the color quality is definitely lacking now....still good pictures but the darker colors tend to blend...I've got three other flat panels and an Epson 8350 projecting on a 150" screen so no worries...have this 42 incher in my bedroom...just got the new hopper system and have a joey hooked up to it...only complaint is no HDMI input...but back when I bought it in 2006 there weren't a lot of TVS with HDMI....back then it was all about the Component Video...hahaha....how times are changing :)
