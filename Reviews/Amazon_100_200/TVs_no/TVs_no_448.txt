First, let me say I'm not to terribly particular about audio/video stuff but there was one of these TVs in the office as a computer monitor and I'd seen them in the local stores and they looked awesome.  It's a fantastic value; the picture is outstanding for TV or DVDs.  If you live in or near a major city you don't need cable or anything like that to get the same picture you see in the stores for your local channels.Get the Indoor Amplified TV Antenna with this TV and you'll be able to get local channels broadcast in HD just fine.  They look awesome on this TV!  If you have more than one TV on the same channel, one with an HD antenna and one without, they will be receiving two different signals so you'll want to make sure multiple TVs if you have them, are all on HD or not.  If you don't, you'll get an echo.The sounds is really good, the remote is top-notch, the picture is great, the TV looks slick and it is a great size for just about any room.
