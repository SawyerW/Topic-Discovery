Honestly, I could not be happier with this TV.  It is incredible.  It has a beautiful finish, a BEAUTIFUL picture, great sound, plenty of inputs, etc...PROS:  Crisp, Clear on HD content, lots of inputs.Cons: Could be better at upscaling 480i content (but this is a very tough job to do)**People, this TV has a sound issue and an issue called 'tearing' (where a ripple will appear on the bottom of the screen and move upwards) THAT IS EASILY FIXABLE.  Call customer support, they ship you a thumb drive with the firmware fix....all is good.  Please don't make this out to be a negative issue when the fix is so easy and so FREE**
