What more can I say?  This TV is an excellent performer for the price.  I switched from Dish Network (Don't ask - all I can say is they are horrible) to Comcast for the HDTV support and the results have been excellent.  Bought a $30 HDMI cable and sat back in amazement - Cinemax is showing the Star Wars movies in HDTV and Revenge of the Sith even had my girlfriend in a trance. (She absolutely hates Star Wars!)  Also use it for gaming w/XBOX 360.  Provides a great gaming experience, the picture is excellent.Pros --Many different connections supported so toggling between sources is a breeze.-Price-Good Picture Quality-Appearance - Black FinishCons --Scenes that are low lighted are sometime hard to see.-Amount of time it takes the set to "power on" is annoying.Great TV- I highly recommend it!
