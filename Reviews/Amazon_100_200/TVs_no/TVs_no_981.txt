The 26" Aquos is a very nice set for its size.  It has a bright picture and excellent contrast.  The set itself is a clean, slim modern design that will look great in any room.  It is about as good as it gets for this size, remembering that the resolution will be better on a tube or plasma set.  You won't see 1080p unless you go up to at least a 32" display.  Nevertheless I am quite happy to have this set in a small room.  Color and contrast are very good for normal broadcast and excellent for HD.  The speakers could use a bit more depth to the sound.  Hookup is intuitive but the instructions are a bit slim and it will get confusing when you try to resolve in what format your inputs get displayed.  All in all a very good product, however.
