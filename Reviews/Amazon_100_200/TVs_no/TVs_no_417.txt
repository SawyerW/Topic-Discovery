I just received this TV yesterday evening.  Upon opening it, I couldn't help to notice that I had received a "used" item vs. the new one I ordered.  Needless to say, it will be going back.  Amazon has informed me that they will be sending me a replacement, so until then, I'll keep my fingers tightly crossed!Pros:*The picture quality of this TV on the XBOX 360 is amazing!*The color and brightness range is exceptional.*The sound is mediocre but it doesn't matter if you are planning to use a surround sound system.*The PC connection when using a standard VGA cable works great.  The max resolution is 1360x768 60 MHz refresh rate.Cons:*I've noticed one drawback; don't plan using the XBOX 360 VGA cable.  For some reason the signal is not supported.*You are not able to use two AIR signals when using PIP.*The TV looks tremendously better in a dark room.  (As with any LCD.)
