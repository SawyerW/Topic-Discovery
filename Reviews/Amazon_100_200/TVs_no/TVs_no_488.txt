I've had this for about 6 months, and it's a great TV.  Bright/clear picture.  I probably would have gone for a little larger screen size in hindsight, but I think the picture is superior to any of the other brands that my family/friends have.  A friend recently bought a Sony, and he didn't have the two cable/antenna input connectors on the TV (I've got a rabbit ears antenna that I can pick up the over-the-air digital stations broadcast in my town, and the regular cable input for the cable channels).  I can just switch between cable and over the air digital from the remote, while my Sony friend needa s switch box or to unplug/plug cables.  Overall a great TV, my advice is to get as large screen size as you can afford.
