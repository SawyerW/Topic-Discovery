It took me 3 weeks to have this LCD to delivered to me. Overall the product itself is excellent especially in HD. I checked the LCD at a store and made a comparison to other LCD and Samsung is the best choice. It's bright and crisp. The speaker in the other hand are weak! I probably going to buy the Samsung Bar speaker they going to have. Also, when the TV is off the circular button on the bottom is always lid up with a red light. The design is sexy with the black piano finish with a silver metal on the bottom. It looks good on my mounting TV stand that I purposely match with the all black metal frame. The samsung customer service is also great. If you want a good TV that cost less, then this one is perfect.
