The LNS3251D is a great television and I'm happy with the purchase. I'm using it with my PS3 displaying 720p over HDMI and it looks great. Defiantly worth the $$$. What really stands out on this TV versus the others is the brightness and the great menus.My only complaint is with Amazon's shipper of choice, Eagle Global Logistics. My package sat in a warehouse 20 miles from my home for five days until I called up EGL. They said the package was still on their truck and to call back tomorrow. Sitting on a truck in a warehouse for five days!! The next day I called back and they asked me if I wanted to pick it up, I said sure. Didn't want to wait any longer. What bothers me the most is that I had to call them, they didn't even give me a call to let me know my package was there or make any attempt at delivery. If I didn't track it online and see it was sitting around for five days it would probably still be in the warehouse gathering dust.
