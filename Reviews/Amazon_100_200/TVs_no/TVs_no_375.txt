I got this TV right after Christmas, since my old 32-inch tube died on me.  The picture and sound are great on this TV.  I was really worried about the standard def picture on here since I don't have an HD Tivo, but I was pleasantly surprised at the picture.I got the Samsung upconverting DVD player at the same time, and it's a winning combination.  The picture from most DVD's is superb, there are a couple that are not from major studios, that did not look as crisp but I'm sure that is because of the source.Samsung is really doing an excellent job, they are going to be the next Sony.
