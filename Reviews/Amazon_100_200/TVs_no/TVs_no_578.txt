I purchased the Toshiba Regza 42HL167 LCD from Sears 03/05/08 for $1299.99.  It has been a terrific TV until 08/2011 and now it has developed several black vertical lines behind the picture.  The picture is still great if you can ignore the black vertical lines in the background.  I am keeping this TV until we can't overlook the lines anymore but I think a TV that you pay $1300.00 for should last longer than 3 1/2 years.  I wouldn't recommend this model to anyone. I wouldn't recommend any Toshiba TV or computer to anyone either because we have problems as well with our Toshiba laptop computer and our bigger Toshiba TV as well.  The quality of Toshiba products is lacking.
