After much research and reading of reviews here (thanks to all), we bought this TV. The picture is absolutely awesome. Even in bright daylight next to a large window, the picture is very bright, and the contrast great. The power saving feature lowers the brightness for night viewing and is quite useful, especially for live sporting events that otherwise are too bright. The auto volume control works better than most others I have seen. The remote is large and easy to use, and the on screen menus are easy to use. The speakers are the only weak point, and just can't deliver the sound the picture promises, but a surround sound system is in the near future for us and should make the sound equal to the picture. The shipping was free and on time as advertised.
