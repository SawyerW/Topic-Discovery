Every time I turn this thing on I am amazed all over again. Samsung has gone all out on this midsize lcd. First the negatives: it takes a few seconds to turn on, and when the screen is set to 16:9 ratio (widescreen) the picture is  stretched a bit (but you get used to it, and if you hate it you can change the ratio). There are a few other nit picky things, but they aren't worth dwelling over. Positives: the picture quality is great, and the sound is amazing. These speakers output a nice full sound that is anything but disappointing. The physical look of the lcd tv is great. This TV is a must buy for anyone in the market of a mid size lcd (32" and 19" are also great buy's)
