I was very leery of ordering something like this on amazon but everything went flawlessly.  Eagle delivered the TV on time and in good shape, I set up the TV and turned it on before signing for the TV.Performance on the TV has been great, I cant complain about any aspect of the TV so far.  Viewing angle horizontally is good, vertically not as good but really not much of an issue.  Since it's projection it has a bit of warm up time but it's nothing bad.The number of hookups are excellent, i've got an xbox 360 connected via VGA, a ps2, and my Tivo.  Dvd's on the xbox look crisp (the 360 will upscale over vga).  I also just purchased the HD-DVD addon and have been pleased with the picture quality.I'd say if you find a good price on amazon it's worth it to buy it and have it delivered, I saved a good 500 bucks on this tv vs retail and have been very happy :)
