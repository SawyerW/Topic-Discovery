This television is great!  Great picture, great sound and great price!  It was easy to setup and is all the quality I could ask for.  Now, true some techno-geeks may need some mega set for some mega-video game, but for a great HDTV for the everyday homeowner, you can't beat it.  I have recommended it many times over and if I needed another one, would buy it again.  Sorry SONY, you've been outpriced and outclassed.  Sorry LG, you're just too expensive.  (The Amazon.com delivery was also great and fast.  They brought it in my house and took it out of the box for inspection.)
