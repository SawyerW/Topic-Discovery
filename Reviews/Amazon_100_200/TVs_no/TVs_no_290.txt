I ordered this unit 12/14 expecting delivery after Xmas, then began reading some of the review's and had some concerns about noise, shipping damage, etc.  Well, none of those bad things happened.  I called Eagle Logistics, their driver delivered my unit by working late on a Friday night(7:00PM in the rain) and helped me unbox and power the unit up.  No hum, no damage.I waited a couple of days to type up a review, as I replaced a 30" LCD with this 50" plasma and wanted to have some "experience" with it before I wrote an opinion.So far my opinion which I formed by looking at the unit at Best Buy mirrors some of the other reviews, the picture quality is only exceeded by the Pioneer unit at 40% more.  With HD cable, I don't think I'll ever need to buy tickets to televised sporting events again.  It's as good as being there.The peerless mount which was recommended worked flawlessly and even though the mount instructions did not have this unit in the guide, a quick call to their customer service line gave me the correct screw/bushing combination to use to guarantee I didn't damage the screen.Very Happy.
