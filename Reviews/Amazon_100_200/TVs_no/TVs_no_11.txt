I bought this TV last year and I love it. I have an elliptical satellite dishand a Toshiba HDTV receiver.The picture quality is what sold me on this model, whether you are watching the news or a DVD on aprogressive scan player (with component video cables)Sony gives you the option of four different screen modes, from vivid to'pro'...that is all picture adjustments in the default position.The control over every aspect of the picture is daunting at first but in notime you'll have the four picture modes perfectly tailored to your tastes.The "split screen" is very cool, you can watch a DVD and monitor a program,  minimize or maximize the two screens and have the soundfrom whichever source you want  Even the built in speaker system is sufficient for my taste, to me the picture quality  is of utmost importance.I could go on and on raving about this TV.I only have one regret, the price keeps going down!j.nomograms
