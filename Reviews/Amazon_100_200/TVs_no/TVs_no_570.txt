I don't know why i didn't get a tv like this a year or two ago.  It's one of the better purchases i've made in my entire life.  got it here at amazon for 1200 bucks, no tax, no shipping charge, and it came within a week in pristine condition.  toshiba's a reliable manufacturer and the tv looks so stunning it's unreal.  i compared it to the others at a local best buy and i thought it looked just as good as the samsungs & sony ones... and it would've cost like 1800 bucks there (before black friday sales i guess).no one ever answered me w/the "what's the 1080p, 1080i" etc, etc questions, but here's what i have figured out:when i watch a random regular channel, it doesn't look any different, cause it only comes in at like 480, but when i put it on a hbo hd channel or a sporting event, the top it says "1080i" everytime (and it looks STUNNING!!) -- and when i play my xbox 360, all the games come in in 1080p (p for progressive) and they look better than ANYTHING!!!i love it.  wouldn't do anything differently.
