I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.
