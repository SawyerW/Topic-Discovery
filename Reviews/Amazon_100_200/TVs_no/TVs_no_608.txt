My husband does the research and was going top buy a 37" Sharp Aquos 1080P until he and I compared the two pictures with the same input (even alternated the connectors) and the Toshiba beat it every time for sharpness (no pun intended), color, clarity and the capture and display of movement, (pucks, etc during a game that was also viewed during the demo).It was only a little bit less than the Sharp Aquos and 1080P seemed the better investment prior to the side by side comparison where the Regza never had any fuzziness and the Aquos did.After to approximately two years, we have never had a problem and our Toshiba Regza picture is still as clear and sharp as when we brought it home.  There are several Toshiba TVs out there and I can only speak to the Regza models which I am of the impression have a superior engine to their other Toshiba models.Would we buy another one again, darn straight we would.
