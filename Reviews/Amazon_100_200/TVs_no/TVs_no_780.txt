I have a nice wood cabinet, originally for a Heathkit TV, that I've tailored for many years to fit upgraded TVs. When I decided it was time to go high-def, I wondered what I could use to replace my 27" Sony Trinatron. It looked like a 32" wide-screen LCD would just fit the  cabinet. But which one? I went shopping and found that this Samsung was the only one that had on-set controls on the front; all others had them on the side. Since my cabinet would not give me access to the side, it was a no brainer. It has been a joy even since the set arrived. I hooked it up to an attic antenna before the HD cable was installed and I was able to get some great HD pictures with the built-in tuner. The picture in standard 3 x 4 format is about identical in size to that of my old 27" set.
