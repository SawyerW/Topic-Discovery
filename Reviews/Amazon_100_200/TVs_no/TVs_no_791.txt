It's my measuring stick to gauge others.This guy was expensive, a small fortune to me back when, so I sought long and hard for the best quality LCD, and I'm convinced I chose well.  Other TVs, even latest today, pale to impress as this one still does.It's a 720P but renders downright beautiful OTA HD (eg everything period) compared to a big 1080p plasma, and four other newer/cheaper quality Samsung and Sony 1080p LCDs strewn throughout house.  This Samsung is my baby (I handed-down to son #2 a several years ago - mistake) still working ... Xbox gaming with 360 is awesome, vivid/game mode, smooth frames and sharp contrast...It's a Toslink (optic audio out) and I think it has a USB2 port.  It's heavy for a LCD.  It began to whine years ago and I discovered its rear plastic loose - I tightened all rear cover hardware and it has not returned.In sum: They're not made like they once where...Kyle
