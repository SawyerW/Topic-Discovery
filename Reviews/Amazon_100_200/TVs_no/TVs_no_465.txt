I spent probably two weeks researching different HDTVs on the web, then about an hour and a half at an electronics store watching different TVs to see which has the best picture quality.This Samsung 32" Wide LCD HDTV beat them all by far.  All the different functions and connectivity features make it easy to utilize with other equipment.One thing that makes a huge difference in picture quality is the contrast ratio, which on this TV is 4000:1.  When watching my first HD programming, it seemed like the people on TV were sharper than reality.  It is absolutely amazing.The only draw-back of this TV is that it has one tuner, which means the PIP function is available only when used between certain connections.  I couldn't, for example watch one cable program and have another channel on in the PIP.  But I can use it as a PC screen and watch cable in the PIP, which I find very cool.This was definitely a great choice for me, especially with Amazon's amazing price - about $400 cheaper than anywhere else.
