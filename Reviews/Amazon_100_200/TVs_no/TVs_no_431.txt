I changed for a 32 inches LCD from WalMart because of the price... same price bigger size, ...make sense but, to be honest... the WalMart unit is far less atractive; electronically I didn't find any difference and thats the reason I change it; I have plugged to the unit a Mini Mac, a Wii, a DVD Elite and a Mitsubishi VHS... only the last one doesn't look great...all the others... stunning clarity; I have a 53 inch Pioneer Elite and this unit (32) look as good as the other monster for less than $900.  Sound is good in quality but kind of poor in power... in both units (26 and 32); if you want to enjoy games or movies in a gameroom you will need a better sound system but, for a bedroom is enough.
