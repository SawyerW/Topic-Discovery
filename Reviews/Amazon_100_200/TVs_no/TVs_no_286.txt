Received the TV from Eagle in mid-December and had it mounted on the wall and had the HD box from Comcast about a week later.  Absolutely fantastic.  As usual, standard-def source looks a little funky, but all of the HD content is bright, clear and of the highest quality, IMO.  I researched this for 3 months, looking at Panasonic, Pioneer, etc. at Best Buy.  My friend bought this same unit and he loves it too.  Best Buy has this unit for over $2500 with a bracket ($250) and HDMI cables over $100.  With shipping, you would approach $3k.  I got this TV, a bracket and HDMI cables for about $2100 from Amazon and Eagle delivered in less than a week.  The TV has a boatload of inputs, the remote & menu system are great and this particular unit did not have any buzzing at all... as quiet as can be from the first power-on.  If you're looking for a great 50" Plasma for a good price, this is it.  Thanks Amazon.
