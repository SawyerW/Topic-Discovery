I bought this TV last week. I got it for an excellent price on Amazon with free standard shipping. I was a little worried abt Eagle shipping delays(seeing some of the user reviews). Surprisingly, they delivered it in less than a week and their service was good too. Abt the TV, the picture quality is awesome and best among all the 32" LCDs I'd researched for a couple months. The TV speakers are awful though. They make a very annoying buzzing noise and are of inferior quality. But, this shouldn't be a problem long as one has an external speaker system. Overall I'm very satisfied with the purchase.*******Update********Oops!...the speakers are OK. It was the dvd player. I hooked up a better dvd player and the sound quality is fine now.
