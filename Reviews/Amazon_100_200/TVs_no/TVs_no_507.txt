My wife and I walked into one of those big-box electronic stores, and from about 10 feet away,passed our eyes over the usual wall of illuminated televisions. We were both struck by one set. We discovered it to be this Samsung device. Fortunately, the store had sold out on Black Friday; we found one at Amazon for $400 less (and no tax!). Eagle delivered it very agreeably (the courteous truckers carried it upstairs for us)within a week. After three weeks, we continue to be astonished at the beauty of the images, and the clarity of the sound (I'm hard-of-hearing). Highly recommended.
