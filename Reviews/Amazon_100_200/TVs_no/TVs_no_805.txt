First of all, I'm not HDTV-literate.  All I know is if the sound and picture is good and both are great on this t.v. for the price.  I've had my set for only about a month and have not experienced any noise problems yet (got my fingers crossed). However, I did have to return the 1st set I purchased. After having it for only 5 days, it developed a line down the screen.  Samsung customer service was very helpful, but I ended up taking it back to the store and exchanging it for another one.  After reading these reviews I am happy that I did something I rarely do..... I took out a 3 yr extended warranty!!
