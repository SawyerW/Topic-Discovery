i can't rate this item beacuse it dont work. i had it less than 30days when the tuner went out. i contacted the seller and they are giving me a hard way 2 go and all i want is my monies back. i also contacted the manufacturing company who was able to look the tv up and said it was manufactured in 2007 which means its old and the seller is responsible for any issues. when i purchased this item the seller had it listed as new thats why i had no problem in buying the item but they lied as you can see.
