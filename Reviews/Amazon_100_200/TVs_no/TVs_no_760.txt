Excellent TV.  I have not explored the full capability of this set yet, but the picture and sound quality are so far superior to my old 36" Sanyo Tube-type TV, I feel bad for the guests who have to watch that one in the extra bedroom.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  It was at our home a week before it was advertised to be here, and the delivery service (Eagle USA) was nothing less than excellent.  They brought it into the house, unpacked it, made sure it worked, and removed all the packing material.  I had ordered four items total, and all were easy to track in my AMAZON account.  This has been a pleasurable experience.Samsung LNT4053H 40" LCD HDTV
