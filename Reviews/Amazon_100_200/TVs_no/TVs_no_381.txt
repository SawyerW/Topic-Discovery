Well one would think Samsung is a trusted name, but when it comes to LCD TV...one wonders. I bought this TV brand new from Amazon on January 10th 2007. I was very amazed since it was my first LCD TV. At first it worked very nicely, although I had some problems searching for signals for the DVD and the VCR.  After two months owning this TV the picture went black, only sound and no picture.  I called SAMSUNG and took it to repair. After 2 months, they told me that the LCD PANEL was burned and the PCB main was not working. I live in Caracas, Venezuela and since I bought it in the USA, the warranty is useless. I just lost the money invested. Thanks SAMNSUN
