The quality of the screen (I'm using it as a TV) is not as good as my old 1987 bedroom TV. Other reviewers were pleased, maybe it works better connected to a PC? I've gone through the setup a number of times. Can't get a clear picture.It is compact and fits well on the counter top. Also, it was easy to setup.For delivery an appointment had to be scheduled so I had to come home from work for a 4 hour period to have this item delivered. This is the first time any service didn't deliver to my door and this item isn't more than usual orders.
