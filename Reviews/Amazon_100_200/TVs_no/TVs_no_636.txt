I ordered this item with the shipping time between may 5 -8. Om may 8th I was told that it was out of stock.  I had already thrown out my old TV and took a day off from work, then that afternoon I receive the e-mail. I went back to my open orders to leave feedback and get refund and it was magically gone.  I hope I get my refund.
