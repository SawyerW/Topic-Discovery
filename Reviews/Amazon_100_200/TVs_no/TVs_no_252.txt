I am so pleased with my Sylvania 42" Flat-Panel EDTv Plasma TV. Not only was it a good value. It has a wonderful support staff that comes with it, just call them up and they will help you hook it up! I looked at several models prior to purchasing this one, none really stood out. I was actually reluctant to order the Sylvania because the price was so low, you know, you get what you pay for...but I took the chance and ordered it. Best decision that I have made this year! If you want a Plasma TV there is no better deal or picture.
