Overall, this tv is a very good second tv for the bedroom. The main thing I would like changed is that the on screen information for the channels is very small and I have trouble seeing the on screen info without sitting up in bed and leaning forward. I'd also like it to continuously show the time, but it doesn't have the option of leaving any info permanently on screen. Also, because it is up higher than the bed, some of the channels appear dark, but I think that's a problem with all lcds. There's none of the white light bleed other reviews talk about. In fact the blacks are very black.
