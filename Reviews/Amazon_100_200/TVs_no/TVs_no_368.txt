I spent many hours researching online and in stores comparing LCD, Plasma, and DLP HDTV's. Awesome picture without HD reception so far. If only the satellite companies would improve technology so that more than one TV can receive HD on a dual tuner/receiver. We started out looking at 32 inch and ended up with this 40 inch for our bedroom.  The sleek style fits conveniently upon a chest of drawers, just the right height, and blends in with the decor of the bedroom. I ordered this TV on a Friday, it was shipped on Monday and by Thursday the TV had been delivered and set up by Egle. Shipping and handling I rate with 5 stars for the professional manner in which this transaction was handled.  We are always pleased with Amazon's service.
