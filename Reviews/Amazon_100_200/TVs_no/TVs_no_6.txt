The Sony 43in. projection TV is a good unit to look at. It does seem hard to get, as most TV stores and retailers are out of stock. The picture is sharp, clear and almost at times real. However the picture does seem  sensitive to noise (lines, snow). But for watching a DVD or video  presentation I cannot think of another set I have seen as that is as good.  The set is in a nice, compact case, and the cabinet (extra, fits under the  TV) available has room for a DVD, VCR, Tuner, and Cable Box, making all of  those components fit in a neat presentation, without, wires and boxes  hanging off the set. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good quality  set look into this one, if you can find it!
