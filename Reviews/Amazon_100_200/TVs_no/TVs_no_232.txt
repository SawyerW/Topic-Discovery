Do not waste your money on this Television. Picture was great for the first year and about 15 months out I heard two loud 'Pops." Had the television repaired and 3 months later same "pop." From my understanding there are 5 boards in this television and two of my boards have gone already. I would recommend anyone who is contemplating buying this TV to do your research. Go to yahoo, Google, fixia, best buy, ECT. and you will find that most everyone is hearing a loud "POP" after 9months - 2 years of use with the 50" Zenith Plasma. In the past I had been a huge zenith supporter based on my experience with quality products. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ZENITH OR LG PRODUCT. I hope that someone else will learn from my big mistake.
