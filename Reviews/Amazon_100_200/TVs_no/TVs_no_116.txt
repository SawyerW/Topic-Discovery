I bought this for a computer monitor/ entertainment system. With ATI AIW 9800 pro video card. Before hooking up the tv just go into control panel and advanced monitor settings: and pick the troubleshooting screen (its in there) then check the "force 720p" checkbox. its that easy resolution will be 1280 X 768. Gaming on this screen is excellent with no classic lcd problems. I would definately use the DVI cable though as the vga cable has slight image ghosting due to RF interference. The tv tuner is basic and the picture is mediocre but if you're just using it for digital media like me ... an excellent choice!
