This TV has the best picture that I have seen so far. Consumer Reports rated this TV as the best of all DLP TV's as of March of this year when they ran their last DLP comparisons. I was in the market for a plasma but many of the plasma's out there are not able to produce deep blacks and whites are sometimes off-white. In my opinion, DLP's offer more bang and value than a plasma or LCD tv. This TV will not dissappoint and if you are trying to research which TV to buy, you will notice that this model gets excellent reviews from professional reviews and owners from numerous different websites.
