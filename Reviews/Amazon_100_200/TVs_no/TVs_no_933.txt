Bought this Plasma on 1/4/08 and was stollen out of my house on 1/27/08 After several attemps, and speaking to several Indians from India, I finally got to speak to someone that spoke english.  I asked if they would approve a free shipping that I received on the exact same plasma puchased some 20 days before.  I was told "no I am so sorry but that was a promotion that we were running"  I understand that this is a "big business company" but I would think they could make an exception when I offerd to email or fax a police report.  It's bad enough that I was ripped off once but twice?  So now to get the same tv that I bought 20 days ago I have to pay $150 more for shipping.  Lesson should be learned when dealing with Amazon all they care about is the initial sale and nothing else.T.V was GREAT.  Picture was GREAT.  Sound for a plasma was Great.  HD GREAT.  Standard GREAT.  LOVED THE TV.  Trust me I am not one of these people that sits around looking to complain about something.  Thank you for reading.
