I had this tv for a little over a year. The picture quality was very good for it's time, and the style of this tv is out of this world.  As soon as my warranty expired I started having issues with this tv. I hardly ever used it(average use once a week), and took very good care of it.  So in my opnion these problems shouldn't occur so early, and the tv itself now is near unusable.  My tv is plagued with green pixels scattered across the screen, and basically you don't know what you're looking at anymore.  This happens every time I use it, and majority of anything I watch is infested with green pixels.Trying to find a fix for the problem, I was told time after time, that many people are having issues with this model. That and Samsung needs to send a Tech out to troubleshoot the tv, and I was told not to go this route. I'd suggest if you'd get an HDTV, that you look at other models with a better failure rate.
