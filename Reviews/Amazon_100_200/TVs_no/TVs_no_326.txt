I love how this tv looks.  HD channels look absolutely fantastic.  My PS2 games also look amazing.  I can't say enough how great the set looks with it's black finish, illuminating eye, and sleek look.  The internal speakers sound fine but turned them off since it creates an echo effect in conjunction with my external speakers.  2 coaxle inputs for cable & antenna. It has pixel shift, white screen, and sweeping screen to prevent burn in.  haven't had burn in yet so I have to wait and see how effective it is.PIP doesn't allow you to watch 2 tv stations at once.  when i change cable/antenna channels, the audio cuts out for a second shortly after the image appears. I usually plug an audio cable from my computer to play mp3s thru my home theatre system, but it requires that i plug in a video cable in as well or the entire source won't be detected.Overall, fantastic TV and i think i made the right choice after all the research. I'm nit-picky about a few things but still probably better than most out there
