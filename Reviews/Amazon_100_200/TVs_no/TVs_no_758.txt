The Samsung LNT4035H is our first venture into hi-def. I researched the purchase for over a year and using a matrix I selected this set for the overall value. It had a great picture, decent sound, and an outstanding price-point for 1080p. We've had it in our home for about 3 weeks now and love everything about it. My son plays his Xbox 360 on the set and is amazed at the difference from our previous non-hdtv system. It was easy to hook-up and enjoy quickly. The only reason I do not rate it as 5 stars is that 3 weeks is just too brief.... and I know there are a few better sets out there, but for the money.... you can't go wrong. Order and delivery through Amazon was a breeze.
