I purchased this product in 2008 and I believe it was within 1 year that I noticed a high-pitched whistle that would start after the TV had been on for an hour or so.  It has continued to get worse throughout the years.  The picture is fine and the TV has survived through several moves (with use of the original box and moving it myself instead of allowing the movers to handle it), but that whistle is annoying and embarrassing when having company over.  It is at such a pitch that I don't always notice it, but I have also gotten used to tuning it out.  I have had comments from friends that aren't used to it though.  I would LOVE the TV if it weren't for that.
