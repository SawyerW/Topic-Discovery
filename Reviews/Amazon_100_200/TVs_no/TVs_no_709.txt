I spent 6 months researching LCDs and decided that the Samsung LNS-4095 was the way to go in terms of price and features.  Sure enough, just as I'm about to buy it, the LNT came on-line.  Others complained that the LNS had "cloud" issues, but you find none of that on the LNT-4061.  The piano border is classy, and the matte finished-screen is great because of the reduced glare. 3 HDMI ports are best in class, and I haven't had one problem with it at all.  The screen is simply gorgeous (check out Sunrise Earth on Discovery HD to see how clear it really is).Some people complain about the speakers, but buying a flat screen TV without getting a separate audio system is like buying a sports car without manual transmission.  Even better, the speakers are below the TV rather than on the side as seen in the 4065, so it saves room. The contrast ratio rivals most plasmas and, generally, I think it's a great investment (especially as more things are broadcast in 1080p).
