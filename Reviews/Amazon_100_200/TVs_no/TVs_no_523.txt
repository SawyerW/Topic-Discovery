pros:- Sleek design accents any wall.- Colors are as natural as any set I've previewed at Best Buy.- You can leave it in 16:9 mode, and it will optimize the size of any program you watch.cons:- Remote design is a joke.  If the same guy designed your car you'd be adjusting side mirrors with the steering wheel.- The information boxes that pop up when you change something (channel, sleep, etc.) are way too small.  At 20-20 vision, I can barely read them at fifteen feet.- The sleep function gives no warning before it turns off your set.  I'm used to a three minute countdown on my old set.
