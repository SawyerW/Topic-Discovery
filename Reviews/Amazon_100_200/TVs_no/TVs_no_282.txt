After comparing prices on several different makes and models, we decided to buy the Samsung S5053 from Amazon. The Samsung had picture quality that equaled or surpassed other models that were quite a bit more expensive and it's 'eye appeal' is second to none. Anyway, Amazon had it delivered right on time and the delivery guys from Eagle USA were great....they brought it in, unpackaged it and helped get it up and running. The TV made it here in great shape and so far, we have not had the 'buzzing' noise that some reviewer's have reported. If you are in the market for a 50" plasma and are the least bit budget conscious, you won't go wrong with the Samsung. We checked prices in the 'brick & mortar' stores and decided to shop online and saved $500.
