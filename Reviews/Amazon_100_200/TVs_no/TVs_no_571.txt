Bought a Regza 42HL167 in January 2008, used it to watch occasional movies in the first year, then a bit of TV viewing in the next year.The third year, it started not powering up  when turned on, and we'd unplug the TV for 10 seconds and re-try.It got worse and worse and in January 2011 it totally gave up.It wouldn't turn on, power-up, anymore, at all, regardless whatever we tried (short of the opening of the insides and re-programming).Toshiba acknowledged the problem in its website in Sept 2010, telling people to unplug it, wait and re-try, which we did, but Toshiba never volunteered for additional help.1.5 years later, it is still the same info about the problem:[...]Got barely a 3-year use out of it, for $1600.The Japanese usually built quality, but, I guess, not always.We shall stay out of Toshiba ever-never from now on.Won't recommend (any) Toshiba! Stay out of it.Mid-year 2011, we got a Panasonic Viera TC-L42D30; it is very good (so far).
