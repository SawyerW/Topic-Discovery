I researched LCD HDTV's for a very long time before purchasing this one. When I recieved it there wasnt a single dead pixel, and the first thing I did was connect an Xbox 360 to it. The 360 looks incredible and has no issues at all, with or without "game mode". DVD movies also look incredible. Normal TV looks as good as it can on an HDTV, and the zoom feature allows for full screen viewing of 4:3 shows. The only reason this TV doesnt deserve 5 stars is the sound quality. For normal TV viewing it does an ok job, but once you pop in an action movie or get into a firefight on Chromehounds it cant produce quality sound. It even makes a strange vibration type noise when trying to keep up. Even my extremely cheap 2.1 system can beat it on sound quality, which is disgusting since it cost less then 5% of what the TV did.
