When I set out to buy a new TV I spent months researching to make sure I was getting the best one I could find. When I finally found this one I thought it was too good to be true, and you know what, it wasn't. I've had it for months now and there isn't one thing to complain about.First of all, it has the best picture I have seen on an LCD. There is no difference between the picture on this one and the picture on a TV 3 times as expensive. Blackest black I have seen, incredible viewing angle, tons of picture options - really, this thing is beautiful. It has 2 HDMI ports and it does 1080p through component, which is something that's hard to find in a TV this size. Built in tuner, only weighs 60 lbs. If I had the money I'd buy a second one.The only negative I can say is no Picture in Picture, but it's such a small it's not even worth complaining about.You might also want to consider its 37" and 42" brothers, as they are equally amazing, just bigger.
