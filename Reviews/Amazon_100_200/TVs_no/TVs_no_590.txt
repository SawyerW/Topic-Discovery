Set arrived in Mid December, packaging was not damaged, but the quality of the display was awful.  Toshiba customer service referred me first to a repair shop that was out of business, then to two shops that don't service my community.The 4th repair shop picked up the set a week later and then lied to me about the repair for 4 more weeks.Toshiba then asked me to agree to accept a smaller set in exchange, which I refused.They now promise to refund my purchase price (but not shipping!!!) in 4 to 6 weeks after some freight company gets around to picking it up.The set looks nice when I saw it working in the store, but consider the company behind it before buying!!!  Toshiba's policies toward their customers are the worst.
