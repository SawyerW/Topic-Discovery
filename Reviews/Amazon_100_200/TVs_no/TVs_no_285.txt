After some serious thought, we decided to buy this plasma.  The color and picture is amazing.  Not a big difference between higher priced models.  Delivered first tv, plugged in BUZZZZ.  It was so annoying we couldn't enjoy watching tv.  Volume had to be atleast 36 or higher to drown out the noise.  Called major local retailer for exchange.  New tv, plugged in...buzzzz.  Couldn't believe it.  Based on previous reviews w. same noise problem, we knew it wasn't our imagination.  We LOVED the picture quality.  HD is amazing and the colors are brilliant.  It's truly an experience watching this tv.  We liked the picture so much, decided to try a THIRD SAMSUNG s5053.  Told store manager we wanted newest model from most recent shipment.  Kept our fingers crossed and...NO MORE BUZZZ.  I don't know what's going on w. Samsung.  If you get a bad s5053, it's really bad.  But if you get a good one, it's a really great plasma!*HINT- only buy if it's easy to exchange!
