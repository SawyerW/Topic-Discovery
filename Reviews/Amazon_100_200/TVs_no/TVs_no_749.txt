Like most people I had one major problem with this unit right away which was the sound cutting out regularly.  Samsung tech support did do a good job remedying the problem by express mailing a thumb drive with a firmware update that fixed the sound issue immediately.  After that I didn't have any problems for quite some time until about 2 1/2 years after purchase the set started having serious difficulties starting up.  After being turned off for a long time, turning the set on took about 3-5 minutes during which clicking noises would occur.  Once the set finally turned on, often there was no sound and even sometimes no picture.  Samsung has no firmware update to fix this and recommended that I be referred to a service center who said it could cost from $150-300 to fix with several days of waiting.The TV in the end, seemed like a good purchase but after all of the problems I've encountered I couldn't consider buying another Samsung TV.
