i have a few friends that purchased sharp aquos and having been able to watch it and inspect it first hand helped in making the decision to get one myself.  i'm the type that is very hesitant in making such big ticket purchases.  i tend to research things to death and find it hard to commit since so much money is being spent on it.  so after 2 months of researching, i finally made the decision to go with the sharp.  i do not regret it for one minute.  i love it!  but in order to enjoy all that my new HD tv had to offer, i had to upgrade to an HD cable box (a must to have the full experience of HD television).all in all, this was a great purchase.  the quality is amazing, design is sleek and compact, and a wonderful product.
