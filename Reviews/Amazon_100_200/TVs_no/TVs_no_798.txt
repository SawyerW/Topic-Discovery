This TV is really really nice.  I love that it has two coax imputs one for my tower antenna and the other for my cable. It works really well.  I'm still trying to get an s-video cable from my computer to work with it but that may be a problem with the computer as much as the TV.  I'm not really crazy about the remote and the channel selection process is a bit awkward which is kind of a problem when you are dealing with so many over the air channels as well as cable channels.  So far so good, I hope it lasts forever.
