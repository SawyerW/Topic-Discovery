When my TV arrived, I had the delivery guy wait while I plugged it in.  When I did so, I was able to hear an audible buzzing coming from the unit, which is not normal according to all the electronics message boards that I did my research on.  I then refused delivery and shipped it back to Amazon and will try ordering again, but did not want to take a chance with Amazon's strict policy about not exchanging TVs over 27 inches. It looked great for the few minutes it was at my place and I think it will be a great TV if I am able to get one that does not buzz.
