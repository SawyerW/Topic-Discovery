We'll, I finally decided to purchase the Sharp LC-52D92U over the Sony KDL-52XBR2. This decision took me about 4 weeks to make, with multiple trips to local retailers to compare the sets in action, and reading many online reviews.If you ask store personnel what is the better of the two, most will say the Sony. After watching both sets in action many, many times, it's just not so. The picture quality, sharpness, and black levels on the Sharp are truly amazing. The Sony is a good TV, just not worth over a thousand dollars more! I purchased mine from the internet for $3,200 delivered.I highly recommend this TV to everyone.
