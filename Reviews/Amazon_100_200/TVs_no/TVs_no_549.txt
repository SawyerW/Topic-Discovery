I shopped forever before buying an LCD flat panel TV.  I looked at all the major brands, and chose Sharp for it's reputation and having owned one in the past, made the purchase easy!.  I could see no difference in the quality of the picture from the Sony, Samsung and Panasonic models.Only thing I might see as a fault is the fact it takes almost 2 seconds for the TV to change channels.I have also seen others that have complained of a weak base, but it went together easy and seems sturdy.  The sound on this TV is very good and the picture is very good with good response times and very good blacks.If I were to buy another LCD, I am pretty sure it would be this same model!
