Another member of Sharp's unbeatable LCD TV family:1. Great LCD panel:  32" diagonal, vivid colors, stunning clarity, very good black-level quality, no dead pixels (cheaper brands often have dead pixels)2. Great styling:  looks absolutely beautiful, in the living room or bedroom or your fancy bathroom3. Lots of inputs:  digital inputs, component inputs, PC input.  HDTV tuner is not built-in, though, so you'll need a separate HDTV tuner, which is fine since you likely need to get an HDTV cable or satellite service like VOOM anyway4. Simplicity:  the set-top connector box hides all the wires5. Easy to set up and useBTW, the "32GD4U" model (with a D) has a built-in HDTV tuner, but it's also hundreds more.  This present model (without the HDTV tuner) is definitely the better value.
