After shopping around locally for the best deal on an LCD, we found this deal on Amazon which beat them all on price.  I was a bit hesitant to make such a large purchase online but could not be happier with how it all turned out.  The tv arrived within 9 days (including a weekend), Eagle Global contacted me within five business days to schedule delivery.  They gave me a four hour window and when I called them the morning of the delivery, gave me a specific delivery time to within 10 minutes.  They get five stars as well.  The tv is beautiful, stylish, and has great picture quality even though I don't have HD yet.  The Mustang mount works great, directions are straight forward so if you can hang shelves, you can install this mount yourself.  I'm EXTREMELY happy that I saved at least $600 by going through Amazon (no shipping costs, no sales tax, and a couple hundred dollars retail on the tv and mount) and the process went so smoothly.  I highly recommend this model television through Amazon and Eagle delivery.
