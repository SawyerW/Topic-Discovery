Other than going to pick up the TV myself at the local warehouse... (I didn't want to wait another 8 days for them to deliver it to my home, the process was a breeze. I have had the TV for a little over a week and absolutely love it! I got my DirecTV HD set up this weekend and now am wishing every channel was HiDef. DVD's are great and I don't have an upscalling DVD player (yet). Sound could be better but is adequate till I can get the surround set up I want... I see that the price dropped another 20 bucks so have contacted customer service for the difference! If you are not set on a 1080 set yet this is a great set at an incredible price!
