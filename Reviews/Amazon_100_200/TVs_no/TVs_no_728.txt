This is a product I would highly recommend.  I did not get the 1080p version of this TV because I have read that once you get over 36" you cannot tell the difference between having 720 and 1080.  In any event from the standpoint of price I am very happy.  From the standpoint of space I am very happy as this TV is only about 12" thick and is light (60lbs).  It is very easy to set up, the remote is easy to use (although I am transitioning over to a harmony remote) and all of the functions are easy to acess.
