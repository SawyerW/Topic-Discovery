This is a excellent set for the price; we are particularly pleased with the tuner.  Take heed, however, of the risks inherent in having this sort of item shipped to you.  The first time this was shipped to me, it was "lost" by the shipper (being a large item, it was not shipped UPS or the like but by a freight company)...both the shipper and Amazon were less than stellar in responding to this problem....after much time in the Amazon bureaucracy it was re-shipped, only to arrive in a giant truck that could not make it up my driveway.  In retrospect, I would have been better off buying this item locally.
