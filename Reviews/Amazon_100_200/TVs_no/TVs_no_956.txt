As other buyers were saying, Amazon and other sellers have issues with delivery companies! Mine was CEVA! Amazon scheduled the delivery for 26th! I spent entire day waiting for my box and guess what? Right, it did not arrive!!! Next day I called Amazon! They said it is out for delivery today! Then I decided to call CEVA and they said that I had to make an appointment for delivery!!! Wow! Did Amazon mention it?! Moreover, trucking company was trying to call me at the number that was provided by Amazon. Here is the number 00012345! Have you ever had any success dialing such number?! Right, ether delivery company!CEVA was great! After I scheduled a delivery they called me one hour before delivery as promised and came to my door at 7:07 pm after I came from work! So, if you get your TV delivered by CEVA CALL THEM TO SCHEDULE THE TIME!!!Product:I love the picture! Even regular cable definition (non HD signal) looks fabulous compare to other TVs!If you are looking for a panel at one grand, do get this model!So, Product A+, CEVA A +, Amazon C
