Our new 50" Samsung 5064 arrived the other day from Amazon. The shipping was fast and the guy from Eagle wouldn't leave until the set was plugged in. Our new entertainment center had not yet arrived, so I just unboxed it there on the floor and plugged it in. After the Eagle guy left I finished removing the packing from beneath the TV and found that the base was defective. The metal was broken underneath the plastic base cover and the TV was leaning to one side. The TV itself was working fine and I determined that all I needed was a new base. I called Amazon and the customer service lady gave me the toll free Samsung phone number and said "if Samsung doesn't take care of your problem we will". I then called Samsung and explained my problem. They sent a new base for the TV which was very simple to install...Great TV and customer service from both Amazon and Samsung.
