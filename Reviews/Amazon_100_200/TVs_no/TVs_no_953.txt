TV is awsome, amazon is so-so. I looked at several TV's,the samsung plasma had all the qualities I was looking for at a great price.  I was concerned about the picture quality with SD input and am really pleased with SD picture; of course picture is great w/DVD. I wasn't aware that the shipper only delivers on the weekdays and they need a 4 hour block in the morning or afternoon for you to be home to deliver, so I had to take time off from work.  The price also came down on the tv and I got the run around from amazon on the price guarantee.  In the future I will buy locally.
