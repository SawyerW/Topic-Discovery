My husband and I ordered this TV as our Christmas present to each other... let's just say that he was way more excited about it than I was.  However, I must admit that once we got it, I loved it!  I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone who is thinking about getting a  32" LCD tv!On a side note... I was VERY sceptical about ordering this TV (or any TV)online.  I was afraid that something was going to be wrong with it b/c it was almost $300 cheaper than any of the local stores... obviously it was just fine and I will definitely order from AMAZON again.
