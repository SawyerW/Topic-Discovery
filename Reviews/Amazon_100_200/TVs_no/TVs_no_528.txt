I ordered a Samsung TV through amazon to be sent to my daughter residing in washington d.c.  After several weeks, the TV arrived and she left it in the package until the cable tv man could come make the connection and help set it up.  He was present with unpacking and told her the TV was completely defective; no images could be viewed, only multiple colors appeared on screen.  I live outside the U.S. and told her to call Samsung and they told her they could only 'repair' it, not exchange for a new one.  I was indignant that I had to pay for a new (not used)TV that was defective and had to be repaired prior to even turning it on.  I tried amazon returns but the site is down.  I hope for a resolution because I am really upset that a new tv can be delivered completely defective, and i no longer want a samsung and expect a full refund and hope i don't have problems with amazon with this.  I will have to search for another manufacturer now.
