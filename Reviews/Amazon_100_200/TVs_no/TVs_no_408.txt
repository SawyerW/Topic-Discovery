Did a LOT of research trying to decide on the brand, features, looks and price point. This was going to be a Christmas present for my wife and was going on the bedroom wall. Wow! For $739 direct from Amazon, I feel it was not only a great buy but a steal. Just put it on the wall and attached a local HD antenna. The picture is amazing! I currently have a Dish Network standard DVR tuner hooked up and the picture is also very good.On order is Dish HD tuner, can't wait for it to arrive. This is the best 26" LCD.
