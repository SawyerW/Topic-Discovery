This TV has awesome picture quality, very sharp, and you can't beat the price. Personally, I also like the aesthetics of the glossy black bezel as compared to some competitors (e.g. Panasonic). No buzzing noises either, which I was a bit concerned about after reading some reviews. But even if there were buzzing noises, Eagle Freight USA (Amazon's delivery company for large products) will help you set up the TV and give you a chance to test it out to make sure there are no problems. If there are, you can just refuse delivery. Bottom line is, awesome TV with beautiful picture and you don't face any risks.
