Update: 4 years out, it just broke.  Was expecting at least 6 years...This thing has been hanging over my fire place for maybe 3+ years now.  Excellent value when I got it back then.  Take note that this is a PLASMA TV so it's not all that new foo foo LED/LCD tech.  Back when I got this thing, it was equivalent to LCD's and LED's weren't out yet.  I wasn't looking for the highest quality picture and this thing delivered more than enough.  In fact I would argue that 1080p is almost unnecessary when you're sitting more than 12 feet away.Anyways, its a great plasma, and it's been working well.  It's a bit heavy, but its old tech, so, whatever.  Highly recommended for an every day TV with or without HD signal.  Good speakers too...
