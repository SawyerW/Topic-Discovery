I really love this TV! It was easy to hook up and set up. I have it hooked up to Charter Cable, and a Samsung HD860 DVD player. The HD picture is breathtaking of course, but the picture on non HD channels is fantastic as well. The HD860 DVD player makes regular DVDs come alive with it's upconverting to HD capability. It is easily worth twice the $90 I paid for it. Amazon's price was lower than anwhere else, and I got the TV in just over a week! I highly reccommend them. Also, Samsung's support is great. I had a small problem that turned out to be in the set top box, and Samsung was very helpful in finding it. Real American English  is spoken there.
