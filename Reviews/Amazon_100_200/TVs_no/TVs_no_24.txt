First of all, this TV is an EDTV 'monitor', not an HDTV as they want you to think.  I received mine today, and the actual spec is buried on p.16 of the manual.  This TV is only capable of displaying 480p max, and can receive HDTV signals that are passed through an external decoder (the decoder is not built in).  However those 780p/1080i HDTV signals are downconverted to 480p.  Same with Progressive-scan DVDs.  I wish I would have known this before ordering.  Now, the picture looks nice, but $3k is a lot to spend on a widescreen TV, even though it's a flat-panel.
