I got my new TV in stunningly fast time. It took only 10 minutes to open the box and connect to my system. The picture is awesome, and sound quality is good as well. On screen navigation is simple, and I looked at the manual only an hour after watching the beautiful picture. Please note, this is not a perfect buy, because the spec sheet is wrong. According to the Amazon description, and the manual, there are supposed to be additional connections on the side of the TV, but in fact, there are none. No serial, additional component or s-video on the side, or anywhere, they simply don't exist. But otherwise it is one of the best LCD HDTV's for the money. XBox-360 hook up was simple, and in game mode, my nephews tell me Gears of War and Call of Duty 3 are simple awesome to play now. If you are buying and planning to use the additional connections keep shopping, this is not for you. Otherwise, no complaints.
