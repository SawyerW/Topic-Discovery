I do not fall for scams. But I almost fell for this one. A seller had the TV listed for $990. She even had 69 positive ratings next to her name, 'torrter77'. When I emailed to ask why the item was priced so low, 'she' said that her ex-husband had cheated on her and she was trying to get rid of anything that reminded her of him. She sent us to a 'secure' website to make sure our transaction was guaranteed. If you are ever sent to '[...] know that you are being scammed! Luckily, my husband did some research on the site and realized the whole thing was bogus. She even tried to have us go to Western Union to send money to Paris. It was all too much and too many red flags were sent up. Take heed to your mother's advice...'if something seems too good to be true, it is!'
