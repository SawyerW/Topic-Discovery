This is a nice TV with a beautiful picture and lots of inputs, but ... and it's a big but, it has sound issues galore.You'll will see in the discussion thread this had issues from a high pitched sound and other issues of HDMI sound drop outs.I returned one and got a replacement because I like the TV so much, but that also has the sound issue so I'm giving up and returning it.If asked around and several people have had similar issues with different models, so I think it's a Samsung thing in general.It's a shame, I really wanted the TV, but it doesn't matter how nice the picture is if sound and noises are ruining the whole experience.
