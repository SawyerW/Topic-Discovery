I purchased this exact model about a week ago, my wife and I saw it hanging on the wall at Best Buy and both agreed that the picture was sharp and it had a very sleek frame to it. We purchased it, took it home and got it set up. The first thing I noticed was the frame. Although it does look good, it is very cheap feeling. Theres is ALOT of flimsy plastic covering this lcd tv. I put that petty opinion aside and started watching it, the picture looked great and I also liked how the sound came from the back of the tv. Then it started....Audio dropping, about every 5-20 minutes 1-3 seconds of audio would just completely drop. Well to make a long story short I found out that this is a very known issue with this model. I didnt pay almost 900.00 for a lcd that has a "known issue" so I took it back and payed 200.00 more and purchased the Sony Bravia 32 inch, which looks fantastic and has amazing sound. You truly get what you pay for with LCD's, so in my opinion I would say to pass on Samsung.
