After a lot of research on flat screen TVs and hours in electronic stores comparing picture quality, there was no doubt in my mind that this Samsung plasma had definitely the best picture quality in its price segment. I was aware of the buzzing problem that seemed to occur with some units but took the chance. Eagle delivered within about 5 days (standard shipping!). Unfortunately, there was the buzzing from the first start up which is constant and seems to come from the left and right top of the housing. It is definitely not the cooling fan as described elsewhere. Anyways, the buzzing was loud enough to be annoying in quieter scenes from a normal viewing distance. Sad, because I otherwise really liked the TV and the picture quality with my up-converting DVD player was great.I contacted Amazon about this problem. Customer service was very nice and immediately offered either replacement or full refund. I decided to go with the refund for now, I just didn't feel like taking the chance again. By the way, the TV was manufactured in Mexico in September 06.
