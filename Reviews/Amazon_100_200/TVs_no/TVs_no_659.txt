I got this TV after searching high and low and reading every review I could.  Everything kept pointing back to this TV.  I have tried just about all of the features and I'm really impressed.  The HD signals look absolutely amazing and with a little bit of tweaking, the SD signals are pretty good too.One thing I am a little disappointed about is the split screen PIP features.  You cannot have PIP set up as split screen if you are using the PC input or HDMI input #1, which are the two ways to hook up a PC.  I was really hoping to have a PC screen on one side for emails/work stuff and the game on the other.  It's one minor draw back that you really don't know unless you read the manual closely.  (This is the ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars)But, over all this is a great TV and I'm very happy with the price, shipping, and picture.  I think Samsung makes a quality product in a field loaded with questionable manufacturers.
