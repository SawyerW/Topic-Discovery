The price was right but I was concerned about other reviews which warned of a 'buzzing' sound. I have been using the TV for over one month now and have never heard buzzing. Great sound and picture and sleek styling. Very happy I bought it. Unit sold through Vanns without any problems. Shipped by Yellow, upon arrival there was a large oily stain on the outside of the box which fortunately did not penetrate through to the inside. TV protected by multiple layers of polywrap and placed inside a sturdy Styrofoam cocoon. Unit was undamaged. The delivery person went above and beyond in helping to transport unit inside, when delivery only specified curbside. Saved a lot of money. Overall, a good transaction.
