I made the connections, plugged it in, and it works great. The definition is very good, and in fact, there is only a few channels that are HD in this area, and so I can't really try a lot of channels. However, those that are broadcast in HD are very clear.Of course, the price was very good on this one, as well. I had been tracking the prices for 740p, and for the same price, this was a 1080. So it's a great deal.Amazon did well on the shipment, too. I came in as scheduled (in fact earlier than scheduled), and the delivery truck driver called me the day before, and then on the day to make certain I'd be in. And rather than waiting all day or morning, I was told in a half hour period when he'd be here. So there was hardly any waiting! That was great!
