I got this for the Family for Christmas and love it. Very good color and price. Mounted on the wall and used the sanus mount. HD cables, S-video (better) or component (best) do not come with it you need 2 sets of to get the best possible pic. One for DVD and the other for Cable/Dish (provided) You also need a home theater system as it has no speakers. I have HK +Klipsch and love this set up.Over all this EDTV monitor is very good buy. With all 42 inch ED saves over Hd as all DVDs do not show HD + no 42" plasma will show true HD you need a 50" plasma for that.
