This television is excellent at least as far as picture quality goes, especially in high definition.The problem I had was the shipping method.  The included shipping ("free shipping") was via Eagle who lost the item for two weeks.  I only found out that the item was lost one month after it was ordered and after several phone calls to Eagle.  Amazon only offered to cancel the order or ship another TV.  Before I could respond to Amazon, the item arrived by a third party (not Amazon or Eagle) five weeks after the order was placed.I would recommend paying extra for proper shipping.
