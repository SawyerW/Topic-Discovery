I bought this TV since it percieved it to be the highest value for money in 37" segment. The other TV I was considering was Samsung which was at least $150 more expensive at that time.Pros:1) The picture quality is very good and noticably equivalent to Samsung. 2) Personally I think the TV looks much better than Samsung as a furniture (when shut-off).Cons:1) The max sound is very low. I need mostly around 80% of max vol and for some movies even the max volume is diffucult to hear if you have a air blower (a/c or heater) running at the same time.Adding additional speakers is pretty much required for this TV.
