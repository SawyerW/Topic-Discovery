Just bought this TV and received it within a week, Eagle was good with shipping, and they set up the TV to test it before they left...As for the TV, beautiful picture. Connected it to my PS3 via HDMI and blueray movies look amazing! Also, I connected an old bunny-ear antenna to it and it picks up local HD channels easily as well as regular SD.The glossy cabinet is very eye-catching and have been getting compliments since the first day it arrived. Also, it brought a soft cloth to keep it clean and avoid scratches (Works GREAT to clean the PS3's glossy finish as well).I definitely reccomend this TV, great picture for the price!!
