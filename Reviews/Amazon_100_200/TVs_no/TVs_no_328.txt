Like I said, the picture is absolutely stunning. That is, of course when you are watching an HDTV broadcast, or a DVD (especially if you have either an up-convert DVD player, or the real deal HD DVD or Blue Ray). When you are watching a non-HDTV broadcast, the picture is marginally better than a standard non-Plasma. But, hey, let's face it, regular broadcast shows aren't why we buy HDTV ready TVs. The color saturation is one of the best I've seen at any price point from any set, and the contrast is phenomenal. There are very flexible options for color, sound, and burn prevention in the on-screen menu. I should mention that if you are watching a channel in 4:3 format (and there are black bars on the sides of the screen), for any length of time, when you switch to a 16:9 channel, you will see some ghosting. No problem, though. You can get a DVD to run that flashes colors randomly to "erase" these lines. There are plenty of inputs for your home theater needs, and the shiny black finish is icing on the cake. This is a terrific deal for a truly beautiful picture.
