I've had this TV for about 6 months now and it's been great.  Great picture with DVDs and HDTV.  If you don't plan on using this primarily for DVDs or HD, then you won't be as impressed with the picture.  It really does depend on the source and the connections you use.  My neighbor sells home theater equipment for a living, he recommended this TV for it's picture, and so far I agree with him.  The delivery from amazon was quick(about a week), the delivery company was very helpful and curtious. So far an all around excellent experience.My neighbor had a better deal on this TV but with the Shipping and Tax it would have cost more.
