First, I gotta say how helpful most of the comments in this section were in helping me decide to buy this product and to buy it from amz.I've had the 4061F for nearly 2 weeks and knock on wood it's been great.  I'm kind of a newbie in hdtv so I'm sure I'm only getting a portion of all that the tv has to offer.Although I'll post this under the Eagle thread as well, the delivery process was just awesome, getting me the set a full week *before* the stated delivery date.  Again thanks to this board for listing the Eagle website (CEVA it's called I think), as amz and hence Eagle had my old telephone number.  Anyway, the guy in Wichita (Jeff) was super, his people delivering the set just five days after I had ordered it!  And on a holiday, to boot, so I didn't have to schedule the delivery around work.Just super all the way the around--thanks amazon, thanks eagle, and most of all thanks to the posters in this review section.
