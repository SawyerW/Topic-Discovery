I purchased this TV in December of 2006 at Circuit City. Almost a year later, in October of 2007, the TV tuner part went out and i couldn't watch cable. The HDMI and other inputs still worked, but not the tuner. I took it back to Circuit City where they were supposed to ship it off for repairs. I called them a week later to ask about the progress of the repairs and they still hadn't shipped it off yet. They told me to come into the store and they would give me a new set of the same model to replace it. I got the new TV and everything was going smooth, until last week when the HDMI port failed on it. This time the tuner works, but not the HDMI port. Circuit City said they won't do anything about it this time.I would NOT recommend this TV to anybody. It looks like a good deal (and the image quality is great), but it will more than likely fail.
