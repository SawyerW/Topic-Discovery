I spent a lot of time at various stores looking at 32" LCD sets since that's the largest size I could fit. The only set that had a comparably rich image was a slightly cheaper Philips model that was 3 inches too wide for my cabinet. I spent the extra money and got the Samsung and haven't regretted it. Beautiful image.The only drawbacks are the downward facing speakers and the complicated menu system. The sound is uneven at times with some frequencies coming thru much louder. The menu hides some functions that you might want quicker accesss to.I have discovered one quirk. If you use it as a computer monitor (which it does really well), leave a DVI to VGA adapter attached to the VGA port and turn the monitor off something strange happens. When you turn it back on the set will immediately go into energy saving mode and prevents you from accessing the menu.  Removing the DVI adapter fixes the problem.
