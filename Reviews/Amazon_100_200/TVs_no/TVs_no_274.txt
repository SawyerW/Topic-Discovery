REMOTE TRICK:Own the monitor for over 3 and half  years now, love it, no problem at all.  Initially lot of problems with remote just like everyone else is experiencing. I called customer service many times and nobody seemed to know what's going on. They just sent me a replacement  remote.(which had same issue)  But after years of use,  I got it figured out....so I thought I should share it for those who still doesn't have a clue what's wrong with their remote.If the remote is not working for you. What you need to do is PRESS THE "TV" BOTTON on the top left corner.  And then everything else should be working again.What happened is that the remote come with your Viewsonic is actually a universal remote.  So if you accidentally pressed DVD or something else on the top.  You are switch the remote to a different mode.  You must switch it back to TV mode to control the TV and voice and everything else.Hope this helps.
