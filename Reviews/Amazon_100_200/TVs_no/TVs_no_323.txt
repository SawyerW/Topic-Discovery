I will admit I was a little apprehensive about whether I was making the right choice when I picked this Samsung but since I've had this wonderful plasma I've been happier with it everyday. It was very easy to set up and looks fantastic. Everyone who has seen it has complimented my choice. The picture is very crisp (I havent hooked up the HD service yet and Im wondering if I really need it). The colors are bright and perfect, all of them except the black. The TV has a bit of a problem when a lot of what you're viewing is dark. Other than that its been great. I've played a few X-box 360 games and Gamecube games on it and the picture couldnt be better. Its a great size too, not too big and definetly not to small. This helps when playing the video games because when you play multiplayer it splits the screen but you still get great resolution and plenty of screen space so you dont strain your eyes. This is a great purchase AND price for anyone looking for quality and name-brand assurance.
