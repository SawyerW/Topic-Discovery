This TV is a superb value and strikes a great balance of features and fundamental performance.  I compared it against the mainstream and Costo versions of the Panasonic 50PX77U (also a very good TV).  As CNET reported, the anti-glare filter on the Panasonic is much more effective, but picture quality on each is great and to me, some features on the Samsung made the difference.- Picture-in-Picture capability (one tuner, though)- 3rd HDMI input- USB port for photo viewing- (partially) Lighted remote- more comprehensive anti-burn-in options- Nice rotating stand (compared to Costco's Panasonic version with duck feet)For my needs (fast action sports), the 50" plasma was a clear winner over a significantly more expensive 46" LCD.  Don't get hung up over 1080p and you'll save yourself a bundle.
