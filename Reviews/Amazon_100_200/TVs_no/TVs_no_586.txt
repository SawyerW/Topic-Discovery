I am completely satified with the Toshiba REGZA TV. It is a fine piece of engineering. What a pleasure to watch. Vibrant color and sound. Crystal clear picture and the 42" is like being in the movie theater. It has many different options to use during set up and can be confusing. But there is a toll free number to call that has real humans to talk to and they are very friendly and helpfull. The TV came within 3 days and the box was pristine. all is good. And thank's to amazon.com I got the TV for $[...] less than I could by it anywhere around here.Dan.
