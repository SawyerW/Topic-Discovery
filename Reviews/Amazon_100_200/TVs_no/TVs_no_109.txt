I bought this TV in December 2005 and it has been working great since. I haven't experienced any problems that were mentioned previously in the reviews and I'm very satisfied.  I use it in my room for DVDs, cable TV, and for my iPod's home dock (where I watch the iPod downloads on the TV) and I can't say I've had a better TV for my needs. I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony). I can't speak directly to the HD issue, but you should do your research if that's a deciding factor for you. HD wasn't really a priority for me, but low cost and quality performance were. I feel that my needs are met with this TV.
