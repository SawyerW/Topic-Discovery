After a couple weeks, I think this set is great.The sound is weak if your used to digital surround; but anyone who buys this has most likely got a better system anyway.It took a week or so to depixelate (I don't watch a lot of tv and have an Infocus projector).Now I love it!My only gripe is Amazons shipping. It was advertised for free "prime" shipping.Others have stated otherwise, but my "Prime" shipping was changed to "ground" shipping. Not only that, but my 5 day ground shipping took 9 days to get to me. GRRRR.....Amazon shipped it via Eagle (egl).Having questioned the issue, Amazon has side stepped several times. They now offer free shipping, at your guess. They have since taken it off "prime" shipping status.It's a great tv, and well worth the money. But if you want it within a week or so, buy it elsewhere.The only negative is the sound.I love the set - the shipping/support sucked.
