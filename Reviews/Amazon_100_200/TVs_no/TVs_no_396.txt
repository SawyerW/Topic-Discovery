I've read a lot of reviews before purchasing this unit and it was a tremendous help to me.  So hopefully this review will be helpful to someone.  First I want to say, I am very happy with this Samsung 40" LCD.  The pros, 2 HDMI inputs, 3000:1 contrast ratio, (DNIe) Video Enhancer, digital noise reduction and 1080i resolution.  Some cons, standard def. looks pretty good but the 16:9 wide sometimes looks a bit stretched when watching standard def.  Another con is the viewing angle; the picture becomes washed-out even at slight angles.  The sound on this unit is okay once the SRS TruSurround sound is activated, but I still plan on getting a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound System.  The brought this unit through Amazon via FREE Super Saver shipping.  The unit arrived in 5 days (great Eagle shipping service). I have to say, when viewing HD programs the 720p/1080i resolution looks great! The bottom line, if you are looking for a solid LCD for a great price.  I think you will be happy with this unit, I definitely am.
