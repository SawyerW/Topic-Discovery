I wanted to like this TV, but had to return it after 2 weeks. Maybe it's because I have the Panasonic TH-50PZ700U plasma and have gotten completely spoiled by it. The picture on the Toshiba doesn't compare to my Panasonic even though both are 1080p. Maybe I just prefer plasma over LCD, but the standard channels aren't nearly as crisp and even the HD picture seems bland. This is probably because the blacks just aren't as pronounced on the Toshiba.I had a few other issues with this TV. For some reason the set would lose video occasionally while switching channels. Had to unplug it for video to come back. As another reviewer noted, the picture from side view of the TV is horrible. Lastly, I couldn't find a picture size that I liked - Theaterwide 1 worked OK for HD channels but was a bit too zoomed in, Natural worked OK for standard channels but they seemed somewhat blurry.Unfortunately this TV was just average - too bad, as I got a great deal on it.
