I purchased this tv in Oct 2006 (not from Amazon) so it's currently 3 1/2 years old.  As of today the picture no longer works and trust me, I've checked all the connections and all other "duh!" issues that I could, as did my husband.  I liked it up until today but dh insisted from day one that the picture was not as good as the other brands that his friends have.  This is now a discontinued model as per my recent internet search.  If you're looking for longevity, choose another one.  I'd hate to think that these newer televisions are only made to last a few years what with how much they cost!
