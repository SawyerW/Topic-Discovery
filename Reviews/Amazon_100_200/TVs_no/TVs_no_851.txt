If you are in the market for a TV around this size, and can afford this model, it's a fantastic choice.  After using it for several weeks, I have no significant complaints about it.  Okay, the case attracts dust like crazy and it takes a while to turn on.  That's all i've got.The image quality is great; lots of contrast, no ghosting, very bright backlight.  It has more inputs than i'll ever use, and you can customize every conceivable setting, from naming channels (3 letter limit), to manually adjusting color balance and fine tuning analogue channels.I can't comment much on the speakers because I have external speakers hooked up, but they seemed alright when I used them.Overall, a very good pick.
