I've had this TV for more than 2 years and it still works as well as it did on Day One. I found a stand for it at Target so it sits about 18" off the ground now, and it is like being in a movie theater. I've been very pleased with this TV and would recommend it if it were still on the market.***I wrote the above review In 2007. It's now late 2008 and I'm still happy with this TV. I figure I'll keep it until the day it dies--and hopefully by that time there will be cheap flat-screen TVs with some great technology for me to move up to.***I took the plunge in July of 2009 and bought a new 50" plasma. I gave this TV to a neighbor in exchange for some work in our house, and he loves it. It's still working fine for him. (April 2010)
