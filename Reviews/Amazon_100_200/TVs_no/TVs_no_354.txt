Saved close to $500 by purchasing from Amazon over local stores, ordered on Sunday and recieved the set on Thursday with free super saver shipping.Picture is great with over the air digital channels with my inside antenna, DVDs look great.Sound is barely adequate, but I'll be running it through my harmon kardon receiver and infinity speakers soon as I find an appropriate stand for it and put my coffee table back to it's original purpose.Picture quality is much better than with the 32" samsung lnr-328w I have in my bedroom, and I was happy with that one.  Wanted a bigger one for the living room, though, and glad I got such a great deal on this terrific set.
