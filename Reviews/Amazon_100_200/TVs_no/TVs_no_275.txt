I turned it on right after the delivery guy unpacked it. Loud buzzing noise comes from the back when I switch the power on. Amazon directed me to call Samsung first. I called them and they proceeded to tell me that the noise was normal but i would not take any of that. I had them send out a repair person who dismantled the television and told me that I will be getting a replacement unit. He said that the unit is irrepairable because defect is in the way the plasma panel is bound to the aluminum backframe trapping tiny air pockets that cause the noise. He told me that Samsung will contact me to arrange for a replacement. The replacement unit came and it was buzzing even louder. I am contacting Amazon to take it back. Not worth all the time I took off work to deal with this problem.Too bad. I was really looking forward to owning this TV. It looks sleek and the picture is very crisp.
