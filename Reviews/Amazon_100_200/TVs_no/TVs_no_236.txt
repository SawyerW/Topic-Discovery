I've owned this TV for couple of months now. The first TV I bought had 7 dead pixel, so called up syntax and they were happy to replace the TV (though it took them 4 weeks to send the replacement). The new(replacement) one had no pixel issues. The picture quality is great for HD signals and standard defenition picture (my cable box upconverts everything to 1080i) is much better than my regular TV. But the dark areas in the Picture lacks detail. I tried to play around with the TV settings, but no improvement yet. I guess that's the inherent disadvantage of the flat panels. You may want to shell out a lil more and get a nicer flat panel if you want more details in black. But for the price I paid i am ok with the quality of the picture.
