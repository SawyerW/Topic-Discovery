I love this television.  Couldn't have made a better choice.  I had bought a Sony 32" Bravia XBR, but didn't like the picture quality so I went searching and found this one.  What I should've done was purchase this one first!One thing I didn't like about this television is the response speed.  This happens mostly when I'm watching HiDef Television and not DVDs though.  I don't know if this is common in LCDs or not, but it can be annoying at times.Also needs better speakers.  Not saying what it has isn't good, but it needs better ones for such a great television.Overall though, it's a great value buy.  Great picture and a great price.  By the way, I've always wondered why Wal-Mart uses these televisions in their stores, but don't carry it... hmmmm....
