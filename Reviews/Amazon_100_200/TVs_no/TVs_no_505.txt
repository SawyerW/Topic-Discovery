I love the tv. It has agreat resolution and makes a neat sound when you turn the tv on and off.I live on campus and needed a monitor and a tv so i purchased the Samsung 32" It works great with my apple and other laptops but my new sony vgn laptop does not work with this tv/monitor. The only way to get it to work is to plug in my apple, change the tv/video screen and unplug the apple and quickly plung in the sony laptop. Once the cable is unplugged the connection is lost.With some research, others have found that the Harmony 550 universal remote (about $80 here on amazon) can program the tv/video to work with the laptop each and everytime.If any of you who are looking to buy this tv to also use as a monitor and have a sony laptop you may need to purchase an additional remote to get them to work together.Good luck
