I just got this TV yesterday from amazon's vendor JR.com. Though I had initial problems like delayed delivery and bad order processing  between Amazon and Jr.com but i am glad that they got it delivered finally:). I was looking to buy either Sony Bravia or LNS3251D but after doing extensive research and visiting bestbuy/circuitCity etc., I and my wife decided to buy this TV.Here are some pros and cons,Pros:-Good picture quality-Good contrast ratio/resolution..better than Sony-Black Colour-Blazing Fast ~8ms response time which is what even sony has.-2 HDMI connections, though they support only version 1.0 and currently HDMI specs version 1.2a are out in the market-Lots other useful connections like 2 composite A/V (1 side), 2 S-Video (1 side), 1 component (Y/Pb/Pr), 2 HDMI, 2 RF, 1 USB, 1 RS232-PIPCons:- Till now i only found one i.e. its HDMI connections still support version 1.0 and I cannot connect my Toshiba DVD player which supports Ver1.1 HDMI specs.This is what I liked/disliked till now.. I will update this review, if required, after playing a little bit more with its functions/features.
