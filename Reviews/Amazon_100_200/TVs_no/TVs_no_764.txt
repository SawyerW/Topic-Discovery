CNET REVIEW PANEL STATES BLACKS ARE THE MOST INPORTANT MEASURE OF PICTURE QUALITY....11/2007 CONSUMER REPORTS STATES THAT THE LN-T4053H HAS DEEPER BLACKS THAN THE LN-T4061F. OUTSIDE OF HYPE I DON'T SEE THE BENEFITS OF 1080P  VS  720P IN MY HOME THEATER. I'M VERY SATISFIED W/ THE LN-T4053H DETAIL OF PICTURE QUALITY. THE BD-P1200 REALLY BLOWS AWAY ALL HD SOURCES EXCEPT HD DVD. THE TWO FORMATS RUN HEAD TO HEAD . ANY HI-DEF CREATED FROM A PRISTINE SOURCE PASSED THROUGH AN ACCEPTABLE TRANSFER END W/ MIND SATISFING RESULTS....MY 1st. GENERATION TOSHIBA PUMPS OUT AS WELL A THE BD-P1200. THAT SURPRISED ME....SINCE I OWN BOTH  - MOVIE AVAILABILITY IS ACCEPTABLE  ....THE LN-T4053H @ UNDER $1200. & FREE WHITE GLOVE IS HOPEFULLY ENJOYABLE TO YOU AS ME ME ME. GOOD NITE & BEST VIEWING ..
