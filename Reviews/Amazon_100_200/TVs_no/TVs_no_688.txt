Bought this TV as my first HD TV, and found it to be easy to set up, remote and setting is intuitive.  My grip is with picture quality for non-HD programming, it quiet bad at time, but the resolution is still worse than my non-HD generic 17 inch flat screen TV.  Is it possible I did not have the right setup, I hope this is the case.  For a promised contrast of 15,000, I regret to inform potential buyers than you can see the pixels on the screen.  Price is very reasonale, specially if you don't have to pay sale taxes the saving may be enough to buy a decent DVD player.
