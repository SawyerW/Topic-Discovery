My husband got the 42" version of this set mainly to watch his never ending sports.  I liked it so bought the 32" for my movies. It's great for both HD and standard programs which we receive via cable. I have the cable company's DVR box and that's working well with this set. I rent movies from Netflix and all of those have looked fine though I still have a standard DVD/VCR combo. The sound is fine and this TV looks very nice as well.  Thanks to all of you who reviewed Sharp in the past as I chose the brand in part due to your recommendations. One thing, the picture on the 32" seems slightly better than the picture on the 42" but that may be the way I adjusted the picture. My husband likes his brighter, wants to be blinded by ice when he watches hockey, or so I surmise.  Maybe it's just the size of the screen that makes a difference, but both are basically great.
