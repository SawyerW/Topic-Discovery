Just like many of the other reviewers. I purchased my TV January 2006, about a week ago my wife calls me and tells me that the screen is black! I figure maybe one of the connections came loose! I was not so fortunate, i come home from work, take the TV off the wall and plug it straight into the cable box. Same problem! I call Zenith, and the outosurced support tells me that I am out of warranty and to try and power cycle it! I call a little repair shop that I have done business with over the years, and he laughs when I tell him what kind of TV I have. He informs me that Zenith does not have tech support and that they make him pay full price for parts! DO NOT BUY THIS TV! Unfortunately when I bought this TV for $2800, the reviews were great, obviously I should have waited until the first year was up on the product! My fault for only buying the 2 year warranty!
