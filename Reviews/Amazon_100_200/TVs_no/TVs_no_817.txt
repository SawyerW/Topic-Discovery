Samsung LNT3253H 32" LCD HDTVBought this for the picute in picture, we've had this for a week now.  Still haven't figured out how to get it done.  Spent two hours at Best Buys with a tech, he couldn't figure it out either.  Besides that the picture is great, it sounds a lot better than our previous Magnavox 32 inch.  I would suggest this to anyone, if they were not looking for the picture in picture.12/30/07 Update; we've had this for awhile now and got the picture in picture to work.  It was the connection in the back that I didn't have right.  Both pictures are great.
