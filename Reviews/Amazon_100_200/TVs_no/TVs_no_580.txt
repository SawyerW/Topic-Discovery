Bought this in December 2007, and it was money well spent. My wife wanted to upgrade from our 35" tube. I was reluctant, but am happy I went along. I had seen LCDs at friends and relatives houses, and was convinced that they were not that much better than what we had. Well they definately didn't have this.The picture quality on the HD chanels is amazing. My wife, who does not watch sports, will watch now just to see the picture.The sound is a little worse than what we had in our tube TV, but I knew that going in. If I want realy good sound, for a movie or music, I run it through our surround sound and its all good.If you can find one of these at a discount for its age, you will not be dissapointed.
