I viewed in many stores the other brands of TVs, like the SONYs, the SAMSUNGs, and the LGs, but after viewing the specs and price of this TV, I said to myself, "this is the one". Just think about it, a 32 inch LCD HD-TV that's 1080P with a contrast ratio of 10000:1, and its a quality brand- Sharp. Other TVs with this same quality are anywhere from 500 to 800 dollars more. The television network shows on HD are great, with HDMI the sounds are even better, I can't wait to buy a PS3 to hook it up and play some sports games on HD 1080P, also view Blu Ray movies. This TV is the ideal TV for your bedroom since it's a 32 inch, totally great deal all for $1030 brand new with free shipping, compared to the prices in the stores which is 300 dollars more plus tax.
