I've been very satisfied w/ this purchase. The TV arrived in good condition, very quickly at Eagle shipping. Rather than have to have someone home when they delivered it, I went and picked it up myself at their depot and had no problems. The TV had no dead pixels and has worked great. I've got it hooked up to an HD DVR through Cox cable in the Phoenix area, and the picture looks great on HD channels, although some programs are clearer than others, I'm sure based on how they were filmed. We're using it in the bedroom and 32" is a great size for that. The remote could be a little nicer, maybe have a backlight and be a better shape, but we end up using the DVR remote most of the time anyway. I'd recommend this tv to anyone considering an LCD HD at this size.
