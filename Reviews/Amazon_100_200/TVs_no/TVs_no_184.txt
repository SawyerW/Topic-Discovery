I use this display in my line of work. The quality is generally above average if not that great. The color is not as bright or vivid but the ability to receive and play HD programs does let one peek into the future of digital programmings and that itself is an enjoyable experience.The LT30HV has considerable weakness in the DVI mode, often the display will exhibit no picture or incorrect color scheme, 6 months to a year after opening the box. For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen. This slight discoloration can take the fun out of having the LCD TV.For the price advertised here, it is definately not worth it.
