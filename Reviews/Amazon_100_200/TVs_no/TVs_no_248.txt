I went into my local big box retailer with a 32" flat panel in mind (upgrading from a 27" CRT) and quickly realized that 42" is where it's at!  After seeing this Sylvania in action and being incredibly impressed by the clarity and brightness, I went in search of the best price.  I unexpectedly found it here at Amazon and bought.  After having the TV for about two weeks now I'm very happy.  Like I say the picture is great - no complaints - but I would like a more robust selection of inputs/outputs.  This thing also looks great mounted -  with just the thin frame oulining the screen.
