There would be no sound when ever there was a quiet scene inanything i was watching. Response: Why would a 'quiet' scene need sound? Isn't greatthat 'no sound for a quiet scene'?And customer service was the worst I have ever experience. Afriend of mine had the same problem with his tv. So please stayaway from this TV.  Really? Ans: Tatung is very famous for its good customer service, notonly in the US, but also in Taiwan and Europe. Are you kind ofsalesman from another competitor? Because I don't think youreally own this TV, and possibly you know nothing about it.Now turn to the review: The TV itself is very good in colorreproduction, and the response time is short (which means verygood for game playing). Moreover, the overall appearance is alsovery nice. Well made LCD TV! I strongly recommend it to everyone.
