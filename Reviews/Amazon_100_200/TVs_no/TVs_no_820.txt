All I can say is wow; everytime i turn on my xbox. The crisp clean picture looks awesome whether the sun is beaming through my windows in my room or the lights are on, no glare at all.  The size is perfect for a small to medium sized room. I purchased the articulating wall mount with it and had the t.v. hung and ready for action in appx. 40 min. No dead pixels, scratches, dings, software problems. Besides the tv, the only thing bad I can say is that the free shipping from Eagle took about 2 weeks!!! If i'd have known it would take that long, i would've payed the extra money to have 3 day shipping... The HD channels from cablevision look great, even the standard channels come in pretty sharp. All in all this t.v. is well worth my money and even the wait, especially buying from Amazon... Best Buy had this tv at the time for $1099, ha! go figure...I laugh at people that still buy stuff like this from big retail chain stores for hundreds of dollars more then by purchasing online.
