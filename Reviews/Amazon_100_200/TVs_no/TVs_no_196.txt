This is not a time-tested review, but my initial tests proved that this a nice TV for the price. The DVD could read a dirty, scratched disc beyond the menu and minutes into the show. There is a VHS "Rental" feature to improve the quality of rented videos. The One-touch VCR recording is only controlled from the TV set itself (not the remote). There is no "Previous Channel" button on the remote, but you'll be using your cable/satellite remote anyway. Only 50 lbs., less than similar TVs from Insignia, Sylvania, Panasonic and Toshiba. Right out of the box, the black levels looked like they needed a boost, but overall the picture quality is great.Update 11/29/06:The only annoyance I've encountered is visible color banding during dark scenes or when the screen goes black. Adjusting the black level and contrast does not seem to help much. It's not a deal breaker.
