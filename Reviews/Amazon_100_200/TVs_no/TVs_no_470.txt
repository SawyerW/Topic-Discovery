The purchase was fast and easy with the delivery being the same way.The set up was very easy as was the programing of the HDTV which at first I was concerned about.I started by looking at the SONY HDTV's and spoke to many people about the ease of set up and picture quality, when I heard the praises so many people gave Samsung products.I researched both the SONY and Samsung products before making my choice, finding that most people and reviews found that Samsung was better product and would cost less.I'm extreamly happy with my choice as far as picture quality, sound quality and cost.
