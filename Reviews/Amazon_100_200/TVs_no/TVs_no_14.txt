some seans come out too blue but most of the time it is great. when I saw it in the stores it had animations on it not live action so it was harder to tell how good the pict realy was, but very nice pict great for the places you don't have room most tvs.the speaker space  for the speakers on the sides is too wide.The speakers cabnets themselves could have been narrower, the cabnet the speakers are in are twice as wide as the actual speakers.I wish it was in black, since my purchase I have seen it refurbished in black,but no brand new in black. wish it didn,t cost more than a big screen.
