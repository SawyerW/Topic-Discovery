This product was purchased 10 months after comparison shopping and on line reviews. The picture was great until this weekend when I noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non-hd broadcasts. Samsung's tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty. The commercial hype by Samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help. Samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real % of their sets which experience the problem. My friends have Panasonics which have never had the problem even after 3 years usage.
