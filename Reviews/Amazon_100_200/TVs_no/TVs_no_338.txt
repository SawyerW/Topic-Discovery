After getting the run around with our Buffalo Best Buy I decided to orderfrom Amazon.com. I saved about $400 to $500. The customer service was very courteous and the trucking line delivered the set on time.  The quality of the picture on HD (Time Warner) is excellent and i am getting this picture quality using three cords between the HD DVR box and the t.v. Time Warner says that with their set up that HDMI cables are not needed. The analog signal though is hard to watch but the digital signal is not bad. My son is going to set me up a surround system for the holidays. Thank you Amazon.com for selling me such a great lcd.
