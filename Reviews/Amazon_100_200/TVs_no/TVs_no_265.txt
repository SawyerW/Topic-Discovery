I ordered the television when Amazon had dropped the price to 699 and received free shipping.  I also ordered the wall mount which did not fit the tv so I returned it.  Overall the TV is amazing.  I've seen projection HDTVs and this blows any projection HDTV I've ever seen out of the water.  I just read about the differences between HDTV and EDTV and from my understanding the technology (as in the signals from cable and satelite) for true HDTV will not be realized until 2009 so why would you want to spend and extra $500 or more when you won't even be able to utilize the difference for another 2 years.  By then, you will be able to buy an HDTV for the same price as an EDTV now.  Unless you want to wait 2 more years, this is the TV to get.  I am extermely pleased with this tv and the picture quality is amazing.  (I have it hooked up through component video outputs through my HDTV box from my digital cable)  FIVE STARS!
