Amazon or the vendor messed up the listing for this TV. It was supposed to have a USB port. It doesn't. It also doesn't have a QAM tuner, which means it really only halfways works with cable. I had to buy an outboard tuner to get HDTV on my digital cable connection.The stand for the unit does not tilt, only swivels. Kinda cheesy.Picture quality is good. Audio is decent, for what it is. Wished it had more outputs as well, as I'd like to feed video back to my PC for recording VCR tapes, etc. Makes device switching a pain.Wish I had done more research, I would probably NOT have purchased this TV, I just trusted the listing on Amazon to be accurate, which it was not. Next time, I'm downloading the manual before purchasing anything this expensive.
