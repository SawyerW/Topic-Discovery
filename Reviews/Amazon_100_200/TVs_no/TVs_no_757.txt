The product photos of this tv don't do it justice.  It has a shiny black finish and a the screen leaves just over an inch of border on its edges - more TV and less box.  The blue light that looks like a reflection in photos below the "samsung" label is pretty cute, too.Amazon delivered it white glove direct to my apartment in perfect shape, and only a couple days late when our area had major flooding along the main expressway.  Setup was easy, and picture quality is great. I've had my TV for two months and no complaints; my Samsung and I get along real well.
