I bought this tv 2 weeks ago and I dont regret it. There are plenty of jacks for anybody who has a lot of components to plug into their tvs. Picture is georgeous. I am using my xbox360 on it i am blown away every time i turn it on. As mentioned in previous reviews this and every other plasma tv is prone to "burn in." Turn the contrast down on the tv for the first 100-200 hours of use to help prevent it and dont leave static images on the screen for more than 2 hours. Use the built in screen burn protection features as they get rid of every burn in issue i have had with the tv so far. I recommend this tv to anyone looking into HDTV as this is my second HDTV. Never going to back to standard tv.
