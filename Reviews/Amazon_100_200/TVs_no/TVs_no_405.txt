I ordered my Samsung and received it in exactly 2 weeks from the date of purchase. Not too bad considering it was shipped free. Only knock on the product would be the remote control. Didn't make sense to me to have the numbers at the top of the long sleek remote, but have the enter button at the bottom. Unless you have big hands, then it  shouldn't be a problem for you.I don't have HD cable programming as of yet, but the picture is decent still. DVD's weren't that good using regular RCA cables, but once I switched to a Monster Cable video component cable (my current dvd player doesn't have hdmi outputs), the difference was like night and day. I can only imagine how great the picture will be once I purchase a player with HDMI output. I thought the picture quality was fantastic, but after reading some reviews on this site, I'm going to adjust the video settings and see if I can't an even better picture.In closing, I'd recommend this product to any potential buyer. Great bang for the buck!
