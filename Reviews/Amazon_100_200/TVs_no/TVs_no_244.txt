I bought the Olevia 30" through Amazon back in March 2005 (at a cost of $1150 plus delivery at the time) ... a few days ago - Saturday July 29 2006, the screen suddenly went black and the TV died - the sound still worked but no vision.  I had a TV expert friend look at it yesterday - and he said that it has gone for good ...Lasted less than 18 months --- so much for the 12 month warranty.My recommendation - stay away from Ovelia ... majorly disappointed - and have to falk out $800 for a replacement ....
