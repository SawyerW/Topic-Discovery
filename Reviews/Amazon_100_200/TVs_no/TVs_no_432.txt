This is my first HDTV. I've been waiting a several years for prices to go down and my preferences were Sony, Sharp, or Samsung. Sonys are still too expensive. The Sharp Aquos' picture was poor in comparison to either the Sony or Samsung. I was surprised since Sharps have good buzz. I originally wanted last year's model--329D, but oddly that model was more expensive. Initial consumer reviews were good about the 324 and the price was right. There were cheaper prices on the Internet but the store names were not familar to me and I didn't want to lose my money. As I was checking out, a popup offered a free trial to Amazon Prime. I got it shipped overnight for $3--sweet. Arrived in perfect condition, beaucoup connection ports, great picture, and I don't even have HDTV yet. The pic tends to be dark but that can be changed in the settings. As someone mentioned, it's so minor it's not worth bothering with unless you're a perfectionist. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
