This TV is absolutely terrific. It's out of box video quality doesn't really need to be adjusted beyond personal preference. Doesn't look the best in store because it's sitting next to 5000$ Samsungs, but once it's home, it's truly incredible. I never thought I'd be able to afford quality like this. Do not hesitate, put away buyers remource and get it. It can be found for $800 plus tax and shipping if you look hard. If you can't find it for less that $1400, it may be better to look at a samsung, but I still can't say enough positive things about this TV.I'm not big into sound because my apartment is small and I have to keep quiet anyway, so this is the only area where it may be lacking, but it's got so many connections for 5.1, etcc, it doesn't matter.Please, do yourself a favor. It's way more affordable than it should be. Seems like one of those too-good-to-be-true deals, but it's not.
