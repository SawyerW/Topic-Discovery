Eagle has got to be one of the dumbest delivery companies around. I purchased this set on Feb. 23rd. As of March 3rd. it has made it's way from Reno, NV to Sacramento ,Ca. A grand total of 132 miles EAST. I live 204 miles SOUTH of Reno!!! HELLO Eagle. Look at a map! From Sacramento it is headed south to Los Angeles. THEN back north to Bishop,Ca. It will have traveled 800 miles before it gets here. It would have been cheaper, and taken less time, to just have one of the employees throw it in the back of a pickup truck and drive it down here.Eagle gets a BIG "F" for delivery. This will be the LAST item I purchase from Amazon that requires a truck to deliver.
