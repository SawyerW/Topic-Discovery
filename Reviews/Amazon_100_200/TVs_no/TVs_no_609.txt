I have only had the TV for about a week, but i have no negative comments so far. Very nice pic and sound. This is my 1st step into HD, so I have nothing to compare to. I passed on the warranty since it would be over $100 for only 1 yr. VERY fast shipping (if ordered directly from Amazon). I recommend paying the extra few bucks for Amazon price so it is easier to get help if you should need it.  The CEVA(formerly EAGLE) website that Amazon uses, does not update correctly. I picked up my TV from the Wharehouse 6 days ago, and the CEVA site still has NO INFO AT ALL on my package. But on a good note...I live only 350 miles from HEBRON, KY (where it shipped from). It arrived at the Wharehouse 3 days later! (est date on amazon read 10 days)  I will update this later if anything comes up....Right now, Very satisfied!!
