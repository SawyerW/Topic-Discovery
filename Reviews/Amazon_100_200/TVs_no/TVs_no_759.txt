first! id like to thank to amazon for deliviring my order samsung 40", scratch less and in perfect condition. they deliver the tv a week early than the date they supposed to deliver, which is i suprised and im happy for that.the tv was exccelent, pictures was really good, sound is great! im still trying to know better with this tv like the setting which is i am really confused, cause a lot of option! and 1 more thing, to someone who reading this, it might be you can give me an idea, cause im trying to use this tv as a monitor of my laptop but the tv says "not supported mode". i didnt call samsung customer service yet, cause im still trying to know this tv. anyway, good luck for all the customer of amazon, just think of it, no tax no shipping rate the price is the best, you just stay home and relax! what im gonna say to amazon is " THE BEST!"
