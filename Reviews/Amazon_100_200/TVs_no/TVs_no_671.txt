I shopped around like crazy and decided on the Samsung LNT4061. This is my first HDTV and upgraded from a 10 year old 19 inch tube tv. The 4061 is beautiful and works like a charm. I was worried about getting a lemon due to some info a learned about the HDMI issues on AVSforums. My TV from Amazon arrived with the latest and greatest firmware and it worked great. I'm a football fan and the preseason games look awesome. I also bought the Samsung up-convert DVD player and my dvd's look great even my old ones.Amazon ordering was easy. I even called back twice to get a price reduction refund in the first 30 days without an issue.Delivery was quick and professional. The tv arrived before I expected and the delivery guy came up and unboxed it , help me set it up on the stand and was patient with me while I looked for any dings and scratches. There were none and I am happy.Pull the trigger!
