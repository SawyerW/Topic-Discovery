I bought this tv directly from Amazon with a high discount and free shipping.The tv arrived before expected in perfect condition. This is what I call a great offer.About the TV, the image quality is great. If you have a room where you can control the light, you will have the best picture. The viewing angle is very good. This TV looks awesome with my PS3 with great colors, a fine response time, and even the color of the TV it self (black) makes it a very good pal of the ps3. I don't have HDTV so I have no tested this feature. In conclusion a great offer by Amazon and a very good TV. I also tested the tv with my brother's xbox 360 and the quality is very, very good. Go for it.
