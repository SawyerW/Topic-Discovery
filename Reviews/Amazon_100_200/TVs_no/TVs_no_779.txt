I've had this TV for about a month now and I love it. The picture quality is great when viewing HD content, but not so good for standard broadcasts...definitely invest in a HD cable box. Blacks look great and the color contrasts are excellent. I have not experienced any serious audio problems like many others out there, only that the audio hiccups for a split second once every few days. I'm sure Sony and Sharp LCD's perform just as well, but the Samsung looks much better...and priced lower. I have mine mounted on the wall, but it looks great on the stand too (just make sure to use the supplied screws). The glossy piano-black bezel is not a distraction like many have claimed...I have mine next to a window and I don't even notice the glare because the picture is so bright and vivid.
