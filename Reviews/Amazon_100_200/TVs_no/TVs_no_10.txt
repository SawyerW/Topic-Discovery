We've had our 32" XBR450 for about three months, and the whole family loves it. Coupled with a progressive scan DVD player (we have the Sony DVP-NS700P, also a great product), the picture is nothing short of amazing. Even VHS tapes look better with this TV, thanks to the line-doubling up-conversion process the signal goes through. The sound quality is also excellent--even has treble/bass adjustments--and has surprising bass output for a TV set. The picture-and-picture feature (scalable side-by-side twin views) is really cool; however, be aware that you won't be able to view two channels at once if you get satellite service. (You can still view different sources simultaneously, though.) The unit also has plenty of inputs, including two component video inputs (for high-definition sources) so you can hook up a DVD player as well as an HDTV receiver. While the price is high, for the quality, features and flexibility, you can't beat this Sony for 32" models. I would recommend this TV to anyone who can afford it.
