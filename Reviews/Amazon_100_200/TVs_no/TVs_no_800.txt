The Samsung LNT3253H 32" LCD has fabulous color and resolution that comparable units fail to achieve.  Many of the other manufacturers that I compared before making this purchase had too much glare and washed out colors.  Sound quality could be better, but I'm glad they put the focus on picture quality since you can always use external speakers.  Lastly, the unit does give off moderate heat through the louvers at the top rear.  If you are going to have this in a picture frame on a wall or a tight fitting entertainment center, I would do some additional research regarding required ventilation and temperature tolerances.  Mine is using the stand on a kitchen counter so not a problem for me.
