I purchased this TV along with a HD-DVD player in May 2007 and I thought it was a pretty good TV after doing extensive research and looking at the picture quality.The worst case scenaio just happened this weekend during the football game- the LCD panel went bad a little more than 3 months outside of the warranty.  After talking to Toshiba, I had an authorized tech out to check it.  He voltmetered one connector on the main panel and said the board on the LCD is bad but they don't make that part so you have to replace the whole panel.  The panel is not cost effective to replace since a brand new set will cost just as much. Toshiba would not offer any financial assistance whatsoever after speaking to a supervisor. They said the set is too old.Bottom line- if you are going to buy this TV get an extended warranty.  A TV this expensive should last more than 16 months.  The TV and the defunct HD-DVD player were a total bust. AVOID TOSHIBA!
