I bought this for the bedroom.  It's a perfect size, any bigger would be overkill.  It remains one of the few medium-sized LCD flat-panels on the market that has native 1080p capability, which means that BluRay looks great on it, as well as upconverted standard-definition DVDs.  Easy set-up, but be forewarned that the stand is not attached when you get the set, so you have to lay the TV flat onto a bed and attach the stand using supplied bolts.  Just be careful that nothing is under the set when you lay it down to attach the stand.  The factory adjustments are fine, but you can also set it to automatically adjust with the ambient light conditions.  Motion is handled well with this set, and it is BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT.  Color is accurate, and I have not noticed any of the banding issues raised with some Sharp TVs.  This is now considered last year's model, so keep on the lookout for clearance deals.  All in all, highly recommended.
