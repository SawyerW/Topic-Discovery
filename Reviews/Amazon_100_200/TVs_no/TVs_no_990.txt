I bought this TV from BJs 4 weeks ago and love it.  I bought it for $579 and it is worth every penny.  For a cheaper priced HDTV, Olevia got it right.  The picture and sound quality are phenomenal.  The Olevia 232V actually has a better picture than my 52" Mitsubishi HDTV.  I only wish this TV had more Component inputs, 1 just isn't enough.  Also, my Comcast Universal Remote doesn't work with this TV either.  I've seen this remote control issue posted on the web from other buyers too.  Buying a dedicated universal remote control may correct this issue, but it's no big deal for me right now to use 2 remotes.Overall, this is a great buy.  I would definitely recommend buying an Olevia TV before spending hundreds more on a more mainstream brand.  The lack of more TV inputs prevents me from giving 5-stars.
