I bought this TV from Circuit City just under two years ago.  About 5 months ago it popped for the first time.  I did my internet research and discovered this common problem and contacted LG, who covered the parts expenses, I just had to cover the $350 for labor.  They said they would only cover these parts once, which screams to me they expected it to happen again.  Well, 5 months later it has popped again.  I can't possibly afford the module that needs to be replaced...again.  So now I have a $3000 piece of garbage.  Learn from me, don't buy Zenith or LG, they don't stand behind their products.  I defiantly learned the hard way.  Always get a reputable brand and always get the extended warranty even if you will have to fight tooth and nail to get the product covered (which you always do with extended warranty, it's still much cheaper than having to buy a new set every couple of years.  I'm now looking at Magnaovox and a few other brands...but never LG or Zenith again.
