This is an excellent TV.  It took awhile to adjust the color and contrast to my liking - the factory settings were not very good.  I'm accustomed to buying Sony's but chose the Sharp because of the 1080p.  The picture is excellent but no matter how I fiddle with it (even using a DVD picture adjuster for HDTV's), the color is almost but just not quite as natural as a Sony.  I also have a 1080p Sony TV and when I watch it, I feel like I can walk into the picture.  I don't quite get the same feeling with this Sharp -  but it is close.  If the price is right, I would buy this TV but all else being equal, I would choose a Sony.
