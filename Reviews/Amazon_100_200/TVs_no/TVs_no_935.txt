I ordered this from amazon after doing a lot of price shopping..Amazon had the best price with free shipping.  I have only had the TV for a week and love the picture and sound. I went back and forth comparing different models but once I got it hooked up I realized any decent Plasma is a ton better then my old 31" tube TV. PLus in 5 years you will probably be able to get a lot better Plasma for $500 so why wait..Quit waiting like I did and get it. I bought this model since my dad had the 4253 and loved it.IMHO the sound is OK but hey it's a TV not a sound system. Still sounds better then my old Tube set.
