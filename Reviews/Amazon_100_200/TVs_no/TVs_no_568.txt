I've had this set for over a month now and could not be more pleased. Video is sharp and color correct right out of the box.  Audio is clear and a blessing for those who don't hear as well as they did in their 30s.  Love the audio setting that keeps commercials from incresing in volume over the show you're watching.  We have digital recording as part of our HD controler.  Recording and play back couldn't be easier.  Especially since ths new shows seem to have pitted by previos favorites against each other.  Thank goodness for the ease of time shifting. If you have digital phone service our cable company will flash the telephone number of the cller on the screen if you get a call while watching the set.
