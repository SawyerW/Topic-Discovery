We bought this TV after looking thru many TVs and considering many factors. This TV is awsome.We heard from many reviews that there may be bad pixels or freen patches...so we hooked up the TV with our cable and checked for that, and found nothing. Picture is exceptionally great....low resolution signal does distort a little bit, but can;t blame high-performance TV for its poor source of signal. We played DVDs and everyone said "WOW".Sound is also nice, enough bass....it has thin speakers, but still we like the sound.Menus are very good and some of the features are really good like half-mute, pic freeze etc...and remote has been very well designed with easy to read big font letters/numbers.Another good feature - it has a swivel base...you could turn arount the TV to suit your sitting arrangement.Remoter is also well designed with big letters - easy to read.We highly recommend this TV.
