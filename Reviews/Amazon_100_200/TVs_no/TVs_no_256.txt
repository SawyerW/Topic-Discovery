Why can't we rate this with zero stars? One star is far too many! Our story is just about identical to many that have been reported here. One day about a month ago there was a loud POP and the TV just stopped working. Unfortunately we didn't pay $600 for it, we paid $1200 in April '06! Funai/Sylvania should be shut down and we do plan on writing letters to the Attorney General, reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and contacting our Congressman to ask for a congressional investigation into this company. Someone needs to start a class-action lawsuit here. We also got the run around about them sending us a box. We made several calls, talked to supervisors and their supervisors and got no help whatsoever. I cringed when I read the great reviews that some have given this TV who have only owned it a few months. I wish them luck. We, also thought it was great and the picture was beautiful until without warning it turned into a piece of junk! Don't buy it!
