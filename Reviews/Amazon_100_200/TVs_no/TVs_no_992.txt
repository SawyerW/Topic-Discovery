I purchased the 232v set from Circuit City in September, 2007 and got a very good price on it. Overall I was happy with the product, but found it buggy. The date and time never worked right and Olevia tech support suggested a firmware upgrade, which was the beginning and the end for this set.The firmware that I downloaded from the Olevia site killed the HDMI port on the set. Consulting with tech support, they sent me another firmware upgrade that killed the set. No picture, no audio. Their return policy does not favor the consumer in anyway.I had purchased the extended warranty, and I was told that the product is not even repairable, it is a return to vendor. I ended up trading in (and up) my set for a Samsung which looks great. Some picture issues have also gone away, which may be the difference between the 8ms response rate on the Olevia and the 6ms response rate on the Samsung. Overall I am much happier that I paid a few extra dollars and got the Samsung.
