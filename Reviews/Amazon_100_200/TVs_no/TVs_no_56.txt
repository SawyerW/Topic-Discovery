I bought this TV in philips outlet for 750$. Used it for less than month now.Pros----1. Cheap, inexpensive, TV for bedrooms or kitchen.2. Picture quality seemed ok with HD , so far.3. Look and Feel of the TV is good.Cons----1. Only one HD-Analog connection (Component to VGA)* Beware of this, though the TV has component input, its not HD Capable unlike all other TVs. Philips gave a special Component to VGA cord, which can be used for regular dvd player progressive scan(480p).2. Only one HD-Digital connection (HDMI)3. Though the TV says 16:9, I can only see 15:9 in wide screen format.4. Black levels are not as dark, it may be scenario with all LCD TVs. Plasmas has dark black levels.5. Poor and long waiting on customer service. I think philips should consider outsourcing customer service, instead of torturing customers with long waits.6. Very badly packaged, so open the package cautiously.7. Wall mountable is included, but it is not tiltable.8. Very very annoyingly poorly written manual, dont expect anything from it.
