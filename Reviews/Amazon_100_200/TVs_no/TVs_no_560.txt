Pros: Good price, great scaling of non-HD content, three HDMI ports, attractive design, lots of inputs and outputs, feels well made, good menu system, very bright (so bright I had to turn it way down since it was TOO bright by default)Cons: 1080P through HDMI only. Even component video will not do 1080p. Limited to 1024x768 through PC VGA port. Seems to be picky about HDMI 1080P input. I tried a cheap RCA upconverting DVD player, but the TV would only accept the HDMI signal at 480p, 720p, and 1080i -- not 1080p. I haven't had a chance to test any other HDMI devices (thus, I have never had the TV actually display 1080p).Update: Been running the TV at 1080P for months, works flawlessly. Make sure you have an HDMI 1.3 cable (which should not cost more than $20USD).Previous problems with 1080P went away when I replaced the cable. HDMI cables are digital, so the other one must have been defective.
