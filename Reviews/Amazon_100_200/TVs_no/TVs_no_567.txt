Great TV overall and one of the least expensive of the major name brands.  One of my favorite features is the black matte finish to virtually eliminate glare and reflection.  Can't say the same about some of the other brands.  The downside is that the TV comes with some awful presets for colors and such.  Took me several days to get it the way I want, but even still it looks somewhat off.  Luckily, it comes with a slew of configurations (especially on service mode).  Pictures in high-def look really sharp.  Fast movements tend to get a little blurry though.  Paid about 1/3rd less than a Samsung equivalent.
