Received this TV from amazon last night and within 30 min of turning it on, the sound went out.  I've had more time to mess with all the settings today and everything is set properly.  It doesn't seem to matter what I have hooked up to it as far as A/V equip goes either.  Right now it's a basic coax cable, but no matter what channel, when it messes up, the whole TV is going haywire.  After turning it off and then back on it fixes the problem, but only for a minute or so.  After multiple experiments, it stays on for about 30 min after sitting turned off for an extended period of time, then after turning it off and on, it will only work for about one minute after....I did that about seven times and every time the sound messed up.  About half the time the video was also scrambled and then went out....simply disappointed and frustrated as now I have to deal with Samsung customer service....awesome.
