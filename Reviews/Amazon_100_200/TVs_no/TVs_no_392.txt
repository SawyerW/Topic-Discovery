We bought this TV in October 2006.  About 2 1/2 months ago, a line appeared on the screen and "grew" to the entire length of the TV.  We called within that week we noticed it and have been given the run around ever since.  The last promise from Samsung is someone will call us to schedule an appointment to replace it.  If it weren't for the slow customer service, I would give the TV 5 stars.  The reason we even gave it 2 stars is because it is a great picture (if you over look our "line.")We expect the TV's we buy to last at least a couple of years!
