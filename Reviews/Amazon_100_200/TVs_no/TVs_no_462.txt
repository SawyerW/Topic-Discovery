I knew that once I opened the box and signed off on delivery the Samsung LNS3251D would be mine and I wouldn't be able to return it, but I didn't expect that Samsung would not assist in having my set's dead pixel issue resolved. Although there are only a few dead pixels in a cluster, they are in the viewing area of the screen. What is strange to me is that I viewed at least 10 display models and none had any dead pixels. (Are the problem screens being "reserved" for Amazon purchasers?) So you need to keep this in mind when purchasing TV's from Amazon.UPDATE:Could not get either Amazon or Samsung to rectify problem.
