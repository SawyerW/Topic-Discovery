I have owned the HP-T064 for 3 weeks now and I am satisfied with the overall quality of picture and sound. One clear strength is getting a fairly decent picture on regular, non-HD signal using either the cable or satellite dish. Play around with the picture controls to your hearts content.One word of caution as expressed by a previous reviewer- in the initial period, watch for burn-in. Even leaving the TV on mute (small checked box on the left lower corner of screen) for a short time was leading to a residual image. It cleared after running the white screen feature for an hour. Also having black bars on the sides of the picture does the same. The warranty does not cover burn-in !!!A minor quibble is with the remote which does not accept the codes for dish network receiver and has no manual search feature.
