It looks great but unfortunately I have not been able to use my Toshiba Regza as during the shipping process it was damaged. EGL delivered the TV late with the box in a terrible state which looked like it had been dropped and dragged. The LCD screen is shattered which can only be seen when it is turned on. Suggestion from Amazon "I would be more than willing to refund you 10% of the total order, which would be $128.00, for keeping the item. If that doesn't work for you I can issue a replacement free of charge.  Since this item does require a specialty shipper we would not be able to expedite the shipment." Hopefully this gets resolved as I have faith that Amazon values their customers.Toshiba REGZA 42HL167 42" 1080p LCD HDTV
