Even at the low price, this TV managed to disappoint in all categories.  The remote is a giant brick with all the important buttons hidden under a slider.  The image quality was fuzzy and poor.  The screen would glitch every once in a while for no apparent reason.  Any white or bright area on the TV (even with the brightness turned down low) would cause a terrible BUZZING sound from inside the unit.  Weighing in at 90 pounds, it was difficult to even rotate it a little by yourself.Let me put it this way -- I had the TV for about 2 months before someone broke into my office and stole it.  I was actually happy to see it go.
