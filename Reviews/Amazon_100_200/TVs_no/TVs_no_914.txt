I just got this tv about 2 weeks ago and couldnt be happier. The tv looks fantastic and works even better. The only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the difficulty i had with getting the correct unit. I ordered teh HP-T5064 and they shipped me the HP-T5054. There really are only subtle differences and about $100 but i expect to receive what i paid for. After being hung up while on a long and aggrevating phone call with Amazon support in some foreign country i called back and spoke with someone in Atlanta. He was able to setup a new order for the correct unit and have my current one picked up at the same time. Overall i am super happy with the tv and neutral about Amazon's so called customer service.
