I just set up the TV as a family Christmas present.  It has an audio problem - a high pitched whine that begins after about 20 minutes of use. It happens after it warms up and won't go away. The digital picture is good. The analog channels are not so good. But, the noise is driving me nuts. Others have had the same problem with audio according to the Amazon Blog.  Now I must  begin the process with Amazon to return it rather than "give a more detailed description of the problem" after contacting Samsung Customer Service.  Think twice about buying this 32" model HDTV until Samsung gets their act together.
