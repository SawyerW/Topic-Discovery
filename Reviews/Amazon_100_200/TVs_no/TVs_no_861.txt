I was unlucky enough to get a defective set, with the sound distorted by a loud buzzing noise.Samsung customer service stubbornly insisted that I pay to have it shipped to their repair facility in New Jersey (I live in California).  That, even though the set was less than a week old.Took nearly a month to get it back, and the buzzing noise soon returned!No way I'm paying even more for shipping it back to Samsung; I decided I'm stuck with the problem.  Had to buy an amp and speakers in order to have sound without the buzzing distortion which plagued the set's speakers.I found Samsung customer service to be brusque and anything but helpful.
