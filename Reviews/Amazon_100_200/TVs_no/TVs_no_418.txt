I have had the TV for a week or two, and it's working out great.  The picture is really clear, and the surrround sound works great.  The setup was easy.  All one would do is connect the cable and power cord to the back of the TV, and you're watching TV.  The TV has 3 picture settings-16 to 9, zoom 1 and 2, 4 to 3.  I tried all 3, and the picture is clear.  I like the channel setting.  It's where one can add, rewmove, or pic a favorite channel.  It also has a custom picture equalizer-brightness, contrast, fine tune, red/green, tint.  The hand held controller works great.  Nothing really fancy, your average contoller.
