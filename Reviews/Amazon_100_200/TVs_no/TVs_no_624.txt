I don't make large purchases very often, I spent a lot of time going from store to store (large retail local stores you name it I went there), I looked at all of the screens. some looked pixelated, some didn't handle red very well, and the ones I liked were out of my budget.  I started considering an on-line purchase initially for the cost. I checked reviews, and then picked the best reviewed screen within my price range, that was 42' in size.  I never got to look at this modle in a store and was very worried it would have screen trash, it arrived, I opened the box and set it up (easily) plugged in my cable and .. Hummmmmmmm I was in heaven. it didn't have 1080p but its picture surpassed some of the 1080p screens I saw that fit my price range (I.E. not the best brand)  Highly recommended.
