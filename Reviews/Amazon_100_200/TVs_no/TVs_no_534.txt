We were ready to move our ten year old big screen , which still works just fine but is obviously missing a lot of the improvements of newer tvs , to our basement. Our old brand was a Zenith so we decided to go with them again since we had such good luck with the old one. I was afraid we would be disappointed but we absolutely love this tv. Not only does it have all the improvements that we were missing, but for the price the picture is fantastic and since we are setting it on a raised hearth the depth of less that 18" is just fine. After looking at the more expensive really flat panels and deciding to hold off a while, we happened across this tv and have no regrets.
