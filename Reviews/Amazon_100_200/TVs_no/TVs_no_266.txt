I received this TV about a month ago, and other than a small problem with the supporting feet being bent during shipment, I have not had a single problem.  Use it in our master bedroom, and am amazed at the color and brightness this TV offers.  Have it connected to a Dish Network 942 HDTV receiver, and the HD channels look incredible even though it isn't an HDTV.  Using Component Video cables to receiver, and cannot stop watching Discover HD channel.  Audio is fine for our bedroom, but I can see if it where in a large family room it wouldn't get loud enough.  Shortly after purchasing this TV Amazon lowered the price and I was pleased to find that they gave me the difference of the price back to me when I called to ask why the price was dropped shortly after purchase.  That being said, if you want a truly budget TV, then this is your sure thing.
