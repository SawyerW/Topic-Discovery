I chose this specific model because of great reviews by Consumer Reports. Its nice, but not perfect, and not purely the manufacturer's fault.1) I ordered this through Amazon's 3rd Party Electronics Expo.  Upon turning on the TV for the first time, I noticed a bright red dot near one of the corners.  I called the vendor, whom said this was "normal" for LCD technology to have imperfect pixel dots.  I called Toshiba, whom said the same thing.  So I am stuck with a defective TV and out $1300.  I filed a compliant with Amazon, whom still hasn't gotten back to me yet.2)1080P is spectactular with HD DVDs.  I also have a Toshiba A30 HDDVD player hooked up to the TV with HDMI.  However, with regular DVDs, they look worse than they do on a classic cathode-ray TV, even with 1080P upconvert.  The pixelation is very visable, and there is a "have" of blinking pixels no matter what.  Perhaps this will be corrected as the the technology advances.
