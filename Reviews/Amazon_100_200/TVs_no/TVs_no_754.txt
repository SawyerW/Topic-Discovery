I had been researching lcd/plasma tvs for months now thinking about making a purchase when I happened upon a gold box deal for this Tv.  I had been keeping my eye on the 32" model from the same Samsung series, but for the price of $800 with an upconverting dvd player and free shipping, this Tv could not be beat.  Currently the Tv is pricing around $1,000, so not quite as good of a deal, but I would still say it's a fantastic purchase.  Great picture, plenty of hookups, and 2 coax inputs (for a cable box and an external antenna, which really can't be beat for crisp free OTA hdtv for local channels), there really is nothing bad to say about the set.After reviewing lots of tvs online and in person, I'd say this series of the Samsung lcd line is a great value for the price and one of the best lcds out there right now.  Although at this point in time, you might as well step up to the 2008 model (unless you too are lucky enough to happen upon a great 2007 model closeout price).Ryan
