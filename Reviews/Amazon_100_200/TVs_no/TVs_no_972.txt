I've never reviewed a product on Amazon before despite my many purchases here.  However, I've been so frustrated by this particular TV that the time has come.  I was able to use my TV for about 10 minutes - during which I have to say it looked and sounded pretty good - and then the sound went out.  Completely.  I returned the unit at my own cost to Westinghouse.  That was in April 2008, this is almost July, and I still...don't...have a TV.  Their warranty process is completely screwed up, and though the agents on the phone are plenty nice, they can't do a darn thing.  So enjoy the TV if it works for you, but if it doesn't, be prepared for a long, drawn-out torture of customer service absurdity.  You've been warned.
