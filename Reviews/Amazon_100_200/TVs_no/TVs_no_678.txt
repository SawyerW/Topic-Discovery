Model LNT4061 worked fine until I downloaded an upgrade to their firmware from their website & now my tv no longer has a correct picture.  the picture is with paisley prints and wild wavy colors.  Their 800 phone number rep told me that I should not download anything without first speaking to them.  No where does the website say call first - but no worries they said tv's older than 5yrs are junk and should be tossed. Can you imagine.  BE very carefully buying from them - this tv also has issues with turning on & off 4-6 times before staying on.
