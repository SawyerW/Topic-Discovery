I bought this just when it came out and the TV was pretty good while it was under its warranty. There were some issues with the sound where the speakers muffled and the volume on different channels would sometimes be astoundingly higher than others. But none of that really bothered me too much, if you want a nice HDTV you should probably pony up for surround sound anyways. The thing that really irks me is the cheap capacitors that Samsung used, which all blew out one month after the warranty expired. Now when I try to turn the TV on, it clicks for a few minutes with the red light blinking and when it finally powers on, I get a picture filled with blue and purple pixels. This is the same issue that has been documented by thousands of other owners of this TV online. Just do a quick Google search.
