I ordered this item twice.  The first screen came poorly packaged and the unit looked like it was dropped then packed up with foam plastic.  I sent it back thinking it was UPS who had dropped it durring delivery.  I ordered another one.  The 2nd one came again poorly packaged but it did not appear to be damaged. Thats when I plugged it in. I found the picture to have burned out pixels.  Ahhh not again.  The picture also was not clear. I dont know much about flat panel LCDs but I will pass on this company due this experiance.... Now i just need to wait for my credit to buy somthing else.  Maybe a Samsung or NEC...  Good luck with yours!!!
