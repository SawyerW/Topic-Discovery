Mine was purchased at Circuit City exactly 3 1/2 years ago (similar to another person here). Today it made a loud bang from behind the set and was accompanied by an electrical burning smell. The screen faded to almost black.  I called a repair center today and based on what happened, the repair guy says it is probably a driver board and will cost anywhere from $300-$600 to fix.Okay, I paid over $3,200 for this set (good price at the time).  Basically thus far, this T.V. cost me $76/month to use.  IF I pay to repair it, who knows how long it will last until it fails again.Odds are, I will scrap it, do my research for a more reliable brand, buy an extended warranty, and kiss a few hundred dollars goodbye on a smaller LCD set.Thanks Zenith (LG) for [...] my wallet dry.
