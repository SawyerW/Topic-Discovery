Real good tv with LCD HDTV technology for this price, it beats the store prices by at least a couple of hundred dollars. The shipping was great too, my order arrived in less than 4 business days. the picture quality is great with ordinary digital cable, I think I get a very good picture on the digital channels.  I tried my progressive scan DVD player with the TV and the picture was amazing.Pros:1. Great for this price2. Very good with digital channels3. Black stylish tv on a swiveling stand4. Bright and brilliant colors in the best picture modeCons:1. Picture is not great for ordinary channels2. Have to sit at least 6 feet away to reduce pixel effect
