my wife & i did a good bit of research in brick & mortar stores before visiting amazon.  i was actually looking at a slightly less expensive model samsung with 3000:1 contrast ratio, but then i saw that something like 70% of the people who viewed that model ended up ultimately purchasing this one with 4000:1.  i've had this beauty in my living room now for 6 weeks and it's inspired lust in the hearts of all the folks who've come by to visit.  regular tv looks great, but the hd channels are mind-bogglingly beautiful.  strong buy recommendation!  ps, buying on amazon got me a better product with no sales tax & ended up saving me over $700.
