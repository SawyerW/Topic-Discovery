After much research I bought this TV through Amazon, and after 3 days it had a snowy picture. After spending a great deal of time confirming that the problem was in the set, not my cable set-up, I had to send it to a repair shop (at my cost!). While the Samsung customer service people were friendly and apologetic and the vendor (BuyDig) refunded the shipping, I have been without the TV for 10 days now and the parts are on backorder until who knows when?This policy, whether its Amazon's or Samsung's, sucks. I pay almost $700  and get left hanging, waiting for a defective TV that will now always be suspect. DO NOT BUY A TV FROM AMAZON IN THIS WAY AGAIN! DEMAND THAT DEFECTIVE SETS GET IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT, NOT A REPAIR NIGHTMARE!
