I bought this set for a number of reasons: 1) I wanted the "narrower" 26in width with the speakers along the bottom to fit into my desk cabinet. 2)I wanted a PC input 3) I wanted two coax inputs, one for OTA (over the air, free HDTV) and a standard cable coax input. 4) Built-in ATSC tuner. I'm not using a STB (set top box) at this time. This LCD unit was the only 26" set that could meet these requirements.  I paid ~$800 in March of 2007 - free shipping from Amazon, new not refurb. HD picture quality is as good as my Panasonic Plasma, analog picture quality is very good, sound is adequate for my office. I'm not a gamer, so no opinion regarding that.Features I wish this set had :  QAM tuner (allows tuning local HDTV over standard cable TV connection (no STB required), remote is clumsy when direct selecting a channel number ("enter" key is well below the numbers keypad.I would buy this HDTV again.
