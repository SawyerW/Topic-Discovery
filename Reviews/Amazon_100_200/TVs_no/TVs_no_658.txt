The Good:=========This TV has exceeded my expectations in terms of image quality. It also makes for an amazing computer monitor with full 1080p resolution.The Bad:========- The remote control is very sluggish in responding, specially when the TV has just been turned on- The audio and the video are out-of-synch in many digital and analog channels (maybe it's just my unit), this also occurs with other inputs, such as composite. The delay is small but enough to notice when people are talking and you see the lips moving slightly out of synch with the voice you hear. I called samsung about this and they will have it fixed soon.Despite the problems, it's a great TV overall.
