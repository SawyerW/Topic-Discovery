I've waited over a year to buy a HD television.  Originally, I was holding out for a 1080p of another brand.  But, after reading a lot of reviews and commentary on HD tv's, I decided this was the one for me.  I'm so glad I didn't spend the extra money.  The picture is sharp and I love the choice of screen sizes, picture and sound modes.  A few times there has been "real" stereo sound and it's been wonderful.  These are powerful little speakers...I tend to keep the sound at less than half.The set was sent from Texas and arrived in less than a week.  The delivery man was delightful.  He not only delivered the set, he unpacked it, set it up and made sure it was working properly before he left.  A real gentleman.  My small tip was way too little.  I am very happy with my purchase (even though the one I originally wanted was on a super sale the very next week!!!)
