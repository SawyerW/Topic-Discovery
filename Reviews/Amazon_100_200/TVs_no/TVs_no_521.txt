My parents bought this tv about a year ago when it was $1500.00. The tv may be ok for the money now, but it sure was not worth what they paid and my mother has said several times they wish they had not bought it. The biggest issue is distortion at 16:4 of objects. They appear too wide and there is NO adjustment for this (according to the manual) which is crazy for a tv that cost this much. The other problem that won't bother too many people is  a missing feature for pc input. The manual claims this model has this feature yet the menu will not allow you to select it as a source (with or without a pc connected). It is grayed out and if you look at Samsung's website you will see this is a common complaint that is mentioned in the faq yet no mention on how to actually solve it. Probably just a software bug as the tv has the vga connector but they should not have released the tv until these issues were resolved. Hopefully newer models have these problems corrected but stay away unless you get it really cheap.
