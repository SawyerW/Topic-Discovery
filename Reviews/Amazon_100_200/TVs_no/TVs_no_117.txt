I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable.  But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.
