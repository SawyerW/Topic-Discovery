I own this model of television and have been pretty happy with it for about four years.  Unfortunately about a month ago turning the set on became problematic.  It makes a clicking sound for a few minutes before giving up.  Sometimes it eventually turns on after several attempts.  I researched this issue via the internet and discovered that my problem is typical.  Apparently the capacitors that Samsung used on their boards were not rated to an appropriate voltage so they burn out.  I spoke to a Samsung service representative and they deny that there is an issue with this model, even though a simple Google search says otherwise.  They offered to send a technician to my house but said that I would be responsible for the cost of the repair.  I've decided to replace the faulty capacitors myself, just like many others who have had this issue (search for "samsung lcd tv repair capacitor" on youtube for examples).  I will not be purchasing any more Samsung products, however.  A $1400 television set (the price when I bought it) should last longer.
