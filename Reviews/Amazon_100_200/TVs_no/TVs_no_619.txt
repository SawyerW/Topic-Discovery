This is my first LCD and I couldn't be happier with it.  I spent 3 months researching TV's before settling on this one.  This set has excellent contrast with good black levels.  A lot of the cheaper, or even similar priced, LCD's have very gray blacks.  Be prepared to spend some time tweaking the picture settings for each input to get exactly what you want.The glossy black bezel looks really nice in my living room, but keep your kids away from it or you'll be wiping off smudges all the time.  The remote could probably be a little better, but I'm going to get a universal remote soon anyway.  I now have 5 remotes and it has become too confusing for the rest of the family to use.
