After months of research about brand, screen size, screen type, and resolution, I settled on this 720p LCD from Samsung. Don't believe the hype about 1080p sets at this size: it is absolutely the case that at this size (40 inch) the difference between the look of 720p and 1080p signals are negligible at the viewing distance most people will sit from their sets (6-10ft). Do yourself a favor and save some cash, unless you absolutely must have the newest tech toy. Me? I'd rather put the $500 toward a pair of speakers that look and sound the part next to this marvelous LCD.Colors are rich, sharp, and with no noticeable ghosting or pixelation. I've heard some folks complain about the hidden speakers sounding muddled, or uninspiring. With a bit of EQ tuning I think they sound fantastic for on-board speakers.Ordered from Amazon on a Monday evening with free shipping (and at $500 less than retail in BB or Circuit City!). The set was at my door by Wednesday afternoon. Unbelievable!No complaints. This is a gorgeous set at a fantastic price.
