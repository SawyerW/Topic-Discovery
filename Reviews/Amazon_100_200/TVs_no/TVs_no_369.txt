I'm glad I went with this television set.  I was considering other ~40" sets including LG, Sony, and Sharp.  Although Samsung might not display the best HD I think overall it is the best set if you consider price (I paid ~1,300), HD quality, and non-hd quality.  I specifically bought this set because of the other reviews I have read about its ability to show non-HD channels in great quality.  It didn't disappoint.  My friend owns a 46" Sharp Aquos and I can honestly say I didn't like the way the regular channels came out on it.  I did have to adjust the color settings on the Samsung but I think you'll have to do that on any other set anyways.  It also has no problems with bright or dark rooms as I've tried both.  Overall I am very happy and will probably buy another for my bedroom soon.
