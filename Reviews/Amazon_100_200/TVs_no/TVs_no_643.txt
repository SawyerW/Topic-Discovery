Ok, this will be a short review.  I heard good things about this TV from various other places, checked one out in a store and was impressed as well.  Killer picture.  Amazon's price was by FAR the lowest.  It was shipped to me quickly and without trouble.  Setup was a snap (although you will need two people, it's not super heavy, but a little awkward).  HD from my cable (1080i) looks insane... watched the great HD Earth series and... wow.  Everyone that has seen the HD picture on this thing has been impressed.  I can't say enough good things about the picture.  Bright rich colors, deep sexy blacks, etc.  The only minor imperfection (that others have commented on) is the sound quality.  It has down firing speakers, so the sound doesn't really come out and grab you at all.  It is adequate, but if you want that home theater experience, you will need to hook up some nice external speakers & sub (but then you should do that anyway).  Very very happy with this TV.
