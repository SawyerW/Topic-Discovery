The TV came in perfect condition, and as many others have already said, the TV itself is beautiful.  I am using my PS3 to watch 1080p video on it, and even sitting only 2-3 feet away (at my computer desk) it looks great.Service from EGL shipping was fast, especially for being free.  I ended up receiving mine 5 whole days before EGL's estimated delivery date--very nice.  One thing to note, which didn't bother me too bad, was that other people mentioned thed elivery person would stay until you set it up to make sure it was a good TV... Thankfully mine showed up in perfect condition, but the delivery guy said he wouldn't stay because he was too busy.  Just something to note that most likely will not affect many people's buying experience.  Buy it here! It's too cheap to pass up :)
