I did a lot of research and I picked this TV for the good value.  I was truely happy with this set for the first few months until the blue dots started showing up.  The random blue dots only show up when I'm stretching a standard definition show and they only show in the top left part of the screen.  It also seems to be related to the audio as I can see the beautiful "northern lights" change with the audio.  If you only watch Hi-def then I would still recommend this screen.  If you feel lucky or like a random 'northern lights' experience then I still recommend this screen. :-)
