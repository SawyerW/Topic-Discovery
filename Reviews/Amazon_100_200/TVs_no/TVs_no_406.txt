Having looked around at different online deals for this TV, I found that Amazon had the best deal when I factored in shipping and sales tax. I was concerned about the shipping time and quality of service, but was very pleasantly surprised to find that Eagle shipping and Amazon worked well together to handle changes in my shipping destination (after my office refused delivery and I had to redirect the shipment to my home) and that the TV was delivered, carried up three flights of stairs, unboxed and set up for me - well inside the delivery appointment window and also well ahead of the original delivery estimate. Very pleased with price and service.
