Did do much research on different TVs in stores and online.  To purchase high priced item like this online was biggest hurdle.  Glad  I did though used the reviews to learn from others expereinces.  Eagle was solid  for free shipping,  6 days from order to watching it in my bedroom. Save bundle VS Circuit City and Best Buy  prices.On to the TV.  Picture is very nice.  Red and Greens on my Panasomic Plasma slighly better but its close.  Like the versatilty of the connections it offers.  Having 2 HDMI is nice. As mentioned by other reviewers the speakers are not that strong.  Maybe awkward placement in the cabinet?  Overall very pleased  only been couple days I am hoping the Samsung reliabiltiy continues long term.
