Purchased from Best Buy for Christmas 3 years ago.  Now it clicks but won't turn on.  A local Samsung certified TV repair shop says $350 to replace the motherboard.  Samsung online customer service said the repair isn't covered.  Customer service phone customer service said it's not covered.  After escalating to Executive Customer Service (800) 522-7341 they said we will send out a repair person for a free one-time fix for capacitors -- IF that is the problem, Samsung will cover it.  Otherwise you will have to pay.  I won't buy another Samsung TV.  Do a quick internet search and you will see lots of hits for "bad capacitors" for various Samsung TVs.
