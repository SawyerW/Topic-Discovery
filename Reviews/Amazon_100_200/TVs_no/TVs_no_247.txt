We've had our Grand Wega for over a year now and it is the most amazing tv out there.  Nothing compares to it.  People will be visiting and if the tv is on they are just stop and stare in awe of the quality picture.  We had considered the plasma screens and projection screens for our little theatre room but upon seeing the Grand Wega's rear projection we just knew it was the one. Plasma can not really be viewed well from an angle and front projection screens really lack clarity and pureness in the image.  A football game on this thing is better than being there.
