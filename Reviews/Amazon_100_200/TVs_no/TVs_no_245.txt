I purchased this TV April 2006. The TV was advertised as 1080p capable. Salesperson in a store said that it can show 1080p resolution pictures. He also said that I can watch movies in 1080p resolution where Blue-ray player is available. I have waited for the devices to be available at stores and finally bought a PlayStation 3 which has Blue-ray drive equipped. I connected the PS3 to this SONY KDS-R60XBR1 TV with Blue-Ray Movie put in the player by HDMI cable. I was frustrated by realizing this TV is not an actual 1080p TV. I called SONY. They say KDS-R60XBR1 is not a 1080p TV but 1080p display. SONY said that it just shows pictures that look like 1080p pictures. How can a TV with 1080p capability and 1080p term in the upfront not show any 1080p resolution pictures? Be careful this TV is not a 1080p TV. It's a 1080p display which the screen output may look like 1080p TV by their definitions. It sure does not make senses at all to me.
