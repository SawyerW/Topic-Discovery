I got a great deal here on Amazon buying this tv in March 2008. They beat Best Buy, Circuit City and Frys on the price. No sales tax and free delivery.However, after 15 months (3 months out of warranty) it started having issues turning on (it would make clicking noises for up to 10 minutes before it would turn on). After some internet sleuthing, my husband ended up replacing some cheap parts. After a trip to Radio Shack and digging out his trusty soldering iron, I think it cost us $15 (that included his lunch at Del Taco).But the issue remains: $1100 tvs should last longer than 15 months. It makes me question purchasing Samsung products in the future.If you're having issues, google it, find yourself a local geek to go pick up the parts at Radio Shack, solder them in, and save some money. It's a 20-minute fix, mostly unscrewing screws from the back of the LCD and reattaching them later (driving time not included).
