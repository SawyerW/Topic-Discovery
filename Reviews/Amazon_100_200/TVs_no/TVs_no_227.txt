Have the Zenith plasma 50" Z50PX2D purchased 4/6/07.  We are probably below average TV users and TV popped Sept. 11, 2008.  17 months after install.  Did not buy extended warranty.  TV repairman from store that TV was purchased from picked up TV and has had it for 2 weeks with no news.  I started looking for a new TV and came across all these "popping" reviews.  I will call local store to inform him of this problem and that I am not alone.  However, when I called checking on status, clerk said he has 8 flat screens that he is working on and waiting for parts!  I will also call the 877-543-8325 posted previously and see what they can do for us.  Update:  Called LG & talked to a supervisor and he is helping me.  My confidence for Zenith/LG has been restored!
