Crisp picture, good blacks, good contrast, easy set-up, sound is acceptable though we've hooked up external speakers so that the audio will be as excellent as the video. Before we purchased it we read reviews of comparable sets and are pleased that we chose this one. The first set we got had a vertical line on the screen, so we called Sharp's customer service, and they very quickly picked up the set and brought a replacement, which has been perfect. We are pleased both with the quality of the tv and the responsiveness of Sharp's tech support/customer service. The only thing we would change is the glossy cabinet because of the glare and because it has to be dusted so carefully and so frequently; would prefer matte black. We purchased a Toshiba 19" lcd hdtv/dvd combo about the same we got this Sharp, and were unhappy with the washed-out picture; we exchanged it for the 19" Sharp combo, which has a much, much better picture and was so much easier to set up. Happy all around.
