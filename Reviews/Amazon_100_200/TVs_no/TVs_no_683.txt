What a piece of junk.  I purchased this set in March of 2008.  Now, a little over a year and of course out of warranty.  The television is experiencing issues with staying powered on.  When it does power on it usually comes up with most of the screen covered in purple pixels.  This is completely unnacceptable!!!I called Samsung support and they suggested unplugging the TV for a full minute to "reboot" the TV.  This, of course, did nothing to help with the problem.  Besides trying to locate my own repair service (no Samsung authorized repair center within a 50 mile radius), this was all they suggested...I am now stuck with broken television, that hardly lasted a year!!  What a joke!I will never purchase a Samsung product again.Jo
