I purchased this in Dec. 2007 and was very pleased with:ease of setup, picture quality and color tone.  Am a bit ofa cheapskate, so boosted the rather low sound with computerspeakers and the headphone jack...It even played a DVD I'dcreated in iDVD w/ no troubles at all ;-)Was worried about buying my first 'combo' as it seems one part alwaysseems to fail...Have been having major problems the past couple of weeks with the DVD player:skipping, freezing, and just not working well at all!  Cleaned discs,ran cleaning discs through the player - nothing is helping.  Hauled-outmy former DVD player to check a particularly troublesome DVD- and no playback/freezing at all! [All were movies / store-bought.]Read some other reviews where folks have DVD's permanently stuckin the mechanism...unfortunately, I think that's where mine is headed!Will keep my fingers crossed - and the old player setup just in case.
