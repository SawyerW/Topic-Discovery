This TV is excellent - took about 10 minutes to set up turned it on and perfect picture, great sound.  I already had a small 17" LCD which I use as a combination PC Monitor and TV, so I knew LCD's were very clear.  This Samsung is even clearer, so clear that our Sony Projection TV is hardly watched any longer, and that picture is fairly clear.  We are so impressed that we are going to buy another LCD in the 37" or 40" range for the formal living room.I highly recommend this, this is coming from a very jaded person, me!Ray
