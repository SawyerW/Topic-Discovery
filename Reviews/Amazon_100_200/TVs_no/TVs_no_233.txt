Mine went pop today, just a few days before Christmas.  Nice!  I read your other reviews here and it looks like I'm screwed.  BTW, LG bought Zenith a few years ago, before they manufactured this model, so LG is to blame.  I'll follow up if they stand behind their product but I won't hold my breath.  If the repairs don't last any longer than the original, I may not even waste my time with this one.  Thanks for the big bill at Christmas LG!!!  I will never buy a LG/Zenith/Goldstar again!!!  This is ridiculous.  I will however, buy HD again, as the video was beautiful until today.  Arrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!  60,000 hours my A$$.  Mine lasted just over 2 years and we didn't use it that often.
