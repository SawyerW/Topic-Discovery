I've been looking at HDTV's for 2 years now.  I looked at DLP's and Plasma's first.  However, I must say I love this 40" LCD best!  The picture is great in HDTV and very good on non HD channels too. With the price it's at now I don't think you will be disappointed.  The only negative is fast scrolling letters across the screen ex. espn news flashs are a little blury. I think you will have a hard time buying a better TV.  Amazon also had great prices on Monster cables and surge protectors too.  I plan to put on 15lbs this year with this TV!!!!!
