The HDTV was our Christmas present to each other.  It is now in the repair shop!  It ran for maybe 2 weeks and then we could no longer get reception.  We are in a rural MN location so we use an antenna.  Got faulty advice from the factory "phone techs" 2X.  We are unsure if the problem will be taken care of satisfactorily without a charge because the set is still in the shop.  We are off to a bad start with this unit.  We bought this unit from the low cost supplier over the net - Maybe a bad move.
