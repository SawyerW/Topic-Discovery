I did lots of research as to what type of TV (plasma, rear projection, etc)is best in the HDTV world.  For the space in my house, I needed a TV less than 40 inches so was fairly limited b/w smaller Plasmas and larger LCD's.I looked at the Sharp, but was willing to go with the Olevia due to the # of favorable user reviews I found.  There are a couple of 'expert reviews' that don't recommend Olevia (Cnet), but there were some very favorable recommendations (extremetech [...] gave it an 8/10)I received the TV in fine shape - excellent packing.  I was shocked to have it up and running within 5 minutes and looking great - I expected it would take much longer.  I had Comcast upgrade to the HD service and Hi-def looks awesome on the TV.  The old analog channels are passable, not great...but I'm hoping most the programming will move hi-def.Hope this helps in your search.
