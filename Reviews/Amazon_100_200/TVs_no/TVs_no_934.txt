I intended to buy the newest Panasonic 42 inch plasma, but when I did a direct comparison of the pictures provided by the Panasonic and the Samsung, the Samsung was far superior re. brightness, contrast, and resolution.  I bought the Samsung, and am extremely pleased.  The shiny finish also looks great (much better than the dull finish on the Panasonic). For people buying their first plasmas, please note that the 10 watt speakers (which are common for all 42 inch plasmas) are barely adequate.  This is not a criticism of the Samsung; all similar plasmas have 10 watt speakers.  You will probably want to buy a surround system and receiver, so be prepared for the additional expenditure.  Overall, this is the best plasma out there for the price.
