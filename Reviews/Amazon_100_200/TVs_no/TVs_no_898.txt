This HDTV 1080p has a very good appearance and the images, even not the HD ones,  are outstanding. I am very happy with it and the price,  through Amazon.com, was 58% less than in certain other retailers.My only relatively negative point about this TV is the fact that the manual controls are on the top of the TV. This renders them useless if you hang the TV up in a wall. You can not reach them if you need to use manual controls by some reason.Over all, it was an excellent buy and certainly worth the money and the five stars. How about the same fixtures in a 26"? I would buy it.
