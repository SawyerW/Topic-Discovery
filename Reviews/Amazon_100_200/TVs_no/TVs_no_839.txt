Samsung reliability is terrible and completely unacceptable. My following 2 Samsung LCD TV's LNT4066 & LNT1953H which I purchased in fall of 2007 both died within a month of each other. They were built in 4/2007 and fell victim to Samsung using cheap power supply capacitors.....No product which cost as much money as a TV cost should fail after only 3 years of the same issue. Samsung TV's have great pictures and the past performance reviews have been very good, however I cannot and will not ever buy another samsung product again!!!!!I have a Samsung PN50A650 Plasma also. Everytime I turn it off now I wonder now if it will ever work again. Way to go Samsung!!! Good business practice scimp on Quality and lose another loyal customer!
