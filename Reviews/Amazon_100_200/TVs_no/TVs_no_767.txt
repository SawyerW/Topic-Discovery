I was very apprehensive at first to buy this tv after all the bad press in regards to the sound card.  After looking at the other options availablke in tv's I was continually drawn back to the LNT3253H.  Once it arrived I registered it immediately to check on the manufacture date, held my breath and found it was July 27th 2007 which gave me enormous relief.  Like the 40" LNT4065F I purchased just two months before, the LNT3253H has lived up to its quality expectance by far.  The set is now a month old, the color incredible, the sound outstanding, the HD 1080 color and depth of picture phenominal.Apparently Samsung realized they had a problem, and must have resolved it.  Hopefully everyone else is happy with this product on all the recent shipments.NormChicago
