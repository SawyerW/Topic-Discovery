Samsung plasmas have come a LONG way in 5-years, and the picture on these 6th generation plasmas is just about as good as gets right now.  Looking side-by-side compared to Panasonic, Pioneer, LG, Hitachi, and Toshiba, the Pioneers are the only ones with a better, brighter, more vivid picture than this Samsung... but those 50" Pioneers are at least $1,000 more on average, and you can compare for yourself to the Samsung and see if you can tell a $1,000 difference.  Doubtful; this picture is as sharp or sharper than any non-Pioneer 50" out there right now.  I would have given a 5-star review if any of the Samsungs included a cable card or SD card slot.  The Panny's had the SD card slot, but still didn't justify the $300 difference.  This 5064 model has a comparable USB slot for picture viewing and works just as well.  All the manufacturers seem to have just about given up on the cable card slots, which I'm sure is exactly how the cable card companies want it... so a separate cable box it is.
