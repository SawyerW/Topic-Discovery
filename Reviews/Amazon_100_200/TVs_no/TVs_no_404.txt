I really like this TV.Good:The SD performance is good. The digital processor is top noch.The HD picture is as good as any.I'm satisfied with the contrast.There is a lot of input options.The HD tuner is pretty good.  I'm only using a $3 rabbit ears and get all the major HD channels with solid signal strength (most transmitters are 20-30 miles away).Great price for a name brand.Amazon's delivery was fast and courteous.The not so good features are minor, but I'll list them incase it helps the reader decide:No QAM tuner.The remote/IR reciever is not great.  There are times I push the buttons on the remote and the TV doesn't respond. You need to point the remote at the lower right corner of the tv for best response.Clunky menu navigation (function buttons on the remote help, though)Univ. Remote has no codes for DVRs (Tivo/ReplayTV)
