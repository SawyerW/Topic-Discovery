i bought a 32" samsung lcdtv in november for $1000. but returned it after a few weeks.  a month later, the 50" plasma was only $1400. i decided to buy this 50" plasma and its well worth the $400 upgrade from 32" to 50", and from lcdtv to plasma. the box was humongous!! i ordered it on a thursday and i got a call saturday night that they were going to deliver it on a "SUNDAY". can you believe it? they deliver on a SUNDAY?? i love my 50" plasma, its fricking HUGE. weights about 100 pounds and it looks absolutely breath taking.
