As far as the TV is concerned, it's a great 40-inch LCD.  It has a thin bezel (thinner than most LCD's) that allowed it to fit in my bedrooms armoire.  Great picture in HD and as with nearly all HDTV's, a so-so SD picture.  Make sure to look up calibration settings for this TV here [...] for the best picture.My only real complaint is typical of all Samsung TV's, crappy PIP.  This one's was especially bad because it's picture would only take up approx 1/8 of the screen.  And as usual, only displays cable and off-air channels.  I guess at least it offers PIP.  I think I'm like the last guy on earth that cares about that feature though.I ordered my TV from Amazon's Warehouse deals.  It arrived 2 days after I ordered it, and only had a slight crack with a few scratches on the lower right silver bezel.  Tv works flawlessly and is still covered by Samsung's 1-year warranty.  Overall a great deal and a great TV!
