UPDATE: Exactly two weeks after having my tv unpacked, Samsung's outsourced service department came to my home and fixed the problem. Turned out there was one cable loose inside the tv and it literally took the repairman five minutes to fix it. That's it a loose cable. i could have fixed it myself. now the tv is as beautiful as i remembered seeing it before i bought it. bright picture that you can view from any angle. I would now rate this tv a 4 out of 5 stars. for the back story, read below:just ordered this tv. got it home. unpacked it. didn't turn on. major disappointment. there is some kind of short in the electric system. have searched online and have seen basically zero reviews for this tv. now i'm dealing with samsung's manufacturer's warantee. you may want to look into amazon's policy before purchasing a tv. i thought the price on this tv was amazing. and you know what? the tv looks great in my living room, except it doesn't turn on. thus i have to give the overall rating 1 star. i'll let you know if it gets fixed. buyer beware.
