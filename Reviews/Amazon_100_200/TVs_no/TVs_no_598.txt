Have this TV now for 5 or 6 weeks, together with a $100 sony upconverting dvd player and the picture is just beautiful (who needs blu-ray).Watching my old dvd's looks so different now with so much detail that couldn't be seen before. Was originally trying to get a 1080p but after some research into whats available right now with this screen size and also reliability ratings, I decided on the toshiba. My old toshiba was a great tv, I hope this one lasts as long. One minor issue I have is if you use a surge protector and turn it on before you try turning on the tv, then it sometimes takes 2 trys and/or a short wait before you can actually turn it on.  Overall, highly recommended (eagle shipping was a week late but I guess you can expect that)
