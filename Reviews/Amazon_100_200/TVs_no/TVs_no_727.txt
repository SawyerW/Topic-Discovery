Is it the greatest TV ever? NO, but it is the absolute best you'll get anywhere near the price. Picture did take a lot of adjustment, but we did finally get it "perfect" Sound quality isn't the best, but again for the price we can get a surround sound system. My only real complaint is with the shipping...After reading all of the instructions to the shipping Co. from amazon I found out that Eagle was supposed to set it up for me and throw out all the packaging. All they did was dump it off in the middle of my living room. and their dolly left spots all over my carpet...If you buy this T.V. or any other large item from amazon watch the shipping people.
