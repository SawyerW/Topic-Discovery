Amazon delivery service was great, the TV is perfect, got a great deal...saved about $600 over the 1080P version (Samsung FPT5084 50" 1080p Plasma HDTV) and I honestly could not see the difference in pictures when comparing them in stores. This model has the all black around the edge with a blue LED and the 1080p version has a slightly different look with some chrome on the sides. Anyway, I couldn't be happier. Of course I had to toally let go of the "I need 1080p" feeling just to match specs with HD-DVD and Blu-Ray. I'm happy I dod since now I can afford a player or Apple TV as an addition!
