This TV is very underrated, I've had it for a few months now and I must say, everything about it is awesome. It has tons of inputs on the back, 2 HDMIs, 2 Video, 2 Components, and a VGA in for your PC! The VGA on the back is my favorite, I hook my laptop up to it and use it like a massive monitor. The stock speakers are decent, but I use a Frankenstein system made up of 7 speakers and a sub. Picture Quality is awesome, COD and GH:WT look great on HDMI and 720p. Oh, and if you're a Guitar Hero enthusiast like myself, the lag is about 35ms, but that setting works perfect for me.Pros:-Excellent picture quality-Tons of inputs for devices, designated audio out-Great for gaming, TV, and computers-Underrated, I guarantee you'll love it :DCons:-I haven't run into any so farOH BTW, My xbox says its only a 1080i TV, so I prefer to use the 720P setting.
