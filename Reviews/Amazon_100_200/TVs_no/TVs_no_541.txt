The title lets you know what I think.Did my homework. Did not want to step up to the plate and pay the price so, I settled for a "cheaper" TV. ...Hated it! Took it back and did what I should have done to begin with, dig deeper and buy one of the best. Sharp is offering us a superior product. ... Worth every cent. Oh, details: (1-10 1=bad / 10=Great): Picture quality-10, Ease of hookup-10 (unbelievable number of component options), Speaker/Sound quality-6 (Picture quality this good deserves an outside source. Ours is a Bose system. Combine the 2 and no need to go to the movies), Appearance quality-10, Warranty-10, Latest features-10 (Just came out), Remote control features-10, OVERALL: 10,10,10,10,10,10,10, and TEN! Thank you Sharp. Give those engineers a raise!
