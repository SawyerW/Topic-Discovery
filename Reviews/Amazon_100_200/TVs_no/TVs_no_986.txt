I bought one at Sears for $275.00.  This digital TV has superior picture quality and the sound is OK for its size.  It is "enhanced" definition rather than "high" definition, but I can't see a difference.  I feed it from my Comcast cable box via an x10 brand $49 wireless A/V system.  I have not used it with an antenna at all.  I wish I could buy three more, especially at that price!!!  Get one if you can...seems like it is no longer manufactured?  Not sure.  I personally like that its a 4:3 aspect.  Who needs 16:9 in a 15 inch TV?  However, it also displays 16:9 when the input format from cable TV is 16:9.  Just terrific!
