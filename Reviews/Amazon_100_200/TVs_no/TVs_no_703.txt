The Samsung TV looks absolutely great. I am using HDMI connections from my cable box. The first HD football game was a real treat (1080i). Too bad my team stinks this year! (Dolphins). The quality of the picture from an up-converted DVD player (LG) hooked up with HDMI was also great.The Delivery Company, Eagle Shipping, did a great job on the delivery. They beat the promised Amazon date by a few days and the delivery team couldn't have been any more professional and courteous.They called the night before to confirm and arrived in the time slot they promised. The TV came in pristine condition, they set it on my TV stand and I plugged in the HDMI cables and tested it out before they left, taking all packing material with them. First class Job all the way.Best of all possible worlds. Much better price than in the local stores, nearly the best price on line (a few were a couple bucks cheaper, but their ratings were not that hot), and no-hassle delivery.
