This was my first major buy on my own. I bought this TV Christmas 2007. I had it a total of 3 months and the humming began. The picture is good, but this humming drove me crazy. One day I finally called a repair company and had it fixed. I could have bought a new one at the price I paid for repairs. Also, the parts were back ordered and it took nearly 2 months to get in. The control panel often goes out on these...I would look into another TV if I had it to do all over again. It would save me a lot of annoyance and a lot of time.KEEP IN MIND:Since the repairs no problems... Buy with a warranty.
