This viewsonic T.V. is great as long as you know how to hook it up.  Unlike regular T.V.'s if you hook up to this T.V. using the Coax Cable the picture will be awful.  Now if you hook up using the S-Video, Componet, or Composite Video the picture will be perfect.  That's why Plasma's are considered monitors instead of T.V.'s  What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50% of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up, or what others call the RF adapter.  Regular T.V.'s can make up for this signal loss plasma's can't.  So for all you out there do some research before you buy a Plasma.
