After 2 years of ownership the picture / sound disappears after a few minutes of watching TV.  The only thing that works when this happens is the blue standby LED.  Searched on the internet and found that this is very common problem for Olevia LCD HDTVs as well as some other makes.  Before this occurred I was very pleased with the TV performance / operation.  However, 2 years of operation for an item that costs as much as this puts this manufacturer at the bottom of my list of preferred vendors.  I would definitely not purchase another TV or any other product from them.  They have serious quality control issues with their products.  You might be lucky and get a few good years of use out of one of their products, but given what I have seen I believe your product will ultimately fail prematurely.  By this I mean you will not get the expected life out of the product.  Save money, time, and aggravation by spending more money up front on a better quality product.  The odds are in your favor that you will ultimately save money over the long haul.
