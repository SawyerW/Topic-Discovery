The purchase of the Samsung LNS4051D is my first foray in the world of HDTV. I've sat on the sidelines for a few years watching HD technology mature. When I saw the Samsung 4051 at Circuit City I knew the time had come to purchase a television.This particular TV's reviews in the press has been lukewarm at best. I compared the specs. and the picture of the other competitors and found that the Samsung overall was the best for me. I won't go into the particulars, but this TV deserves a look-see.My experience with Eagle USA transport, the company Amazon uses, was great. The delivery was quick and uneventful.
