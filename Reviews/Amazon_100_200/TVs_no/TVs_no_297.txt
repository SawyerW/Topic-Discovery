Great product ,I am enjoying it very much...But Amazons shipping needs to change a few things, There shipping time is very miss leading .They said it was going to be shipped by "expedite shipping" then they send me an e mail saying  " Eagle does not offer expedited shipping" right after I ordered it. I ordered this  November 27, 2006 on the promise it would be here in 3 to 5 business days. The estimated time they send me after I ordered was December 20, 2006 that's like 17 business days...I had to fight with them on the phone to get it here when they promised ,so be prepared to either wait or give the run around on the phone.
