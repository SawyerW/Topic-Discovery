The z50px2d is made by LG, and the quality is absolute garbage.The details:Purchased a few years back.  Within 4 months, the TV popped and would not display an image (only audio) and red sparkles.  Searched the net for some help, and found a lot!  Went to avsforum.com, and found over 50 pages of complaints on this unit, as well as the workaround to get it replaced.  Turns out, there is a known design flaw on the system boards, and they routinely fail (causing the sparkles issue).  Attempted to get the unit fixed, and since it was under warranty and could not be fixed within 15 business days, I was issued a full refund.  I immediately replaced it with a different brand, and have been much happier with the image, quality, and reliability.If you happen to see one available, whether new or used, pass it by!
