I spent much time searching through televisions, looking for ones with Game Mode or ones known for no lag. I was a bit unsure how this television would perform, never mind that it had Game Mode. But I am pleased to say it functions well. Playing Final Fantasy on the PS2 or Zelda on a GameCube has been a breeze, just as every game on the Xbox 360. If you are looking for a television that will work well with games that need fast timing, this is an excellent choice.Picture is another place this television stands out. Even with just standard satellite the picture comes in extremely well. Then when you move on to DVD's, the picture is outstanding. The sound on the other hand, isn't the best but it could be worse. However if you have surround sound, you won't need to worry about this. Luckily for me, I do have surround sound, which eliminates this problem.Overall, I do highly recommend this HDTV for someone looking for a good brand, a great HDTV but at a decent price that doesn't break the bank.
