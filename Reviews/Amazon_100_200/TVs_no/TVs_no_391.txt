Before you buy this TV go google "Lns 4041dx takes forever to turn on".  I have had the tv for 2 years the quality of picture is good, sounds OK. The only complaint me and thousands of other people are having is that the conductors on the board go bad. Basically at some point can b a week after you buy it or 3 years the TV will stop turning on right away, it will take about 5 min, then a few weeks later 10 min then a week later 20min till it does not turn on its at all.. Now you can at this point pay Samsung 300+ dollars to fix it more then half the price of the tv, or you can fix it yourself if you do not mind pulling the board out of it and soldering a few new conductors on.. Any way its and epic fail on Samsung part, guess i should spend the extra money and get a Sony..
