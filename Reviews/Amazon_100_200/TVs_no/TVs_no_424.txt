I just got this TV and it is great... I didn't have HD for the first few days, so I didn't get the full effect but when I did get HD the picture quality was amazing, I'm only 16 so I don't really know that much about different TV's, but after some research and price comparisons I concluded this was the best choice.. And it really was because of the great sale Amazon is running now... hopefully I will get the playstation 3 so I have HD gaming too...If you want a great TV, for a cheap price this is the one to get, 26" for under $1,000 is a very good deal.
