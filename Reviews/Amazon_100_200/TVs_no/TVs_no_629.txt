did much research on three technologies before I settled on this set...two "best buy" reviews from consumer reports sealed the deal...got a great price from Amazon at less than $1,000.00 after seeing same set in Circuit City for 1400.00...set up was easy...only complaint, if you want to call it that is that I don't think consumers are aware that not every channel they watch is going to be terrific...how the signal is sent and whether it is accomodated by 720p or 1080p is the issue...also, my research was right, at app. 10 to 12 feet 720p is plenty and 1080p is a luxury and advertising hype... stand next to a 720p and 1080p in Circuit city and I defy you to see a difference, except in price!!!service from Amazon and Wholesale AV where the set came from was excellent...received set in 2 days!!! at a shipping cost of 42.00!! Tech Direct wanted $150.00 shipping for the same TV...
