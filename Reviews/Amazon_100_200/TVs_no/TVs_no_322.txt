Ordered the TV, was contacted by the shipping company, they were here when they said, unpacked and even set the TV on the cabinet (important for me as I'm in a wheelchair), even cleaned up the packaging materials when they left. The TV performance is great, with "regular" cable the picture is good but not great, I hooked up an external HD antenna to get our local HD broadcasts and WOW! What a difference!I do find the pictures settings (it has several modes) to be a little hot.... too much contrast and washes out the darks, but using some of the different settings, a broader tonal range is easy to accomplish. Viewing angle is fantastic, picture is clear and visible anywhere in the room. Sound is a little hard for me to hear the midranges, but I'm old and a little hard of hearing, so I don't know that this is due to the TV or me.All in all, an excellent TV, very nice styling, easy to use menus and controls... highly recommended!
