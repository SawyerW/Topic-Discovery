As mentioned by others, the HD picture quality is spectacular.One great feature this TV has, that most others don't, is two separate antenna inputs. This allows you to use both an antenna/rabbit ears for over-the-air HD and also regular cable TV. With most sets, you'd have to use an A-B splitter to switch between the two. So if you have such a setup in mind, or just want to see HD before you commit to expensive digital cable, this set is ideal.This TV has a very nice menu system, good sound, case looks great, lots of inputs.Only flaws, the remote is a bit busy with lots of buttons, and I've found the ON timer sometimes doesn't work on my set. Don't rely on it as an alarm clock.Overall, a terrific set.
