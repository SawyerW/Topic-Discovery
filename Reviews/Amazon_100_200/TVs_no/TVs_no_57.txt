I ordered and received the model off the Philips outlet store $999 - $200 discount which I consider a very good deal.  The set arrived quickly and in good condition.None of the accessories other than a stand were included (ac cord, remote control, cables and wall mount) with the original shipment. A call to Phillips customer support got a quick response that they will send the items as the become available. The ac cord arrived in two days with a packing slip stating stand and remote are back-ordered. The wall mount is not available, but I would want a tilting one if I were to wall mount.The stand they shipped originally was for a much bigger tv.If Philips comes thru with their promise I will remain happy.I will echo the statements by other customers. This is not the ideal hdtv (picture, connections, etc.) but an excellent set for $800.
