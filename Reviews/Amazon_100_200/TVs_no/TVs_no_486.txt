The TV is awesome in nearly every regard for the price.  However, Amazon is not equipped to handle high value orders when something goes wrong.  My order was stolen in transit with their freight carrier.  Not only did they not notify me - ever, even when I called on the due date and they had the information several days prior, they took a week to offer a replacement or refund.  I wanted the TV, but they offered to ship the replacement with a delivery estimate 2 months after they originally charged my credit card.  I cancelled and bought it elsewhere for the same price.  That said, Amazon seems fine for some items and has served me well.  I would just avoid them for anything over $200.
