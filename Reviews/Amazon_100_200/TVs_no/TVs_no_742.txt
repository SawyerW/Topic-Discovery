This TV is great. Blacks are black, colors are accurate, images are sharp. With the built-in digital receiver you can get over-the-air HDTV channels that are simply beautiful. One complaint is sometimes if the image is mostly low-contrast with subtle tones of greys and darker colors, there is motion blur. This effect isn't noticeable for high-contrast images like sports. Great for football, especially with the "Vivid" image setting and the HDTV over-the-air feeds from national channels.I'm also using this TV as a computer monitor, using DVI-HDMI converter. Games look great. Not so good for web browsing because the max 1360x768 make it hard to see much, have to scroll down a lot. Kinda wish I had gone with a 1080p just for the extra resolution with the PC.On the speakers: sufficient for television, but a receiver + nice speakers are good idea if you want a good setup for movies.
