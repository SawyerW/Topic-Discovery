I ordered this tv on 11/28 and it was delivered today.  I read the online reviews and was worried about the buzzing sound.  There is a slight buzz but I have to put the television on mute, stand behind the unit and nearly put my ear to the unit.  Fortunately, my unit is not as loud as some others have complained.  For the price, I think it is worth ordering from Amazon and checking the unit at delivery.  If the buzz is too loud, just have the delivery guys repack it and return it as others have done.  I'm off to watch the Lakers...!
