I bought this Tv for my college dorm and I couldn't be happier.  I got mine for around $450.  The picture on this tv is excellent.  The clear QAM tuner means you can get unencrypted HD channels which is important for me because I can't have a cable box at college and yet i still get all the big football games and network shows in HD. I often use this as a secondary monitor for my laptop when I am gaming.  Games look noticeably better on the 1365x768 res of the TV than they do on the higher 1680x1050 res of my tihnkpad t61.  The colors are much richer and pixels are more defined.  This tv also has plenty of inputs however in the future you may need a hdmi switcher because it only has 1 input.Some of my friends have the equivalent TV's from the budget companies like vizio and westinghouse and often paid more than I did and my picture is unanimously voted better.  Highly Recommended!! The best tv you can get for the money.
