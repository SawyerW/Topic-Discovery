I bought this TV from Amazon in July and the whole experience has exceeded my expectations. First, the shipping was quick and Eagle unpacked the TV in my apartment. The TV comes attached to the stand, so there's really no set-up required. At first, the color was off. I adjusted the color settings based on some of the reviews, but my girlfriend would still comment the color wasn't right. After several weeks though (and playing with the adjustments), the color is now great! The HD channels are remarkable (a big difference from my previous non-HD TV). Overall, I really love the TV and can't imagine anything better. The price is also right. 5 stars.Pros: Great delivery, customer service and overall pictureCons: Not a 1080p, but no one is broadcasting in that definition anyway
