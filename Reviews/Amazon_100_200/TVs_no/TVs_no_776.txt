I have had this TV for 1 month.  It is by far better than any other LCD TV I have seen.  I only have extended basic cable (no HDTV or digital cable) and the picture is amazing.  I also am able to get some HDTV pictures and those are unbelievable.  I was so impressed with it that I convinced my best friends to buy one as well.  They are also very happy with their purchase.  If there are any cons, they are very minor:  1)  When you press the power button, it takes a few seconds for the TV to power up and 2) The remote only has a few lighted keys.If you want a 32" LCD TV, please feel confident buying this one.BTW, I bought this from Amazon (not one of Amazon's partners).  Eagle was the delivery source.  They were amazing as well.  My TV was delivered 1 week ahead of schedule.  Everything was great!!!
