We absolutely love Samsung's picture quality.  We still research to other brands but always come back to Samsung.  I even have Samsung for my phone!  The TV came fully sealed and then the delivery company (they use a special co.) opened and let me check for problems before he left.  Nice.  There weren't any problems and still aren't after a month of use.  We connect to a satellite and boy is the quality great.  This TV would increase the video quality of any source of video that you have. Piece of cake to install.  Great size to see things clearly without straining.  The HD ready makes pictures even better.  I didn't think going to HD was that big of a deal, but I'm here to say that it is a big deal.  What a difference.  This TV is well worth the money and time to wait for it to deliver.
