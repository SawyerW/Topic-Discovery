I bought this tv after reading good reviews about it and I haven't been disappointed. HD content looks excellent and even SD isn't bad. However in my setup, all the content fed to the TV is already upconverted to HD, so can't comment on its "true" SD performance.Pros:* Excellent picture quality (colors, brightness, contrast).* Large number of inputs.* Price* Excellent speakers for a tv.* Looks good even when turned off :-).Cons:* Does not allow zooming of 4:3 content when using HDMI input.* Piano black finish may irritate some (not me).* Takes a little long (5-10 seconds) to get picture when turned on (may be this happens only with HDMI input).* The width of the case around the screen could have been smaller.
