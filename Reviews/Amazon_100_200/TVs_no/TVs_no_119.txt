Price was very good ($389), good features, but doesn't deliver on image.The screen has a film across it, causing unacceptable light reflections and a bit of wavy distortion.  It states HDTV ready, but when hooking up to my HDTV tuner using component cables, I could not get the TV to synchronize on the 480p signal (it displayed two images - side by side).  Forget about 720p or 1080i - no image at all.  Picture from satellite using S-video connector was not impressive.  This unit is going back (even my non-techno wife complained about it).  By comparision, I do like my Sony 50" HDTV LCD rear projection.
