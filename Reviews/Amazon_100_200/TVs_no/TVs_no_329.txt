I owned this TV for 2 weeks before I packed it back up and returned it. I did my shopping and Samsung is a respected brand. This TV has some nice features. However I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality on this TV. After the initial "ooh and ahh" of watching television in HD wore off, I was left feeling like I'd wasted an awful lot of money. The picture on HD stations is "pixally" especially when there is movement in the picture. Football games were the worst. The TV doesn't seem to read the signal fast enough to provide a crisp HD experience. The TV also distorts skin tones. I spent hours upon hours adjusting the color and settings but never found anything that made me feel I'd made a good investment. Pay the extra money and get the Pioneer. I found that the difference between the Samsung and the Pioneer was as big as the difference between non-HD and HD quality. I now use the same signal and same HD box but with the different TV and I get TERRIFIC picture and sound quality.
