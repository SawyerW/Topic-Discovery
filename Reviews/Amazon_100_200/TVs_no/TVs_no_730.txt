I have had a similar 50" Samsung DLP HDTV set for two years. It cost me $3,000 and was a good price at that time.  I bought an extended warrantee because I wanted to take no chances. I haven't needed the warrantee or any kind of service. It was a little challenging learning about the set's adjustments, but I expected, and got, the best picture I ever imagined! The only picture problems I have had were the fault of the cable company, e.g., low signal strength or poor connections within the cable box, and not the T.V.  I would get another one of these in a second, but I would put it through it's paces immediately, and if it weren't perfect, I would return it! And it's lightweight... I got a stand for it at Walmart for $69 that works fine.  I'd say buy one, but make sure your particular set is working right and make sure you can return it if it isn't!
