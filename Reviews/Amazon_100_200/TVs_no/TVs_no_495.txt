I've had this television for about a month now. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I received the tv about 4 or 5 days after I bought it....fast service! The best way to handle the shipping is to track your package and when it gets to its destination, call Eagle shipping and schedule an appointment for delivery. They will call you if you wait, but you will get faster service this way.No complaints! Great with Xbox 360, has a special game mode that makes the games rock! I suggest getting a DVD upconverter for movies.The sound is great for my bedroom and the size is perfect as well. This tv is 300 dollars more if you buy it at Best Buy or Circuit City. Buy it here at Amazon and save money, especially with the free shipping!Overall, great purchase and I would highly recommend it.
