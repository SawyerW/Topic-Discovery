I have had this TV for about 5 months (yes, I used my tax rebate).  I was lucky and found it on sale as an end of line since the new ones were coming out.  I had gone to the store planning to buy the newest Toshiba 37" (not Regza) but got this one instead as it was exactly the same for less money.  I love it!  I had upgraded from a 21" CRT so it was a huge improvement.  I find the picture quality, sound and menus to be very good.  My only complaint is when I watch DVDs I have to turn the sound way up, but this is probably not really an issue with the TV itself.  I researched the LCD market heavily before I bought and I believe I made the best choice for me.  I highly recommend this TV (and Toshiba in general) as a great choice for a great price.
