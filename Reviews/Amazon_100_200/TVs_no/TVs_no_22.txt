I bought my Hitachi 65SWX20B in the fall of 2002, and over 10 years later it works just like new.  It has never had a service problem.  It is my primary television and gets lots of use (5-8 hours daily).  It has 1080I capability so the HD picture is very clear.  I actually prefer the picture over some of the newer flat screens.  The one drawback is the size of the cabinet, but mine has been built into a wall since first installed, so all I see is the 65-inch screen.  Whatever Hatachi did in designing and manufacturing this television, they sure did it right !!
