I am 100% satifified with this purchase. I read all the major reviews on CNet and elsewhere for 32'' LCD tvs and this came out as the best. The price was great. The picture is gorgeous. 8000:1 contrat ratio, 720p, bright, sharp picture.  If you're gonna get something larger than a 32'', you might wanna make the jump to 1080p, but the 32'' size is perfect for that resolution. Xbox 360, HD DVD, HDtv, and (that which matters most: football) couldn't be prettier.  I feel like I could lick the perspiration off of Reggie Bush's forhead (not that I would want to, it just feels like I could.) The tv itself is beautiful piano black finish. If you're in the market for a 32'', look no further. Sony guts!
