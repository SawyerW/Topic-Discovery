Everything about the shipping process was great.  TV arrived, worked great.  And then, well, boom.  The first 24 hours it got very flaky - every 30 or 45 minutes, the communication between the remote & the TV dies, and the power button gets mapped to 'volume down'.  It's toned down in terms of frequency and I have a repair person coming, but still, bleh.However, when it *is* working, it is amazing for the price I paid (875ish)edit:  Turned out there was a loose connection.  Took the repair folks (Sascoa) just a few minutes to figure it out, and its been perfect ever since.
