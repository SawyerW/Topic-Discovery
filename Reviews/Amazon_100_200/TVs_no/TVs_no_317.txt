Both seller (Tiger Direct) and Amazon fail to disclose in the tech summary that these Plasma's have major issue's at altitudes above 5500 feet! Final tally after returning the item:Shipping to me, $171.50Shipping back to Tiger Direct, $251.94Plus I purchased a Samsung 1000watt home theater system that worked for twenty five minutes before it quit, so back in the box for another shipping charge of $21.86. LOL $400.00 and change for nothing! If you read this do yourself a favor and buy locally! It's nice to save a few bucks when it all goes good! But be prepared to loose big if the items are defective! At least locally you can return it with no out of pocket expence.Also Amazon has a sweet rep of being the hardest company to contact via voice, making things even more complicated.. I'll just chalk it up to lessons well learned, and hope I save a few of you the experiance..
