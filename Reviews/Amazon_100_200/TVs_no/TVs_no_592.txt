I upgraded to the flat screen, went full HD 1080p, sized up from 32" regular TV to this Toshiba 42" but have not really noticed a remarkable difference in actual picture quality even having had Time Warner switch the old boxes with HDTV boxes and entirely rewiring the house. Maybe the difference is too subtle for me to notice? That being said the TV itself would get 4 1/2 stars - it is beautiful, designed well, flat screen, even though the sound seems to fluctuate from channel to channel. I love it, but wish I would notice the remarkable difference I hear everyone talking about.
