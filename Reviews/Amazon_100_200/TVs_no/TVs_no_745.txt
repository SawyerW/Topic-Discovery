I ordered this TV and the first one they sent the picture looked terrible. They picked it up, sent another, and about 2 weeks later the audio stopped working. That was in January. After 6 phone calls and much time on the phone with Amazon the TV is still sitting in my apartment. FOUR MONTHS LATER. The customer service has been terrible and they can't seem to make the appropriate arrangements to come get this thing. If that hasn't been bad enough, their customer service rep gave me an attitude over the fact that I am annoyed about it. I will never order from Amazon again. I'd rather pay more and know that what I'm getting is going to work. This was a complete waste of time and effort.
