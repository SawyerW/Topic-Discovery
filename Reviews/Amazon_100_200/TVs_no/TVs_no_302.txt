This is the second Samsung TV I've purchased within the last year.  The other one is a 56" DLP which is beautiful to watch and simply to look at.  Having been spoiled by big screen, I got this for my dad who watches mostly analog satellite programming.  Which means no HD.  Which is why I didn't pick an 1080P enabled TV and got this one instead.The quick white-glove delivery is great.  Package came, carried, opened for me with courtesy and professionalism.the TV is plug and play and analog TV looks a lot better than I had expected on this TV.  So far he's been very satisfied with it and I have not noticed any loud humming noise aside from the very low decible fan noise.I plan to purchase more Samsung TVs in the future as their quality is simply awesome.  Not to mention the attractive design.  You can easily see a side by side comparison in stores.
