I bought this tv after seeing my father-in-law's Samsung HDTV (he has the LNS3251D).  I have seen a bunch of HDTV's but I really liked the crisp, clear, bright picture of the Samsung.  I also loved how light it was in comparison to my 80lb. tube TV.  This model was a little bit cheaper than my father-in-law's, but offers the same terrific picture (I believe the only difference is that his comes in "piano black").I ordered through Amazon (great price!  free shipping!) and picked up the TV from Eagle USA instead of taking a day off of work to wait for them to drop it off.  They were very helpful and friendly.When I first got the TV I thought something might've been wrong with it since my picture was worse than my previous TV using the same DirecTV box.  As much as I adjusted it the picture was blurry, moving objects left trails and the picture seemed to scroll.  However, ever since DirecTV came and gave me the HD box (optomized for widescreen picture) and installed the HD satellite I have been able to appreciate this TV.  A must-have for any sports fan with poor eyesight.
