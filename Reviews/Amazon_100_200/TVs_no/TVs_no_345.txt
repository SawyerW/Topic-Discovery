If you have any doubts, forget them....buy the TV.  It is fabulous.  We brought it home, mounted it on the wall, plugged it in and the television did the rest...it programmed itself.  The only thing I had to do was re-program my cable remote.  The absolutely best picture, clairty, sound I have ever experienced in a television.  Nothing against Amazon (I've purchased many items from Amazon) but I did get a much better price from Best Buy.  Apparently most people don't realize you can negotiate prices with them.  My original quoted (sticker) price was $2,499, by the time I finished haggling with them I purchased the set for $1,500 including tax.  I LOVE THIS TV!
