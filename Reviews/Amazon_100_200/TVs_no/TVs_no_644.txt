The Samsung LNT4061 LCD TV is first class.  High Definition pictures are sharp and clear, side viewing is excellent, action is not blurred and colors are excellent. Analog pictures are also very good. It also has a matte screen, which does not reflect room and outdoor light, so you don't need the dark room the latest TVs need. I didn't want the annoyance of screen reflections, so I picked the 4061 over the latest models which all seem to have the reflective screens. This TV is also picking up HD channels from cable without a HD cable box or a subscription to the HD channels, and HD over-the-air is also excellent.
