I purchased this LCD for primary use as a monitor for my home computer. Three problems make this less than satisfactory. One, unlike my Toshiba 32 inch, there is no setting to change the blue background to black. This is needed when your computer's power settings "shut off" the monitor. It cuts the signal but the screen stays on with a blue background. Secondly, the monitor stand is set at a slightly down angle and does not adjust. I've had to place something under the front of the stand to achieve a viewable angle. Lastly, you cannot change the Aspect in VGA mode.The color and clarity are fine, this monitor would work well as a HDTV if you have an input source as it does not have a tuner. The multiple inputs are a plus.
