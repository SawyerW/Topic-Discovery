We are pleased with the picture quality of this set, better than expected for the money but it does have a major problem. Pre recorded VHS tapes do not work with this TV, when played the screen goes blue. Yes I have tried three different players with the same result. Repeated calls to customer service and technical support Are fruitless, no one answers the phone. Emails are only answered by their computer telling you they recieved your email. I have been trying to contact them for at least a month. Bottom line...Stay away from this company. Read other current reviews from people who had problems with their TV's. If you are considering purchasing an olevio try calling customer service first and see if I'm exagerating.
