This is my first plasma tv, third HDTV.  I have a Phillips crt and a Sharp Aquos LCD as well.  I am not sure if my expectations were too high, but the picture quality, while good, is not what I expected.  There's also inconcsistency in picture quality, even between different HD channels.  Also, when the TV is turned on for the first time in a given day, the right half of the screen does not show any picture, initially.  After about five minutes it corrects itself but it's kind of annoying.  A call to Samsung said I should try reseting the TV, not sure how to do that and was then put on hold and got disconnected.  Have not had a chance to call back.  I am using HDMI, but didn't go monster based on the research I did that suggested cable quality is not as critical at lengths under 10" for HDMI.  I may try that.  I am using Belkin HDMI that I also purchased on Amazon.  Can't beat the price, but so far my experience has been lukewarm at best.
