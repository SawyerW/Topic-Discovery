I bought this version for the HDMI port because my previous 19 inch Samsung didn't. When I started setting it up, I noticed a white blurry light bleeding from the edges. I didn't know what it was but I thought as I continued the setup, I could make adjustments to get rid of it. But I didn't find anything. The picture quality for this wasn't what I expected either, my old Samsung had very crisp images, this had a very noticable graininess to it. It was like that with my Xbox360 for both games and DVD. The PC connection wasn't any better. No matter how I messed with the settings for both TV and computer, I couldn't get a fine, clear image. I think I'll look for a bigger version. Pity, I had such high hopes for this one.
