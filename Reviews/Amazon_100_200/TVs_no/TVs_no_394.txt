We are happy with this purchase.  The colour rendition is excellent via component cables.  I have not yet tried the HDMI connection but once my Oppo 981 arrives I will.  There are controls on the right edge allowing you to adjust volume and change channels if you don't have the remote in hand.  There is also a convenient set of standard RCA inputs (Yellow White Red) at the left edge which we use for the kids' V-Smile.The only complaint I have is the lack of an additional component input however, once we switch to HDMI, all should be well.Like any HDTV, the quality of the input is key which is why we've opted for an up-converting Oppo DVD player.  The V-Smile does not look that great in 16:9 mode but is fine in 4:3.
