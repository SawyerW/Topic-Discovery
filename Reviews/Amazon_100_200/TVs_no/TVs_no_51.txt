I have only had this TV for about 2 weeks. It produces an unbeliveable picture in HD almost photograpic. Like one of the other reviewers I am running Comcast HD so I came in on a DVI to HDMI converter cable. If you look on the net a little you can find the cable for about $25 (computercablestore) instead of the $120 for the Monster cable. The audio on this TV is also one of the best I have heard. Almost sounds as if they have put in a subwoofer, the bass is very deep for a TV. Standard TV also looks better than a regular set. If your looking for a great high-def set this is it.
