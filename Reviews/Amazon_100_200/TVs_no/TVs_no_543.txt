I've been using the same 27" CRT TV for years now and I finally decided it was time for an upgrade. I looked around for a long time and then I saw this awesome TV. I then went into Best Buy, where they don't have this exact TV, but a similar one, and it just looked beautiful. Not only is the picture awesome, the TV itself is as well!!! But I expected all of that, what took me by suprise was how good it actually sounds. You would expect with the speakers being as small as they are, that they would sound well...small. But they really don't, they have a very nice solid sound to them. So if you aren't willing to commit to buying or connecting a sound system, it's not a must.The ONE thing I don't like about this TV, and it's minor, is the remote. I just don't like the way it's laid out. Like I said, nothing big, but if I'm having to find something to complain about...
