Bought a Samsung 50 inch DLP about six months ago.  When we got it home we couldn't get it to stay on, so the store sent over someone to replace the bulb.  Unfortunately the store support ended after 90 days.  Then...Samsung was supposed to take over.  Fast forward five months "today."  The TV started shutting off after five mins of playing.  Called Samsung, unfortunately we moved and didn't have the receipt.  A call from the store didn't help Samsung understand that the TV is still covered.  Our six month old $1699 TV, is now going to cost us $717 to fix.  Thanks Samsung...from a guy who bought two laptops and two TVs and a microwave from you...never again.
