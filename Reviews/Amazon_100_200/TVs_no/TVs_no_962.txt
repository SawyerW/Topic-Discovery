The Westinghouse TX-42F430S is one of the best sets around for the price you pay. Last years models were very buggy and had a few major issues, but this years models are very good. Westinghouse has only been around for about three years, but in that time they have improved by a great deal. I bought mine from best buy and all I can say is WOW! 4 hdmi ports and 1080p, what else can you ask for? Not to mention this baby is 42" and costs $1,000 bucks, thats a sweet deal. Plays great and Blue ray looks superb on it, I assume HD DVD will look just as good. A great buy for the money.
