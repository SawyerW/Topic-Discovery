I spent a lot of time in the big box electronics stores checking out HDTVs before purchasing the Regza.  I couldn't afford a Sony Bravia but felt some of the no-name brands offered only fair quality.  The Regza is the perfect solution. Amazing picture quality right out of the box for a mid-level price.  Also, it has a generous count of 3 HDMI ports. I would have liked a USB port as well, but alas, this is the one tech feature it lacks. Will get a DVD player with a USB port instead. The remote is pretty easy to use and the instruction manual is pretty clear for the most part. The set itself is sleek and understated looking.  A great buy!
