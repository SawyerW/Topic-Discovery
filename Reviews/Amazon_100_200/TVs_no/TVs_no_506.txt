When I first received the TV I did not have the HD package from TW Cable.Even before that was turned on the picture was quite nice. I had been watching an older (much older) Samsung which was very tired.  Once the HDwas switched on....WOW....I couldn't believe the clarity and sharpness ofmovie quality TV.  I found myself watching shows that I never watched before.Battle Star Galactica was just stunning. Just as everyone says, DiscoveryChannel takes your breath away.As for the setup, I believe it would be 10 minutes tops if one is savvy with these types of things..very easy although the manual left something to be desired.Delivery came through EGL on the first scheduled day. I am in the greatstate of Maine so I expected it to take a little longer...not so. I waspleased that the delivery was made at an alternate address for me so I didn't have to take time off from work. Everything was fine. There was alittle damage on the outside of the box, but the packing insided was morethan adequate to take care of the contents.This is a great TV for the price and I would recommend it for purchase.
