Like you I'm sure you've shopped around for a large plasma - I don't think you can beat this one for the price.I waited to review this until I could give it a fair evaluation.  The colors and sharpness of the picture are incredible. When you watch the Discovery channel in HD you won't leave your TV for hours. It's magnificent.Set-up was a breeze.  Don't pay someone $100+ unless you can't connect color wires to each other (I have a cable box).  It literally took me 5 minutes.The one problem I did have was self-inflicted.  After going through set-up, I couldn't get the TV to find my cable channels.  What you have to do is select 'Source' on the remote if you are also hooking up a cable box.  Of course when I called the cable company and spoke w/their Tech Support they offered to send a specialist out for $80/hour.I read about the loud sounds some people were having w/their TV.  No problems here.Hope this helps and enjoy!
