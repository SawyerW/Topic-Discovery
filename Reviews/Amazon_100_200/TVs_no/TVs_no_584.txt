This is a fantastic TV.  After shopping around at our local Best Buy, Sears, Circuit City we knew that we wanted this TV.  However, all of the local retail prices where $1200 to $1400 and up.  We paid $1099 on Amazon and they shipped and delievered it, brought it in the house with their white gloves on, and took it out of the box for us to make sure everything worked properly--for FREE.  At any other local retailer you would pay upwards of $200 for this kind of service.  The picture quality is superb, it has quite a variety and plenty of inputs.  And it just plain looks great!  I would recommend this to anyone!
