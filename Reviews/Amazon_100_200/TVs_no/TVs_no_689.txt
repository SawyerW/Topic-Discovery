Divign deep into this will be a waste of time.  Every type of connection you could want. 3 HDMI, S-VIDEO, COMPOSITE, COMPONENT, PC..I watch and edit video using this tv and apple computer on Fianl Cut.Once you get the color right and calibrated then its amazing.Also worthy of note are the price changes between 37-42.  i got this 40 inch off amazon for 400 les sthan in stores.I tried a LG , SONY AND SAMSUNG.I am 100% ON THE SAMSUNG TV SIDE.No doubt...  If u can't spend a little more hi-end go with LG or Sharp but if its hi-end go Samsung over Sony
