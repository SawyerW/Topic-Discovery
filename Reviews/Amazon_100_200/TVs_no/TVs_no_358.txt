Bought TV from Amazon after visiting Circuit City, Sams, Sears and Best Buy. Amazon had lower price, plus no tax/shipping I couldn't go wrong. Received package 1 week after I placed order. Shipping company did nice job making contact and keeping time schedule (called 30 mins before delivery).Hooked TV up in less than 30 minutes. At first I wasn't satisfied, but after playing with remote got picture where I liked it. (Directv hasn't delivered HD yet :(), but I'm happy with picture without HD, can't wait to see it with HD!!! Remote and handbook are easy to use and setup was VERY EASY!!! I'd recommend this TV to a friend and feel like I got a good deal.
