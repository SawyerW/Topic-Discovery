I rolled a dice and ordered one few weeks ago.  I was hoping I won't get a defective unit reported here and at avsforum.  Well, I had no such luck.  I immediatelly noticed a buzzing sound coming from the back of the unit last week when it was delivered.  I called Samsung right away and was put on hold for second level support.  The second level tech (Chris) asked to put the phone over it so he could hear it himself.  Then he proceed to tell me he could not hear anything therefore there is nothing he could do about it.  Of course he also mentioned noise is common for plasma screen.  Today I found out that regular phone only carry frequency up to 4 Khz.  That buzzing sound is for sure way above that therefore he won't be able to hear anything.  I will call them again to see if they will stand behind their product.Other than buzzing sound, it's a great tv.  I agreed with another posting that you should wait until next batch arrived.  Mine is manufactured in September 06.UPDATE : They finally agreed to replace it.  What a different !!I am a happy camper now.
