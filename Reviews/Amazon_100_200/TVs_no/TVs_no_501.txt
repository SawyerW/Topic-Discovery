Amazing.I did a ton of research before deciding to buy. Mostly based on the fact that when viewing all the different ones that friends have purchased, they all seemed to vary quite a bit in terms of picture quality. Various reviews as well as the feedback here had almost nothing but praise about this model. Especially given the price and the whole 'bang for the buck' approach. I then decided to view it and compare it with some other highly rated ones at a local store. I was just blown away by the picture quality.That being said, I came back here and picked one. Hooked it up when I got home and I've been 100% satisfied for well over a month now. Oddly enough, when I head over to those friends' houses now and see their HD's, I find myself saying in my head, "wow, I'm glad I bought what I did".The only thing stopping it from becoming the 'perfect' TV in my opinoin, is that I'd have like to see it come with 1 extra component connection. All things considered, this TV is, far and away, the best 32" on the market.
