After my main CRT TV stopped working, I did extensive research, online and at retail stores. The screen couldn't be larger than 26" due to space constraints. After much analysis I picked the Samsung. Amazon offerred it for over $300 less than the retail stores. I was concerned about the time estimated for the free delivery option but it showed up in two days.It was easy to set up and start running. I wasn't sure how to set up my DVD recorder/player, but the tech support was fast and efficient.The picture, using cable, is sharp and clear.All in all, I recommend this unit highly, both for price and operation.
