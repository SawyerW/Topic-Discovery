Just got this from Amazon.  In spite of the fact that I used standard shipping, the TV was in my apartment less than 4 days after I purchased it.This TV replaces an older Pioneer 40" HDTV whose lamp fried and I didn't feel like spending $350 to replace the lamp, when I could just spend $1,100 to get an entire new TV.  The leap in picture quality is extremeThe Good:The picture is extremely crisp, the screen is very bright and clear.  The setup procedure is very intuitive and easy to use.  The stand that it comes with is very sturdy and easy to connect.  The sound quality is very strong if you happen to not have this connected to a stereo.The three HDMI connectors is a huge value for anyone that has a multiple HD inputs (PS3, Xbox, DVD player, cable, satellite).The bad:While the remote control isn't difficult to figure out or anything, it's ridiculous just how many extra buttons there are on the thing.  There have to be at least 100 buttons on the thing.  Maybe even close to 200.  I would imagine that I will never touch 90% of the buttons on the remote
