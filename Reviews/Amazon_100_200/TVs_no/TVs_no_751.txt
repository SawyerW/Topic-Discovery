I bought this tv April 2008 it came with a free dvd player.  I didnt start using it until Oct 2008.  The audio was poor and I had to do the firmware upgrade that seemed to fix the problem.  Recently I did a firmware upgrade on the free dvd player which then didnt work afterwards even though the player confirmed the upgrade was successful. Also the tv remote burned out after six months of use. Samsung graciously repaired the dvd player and replaced the remote. In 2007 I tried buying the Samsung slimfit crt tv. I had to return three tv's due to audio problems (I bought the Sony wega crt tv) . It appears Samsung consistently has audio problems with their tv's. I would be quite unhappy if I had paid more than I did for this Samsung tv. I'm sure I won't be purchasing a Samsung tv in the future.
