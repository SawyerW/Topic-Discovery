I researched LCD TVs for about a month, not only online but going to several stores to talk to the salesmen.  I was leaning toward a Sharp Aquos, by comparing the stats. But after talking and reading A LOT, I settled on a Samsung. Also, most TV salesmen said after looking at TV's all day long, they would buy a Samsung.I was very pleasantly surprised when I realized that Amazon was in line with the lowest prices available.  I have dealt with them many times and knew I could trust them.  I would have bought a Sony, if money were no object. But my husband and I are very pleased with this purchase.
