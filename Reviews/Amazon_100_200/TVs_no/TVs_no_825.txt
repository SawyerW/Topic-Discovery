I've had this set for about 2 months now and I've been very happy with it.  It gives a good, sharp picture from digital cable and off-air HDTV broadcasts.  I like the multiple screen formats available - standard 4:3, 16:9, and widescreen.  You can default non-HD channels to stretch to fill the screen, and in most cases it doesn't look at all distorted.However, I do have one gripe, and it could have affected my decision to buy this particular set had I known about it beforehand.  The picture-in-picture feature only works if one of the pictures comes from the PC input. And the other picture must be an analog signal.  This means if you don't use the set as an external monitor for your computer, then you have no PIP.  If you do use it as a monitor, your other picture must be analog cable or from an antenna - nothing digital.It's a shame that a set with so many input possibilities (cable, antenna, component, HDMI, PC, s-video) can't have a true PIP that can swap between any two of them.
