I watch more dvd's then tv.  I live in a condo so dish and direct are not allowed. I have a bad cable service and only get the basic package of 78 regular channels.  I just bought a Toshiba HD-A3 720p/1080i HD DVD Player that comes with 7 hd-dvd's.  I have a library of about 60 regular dvd's.Soon I do hope to upgrade my cable service as I hear that ATT will be providing a tv service soon....Anyway, after researching this tv came out the best price. I just wonder if based on my viewing patterns is it worth it...any help provided would be great thanks.  I am not sure if they allow email address to be listed here if you want to email me direct frontruner @ hot mail.Thanks in advance for any suggestions
