I just graduated college and needed a television that was nice to watch and also something that made my Playstation 3 shine and this is it. I had researched TV sets for months and I really like Samsung but I found the price of them to be a little...much. Sony is nice but the models that I could afford had poor grainy pictures and there just wasn't enough for me to justify the higher end/price tag models.I had come across the Toshiba 37HL67 by accident on Tiger Direct for $699 and jumped at the deal. The picture quality on this set is amazing, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare looks really nice and Blu-ray's version of Ratatouille looks even better in High Def. My favorite thing is that there is no blurring effect (you know the one where it can't process fast moving objects).I don't have much to say about the sound though, I have it hooked to a surround sound system.This is the best set that you can buy if you are under a budget.
