I have this set attached to a cable box so can't comment on the tuner but it has a great picture and good sound quality.  The cable company gave me an HDMI cable and it provides an excellent picture.  I don't think you need one of those expensive cables to get all the set has to deliver.  The set has three levels of brightness (the lowest setting is a power saving item) but looks best in high.  The 4 star rating is based on the pictue quality of a 1080i system. Overall a very nice TV and well worth what I paid for it.
