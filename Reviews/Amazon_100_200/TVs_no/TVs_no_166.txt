I am very impressed by this almost unknown LCD HDTV by Syntax.Picture quality is very good in HDTV,and pretty good in regular TV. I have it hooked up to DirecTV for High Definition and regular TV.Also receive off air High Definition from local stations and the picture is excelent.But what impressed me most is the ability to hook up your Computer, with very good computer graphics, and have a large screen for great gaming!You can also run a split screen and watch TV and work on the computer at the same time.Be sure to hook your computer to the "DVI" input to receive the best graphics.I have the DirecTV connected to the "ypbpr" inputs for HDTV.It is true about the remote control.Very confusing to use the remote control at first,but you get use to it.Overall this is a very good TV, and Computer monitor, and for the price it great!
