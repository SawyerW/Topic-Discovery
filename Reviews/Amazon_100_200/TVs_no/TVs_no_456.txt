You'll want to play your audio through a separate sound system. Even when the audio is at low levels certain frequencies will cause either the housing or the speakers to rattle a little. You'll especially notice it when watching the news.As far as the video, be prepared to be blown away when watching HD channels. If you're using a cable box to tune your channels, make sure it has an HDMI output. Without it the picture will not be as crisp and you'll have to manually change the picture ratio, which gets annoying.UPDATE: I finally called Samsung about the audio problem. They had a fix for it. The tech came to my home and removed the back cover (easy) and put electrical tape on the cardboard strip that covers the circuit board. It was rattling against the back cover!
