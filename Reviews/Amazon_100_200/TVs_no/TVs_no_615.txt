You can get it for less at a retail store. I paid $799 for this in Spring 2007 at my local Costco.. Circuit City and Best Buy wanted $1300!While researching the set, I compared it (at Circuit City) to a Sony Bravia sitting next to it. Picture settings were the same and they were running the same feed.. the 37HL67 blew the Bravia away. And the fact that I could get it for almost $600 less, coupled with 3 HDMI when most sets this size only had 2 made it an easy purchase.Standard def is as good as it can be. HD varies by channel and program, something you'll notice once you start watching programming.Hockey and Basketball look GREAT, football and baseball.. look better on a plasma. PS3/XBOX 360/Wii all look amazing, as do Blu-ray movies.Def. a worthwhile buy, but shop around and try to get a better price!
