I odered the TV on Tuesday evening, December 12 and got word a week later that it was ready for delivery.  I asked for an early delivery thinking it would be about 9 AM on Thursday the 21st but it was delivered at 7:15 am.  EGL checked it out.  It did not take long to get it set up.  It is a wonderful picture and I can't wait until my HD service is connected in a month.I paid $1089.99 and less than a week later it dropped to $1029.99.  I sent Amazon an e-mail and they refunded the $60.00 difference.  I see that today it has fallen to $939.99.  Am I entitled to this now lower price?
