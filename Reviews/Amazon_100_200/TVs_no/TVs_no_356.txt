Bought this in 2006 for $1,300.  Now it's floating around $1,000 on the internet.  After extensive web research, I have bought three HDTV's in the past year and am convinced that Samsung pretty much gives you the best bang for your buck when you buy on-line.Pros:Decent quality when using HD cable.Receives local HD channels with HD quality on its antenna.Lots of connections.Cons:No longer a good deal due to price drops of newer versions of this TV.Sound quality pales in comparison to LNT-4053H.Last week, I just bought the Samsung LNT-4053H for $1,100.  The picture quality is slightly better (contrast ratio of 8,000:1 vs. 4,000:1), but the sound quality is significantly better; particularly, it provides noticeably more bass. The speakers on the LNS-4041 pale very much in comparison to the LNT-4053H.If you don't mind spending just a little more, I recommend buying the LNT-4061F, as it provides much better quality (contrast ratio 10000:1 and 1080p).  Since the price of this model dropped after my purchase, I regret that I didn't wait.
