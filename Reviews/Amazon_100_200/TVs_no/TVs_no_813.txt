Samsung has designed a real nice TV here. It is beautifully put together and the picture is brilliant when viewing HD content. The set does an OK job with SD content but it doesn't look as good as a conventional CRT picture which is a common problem with digital sets. My only real complaint is that the built-in QAM tuner was unable to tune in all the available broadcast HD channels coming over my cable. In contrast, my little 20" Vizio HDTV finds all the available HD channels with its QAM tuner without any problem. I had to return the Samsung to Amazon because of the QAM tuner problem. I did call Samsung customer service but they were unable to provide any software patch to fix the problem.
