My wife and I are pleased with this LCD TV.  The picture is sharp (pun intended) and we can't wait to get a Hi-Def or Blu-ray DVD player.  There are plenty of inputs & instructions are clear.  The speakers in the TV are located at the bottom corners (you can see the chrome-colored grilles on the pic) and are very long and narrow making the reproducing of bass-tones noisy at higher volumes but most will be connecting it to a surround sound system, anyway.  Besides that, the only other thing that could make this TV perfect is if the speaker-outs were controlled thru the volume control or remote.  (edit - after using our DTV for a while, we figured out the setting in the options menu to use amplified external speakers and can control volumn thru remote) We don't have a surround system but we do have a three-piece PC speaker system that works wonders on the sound.  If you can't go with a surround-sound, just do like we did.  Use a PC speaker system with sub-woofer.  We had ours collecting dust but now they're back in service.
