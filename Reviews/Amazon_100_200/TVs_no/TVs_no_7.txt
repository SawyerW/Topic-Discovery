I just purchased my first Big screen TV. I would like to say I did a lot of investigative work before i settled on the Toshiba 50A61. For the price ,quality looks workmanship I'm very happy about my purchse. I looked at HDTV,Wide Screen and all brands checked Best Buy, Sears, Wal-mart you name it ..But the picture is so clear and the features are some of the best for this price range.. I would suggest this television to anyone not looking to spend on the high end and still have a tv set that is top notch..you can't go wrong ...
