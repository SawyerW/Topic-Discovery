We've had ours for about a month; a present for my partner.  Did much research on the different LCD's out there.  We've been very, very impressed with the picture quality on this one (it's our first LCD).  Shipping was quite easy; the delivery company called us the day before delivery and about an hour before showing up at our place.  No problems whatsoever.  Easy to set up; it was running in 10 minutes.We're using it simply for TV shows and to run our DVD player on it so I can't comment on things like games.To the person having difficulty with the connection and Comcast; call Comcast and explain the problem.  When we initially received their digital cable receiver the connection was terrible; so bad we disconnected it.  At that time I assumed it was our very old (1993!) TV we were using as a backup after a lightening strike and while we were checking out LCD TV's.  Same problem with the new TV.  Turns out it was the actual cable line which had been buried in the yard for the last 20+ years.  They replaced it (no charge) and things have worked great with this set since.
