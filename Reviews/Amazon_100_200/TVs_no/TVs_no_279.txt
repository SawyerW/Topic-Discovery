Excellent picture, easy setup.  Pretty good remote.  For the price 2019 + free shipping, I couldnt beat it.  I ordered it with the regular shipping and it arrived 5 days later.  I also bought the mustang mount which made putting it on the wall very easy.  There is no buzzing noise that I can notice unless i place my ear against the back of the unit, so they must have fixed that problem.  The only problem is now i don't want to watch anything but HD programming. Regular DVDs also look great on it,and the sound is pretty good for TV speakers. I would definitely recomend this TV to anyone on a budget in the market for a 50" flatscreen.
