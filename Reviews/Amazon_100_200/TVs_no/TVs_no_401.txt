While deployed, there would sometimes be six or seven of us huddled around an iPod trying to share a movie.  Perhaps two dozen or so could watch one play on a laptop.  You can only take so much of that!  I knew a large LCD would be my first post-deployment purchase and it was.Samsung makes great LCD's.  My Dell Inspiron 9300 has a Samsung beauty and I've another on my desktop as well.If this large LCD doesn't live up to its peers in my house it's on the darks.  Colors are rich and vibrant but if a scene is shot with low light or contains a lot of shadows, it's inky black on this screen.
