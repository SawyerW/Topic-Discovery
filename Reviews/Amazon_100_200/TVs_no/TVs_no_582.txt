It did take a while to recieve this TV and it was difficult to track, but it came as promised and not a minute sooner.The TV is great.  Beautiful picture, quick and easy to set up...and I'm a girl. I just needed help lifting it to the TV stand I am using for it.  I loved that I didn't have to haul it from the store.  It was delivered directly to the room where I set it up...and the shipping and tax were free.  Great deal...better than I could find anywhere locally.I've played video games with the video game setting and they are terrific on this set.  I haven't watched a DVD or hooked up my computer to it yet, but I will as this set is ready for it all.I live in the Dallas/Ft Worth area and just use cheap HD rabit ears to recieve HD programming over the air.  It is spectacular!  It even has an information button that gives a title and synopsis of the current program...over the air!  I can't stand to watch analog tv in my bedroom or at my parents any more.
