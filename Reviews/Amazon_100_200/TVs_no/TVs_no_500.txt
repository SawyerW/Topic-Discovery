I mainly wanted an HDTV to fulfill my gaming needs. I currently have an XBOX 360 and must say that the quality of my games have jumped a tall building in a single bound. I can actually read small words with concise clarity. Also, small icons on the HUD of any game are much easier to differentiate. This thing has built in surround sound and also a game mode which enhances video quality and sound. Be it an XBOX 360 or PS3, this gem is definitly an excellent choice for all those game heads out there!P.S.  Hit me up on XBOX Live!Gamer Tag: NETTO37
