I purchased this 50-inch Samsung from Amazon at around $1700 and am completely satisfied. Debated between this and the comparable Panasonic, and to be honest, I chose this black model over Panasonic's silver. Sharp, deep colors were very important to me along with wide viewing angles. This TV delivers! The lack of 1080p was a slight drawback, but I personally didn't see the value in having it. Probably only downside is that the sound put out by this unit's internal speakers is somewhat weak. But if you're buying an HD TV, you darn sure better be connecting to an audio receiver! The non-HD channels look better on this unit than other similar TVs I've seen and it naturally stretches those channels to fit the screen. The TV is one month old as of this writing, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Very good value for this TV.
