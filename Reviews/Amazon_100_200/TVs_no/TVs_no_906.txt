First things first, I ordered this TV on 8/17/07 and recieved it on 8/23/07. How can you beat that!! Second, the delivery guy's from eagle took it out of the box inspected the TV and then put it on my TV stand, again how can you beat that!! Last, What a great picture, not even close compared to the new 1080P DLP. I had trouble with my first purchase which was a 56" Samsung 1080P DLP. Something was wrong with the picture and Amazon picked up free of charge. I decided to go with a plasma after doing more research, and Im glad I did. Easy to use right out of the box, I fooled around with the picture settings and within minutes I had the desired picture I wanted. By the way I put it in movie mode with DNILE off and adjusted the contrast, brightness, etc. It looks great. Really last, amazon beat bestbuy & circuit city by hundreds of dollars. Hope this helps. I do have comcast with the High Def package, WOW!!!!
