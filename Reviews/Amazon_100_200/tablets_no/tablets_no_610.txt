True, my primary motivation was to leave the overly narrow ecosystem that Apple controls with an iron grip.  I have had my Xoom for about two weeks now and have used it far more than I ever did the iPad.  The iPad is a great game machine and it is still the best tablet for my kids, but Android is just more useful for my every day life.  Email, Calendar, Browser, weather.  Everything at a glance right when I turn it on.  No real problems so far, although it probably took me a full minute to finally find the power button, I can't figure out if the placement is idiotic or brilliant.  The app situation is much better for Xoom than it was for the first generation iPad.  Many stock android apps automatically handle the larger screen size, so you don't have to rely on a hacky "zoom" mode for apps.  My favorite feature is the "real" chrome browser.  It is a huge upgrade over the iPad browser.  Since that is my most used application, it's a big winner for me.
