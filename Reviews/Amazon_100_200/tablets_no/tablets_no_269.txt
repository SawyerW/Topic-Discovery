I've hesitated in buying an iPad for quite a while because I had another device, but when two of my associates purchased the iPad2 I started shopping around and found that amazon.com had the best price. I started using it as a "test" to see if it would meet my needs and soon found out I could do everything I needed right from my iPad, like I'm doing right now. For me, it's a mini- workstation, I can literally run my business from my iPad2 now, it's perfect for when I'm on the road, with the apps you can get for it there's nothing I can't do, it's great!
