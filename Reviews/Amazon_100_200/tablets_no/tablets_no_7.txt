It took me a long time to decide to purchase another tablet.  I have or have had an iPad, a HP Slate (work made me), and a Motorola Xoom, all of which worked fine for their intended purpose.  I wanted a new and smaller one for home, mostly for reading (books, web, and docs).  I took a long time deciding between the Kindle Fire and the Google Nexus 7 and ultimately decided on the Nexus because it was not as locked down as the Fire.I received the item today and it was a beauty right out of the box and the setup was simple.  I let it charge and went about my day.  Finally sat down to try it and within 5 minutes the touch sensor started going crazy.  Simply touching the side or even just tilting it would activate all areas at once, resulting in random selections being made.  I tried removing the case and it still malfunctioned.  I removed the screen protector and it still malfunctioned.  Gave up, filled out the RMA and sat down to write my first review on Amazon.
