My son is really going to love this iPad. I purchased it for him for Christmas. For anyone on the fence about purchasing a refurb, don't worry. I am very happy with this one, and I know my son and I will get lots of use out of this fantastic product!UPDATE: Just checking back in to report that we are still very happy with this seller and this iPad. It is incredible! Our son still loves it and has had no problems with it all. Would come back to this seller to purchase again if we need to get another one.
