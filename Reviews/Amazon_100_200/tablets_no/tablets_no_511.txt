This stand is great on a desk or table and really keeps the iPad in place.  I use the iPad for documentation and reference lookups when using my laptop or desktop and it used to keep falling over when I used the apple case with it.  Now I can touch it firmly without the fear of it falling over. The stand is heavy enough that most touches and gestures won't cause the iPad to shift.  My only complaint is the viewing angle is not adjustable.  It's not a big problem with my current working space, but I can see it possibly having some glare issues if there are a lot of overhead lights.  Aside from that little shortcoming I think it's worth the price and I'd recommend it.
