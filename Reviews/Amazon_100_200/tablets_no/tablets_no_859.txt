I can't say enough about this product.Its fast, intuitive and fun.Accessibility is built right into the product right out of the box for various types of disabilities.I am blind and use voice over.Its clean and intuitive and highly functional.The apps are great and I love sinking with ICloud and having my schedule, photos, contacts and data pushed to other devices.The screen reader has multiple voices and they are clear and understandable.Email, internet, calendar, clock, notifications, and much much more are highly accessible for the blind.There are many other apps that can be added to use for work or fun.Looktell Money reader identifies dollar bills, gps apps help with navigation and travel, IBooks is accessible and reads with the voice over voice.I bought a roocase in hot pink to protect my investment and absolutely love my IPad2.I highly recommend it.It can be paired with an apple or other bluetooth keyboard if desired or use the touch typing or other mode of typing to enter data.This is an excellent product.
