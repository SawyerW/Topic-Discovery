I have to question some of the negative reviews about this product.  I own an iPhone 4S, a MacBook & an iPad 2, but purchased the Nexus 7 because of good reviews online and from friends.  It's a great product that works without any hitches that I've found after nearly a month of serious use.  I now prefer it over my Apple products due to its convenience and size.  To me it's every bit as intuitive as an Apple product.  It also has the benefit of being almost $200 cheaper than a comparable iPad Mini and is more versatile than a Mini or a Kindle, as it has apps for reading books via Kindle, Nook, Play or Adobe.  The email and Chrome browser function well and I can smoothly watch Netflix in HD. I purchased mine from Walmart for $248 in early November.
