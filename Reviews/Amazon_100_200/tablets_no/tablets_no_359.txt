The 3G looks the same as the wifi except for a black, plastic bar visible on the top and in the back of the device. Before buying the 3G, visit the apple site for the additional monthly data plans that you need to purchase. There are performance issues (restrictions) when the units switches from wifi to 3G so you might want to consider other options ... like getting the wifi version with other options out there like MiFi, MiWi or tethering.If you like the tablet and don't have to have an Apple, then there are also competing products that are coming into the market soon -- like the wePad and products from HP, Toshiba and Google.
