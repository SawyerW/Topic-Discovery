First and foremost I wasn't a believer in the need for a tablet. I thought it was mere a hype. Obviously I was wrong. When it came down to me choosing a tablet I was looking to the use it would have for me. I quickly narrowed it down to a 7 inch tablet simply for the ease of use. I find myself "Googling" constantly on my phone while watching TV or a movie. Once my girlfriend got herself an Ipad I got a costumed to the ease of use compared with my phone. Only because of its size it was at times awkward holding the tablet. The nexus 7 resolved all this for me. It was easy to set up with my Google account. The screen is beautiful. I have been editing photos on it. It fits comfortably in my hand which makes it so easier using it while watching TV or being in bed. At this price its well worth the money. Its fast responsive. I use regularly to read pdf files. The price cant be beaten at this point.
