The iPad got 5 stars because I use it way more than I thought I would because it is so fun to use. I finally bought the iPad 2 because I'm pilot training and my flight school suggested that students buy one. I went with the older iPad 2 because I figured I would use it for school and not a whole lot more. I use it all the time (more play than school.) I would like to upgrade to a higher screen resolution retina display version soon. Fortunately, my girlfriend is pretty much also in love with this iPad so she's probably going to get an early Christmas present when I upgrade!
