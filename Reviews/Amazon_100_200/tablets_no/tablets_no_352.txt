How do I love my IPad, let me count the ways!  If you are a confirmed multiple-tasker like I am, you will find the IPad incredibly addictive.  The size and light weight of this tablet make it so easy to use for everything while watching tv.  I check my email, surf the Internet, play solitaire, read Facebook, listen to music... Get the picture?  Lying on the couch reading a book and you want to check a fact?  Your IPad is right next to you - fact check away.  The screen is fantastic - pictures look incredibly clear.  Everything is FAST.  Battery life is good.Anything negative?  You have to single finger the keyboard, but what's the alternative?  The screen gets very smudgey, but wipes clean easily.  When typing emails or reviews, it guesses words I don't want.  I don't really like reading books on the IPad.  I like the feel of a book in my hand.  That's just personal preference.  But how cool to download a book in seconds when you want it?Apple does it again.
