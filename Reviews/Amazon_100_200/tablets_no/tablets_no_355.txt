I'm glad that Apple has popularized the tablet PC portability concept.  Netbooks also helped bridge that gap, and I think the 7" tablet PC's are the next big thing.  But I digress...What I don't like about our iPAD (my wife's actually) is the following.  There is no flash support, which is a shame, given that so many websites use it.  There is no camera/built in mic- a glaring omission in this day and age of video chatting.  There are no USB ports.  It is hard to print your work or files.  There is no multicard reader built in.  The WiFi is weak, and I get dropped connections all the time.  Multitasking is not possible.  And the unit's storage capabilities is a joke.So many other manufacturer's are now offering, or will be shortly, tablet PC's with so much more functionality, features, and processing power, as compared to this overpriced and overrated iPAD.  That said, I am a huge fan of most other Apple products and computing platforms/machines.  Hopefully, the next generation iPAD will be cheaper, better, and be offered in a smaller size, maybe with a 7" screen like the Archos or other tablets.
