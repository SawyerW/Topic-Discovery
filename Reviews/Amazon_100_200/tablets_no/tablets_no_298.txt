Looks pretty.Works as it should. Priced well. Touch function works well.Somewhat slow(I guess OK for the price).Touchgate with the three floating desktop screens is a dumb distraction and does not add any functionality.WORST OF ALL,the pen writing in the tablet mode (which was the main reason I bought this tablet)DOES NOT WORK, as the palm touch input is not blocked.This NEEDS to be fixed, including updated software for those of us who bought it without knowing this serious deficiency.And the User Manual (paper as well as oline) is virtually useless. Does not give any info or suggestions on using the various functions unique to this tablet.CK
