I bought this for a Christmas present so I just sat down and tried it today...the 30th. I was not happy when I found out that the market app was missing and you are unable to download it. You need this in order to download alot of other apps. I did some research on the internet and I see alot of people have the same problem. Also you need the 2.0 or more operating system in order to download the kindle reader for android. Also the touch screen is all over the place when working on it.Needless to say after I read everything on different web sites I returned it and I am now searching for a new tablet.I would not recomend.
