I ordered the tablet with reservations not normally purchasing "like new" and not "brand new" but the difference of over 200 dollars and the fact that amazon warehouse 30 day quarantee I took the chance and glad I did.The tablet arrived less that 24 hours after I ordered with free shipping. It was in the original box , serial number on the box matched the tablet, shrinked wrapped with no outside damage.The tablet was "NEW" never used and had all the parts listed in the box.Have been using it for only 24 hours and it is great!!!!If you want the ipad 2 with 64 gig disk space at the 16 gig new price RUN don't walk and order you a tablet from amazon warehouse.
