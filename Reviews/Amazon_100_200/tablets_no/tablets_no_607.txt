Point one:  I love my XOOM.  The basic functionality of it are great.  My wife has an IPAD2 and other than the hardware/feel of the IPAD which is slightly nicer and much lighter, I prefer everything on my XOOM. No Itunes, No IOS, No Apple Experience.  Fine and preferred by me.  Yes Google Music, Yes everything Google.Point two:  my big complaint though is I got the Mexican version with a different build number.  That means much delayed updates or not at all.  Now honeycomb, etc is not bad at all--but I didn't know that when I purchased I was given a Mexican version and I read through the description on the advert page and no where did it say that.  I am not that much of a techie so it too me a while after ICS came out to figure out the why of no update for me.  So I am stuck with what I have till I replace it.  It works great, just disappointed in the "hidden" reality of the version you get.  This needs to be disclaimed Amazon and re-sellers!!!
