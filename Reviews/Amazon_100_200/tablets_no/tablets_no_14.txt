Everything was great for the first two months then it would not charge.  After a very long wait on their site to get a return number I got one along with  a long  list of  instructions and warnings to include the charger etc. They kept it for ten days and then sent it back to me with no charger.  Another long wait on the chat line and an even longer wait before they took responsibility for the missing charger.  They said they would send one right out, I'm into the second week and no charger. Their literature it's full of warnings not to use any other charger.AMAZON'S RESPONSE IS WE'LL GIVE YOU A TEN DOLLAR COUPON AS LONG AS YOU ACCEPT AN UNUSABLE TABLET!I would not buy from Asus again.While I chatted with Amazon tonight I tried the chat line at Asus again, no response..com
