I was going to have a cleaver play on words in the title between 'beast' and 'best'.  But rather than be lame, let me tell you about the stand.  It is a freakin beast.  It weights four pounds.  It is solid steal.  It does not slide around the desk when I use the ipad 2 on it.  It is way more solid than any other stand I have ever seen.  The rubber pads that cradle the ipad are perfectly placed and seem well attached.  I am very pleased with this monster.The only question for you is, 'will you use it enough to justify the cost?'Update:  Dec 2012 -my wife went back to college this last year.  Having this stand right next to her laptop has been a godsend.  All her textbooks are digital so having this nice solid stand has been great.  She can distractedly browse through her text without having to worry about the iPad slipping off the stand.  We are more happy than ever that we purchased.
