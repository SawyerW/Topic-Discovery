Apple iPad 2 MC775LL/A Tablet (64GB, Wifi + AT&T; 3G, Black) NEWEST MODELi Pad 2 is really a great device. I am a new man from the moment I bought it. A lot of functions in my hands. But I though I would be able to install on it my Rosetta Stone courses and the Babylon translator, one of the best tools I have found in my live. The Windows 9 version of Babylon is amazing.  But the Babylon version for iPad is absolutely basic and disappointing. It happens the same with my iMac and my MacBookAir. The Mac Babylon version is incomplete and very basic in comparison with the Windows versions.
