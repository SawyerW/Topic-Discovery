Technology-wise and bang for my buck for what I spent it is a decent deal.  Screen was fine, light scratches but the back and one side was showing signs of use, scratched, little dent on back.  Item was describes as like new....more like better than fair but not mint condition.  Runs slower than my Nexus 7...then again its First Gen...so not bad...got it for screen size/width to read sheet music pdf instead of lugging a huge book of charts.  Nice sturdy leather case it comes with too...great added value.  For the money it was a great deal and the seller was excellent.
