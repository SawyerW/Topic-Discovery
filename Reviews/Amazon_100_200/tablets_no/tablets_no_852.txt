Ordered ipad 2 for my wife's bday from BLINQ in September. She's never had an Apple product and was very excited. Wasn't until Xmas when I got an ipad 2 as a gift when I noticed a problem. What I ordered wasn't what I received! ! BLINQ sent me a 1st Gen Ipad. I couldn't believe it until I cross referenced the model number. Yup, paid for an ipad 2 and BLINQ sent me an ipad 1st Generation. Definitely not what I ordered nor what I paid for. Let's see how BLINQ and/or Amazon handles this and I will update but as of now, I will NEVER order from BLINQ again.
