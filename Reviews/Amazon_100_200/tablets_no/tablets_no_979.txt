I bought IPad 2 as a gift for my wife.  We have 1st gen IPad that we got when Ipad came out first time.  Still works good with some lagging now days but it works good.  IPad 2 works pretty good but I just think there are so many better one out there now days with a lot cheaper price.  I love apple products but tablets pricing has gone down so much that IPad is just getting too expensive.  There are 10 inch tablet from Google Nexus 10 with better spec than latest Ipad and it's cheaper than Ipad 2 that I bought.  I see so many other companies such as Idolian with their Studio 10 that works better than IPad 2 and cost only $250.  Ii think Apple is great product but I think they need to get in the game with more reasonable price.  BTW, I'm returning this iPad and getting Studio 10 or Nexus 10.
