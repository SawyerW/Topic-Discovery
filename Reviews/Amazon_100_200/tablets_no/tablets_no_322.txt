My daughter's 3rd generation Kindle went belly-up and I was going to get her a Kindle Fire.  One of my IT friends suggested a used iPad I instead.  I found one on Amazon's Warehouse Deals for about 30% more than the Kindle Fire, so I jumped on it.  I felt very comfortable buying used form Amazon vs some third party.  When the iPad arrived, it looked like a new one, right off the shelf.  The packaging was perfect and the unit showed no signs of use.  If you told me it was new, I would have believed you.There was one problem... there was a short in the power cord.  I notified Amazon and they made it right immediately.  In fact they made it more than right.  I was VERY happy with their solution.
