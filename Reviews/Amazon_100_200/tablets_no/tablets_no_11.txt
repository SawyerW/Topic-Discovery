I've owned a first gen Nexus 7 since November of 2012 and I love this tablet.  I also own a 10" TransformerPad TF300 and the Nexus 7 blows it out of the water in terms of stability and performance, despite the fact that they have essentially the same internals.Google updates this tablet immediately upon new Android versions becoming available and I will never again consider a third party Android device for that reason.The one issue I have had (and continue to have) with this tablet is that the auto screen brightness is a little flaky and the screen brightness will change sometimes for no apparent reason and the resulting flicker is annoying.  At one point I turned off the auto screen brightness which resolved the problem, but then you have to adjust the brightness manually for different lighting conditions.
