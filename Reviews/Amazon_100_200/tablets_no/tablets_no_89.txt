Price was right, ordering was easy and it arrived very quickly.  Is very cute, does what I was expecting it to do.  I'm giving 4 stars at the moment as I purchased 2 as Christmas gifts and I have opened and used and downloaded games for the 2 grandchildren I purchased it for but haven't had enough usage time to give an outright raving review.  I have had little issues so far with the charging, but charge has held since the last charging.  I did have an issue of getting 1 to shut down & then starting back up again, however, I unplugged charger and the little bug seemed to straighten out.  Hopefully once the children have received their gift & played with them awhile I can give a better review.  Seller is awesome so far!!  Haven't had to ask for technical support yet so can't answer to that.  Instruction booklets are TOO tiny to read, however Seller did enclose printout w/some directions & hints in package, didn't see until later though, so check your package for the instructions! Oh!! and they come with all kinds of cords & hookup options, earphones AND a stylus!!
