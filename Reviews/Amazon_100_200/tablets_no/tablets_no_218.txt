This iPad is working great.  Thought I was having trouble with it.  Turned out the problem was with my wireless router.  I upgraded my router and all worked well.  It takes more throughput to run the iPad than to run my laptop, so the it took me a while to troubleshoot since I was still using my laptop wirelessly every day.  I would reset the general settings on iPad, and it would be able to connect to the internet for a bit.  There was an update that I needed, but it crashed the whole thing every time I tried to download it.  Bought a new modem/wireless router at Officemax, hooked all up, and everything is working great!  (Obviously I don't have a contract with AT&T; yet)
