This tablet is great, But don't try to compare to iPad (apples & oranges) not the same.The Nexus7 loads fast, lot of free apps, love the google talk. There is no need for sd slot apps just don't up much space. Adobe Flash is discontinuing flash for android so complaining about it won't help. You can download Photon flash it takes a little getting use to but works. I have read a lot of what this tablet does not have, But I rate on what it dose have, speed,space, size, apps, great battery life. Bottom line for the $ great buy.
