I've found the Xoom to be a great balance between the super simplicity of an iPad and the powerful capabilities of a laptop.  Some of the phone android apps don't work on it yet, but these have been relatively few so far, and the apps that have been optimized for tablets have been absolutely fantastic.  I take this thing with me everywhere now and use it almost constantly.  This really represents the future of average consumer computing.  Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) has proven to be an excellent platform, the more I play with it the more features I find.  Truly one of the happiest consumer electronics purchases I've ever made.
