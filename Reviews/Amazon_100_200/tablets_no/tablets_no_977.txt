The iPad s the best thing ever invented and I love everything about it. I bought it used to save money but just wish I was told that it had been dropped and had a lot of scratches on it. I found the dint on the bottom side and just hope that does not affect the iPad, so far so good. I also wish that I was told about all the scratches on the back, this is ok because I bought a case to cover it but I think when you spend a lot of money on something even if its used that the buyer should be notified of all the flaws before hand. I thought I would be able to  download Microsoft Office and I can not so I had to download a app and pay $10 so I can do my school work on it which is the main purpose I bought it.
