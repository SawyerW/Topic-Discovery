I study the spec of iPad 1st & 2nd gen on the web datasheet and also actual products which my friends have.I need to think closely about how I will use my iPad.1. View my stock video files2. Read Nobels and Managa filesThese are the main purpose of my iPad useage.So, I do not care that much about the Processor Speed and 3G connection.I just need a little bit larger storage, more than 16GB (bigger than my iPhone).My friend has 64GB iPad. He told me that the synchro and back-up takes too long for his 64GB iPad.That's why I choose 32GB.I got a good deal from a supplier, $150.00 off from a list price.I do not carry around my iPad outside. Mainly carry abound Living Room => Bed => Restroom.I bought bluetooth Speakers, eXtremeMac Tango for Living Room & Monster iClarity HD for Trip. These bluetooth speakers are the best match products for my needs.I highly recommend buying a decent Bluetooth Speaker.I love my iPad 1st Gen.If you want to buy iPad, you should think about what you will really use, Gaming, Internet, E-mail, etc.So, you can select the best fit iPad model for your needs.
