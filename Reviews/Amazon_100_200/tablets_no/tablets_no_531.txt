I have read a lot of negative reviews of this device. However, as an ereader fan, I have a different perspective. This is an ereader, not a tablet. As an ereader device, what it is meant to do, it works very well. In addition, it is color and it is back lit. As a bonus, it has web browsing capacity. So, if you are looking for a good ereader that can do that, this is for you. On the other hand, too many individuals are in the market for a tablet device that also reads ebooks. You will want something else. In fact, to you I would say, "Buyer beware!". And, look elsewhere.
