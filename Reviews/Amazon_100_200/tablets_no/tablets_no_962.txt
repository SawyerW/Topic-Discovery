I bought this iPad as new, but learned when I received it that while it had a charger, it was not the one shipped from Apple, and there was only 40 days left of its 2 year warranty. It did not work, so we took it to the Apple store and they replaced it with a used iPad that at least had a 90 day warranty. The seller says he would have replaced it too, but does not think warranty is important to most folks. To his credit, he gave me the requested refund so I only paid for a used iPad.
