I recently made the decision to purchase an iPad. While deciding which to buy, I concluded that newer models (generations) are being made all the time and it is too hard to keep up. I ultimately chose the iPad 2 based on price.Pros:I was very impressed with how quickly my item arrived. I ordered it on a Thursday and was told I could expect it the following Wednesday-Friday. I received it the next Monday (4 days after ordering, including the weekend). In fact, i received the ipad prior to receiving the case. The packaging was great and there weren't any tears or major dents to the original box. The iPad was secure and protected.Cons: Some of the apps are not formatted for the larger screen of the iPad. For example, Instagram remains the size of a cell phone screen. There is an option to magnify the screen in the lower left hand corner, however the display becomes pixilated.Overall: I'm familiar with Apple products and am pleased with the product. It is easy to navigate and use. I am very pleased with my purchase.
