I wanted to love this thing. It was my first netbook. It was my first little touchscreen tablet. It just had so many issues! The touchpad was awful so you could barely mouse around the touchscreen wasn't responsive at all. It came with Windows 7 home edition so multitouch was disabled on it. Sure, it had multitouch support, but it didn't even come what you need to get multitouch from it.The computer became obsolete the moment it arrived at my door. I pretty much regretted my decision but stuck with it. I never use it now cause of all the problems. There is a website someone made for someone trying to hack it into being better than what it was but the owner eventually gave up that website because he knew the computer wasn't that great either. It is what it is and was really cool for the 3-6 months it was not obsolete for, then it just got way surpassed by all means. Too bad Lenovo didn't choose better parts for this thing.
