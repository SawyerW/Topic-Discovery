I purchased this item for my wife for our anniversary.  I had spend the last several months listening to her complain because her netbook kept locking up while she was using it.  So I gave this a try.  The price was good, the best that I could find on Amazon, but a little higher than what I found at the Apple Store.  But the item was more available than at the Apple Store.  I ordered on a Thursday, received two emails making sure that I understood the shipping process, and then it was shipped.  I had the Ipad 2 in four days from the date of the last email, which was seven days after the order.  Needless to say, it was a big surprise for my wife.  She loves it.  It is easy to use!  The apps load quickly, and are readily available.  Since receiving this gift my wife has started using her Ipad 2 everyday.  Unlike the netbook which was being used a couple of times per week. A great buy, the delivery was quick and the item works like a charm.  We are very pleased with this purchase, thank you Amazon!
