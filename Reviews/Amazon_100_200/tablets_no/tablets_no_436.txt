If you are considering buying an iPad you should have done enough research to realize that it is not a laptop replacement.It essentially boils down to a really Fancy iPod touch with a screen large enough to make the display of video, websites, etc. manageable.  That said it does everything it is designed to at the highest level. I am always in touch with social networking, email, entertainment in the quickest and most aesthetically pleasing way possible. This is a five star product, just make sure you know it's limitations (such as no flash player) and how it would affect your usage.
