Two years ago, my laptop became infected even though I had a current and up to date Kaspersky license.  I still remember the error message: "Viruses are coming.  We will disconnect you from the Internet.  Good Luck.  Good Bye."Over time, the viruses left but I kept searching for a permanent way to separate from Windows and for me the iPad2 is it.  Gets me on the Internet, and coupled with a Bluetooth enabled keyboard, lets me type out this review and upload it to Amazon.  Every day I try to learn a new feature.  Once in a while, I make the trek to an Apple store, break out my iPad2, and yammer with their geeks about whatever it is I don't understand.  Today, we covered the file synching. Across the aisle, a 5 year old reached up, hit the keyboard on one of the counters, and set off the security alarm.  Next week I'll start taking pictures with the camera.  Baby steps.  I'll get there.
