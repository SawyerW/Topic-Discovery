The iPad is one of the amazing devices I have ever purchased. The quality of the software and apps is excellent and using the iPad is a joy. The multitouch interface makes using the iPad so much fun and there are so many things you can do with it. Although the iPad is fun, there isn't much use for it if you have an iPhone or iPod touch. If you have both devices, you tend to play favors on one making the other device useless. The iPad is really more of an entertainment device then something that you would use for productivity. Reading books on the iPad is a fun experience, but the weight of the iPad can be quite annoying. Watching movies on the iPad is like having a movie theater in your hand due to the vibrant IPS display on the iPad. iPad games are super fun and I really enjoy playing games on the huge touch display.FINAL VERDICT:I recommend the iPad to anyone who wants a high quality tablet to use as an enertainment device.
