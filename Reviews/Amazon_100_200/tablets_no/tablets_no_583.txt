really love this product, great for anyone that wants an ipod touch competitor, but NOT an apple product. android platform is a major plus, with a small workaround, you can give this device access to the genuine android market, which is infinitely better than the pre-packaged app store, appslib. With access to the android market, you can get apps for almost anything, including games, netflix, and office applications. The ability to use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, as well as the ability to boot a full linux debian or angstrom distrobution make this device stand out for either a portable, versatile media player and social connector for the aspiring socialite, or a cheap development toy for the hardened computer veteran. A definite reccomend.
