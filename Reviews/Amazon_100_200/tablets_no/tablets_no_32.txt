I managed to hold off on getting an iPad for years-I played around with my friends and while I liked them I just felt they were a little too big for what you get. As smaller tablets came out I still held off because they just seemed a little under powered and over priced...not so with the Nexus 7. After I got my mom an iPad mini I started shopping for a tablet in the 7" range and wow what a killer device. I'm not a small guy but even with my large hands some tablets are oversized in this size range (iPad mini is actually 7.9") and the Nexus 7 fits perfectly. Very flexible device, excellent display, CAPACITIVE touch screen, and solid build quality. I bought this on Amazon and 32 gigs of storage for under $300 is an amazing deal (equivalent iPad mini is $429!). Tip: root or jailbreak your phone (android or iPhone, respectively, and is 100% legal) and this thing works on the go with free tethering, must have.
