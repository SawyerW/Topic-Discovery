This product is Amazing and I would recommend it to any level computer or tablet user. It runs fast and has basic functionality, and if you can't do what you want to do with it out of the box you can easily find software to add the feature.Pros:Camera on Both SidesSimple and effective User InterfaceBuilt in SpeakerRuns pretty fastOn Amazon you can find the 16,32, and 64 Gig editions of this second generation tabletCons:The Pricing on Amazon is not the cheapest you can find for the 16 Gig edition. You can go to an Apple store (base price $399 for the 16 Gig ) and get it cheaper than through Amazon's including Tax.
