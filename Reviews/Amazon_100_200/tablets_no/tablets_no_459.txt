This is a piece of junk from Archos, Came with much hype and completely a junk product.1. The touch screen never responds. Very hard to open an app.2. Old version of Android, noway you can upgrade software.3. Battery life is too low, effectively 30 minutes of video, after that battery dies(this is after 6 months of usage).4. Suddenly audio stops, need to restart the device.5. No way to play any of the videos from web.6. Very slow response.This came with a price tag of $199, which I paid, one can get this for $80 now a days. if you really wanted to waste your money one can buy this..
