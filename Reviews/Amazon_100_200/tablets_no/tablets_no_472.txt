This is a good device. It is worth the money. When i first got it i didnt like it. When i learned how to install skyfire everything became better. You can watch you favorite websites because it had a flash player. I was on [...] the regular version not mobile watching highlights perfectly. The videos were even loading faster than my computer. Installing videos and songs are extremely easy. Everything that has to do with it hooking up to the computer and adding stuff is extremely easy. It plays many formats so you just have to drag whatever to the right folder. Make sure you download the task killer app because apps stay in the backgroung after u use them and make the device slower. With task killer, what you dont need open can be closed. Only reason for four stars is in my house the wifi gets weak in my room. I gotta go to living room to pick up signal then go to my room. It works then but can be annoying.
