I bought a refurbished iPad First generation from this seller seeing the positive reviews about the seller. The product reached my hands days before the expected delivery date , and it exceeded all my expectations. I have nothing negative to comment about it. I was a little scared to go for a refurbished-first generation!, but once it's in my hand now, i don't feel any difference with the Galaxy note and Kindle HDs new ones comparing with this. The display is awesome! . I will surely go for a latest gen iPad after a few months. This is my first apple product and i like it. All credits go to the seller as it is a refurbished one. Thanks Hollywood Merchandise!Cons:I should not say this as a con, as it was already mentioned at time of purchase. The OS is iOS5.1, so many apps cannot be installed as it requires iOS6+.
