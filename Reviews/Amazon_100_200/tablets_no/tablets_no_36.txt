I have tried other tablets and read many, many reviews and this by far is the best for the money. It does everything that a tablet should do. From running the latest apps & games and does so much more. It's so easy to carry this with me wherever I go to help me stay informed and organized. It fits right in my pocket instead of hauling my laptop everywhere. The battery life on this is really good but playing an HD game on it does drain the battery a bit quicker but other than that this thing can go quite a while on a full charge. Great tablet, great price! 5 Stars! I would give it 6 stars but it's not possible! You will NOT be disappointed if you buy this tablet! Your wallet will thank you too.
