I had to buy an iPad because I teach a mobile devices class and so many people use iPads and iPhones. I am so used to better Android products that I find it really difficult to use the Apple iPad. Of course this is a first generation iPad but I find it the least intuitive machine I've ever used in my life.I'm going to rate it four stars because the seller deserves a good rating but honestly I hope it's the last Apple product I ever own. I was disgusted to learn I had to attach a credit card to my Apple account in order to download applications. It took a week just to get it going even though the tablet worked perfectly. It worked perfectly but what a ridiculously unintuitive piece of hardware it is. I'm always happy to get back onto my android devices after using one of these.
