Do your homework before making your purchase.  There are lots of tablets available, all with something just a little different to keep down costs and make them unique.  This tablet has most of you want - nice resolution graphics, most recent version of Andriod, not locked in to Amazon (like Kindle) or B&N; (like Nook), not even Google - but doesn't offer MHL to display the output on another device.  For me the 7" screen is fine for what I need.One other note:  be aware of potentially security exposures with Andriod OS.  Apps you download from Google Play or the Amazon App Store do not undergo the same rigor as apps available in iStore for Apple devices.  There are several Android apps that can access sensitive information on your Android device - things like on-line passwords, credit card numbers, etc.  I don't use my Nexus to do on-line shopping, on-line banking, etc.
