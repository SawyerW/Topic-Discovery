The used iPad2 that I ordered arrived within the timeframe promised and is in like-new condition. It was in the original packaging with all attachments included. The outer packaging was torn, leaving some of the inner package exposed; however, the product was not damaged.  As for the iPad2, it is indistinguishable from my 3rd generation iPad, except that it is noticeably lighter in weight, and is thus easier to hold. Having used the 3rd generation iPad for several months, I see no reason to pay the extra $$$ for it over the iPad 2. Unless one has ultra-superior eyesight, the display on the 2 is just as good as the 3.
