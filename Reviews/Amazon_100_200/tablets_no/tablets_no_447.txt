First of all you need to read the product features on Apple to have facts.* I Book totally new and not on I Touch.* 3G totally new* Price start at what I Touch started at with 8gig a few years ago* Support for playback of closed-captioned content* VoiceOver screen reader* Full-screen zoom magnification* White on black display* Mono audioMine is pre-ordered now and form other reviews on the web I am sure this is going to be a big success and step forward!To ALL the nay Sayers and Sauer grapes responders:  I NOW HAVE owned the I Pad for two weeks and stand by my positive pre-order post 100% and then some!!  The image sharpness is better then I imagined.  The speed of the new processor is a big improvement over the I Phone.  The sound of the on board speaker is a vas improvement over the I Touch.The only thing I would say is disappointing is how slow some of the previous app developers are making the change to the I Pad format i.e. Facebbok & EReader.
