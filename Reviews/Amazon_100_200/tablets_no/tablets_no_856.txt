This is still one of the best tablets out there, slimmer than the first model, great touch response and i love the smart cover; the way that aligns and folds for typing and watching.The picture and video quality of the cameras is not that good, nothing compared with the iPhone4 or even the iPodtouch4. i really recommend that you test the camera or look at shots done with this one before you buy.Battery life is pretty good so far is lasting almost all day long with moderate use.Web experience is limited since don't support flash. The maps app is very accurate.In my experience the best apps for this tablet are those of magazines, or newspapers, etc. News and books in general look really good.
