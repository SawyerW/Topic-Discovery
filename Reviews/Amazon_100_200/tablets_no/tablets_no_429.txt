If I could go less than 1 star I would, total disapointment, sent it back, absolutly useless, shouldnt b on the market, ios on it is only 5.1.0 wen any app u need takes at least a 6.0 ios and its impossible to upgrade and of course amazon doesn't tell the consumer what  its capabilities are, I sent back everything that came in the box and got screwd out of 20 bucks, witch they tried to make up for by giving me a 20$  promo that doesn't work for anything, any product has to b sold by amazon and shipped by amazon regardless if u buy from there site, total nightmare!!!!
