I have owned and loved my iPad 1 and waited for the iPad 3 to come out so I could afford to buy the 2. My grand kids and I are all delighted with the upgrade to the 2.I watch movies using the HDML adaptor 2 or 3 times a week and am pleased with the quality and lack of stutters.Both the 1 and the 2 have been used as my primary readers using the Kindle App. I usually read 2 to 4 books a week (I'm retired) and don't have a problem with screen glare. If I'm outside I find shade to read in.It's hard to find anything to complain about but I do find it gets a bit heavy when reading in Bed.A solid Five Star product purchased from AMAZON.COM.
