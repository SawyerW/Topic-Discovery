The nexus line is really the standard for Android.  Because it's from google, everything works as the designers intended it.  You're not trapped in iTunes, you're not trapped in amazon's store.  You can do what you want with it.  On top of that, the hardware is fast, the software is very good, and the 7" form factor is ideal.There's only two things about it I can complain about...  (1) The screen on the kindle fire HD is better, as the colors are more vibrant. (2) The sound through the internal speakers is pretty weak, so you're going to want to use your earbuds.
