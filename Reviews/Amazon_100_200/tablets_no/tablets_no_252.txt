Had this thing for a couple weeks now and it's essentially a glorified gameboy.The camera is total garbage- I mean my 1995 webcam was higher resolution. The speaker is on the rear of the ipad (why?!) making the poor audio quality and volume even worse. I have sensitive eyes and the brightness does not go nearly low enough to use comfortably in a dark room at night. The volume buttons don't adjust to when the ipad is rotated so I am constantly changing it in the wrong direction. The web access is dodgy even though my router is in my room and there's no signal issue. iOS is very lacking, notifications are tedious to turn off, ad block doesn't do bleep...Battery life is pretty much the only thing decent about this. Screen resolution is just OK. I honestly think this is worth about $50-100 at most. $400 can buy a much more versatile and powerful netbook.
