This iPad is fantastic! But the battery life is not as good as I expected. Just playing a game for ten minutes runs the battery life down 5%, but it does take less time to charge than the one with retina display.I know a person who has the ipad wth rd, and I don't see much diff. between the A-5 and the  A-6 chip. but the battery gets really hot on the one with rd. I would not spend 150 extra dollars for tretina disply, A-6 chip, and longer battery life, and siri, when this is really good. I love my ipad 2.
