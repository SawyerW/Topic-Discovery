I am beginning to lose all respect for Apple. The file transfer system on the iPad is a joke. They want to make it as inconvenient as possible to transfer files from a PC (or anything else) to it. Apple wants you to use iTunes, of all things, to transfer files. This from a company that invented Drag n Drop. They also don't want to support Adobe's flash player. So once again the customer suffers.By the way, Apple should treat it's workers with a lot more respect. When workers start jumping off tall buildings, maybe you could give them a short break.
