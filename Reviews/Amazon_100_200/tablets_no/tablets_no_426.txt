I have the 16 GB Wifi iPad, and I absolutely love it! It's amazing what you can do with it! I have photos, music, mucic videos, games, Pages, Keynote, iBooks and more on it, and I still have over 12.5 GB of free space left! It's awesome! A must buy! This is way better then any netbook, and I'm a HP fan! And the volume on here is really awesome too! The only thing that isn't so awesome about the iPad is the price. I think it should be $400.00. But still, don't let the price stop you from owning this amazing device!
