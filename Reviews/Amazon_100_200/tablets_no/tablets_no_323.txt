Well I've always wanted an iPad, or a tablet pc. I did my research on most tablets and found some pretty inexpensive compared to the iPad. After reading reviews of multiple tablets, I looked at the ARCHOS 101 and a SuperPad 10.2" Google Android tablet. I finally decided on an iPad because I had the money and saw it had the best potential for me. I'm gonna first gonna describe the pros:1. Very responsive2. A variety of apps that captures my interests3. Faster than I thought with WiFi4. For me just the right size5. I love the battery life6. Screen size is just right7. Very user friendly8. Good video quality9. Sound quality is not bad'Of course the iPad has it flaws.Cons:1. Being tied to AT&T;, 3G is not unlimited anymore! I should have done my research, but I didn't, I can tolerate 2GB for $25, bevsuse I'll only use 3G on vacations and wherever WiFi is not available. Plus, wifi is pretty fast for me.I recommend the iPad if you are looking for a good app store, responsive, and an user friendly interface! If you want something just wifi go for a cheaper tablet or the wifi only iPad!
