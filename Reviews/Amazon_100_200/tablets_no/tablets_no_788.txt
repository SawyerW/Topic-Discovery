I really like this iPad. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because the display looks alot less sharp than my iPhone 4S. I know this does not have the retina display, which is why, but it just still irritates me a bit when I use it. If I knew the new iPad would have been out soon, I would have held out on buying this until the new iPad with the retina display was out. Anyway, this iPad is still useful. I use it mostly for reading/writing emails and surfing the web while sitting on the couch. Sometimes I use Facetime which works well since my Wifi connection is fast. This thing runs smoothly and is pretty fast. The games for iPad are pretty fun to play on thing as well. Also, I find the camera is not all that great indoors and most of my indoor photos look grainy. Overall a good product but not the sharpest screen.
