The iPad is great for surfing the Internet on the couch or in bed.  It boots up quickly, and one can be surfing immediately.  The size of the iPad allows a good portion of the websites to be viewed easily; however, Java apps don't work.  The biggest downside to the iPad is that it does not support Java, which means you can't watch certain shows/videos online.  The other downside is that Apple controls the apps that get released to the iPad.  Some apps that would be beneficial and/or interesting are not allowed for the iPad.  However, the iPad does have some good apps that have been created by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.  It is much more fun to read the newspapers on the iPad.  Also, one can play crossword puzzles and other types of games.
