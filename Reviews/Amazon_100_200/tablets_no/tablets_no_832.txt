I got this in June and loved it...for a while. This is one of those things that is WAY overrated just because it has an apple on the back. It isn't all that great. You could get a good Android tablet for half the price of this. Even if you simply MUST have Apple products in your home, don't get this. iPod Touch is the same thing but smaller, and iPhone 4 is the same thing except for the ability to call, text, and having a smaller screen, which isn't that much of a disadvantage. If you're gullible enough to still want an iPad 2, at least get the 3G model...maybe that's where I went wrong. I only gave the thing three stars because others might have completely different opinions than I do.
