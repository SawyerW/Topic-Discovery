This is my first tablet and having used it for the last 9 months I can say that there is not a best choice for this price. It's a device designed for google so the integration with other google products is perfect and seamless. It has a 1280 x 800 high-definition display, ideal for gaming, reading and watching movies. Its quad-core processor makes apps run faster and browsing the internet is a delight. Games are very responsive too (I play baseball, soccer and basketball with it).Sound is not that good.Regrettably it has only a front-facing camera. When chatting with family and friends overseas the rear camera is a must!Overall this is a great product for heavy users.
