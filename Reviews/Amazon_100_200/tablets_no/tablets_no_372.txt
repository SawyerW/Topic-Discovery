Now I'll admit I dont own one, just played with it at a store. I own an Iphone so am familiar with general approach. The Ipad is a great device, and I applaud it, but here's why I hesitate to buy one, unless just for an ereader device (and these things were amazingly not mentioned in the leading negative review)-I cant back up my Iphone onto it. I can on a netbook. duh-I cant backup my camera chip on it. Can on netbook.-netbook runs photographic editing sware (picasa - free from Google)-netbook has usb ports-netbook baterry lasts 10 hours.-netbook costs $300 with 160-250 gb hd mem-netbook has keyboard and office swWith that kind of competition, I think Apple has to carefully position themselves as an ereader.Just my 2 cents.added 8/4i bought one, and above comments are true. it also doesnt print, you gotta email or sync the file to your Mac/Pc  and print from there.I like the gizmo, though. Its just that the reader should br aware this is a beta, rushed product whose main advantage is its a tablet with nice form factor. ,I reach for my ipad over my laptop every time.
