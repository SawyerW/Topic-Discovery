So I was in limbo about purchasing a ipad and I didnt know if I wanted the original ipad or 2nd gen, I pulled the plug on the ipad 1 32gb because I didnt need the camera. Man let me tell you, THIS THING IS AWESOME! It has ios 5.1.1 installed and it works flawlessly! The graphic are out of this world. If you are looking to save money and you arent a apple fanboy or girl and you want a ipad, This is the perfect solution!! This item was listed as Good under amazon and after receiving it and examining the exterior, this thing looks New besides a VERY small dent and a faint scratch..it didnt bother since the device was going to be in a ipad cover..
