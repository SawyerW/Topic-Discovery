I had this for over a year now and its OK. Its handy and useful and below are the pros and cons I have with this device.Pros:1. High responsive touch.2. Looks amazing.3. Can survive rough use.4. No lag.Cons:1.  Weak wifi antenna: On a same wifi network my Samsung note 2 shows full network whereas in nexus 7 it will show only 50%2.  Battery: Battery backup is fair 5-6 hours on moderate brightness and 2-3 hours while playing high end games.3. Speaker and camera: speaker is not up to the mark, and there should have been a rear camera to take pictures
