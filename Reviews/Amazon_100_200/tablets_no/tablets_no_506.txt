This is a great iPad stand that is stable and nice looking.  It matches the back of the iPad in terms of color (aluminum).  however this is definitely not lightweight like aluminum it is quite heavy.  So if you are using a fixed desk surface and not moving it often, then it should serve you quite well.  if you plan on moving it often then look elsewhere for something that is a more travel friendly and lighter.  Also, the angle that it provides is unmovable.  For simply looking at something quickly it is fine, but for reading or other things again you might want to look elsewhere as the angle isn't that great for these activities.
