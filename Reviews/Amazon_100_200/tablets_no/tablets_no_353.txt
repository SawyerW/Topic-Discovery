I know all the hype is for the ipad 2, but do not discount the 1st geneation ipad. It is one of the most incredible electronics you will ever own. I bought mine 2nd hand from an Amazon seller and the transaction and product were top knotch! I have not been able to avoid picking up the tablet every opportunity I have. In fact, it is so awesome that my family and I named it (SAM). Sam is never where he was left because someone is always working on him. The older version tablet is not that thick (yes, the new one is sleeker) and if you do not need the camera, you can save a bunch of dollars purchasing the older version, and you will be just as thrilled. Many Amazon sellers even still have warranty on their ipads. If you "think" you want an ipad and you keep talking yourself out of it, DON'T! It is worth every penny!
