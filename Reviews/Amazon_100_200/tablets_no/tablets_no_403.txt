Firstly, you have to be able to appreciate the device for what it does.  It isn't meant to play WOW or Diablo II.  There are thousands of games in the App store that are quite cheap and quite fun.  It isn't meant to try to work with clunky flash plugins that destroy a pleasant internet experience.  I don't miss flash at ALL.  On my MacBook I have an extension that blocks flash unless I want to see it, which usually is only done on YouTube.  Most of it is internet advertisement anyway.This thing is easier to carry around than a laptop, more intimate than a netbook, easier to manipulate than an iPod touch or iPhone, and just more FUN than all of those devices to use.  The battery life is great.  The body is just sexy.  Wi-fi never loses signal and the connection is never interrupted.  The only main reason I can see people not liking this device is adherence to old devices, or a bitterness towards Apple for its "walled garden".  If those things don't sit well with you, just move on to a clunky android device and be done with it.  Otherwise, you will LOVE the iPad.:)
