I got the Xoom from a local Target store last week.  I should have bought this one from Amazon as I have usually shopped for the last 12 years on Amazon.  Amazon is simply the best place for online purchases.  Since Target offered the 32GB Xoom for $399 with a free Motorola tablet case worth $40, the price was irresistible.  Therefore, I decided to get the Xoom from there.For the Xoom, I don't want to talk all the good things about it.  There are so many good reviews being posted in this forum.  All I can say is that this Xoom is the best.  Now, with the most recent software update for Xoom, I can read files stored in a micro SD card that can be inserted into a dedicated slot in Xoom.  The brightness of the screen is one of the main factors convincing me to get it after looking into other tablets. I really enjoy it!  I just have so much fun with it.Overall,  flash player is something this tablet as well as other Android ones can support while it is solely restricted in Ipads.  I would really recommend this tablet to anyone interested in it.
