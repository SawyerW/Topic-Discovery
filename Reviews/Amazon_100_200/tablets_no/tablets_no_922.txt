I had been thinking for months on which type of "Tablet" I should buy. Hitting up every link I could to review tablets. As a windows system administrator, I needed something to carry with me so that I could have my technical books handy. The nook,kindle were just not right for me, The Kindle reader, is good as a reader goes, but there is not internet access on the kindle reader I have. Sure it has whisper net, but no "Surfing capabilities that I am aware of. The IPad 2 solved all that. Just a small learning curve,(a couple of hours)and I was  off and running. Have it now for about 4 days, I am not sorry I chose this version of tablet. Also what was a little icing on the cake, I had ordered it normal shipping, I think 3-5 days, I got email form the merchant, (Penguin2012) saying Hey we are really happy that you chose us as the merchant. to show our appreciation, they shipped it next day shipping. I thought that was really kool.Anyway, happy with the complete purchase. Thanks all involved.
