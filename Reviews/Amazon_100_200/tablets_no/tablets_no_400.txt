The ipad 1 has been really good. It is basically the ipod touch but bigger and more fun to play temple run on!!!(: It gets online, downloads apps, sends emails, takes pics, and more! It's never been a problem. I've had it since Christmas (12/25/11) and it's worked great. It's amazing I think. One thing is though I don't really think it's worth the money. It might be worth about $300 but I don't really think $500. Another thing is if your not really in to or ok with technology than this might be a little hard to operate. Other than that I think it's been great. I would rate it 4.5 out of 5!!!(:
