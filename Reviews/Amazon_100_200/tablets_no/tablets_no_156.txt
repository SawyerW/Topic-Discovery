I absolutly LOVE my IPad 2 I can't really think of anything that's wrong with it, besides not being able to have Flash- but you can pretty much get an app for anything like that! I also bought the Smart Cover, very useful-I always have it on! However it doens't cover the back-I just ordered a few days ago the SmartSleeve from BoxWave, I have heard that it is a good buy, I would suggest something like that! The camera works very well, I am helping my sister plan her whole wedding through our IPads. I bought mine thorugh WalMart, but you never-the-less Apple products are very trustworthy~I didn't even get coverage. Very good product, and would strongly suggest it for anybody that is on-the-go, has kids, my grandparents use it sometimes also! It's great for work too!
