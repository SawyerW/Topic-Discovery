I rarely purchase used electronics especially computer type electronics. In this case I took a chance, even though I am not too savvy when it comes to an iPad or smart phones... To not have the knowledge on how the iPad functions has been a nightmare for me, and to date I haven't been able to sign in with Apple, WiFi, iTune or any of the major connections without Apple operating instructions... I will have to take it to an Apple Store to get it to set up.... My big complaint is that Operating Instructions are not included with the package. The people where I purchased the iPad are top notch, and I would recommend this seller to everyone, they really work with you as a consumer, and attempt to solve most challenges. Apple has the operating instructions on the Apple.com site, but they should include the instructions in writing for quick reference. That is not the fault of the seller I might add.
