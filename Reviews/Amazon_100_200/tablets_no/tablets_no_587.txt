I bought a Archos 43 4.3-Inch 16 GB Internet Tablet in March this year.There are defects on the screen of my device. There are 2 red lines appear on the screen, acrossing from the top to the bottom of the screem. They locate in the centre of the screen. Other functions work well so far.I use the device normally and with cares. The defects were not the results of any careless operation. They happened one day as I turned the device on normally.I bought the device in March this year, it is in the guarantee period. I would like to send the device back and get the defects fixed. I wrote to Archos about this issue, but they had not replied me. Now I have not idea where and who will be able to fix the defects.This is a decent PMP, but it is just too frangible.Allen
