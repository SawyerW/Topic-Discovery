This it a big disappointment.  After you spend $700 you then have to go out and buy third party books to figure out how to begin to use the thing.  Or spend boucoup bucks on Apple care so you can use the thing.'ll stick to Asus from here on out.  If you purchase their product from stores other than Best Buy, you can get two years free 24/7 tech support AND accidental damage protection included in the price of the product.  They don't advertise the second year except in their warranty registration paperwork, but those of us who've bought ASUS before know about it.iPad is cute, but not worth the money.  Even with the maximum memory, I don't find it powerful enough to work on ancestry.com with it, and that's the primary reason we got it.I'm not impressed with Apple products in general.  Their itunes is garbage.  My son has the top of the line imac (i7 version) and it's a pretty piece of useless sculpture.  Should have known better than to waste money on an ipad.
