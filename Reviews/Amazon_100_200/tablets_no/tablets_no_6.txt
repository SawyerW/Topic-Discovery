I have owned a kindle fire and nook and I must say that this is the best out of the tablets that I have had experience with. #1 its very fast! The quad processor really loads fast. #2 the play store is still the best store with better apps and a lot of vs the other tablets. #3 the price was $200 for the 16 GB which was pretty good as well. I'm also impressed with the screen quality and the SOUND. I use the Dr. Dre headphones and it sounds as if it has the "beats" technology built in. Overall I'm very happy with my tablet. I would have given it 5 stars but there is no option to have memory expansion(USB, sd cards etc.) Other than that I love the nexus 7!
