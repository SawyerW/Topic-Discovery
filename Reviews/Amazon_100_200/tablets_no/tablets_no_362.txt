I have had my iPad for almost a week now and I just can't put it down. I take it everywhere I go. I have an iPod Touch and this is everything that the Touch is and more. Beautiful display of my photographs and all the neat things you can do with them. I love the ease of each task performed. It is so much faster than a PC or laptop. Too bad they can't make a PC that responds like the iPad does. I like the fact that I can use it as a book reader too. You can take your whole library with you and read any time you wish. I was contemplating a netbook and I am so glad that I went with the iPad instead. I can't wait to get tons of neat aps installed. Too many aps to go thru and pick from.
