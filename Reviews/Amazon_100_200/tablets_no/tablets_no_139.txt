I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.  Found 8 on Amazon that I took to be new in the box (unfortunately no screen shot saved).  I purchased and printed a receipt that also stated that the units were "New."  When received I was disappointed to find that they were Certified Refurbished.  When I tried to return, the seller started an email argument over whether I should have realized the units were not factory new, then said I should try them out before returning, finally said that if I would return them, he would refund upon receipt.  No offer of a label, etc. Afraid if I sent them back I would never see my money. Felt like a bad ebay transaction, not the guaranteed, no-hassle returns that Amazon advertises.  I ended up keeping the units.  Hoping I don't get fired when they fail to perform.  They're ok so far.
