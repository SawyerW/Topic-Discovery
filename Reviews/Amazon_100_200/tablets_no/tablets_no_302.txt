I read about this net book long before it was released and really looked forward to it. Having bought it im a little disappointed. First off its just too slow for the touch interface to function properly. The shift and enter keys are very poorly placed. The touch pad doesn't work very well, it occasionally thinks you are trying to do something else than move the cursor. If you use the touch pad to write there is no "interpolations" i.e. your writing looks like you wrote it in paint. All in all they should have held off on this till they had improved it a little but on the upside you do get a lot of features for a low price. I especially appreciate the ss-hdd and Bluetooth. I almost rate it 3 out of 5 but everything considered I would not recommend it.
