I JUST BOUGHT THIS NOOK AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THE SCREEN. BEING A PREVIOUS NOOK OWNER I CAN TELL THE NEW NOOK HD IS BUILT MUCH BETTER. THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE WAS A WONDERFUL EDITION BECAUSE IT GIVES THE NEWER NOOK HD AND HD PLUS 700,000 MORE ANDROID APPS! THE NEW CHARGER IS WONDERFUL AND THE OVERALL EXPIERENCE IS AMAZING. I WILL SAY A NOOK CASE IS ESSIENTAL. IVE SEEN, HOW IF YOUR NOT CAREFUL, THE PAINT WILL RUB OFF. OVERALL, I LOVE THE NOOK AND THe B&N; COUSTMER SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND CLASSES. I GOT MY NOOK FROM THE STORE AND IT IS THE SIXTEEN GIG NOOK HD AND I GOT IT ONE FATHERS DAY FOR $150! I WOULD HAVE PAID FULL PRICE FOR THIS AMAZING B&N; / ANDROID TABLET!
