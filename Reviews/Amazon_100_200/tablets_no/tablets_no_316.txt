after looking at the previous reviews, I bought 2GB RAM along with s10-3t. After upgrading the memory and OS it is a complete tablet with multitouch.But the processor became very slow after installing all the drivers of windows7, microsoft office-10(word, excel and power point), Firefox, VLC player and adobe reader,flash...it is not even playing the youtube video. while playing the youtube video the CPU performance was reaching upto 99-100% and the video got struck.Except streaming videos, it can play everything very well.note: Do not expect to play games in this netbook and also the size is more than 10.2' with battery. So do not buy a 10.2' laptop sleeve. Better to prefer 11.6' or 12.1'.Overall, I like it for webbrowsing, basic purposes and to watch downloaded movies.
