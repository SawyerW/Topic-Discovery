I got this for my sister after promising a "pocket facebook/youtube machine", installed google play through arctools, and it works perfectly so far. delivery time from GoHastings was ~4 days, which was pretty good, and it has worked great so far. Screen is responsive, speakers are good, and it doesn't seem flimsy. At first, I was concerned because of the charging light not coming on, but about fifteen minutes in a wall charger fixed that. Wifi is much better than my 2nd gen ipod touch (really need to replace that), and my only concern is the very fingerprint sensitive back case made of extra-shiny oil presentation material. I'll update if anything goes wrong, but so far so good.
