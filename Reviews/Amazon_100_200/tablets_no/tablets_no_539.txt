This product is terrible. I don't know why anyone would want to buy this product. It has terrible callebration, you never really know when it is on or not. the battery life sucks, it crashes all the time. I bought this for christmas and I wish i would have just put $90 in the trash because at least I wouldn't have to deal with a way to get rid of this tablet.While looking for a way to get rid of it, i have found that it is nearly impossible to reset to factory settings. I have googled, binged, yahooed and whatever else I could do and nothing has helped me. Oh, and there is no help line to call when you are needing help. This tablet should just never be bought again and I hop no one else wastes their money like I did.But if you want to get it, good for you.On a positive note, I haven't thrown it through a window yet :)
