Dont trust this seller! This laptop came totally ruined and it didnt even turn on. i wasted money trusting this lier. he promised alot of bull shit and this laptop wouldnt even turn on. when i contacted him all he said is that i could return it and i was not willing to pay to return it again because it was his damn fault. i am usually a happy customer but his service is beyond and worse then crap. i wasted two days straight to fix it and above all i got shocked in the process and had to waste another $85 of equip that i already had from my past work and laptops i saved. and turns out even had to replace that hard drive and ram. you suck dont sell if you cant keep your word to it
