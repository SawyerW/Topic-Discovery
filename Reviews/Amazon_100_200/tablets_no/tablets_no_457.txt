I like the Archos 7 8gb allot! Its fast and the movies play better then my netbook. The only drawback is you cant lock it incase its stolen or lost but other then that its great. The touch screan works great with out any problems. I havent found out how or if I can hook it up to my broad band modem from cricket yet but if not there is the wifi. Also no one seems to have the adapter to hook up regular usb male plugs to it. I did find out that you can hook it up to your HD flat panel to play movies etc which is great! All in all a great buy for the price! Its not a IPAD but I dont want an IPAD!
