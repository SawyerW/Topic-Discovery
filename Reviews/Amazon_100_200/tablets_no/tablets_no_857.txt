I love Apple devices! I already have an iPad 2 and bought this one for my daughter for Valentine's Day.When it would not connect to any wifi network, it was tested by a technical expert who determined that this iPad is damaged, probably by water exposure.I hope to get my $475.75 back...so much for purchasing refurbished Apple devices through Amazon!My next refurbished Apple device will be through Apple.com, where it will have a decent warranty, etc.It may be more expensive...but well worth the cost, when considering not only the money, but the risk.There was a considerable expenditure of time and effort to try to set this piece of junk up, and then to take it in for testing.There was also the extra money spent to have it examined and tested.Not to mention the disappointment of not having this gift for my daughter on Valentine's day.
