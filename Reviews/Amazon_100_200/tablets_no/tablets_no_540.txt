I got a Cruz T301 tablet as a graduation present for my son.  It has given us a lot of trouble right out of the box.  First, the browser kept on crashing.  It took three calls to tech support to find someone who had a clue as to how to fix it.  Once we got that problem licked, it would not install the Amazon Android Appstore app downloaded from CruzMarket.  No one at tech support could help with that one.  I finally got it running on my own.  Then it would not run any games.  Turns out there is no support for Flash, which eliminates almost all of the games out there.  Then there were the repeated freeze ups and resets which wiped out all installed programs.  I finally got fed up and got tech support to route me to a manager to come up with a reasonable solution that would work for both of us.  That manager never bothered to return my call.  Another e-mail to management was ignored.So, if you want a crappy buggy tablet with dodgy tech support and non-responsive managers, this is the tablet for you!  If not, move on, nothing to see here.
