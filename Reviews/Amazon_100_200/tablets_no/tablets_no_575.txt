This is a nice little unit, and pretty powerful.  There is a learning curve with the touch screen.  At first I was always opening something up I hadn't intended while scrolling.  But, I rarely have that problem anymore.  I find the stylus off my old Palm PDA works excellent with it.  It took me a while to figure out the calander, but apparently it sinks with google calender, so I had to sign up for that.  The apps lib has plenty of free apps and the rest are reasonably priced.  And, the one utility app gives you access to the android marketplace.  My senior eyes could probably use a bigger screen, but it was a compromise, as I wanted to be able to carry it in my european carryall.
