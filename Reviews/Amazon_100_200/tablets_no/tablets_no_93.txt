Haven't purchased yet, but want to buy for my mom and the reviews tell me it should work out for her. She's not tech savvy, but would like the basics of a tablet - email, skype, Facebook, reading, and games. She's not all about the best or newest gadget, and I think this is what she would get for herself.I'm.hoping this will also be good for my 3 year old who spends a lot of time with her. When I get it, I'll try it out and make it simpler for her and possibly will buy one for myself if its as good as it seems.I'd also want to get her a keyboard/case and was wondering which would be a good fit for this particular tablet?
