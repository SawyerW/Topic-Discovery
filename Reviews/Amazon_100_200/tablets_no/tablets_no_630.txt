Love the slate.  It does everything!!!  Best tablet on the market, except for the screen.  The touch is perfect.  I did ad a blue tooth keyboard for typing a lot, but if you are a hunt and peck person, the on screen keyboard works as good as any.  Wish HP would have put all thier touch programming on it, but they did send me a link to download it but I need an IT guy to do the final install.  The best part is it does all the programs I want. Nice.  I recommend this, as long as your not using it in the sun, too dim of a screen and you will be disappointed.
