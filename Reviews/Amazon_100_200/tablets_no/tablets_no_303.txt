I primarily wanted something small and light, but with a real keyboard, for editing documents when I travel. I wanted a Windows-based system, as I've had less than satisfactory results trying to edit Word docs with other OSs like Chrome. I've also found Windows 8 frustrating to use for several reasons. Being somewhat of an old fogey, the last version of Windows I really felt comfortable with was XP, so I prefer using that. I've had this little gem for over a month now and love it! The only negative thing I can say about it is that the keyboard is smaller than a standard keyboard so that my typing speed suffers a bit because of that. But I'm learning to compensate for that, and it's definitely not a deal breaker. If you're someone who has to have the latest and greatest, then this isn't for you. But if you just want something that gets the job done, then I highly recommend this. It also has excellent battery life, and accommodates a USB mouse as well as memory sticks.
