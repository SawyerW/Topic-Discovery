Other than not having the Retina display and all those tiny features that come with it, this is the Ipad 2. Its thinner than the Ipad 1 and runs a bit sleeker. It's actually easier to hold than the Ipad 1 which got heavy at times when I was laying down and watching a movie or show on it before bed. It's nice to carry around for college classes then carrying around a laptop, which can get heavy. Great to take notes with, type papers up, edit photos, surf the web, read, watch tv/movies/netflix, pandora, and play games! This doesn't have the retina display but I don't really need that insane graphics. If you want something that is now cheaper than the Ipad retina get this as an alternative. It's a great Tablet and still sets the bar high! 5/5
