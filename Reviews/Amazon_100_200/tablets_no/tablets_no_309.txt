I have read that there was confusion between the 200-pin or 204-pin 2GB to use with the Lenovo S10-3t.  I believe the computer came out as either a DDR2, with 1GB RAM and Windows 7 Starter OR in my case, the same model came out with a DDR3, WIN7 home premium and 1GB RAM- I have the Cosmic Flight ATOM N455, and discovered (after having read the posts) that the 200-pin did not work but the 204-pin did.  The best thing to do is to open your computer and do a pin count on your RAM.  If the gap where the gold pins are is near the middle or an inch from the RAM edge, then you need a 204-pin 2GB RAM DDR3, if the gap is less than that to the edge (perhaps 3/4 of an inch) then you need a 200-pin 2GB RAM DDR2.  This should save you hours of trying to figure this out on posts, as I have done when the 200-pin did not work on my computer.  Happy days for me from now on!
