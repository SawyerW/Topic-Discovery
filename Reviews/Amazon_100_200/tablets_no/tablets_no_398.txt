My husband and I bought two of these for our boys for their birthdays, mainly to be used for educational purpose, which they are.  The refurb for all the mechanics were very good so says my husband the IT professional.  There were a few little scratches on the back of one and a small ding on the back of the other, but beyond that they work like brand new.  We bought cases for them so you don't even see the minor wear.The iPads came with a power cord but no head phones as a brand new one might have.  I did not see this as a big issue as we had plenty of head phones and those are relatively inexpensive.
