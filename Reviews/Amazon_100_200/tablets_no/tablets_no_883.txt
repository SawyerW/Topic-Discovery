I never thought I would buy a refurb. It is wonderful. Works as it should. I will NEVER pay full price again for an Apple product. I love this ipad. I also have the mini. It was a gift. My eyes are too old to use it all day so I keep the mini next to the bed and her big brother in the Living room. This refurbished ipad is a great great deal. I love it. It would be a good deal to give to your kids if you want to update frequently but not spend a gazillion bucks. Don't be afraid to buy refurbished. No marks or scuffs or excessive use showing. It is worth it!
