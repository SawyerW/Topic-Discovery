Freaking awesome, I'm an aerospace engineering student & this actually meets almost all of my needs. It runs MATLAB, Catia, and AutoCAD beautifully, as well as all Citric based programs that my school offers through the wireless drives. The camera's pretty crappy, but I don't think you're looking at this for use as your primary camera...it also runs normal apps (fb, pinterest, weather, FML, cut the rope, etsy, spotify, etc.) perfectly. It has some trouble with Surfline...idk why. Also, the Bluetooth range is not very far, maybe about 15ft max. I can take my speakers at least twice as far from my iPhone before I start to have problems. Overall though, this is a great product. Its very light, I can put it in my school bag, and I am never dissapointed with it.
