I purchased an iPad for my wife who loves the instant on, the very portable form factor and the many uses for this device provided by the multitude of varied Apps that you can purchase for iPad.I had heard about the scuffle that Apple and Adobe were going through around Flash support for the web browser but didn't think the issue was of much consequence.As my wife and I have been using the iPad it is becoming very apparent to us just how much Flash is used on the internet. It infuriates me that this device can't perform such a basic function (simple internet browsing) without stumbling over Flash and forcing me to go to my home computer to finish the task.What was Steve Jobs thinking? I am so upset over this issue I am hoping that Google, Cisco, Microsoft eat his lunch until he gets some sense knocked into him.STEVE! Support Flash on the iPad! We have paid too much for your device as it is and to not support something so basic like Flash is unbelievable to me.
