I was looking for an e reader because I did not want to spend the amount of money needed for a new Ipad and I was not sure how much I wanted one. Both of my kids kept saying get the Ipad Dad you will enjoy it and it is so easy to operate even you will have no trouble setting it up and using it. When I saw that Amazon had Ipads refurbished at prices better than a cheap Android I thought, Why not give it a try, I have 30 to 60 days to return it and there is so much more I can do with an Ipad. What a great decision. The Ipad I bought from Ocean Electronics looks and operates like it was brand new. Added 14.95 for a new leather cover and I could not be happier. This is a great deal so if your interested in an Ipad and your a beginner like me don't hesitate this is the ticket.
