First let me say that I knew what I was getting before I bought this little gem and was intelligent enough not to compare it to the Apple iPad.It runs Google Android version 1.5 and does NOT include the official Android Market. This is the only gripe I have with this tablet and the device is easily rooted to install a different firmware that does include the market. The resistive touchscreen is surprisingly responsive. Apps are plentiful and many are free.Overall I have had a positive experience with the Archos 7 Home Tablet and would purchase one again in the future.
