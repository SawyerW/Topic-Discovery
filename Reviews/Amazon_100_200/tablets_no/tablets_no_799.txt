This is definitely worth the money. I don't have to be running to my computer. It is very portable, so unlike your desktop computer, you can take it to any room. Unless you are doing a lot on the actual road away from WiFi, there is not much reason to get one with 3G. Between IMessage and FaceTime it makes it worth it for my 5 1/2 year old daughter to keep in touch with Grammy and Grandpa, who live in a different state. She likes to talk to them while eating dinner, so I would rather have her eat near this than my computer.
