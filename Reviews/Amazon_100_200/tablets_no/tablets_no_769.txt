I bought the IPAD2 with gift cards I nabbed from work and I am so glad I did (its a joke people, don't get bent out of shape)!  The Ipad2 is great fun and I can't believe I was doing half the crap I was doing with my iphone on such a small screen now that I have the 7in ipad screen.  I do bills with "pageonce", I read magazines with "zinio", I read books with the "nook" app, I listen to radio (Bubba the Love Sponge) with "tunein radio" and I have phone sex using "facetime".  It has everything I need for a full and healthy life and if you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.
