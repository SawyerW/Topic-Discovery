Ok, so I've changed how many stars this gets. And the title. Because it SUCKS. I thought it was great at first. And it was. I loved reading on it. Then my daughter used it. She read Manga online with it, which was pretty cool for a minute. THEN I noticed that from her turning pages, she'd scratched the screen all up in the corner. WITH HER FINGER. C'mon! Her FINGER?? THEN the battery died all the time so she'd have to read with it plugged in. So naturally, with the cord being on the bottom, the little jack (or whatever that thing is called) got bent or something on the inside and it stopped holding a charge AT ALL. It now sits in a drawer. I'll probably just throw it out because it's an awful ugly paperweight.
