The good:This thing is so cool in so many ways that I could not list them all.  Great battery life.  Good sound.The bad:This thing is so bad in so many ways I could not list them all.  The shape is not good.  No camera. The price! Needs better connectivity.  Lack of FLASH support a total deal breaker.  I was sitting in a restaurant showing this thing off when it started to rain.  I went to Intellicast to get the weather radar.  No joy.  Intellicast uses FLASH.  More sites use FLASH for more things than I ever knew.Bottome line:This thing is a very cool toy that can be usefull but is not well conceived.  Just wait, there will be better things out there.  Maybe the iPad II?
