Do Not Buy!!! I bought the Ideapad S-103t directly from Lenova. I had the product two weeks when the screen cracked while I was tutrning it to tablet mode. I did not apply any special force it just cracked during normal use. When I called tried to get it fixed under the warranty customer service said screen cracks were not covered and I would have to mail it back and pay to have it fixed at $80 analysis fee, $150 for screen, + labor, $250 - $300 total. That is over half the cost of the computer. I took it to the local service provider and got it fixed for $150. Bottom line - The flip between tablet to keyboard is cool but Lenova is selling a poorly built product and does not stand behind thier warranty. If you buy, plan on spending another $200-$300 replacing screen.
