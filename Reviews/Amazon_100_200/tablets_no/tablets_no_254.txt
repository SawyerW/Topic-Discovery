So excited!! I ordered the IPad 2 on Tuesday afternoon and it was received in my office on Friday morning!! So not expected. The product was packaged wonderfully and ready for use. There were no scratches or dents...nothing on it that I would be surprised of. Thank you for such a quick delivery. This will definitely give me time to familiarize myself prior to the start of my hiring season in the next couple of weeks!The iPad is in wonderful condition. I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac. The installation looks as if it happens, but the id name does not install. There are Youtube videos with instructions, but I am not the most computer savvy so I do not necessary understand the instructions. Microsoft office works well and all other programs that I have installed.Have a wonderful day!
