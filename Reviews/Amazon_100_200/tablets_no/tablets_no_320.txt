Four hours and I could never get it to synch right. Visited the local Genius bar and was met late, by a rude Genius, who brought another customer with him and then announced he'd be working with us both. He then did everything he could to get rid of me - I had the wrong kinds of questions, he couldn't help unless I had my desktop PC with me, etc. My daughter had the same experience in her last visit. My wife and daughter thought it was a nice gift. In the end it was a big time sink.I'm an experienced and long-time Apple user and made a good effort to get it working. I'm sure I could if I kept trying - but if Apple doesn't care if it works - I guess I don't.Ex-Apple Fan
