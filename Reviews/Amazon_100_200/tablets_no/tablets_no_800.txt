I bought the iPad for my wife. If you're not a Mac user, it might be a little difficult to get used to, at first, as it was for her. However, it's well worth the learning effort. After an initial slow, but fun orientation and adjustment period, she loves it. It's fun, attractive, and pretty funciontal. I found it was not good for doing my homework asssignments and heavy duty work, because of its small size and onscreen keyboard (not effecctive if you really know how to type). However, once we added a bluetooth keyboard, I thought that it really could be a good "only" computer for anyone but a hard core document writer. I certainly would consider it for myself, as a travel and meeting device, but I'm still not giving up the big comfortable screen on my desk in the office. One more important note. Customer service is superb to any I've used anywhere in my life. Representatives are friendly, responsive, well-educated and just good folks. Thanks, Mac.
