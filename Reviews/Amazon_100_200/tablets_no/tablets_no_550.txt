This is a great e-reader with multiple functionality.  Please note that it is meant to be an e-reader and not a tablet computer.  As ereaders go, it is great with the borders and kindle app.  I wish I could get the barnes and noble app.  I went searching for it but can't find it.Somethings that can be improved is that I don't like the volume buttons being on the right side.  Once I tilt the device to watch a video and try to stand it up on it's side, the buttons tend to interfere. Also, I wish there were some peripheral devices that could be hooked up to it like an external keyboard.Otherwise it is a solid product, good books right out of the box, games, videos, now it has a youtube app.  I was able to hook it up to our wireless internet right away.  Able to view regular websites with ease.  Great product.  Just wish it had flash so I could go to hulu or watch divx movies on it but great, soild device.
