I've had the product for about a week.  I have not modded like many on here, so I am only running apps available on GetJar and Appoke.  Legit access to the Market is a much needed update, and wish the company had a timeline available.That being said, the tablet functions very well as a mini-computer on the go.  Web browsing, email, music, video, photo galleries all work as advertised.  Comes with documents to go for office, productivity needs.  Haven't yet tried a video conference over this, but look forward to trying it out.The best is that is is about half price of the competition.Biggest cons:-- No non-mod access to Market yet.-- Very little in the way of accessories (would love car adapter, customized case.)-- The buttons are not illuminated, although I've found that i know where they are without seeing them after a week of use.
