Archos 43 4.3-Inch 8 GB Internet Tablet Given to my daughter as a birthday gift and she was unable to use the MP3 player app as the screen would freeze and the music would stop.  She would have to restart the app to get the music going again. She only wanted the MP3 part so I bought her a regular cheap MP# player and it works fine.  I now have the Archos and am attempting to learn how to use it.  I could not get it to browse the internet or accept the WIFI connection at McDonald's As I have previously with my laptop.  I will continue to try to understand it.  I should have bought a Kindle Fire.
