I got an iPad 2 a while ago. It's a great choice for anyone.It has pretty much the same features as an ipad 3 or 4, except for the fact that the screen in the 3 and 4 are much better (who cares really?) the ipad 2 screen is also beautiful :)The ipad 3 4 have The new charging cable . the iPad 2 doesn't.  i dont see how that makes a difference. also the ipad 3 amd 4 have Siri. But if you don't plan on using Siri alot, the ipad 2 is perfect :Im writing this review on my iPad. :) It's great!
