So it doesn't have FLASH - clue here peeps ADOBE STOPPED SUPPORTING MOBILE FLASH. Gues HTML 5 or better will be new standard. The IPad 2 is still the BOSS of tablets PERIOD. Nothing performs as well ....NOTHING !  In short was a Apple hater ( still am) but wanted a smaller form factor than the laptops/net book areana. This replaced my laptop couldn't be happier.  Hate the limitations of Apple World thus have an Android phone (Motorola Droid Bionic used as mobile hotspot). All said n done HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! Kindle Fire smaller very limited performance compared to the BOSS.
