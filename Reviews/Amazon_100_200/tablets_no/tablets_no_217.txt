thank you for the speedy delivery of my new I PAD .  this will be used for my 2 yr old sons ABA(applied behavioral analysis) therapy..  my friends and i order from you because you have EVERY THING we look for . i encourage anyone who can order on line to go to you.  research shows that since  the typewriter  an autistic child  can communicate  through these devices and with technology that led to the I PAD .. thank you for the SPEEDY delivery , my sons therapist is programming all the apps and we are all excited to have the i pad.  in our lives . The survivor cover Is AWESOME also . we are really impressed with that . it is very tough and attractive looking. well worth the money to add it to  the I PAD 2  .  THANK YOU THANK YOU
