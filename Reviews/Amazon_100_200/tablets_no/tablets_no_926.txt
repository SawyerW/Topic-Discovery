The supplier was very prompt in delivery, however I was never able to connect the unit to Verizon.  I suspect that this particular IPAD was one in the group that had a duplicate MEID number burned in during manufacture.  The defective unit was returned to Apple and a new unit was sent to me.  The new unit performed as advertised.  Replacing the IPAD took less than a week.  If you are going to use Verizon 3G, then I would recommend that the IPAD be purchased directly from your local Verizon shop.  This will insure that the unit is working properly before you pay.  The price is the same and you can set the account up where the billing is included in your cell phone account rather than through a separate account via Apple/Verizon.
