i was not expecting the ipad when i ordered the micro cruz reader, i just wanted something close for less money.  i have looked over many other touch screen tablets and readers, before choosing this brand.  when i received this product a day early i was excited to get it uncased and working.  since it comes half charged, i was exploring every inch of the light gizmo.  for me the hardest thing to do was getting wifi. Maybe that is just my own particular problem, but i believe it should be noted.  once on the internet downloading apps and stuff is a breeze!  battery will last longer if you turn off wifi when you aren't using it.  overall great buy!
