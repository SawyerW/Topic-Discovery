I bought an iPad 2 and have decided to return it a few days after I bought it.  It's still unopened, and I've attempted to contact them twice.  Still no reply.  I'm giving this a one-star unless this business backs up their end.  Otherwise, I would highly discourage you from doing business from this place.  Quite the unhappy buyer right now.  At this point, I wouldn't trust them as far as you can see.  If I hear back from this company, dependingon how they decide to deal with returns to their business, will depend on whether I leave it at one star or bump it up to a business upholding good customer service.
