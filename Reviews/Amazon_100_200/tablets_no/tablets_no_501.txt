This is my first netbook ever, and I have to say that Lenovo may be the only company I ever go to for netbooks/laptops in the future! I ordered the laptop on the fifth of August and used the 2 day shipping. The laptop arrived on the tenth of August. You should probably allow for about 3 days of processing, not counting actual travel time. I love the touch screen and the 180 degree screen rotation. The size is perfect for just carrying around all day. The only bad things I can say about this netbook are as follows:1) The battery life is small. Only about 3 - 4 hours.2) The RAM is only 1gb. I'm going to extend mine to 2gbs. to allow for faster speed in general.All in all, the problems I have encountered thus far are easily repairable and aren"t going to be much of a setback at all.
