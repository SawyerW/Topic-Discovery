Owned the Archos 43it for almost a month now, and I love it!Plays pretty much everything, has an abundance of inputs and outputs, and has a great interface on the music app.I was very happy to see that it correctly interprets the "discnumber" id3 tag for multi-disc albums (unlike most players) as I have quite a few compilation albums.Pros:* Video playback is clear* 16:9 screen means no letterboxing on movies.* Screen is big enough for movies, while small enough to keep the overall player size fairly small (it's about the same size as my phone, a HTC Desire HD)* Android means you get all the apps* Battery lasts a LONG time: listening to music it will last all day, and after a full charge I can get through a feature-length movie on full screen brightness and still have several hours worth of music playback leftover.The only complaint I have is that the screen is resistive, I would much rather a capacitive screen.Also (and now I'm just being picky), Android 2.3 would be nice (it's running 2.2 with the latest update), and maybe some physical buttons to change the song/play/pause, but we can't have everything :)
