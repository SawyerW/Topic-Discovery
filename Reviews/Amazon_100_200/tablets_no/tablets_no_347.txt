Bought one of the used Ipad 1s from amazon, paid 256$ great price for me to see if I like the whole tablet thing....so far I'm impressed, looking to sell my netbook since this Ipad does it all and better. one issue I had was the included charger...it sucked, luckily I have an Iphone so I can use that charger til I get the dock style charger.but to sum it up....I like what I got, condition was accurate, good with a few use scratches on the back, I've always been impressed by apples products, no wonder they are the most profitable company in the world.
