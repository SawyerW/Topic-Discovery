I bought an Ipad 2 32 gig version before coming to college in hopes of using it as an ereader.  It was absolutely amazing for about the first hour that I used it.  However, once the novelty of it has worn off it isn't extremely useful.  I was only able to find two of my textbooks available as an ebook so I only saved about $50.  Taking into consideration that I paid $600 for it, I most likely will not be able to save any money like I was initially hoping.  Though the Ipad is a fun toy to have around, the apps for it are pretty fun, and it has internet browsing capabilities, it only has about 80% of the utility of using a computer.  For this reason I find myself never really using it for anything and I plan to sell mine before next semester.
