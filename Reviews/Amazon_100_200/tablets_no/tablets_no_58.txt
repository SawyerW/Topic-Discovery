I love my Nexus. I use it 24/7 literally. The app market is great, the tablet runs multiple apps at a time without slowing or freezing, it is easy to transfer extra files to a computer to free up storage or to import files, the speaker is nice & loud, & I have never completely filled my storage space even after I downloaded an extensive music collection, books, apps, and pictures. The camera is nice but I wish it was on the backside. I was able to use it to take video during a flight for my mother & it turned out nice but obviously not as good as a digital camera. There are many free apps to choose from on the market. If you are looking for a few starter apps to try I reccomend chef tap (recipes), bulba the cat (game), duolingo (teaches Spanish) & season zen HD (wallpaper).
