This is an amazing product. But it is not a netbook, or even a computer, exactly.I use it to read/view web stuff, pdf's, kindle content, tv shows, ect on my sofaand in bed. Sounds unambitious--but its a great convenience--easily worth theprice. If your used the itunes sync set up you'll have no problems getting contentonto the ipad. There is no file system per se--everything is organized through theitunes browser. Also available at itunes are huge collection of apps--small softwareapplications. Some are truly great--like the autodesk sketch app, the kindleapp, and the marvel comic app. The device is very fast and seamless; and thedisplay is stellar. If your intent on doing  work on the ipad--you willbe frustrated by its form factor and lack of a true file system. If your lookingfor a portable content browser/reader--you will find the ipad is revolutionary.PS--get the apple case or similar product.
