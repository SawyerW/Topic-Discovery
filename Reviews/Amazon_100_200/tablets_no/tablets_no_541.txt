At first glance, the Velocity Micro Cruz appears to be a great product. That isn't so, as I soon found out. When it first arrived, it took me about an hour to figure out how to even sync ebooks and music to it. Then it suddenly cut off and wouldn't turn on. Then I had to research how to reset the tablet, which was another pain. Finally, I had it up and running and only discovered it would not hook up to wifi. I called the company and the only solution they could give was to return it and get a reimbursement. Even as an e-reader, it did not have a separate e-book library to find the books. I had to go on a scavenger hunt just to find the pdf files. The music on the technology was the only thing I did not have a problem with, every thing else was a pain. All in all, it was a horrible choice for me and I do not recommend it for anyone.
