The iPad will change the way humans live. It's as simple as that. A few years back you saw stage prop devices like this on Star Trek TNG! Now they are here.This is in the same league as Wheat, Fire, Steel, Flight, Anti-biotics, Sails, Steam.You are on the ground floor of a new age and a new civilisation. This WILL reduce the use of paper and oil. This will make humans much more efficient. Old paper and oil based industries will suffer but that is how it goes...If you can find them, there are apps for a wide array of uses. I can read Conrad, Wharton, Fitzgerald while waiting for a plane or work. I can know where I am in 700 cities and what's around me. I can make a video call.You get the idea. It's only going to get better!I like my iPad.Get as much memory as you can afford. Bigger is better. Get the Griffin Survivor case and the Kensington  sling pack. There may be a way to use flash memory as well.Highly recommended.
