I purchased this item for 2011 christmas for my 75 year old mother who wanted to have access to Facebook to communicate to her children and other family who live all over the world.  One of my sisters who lives locally uses this all the time when she comes over and now she wants one for herself.  I have played with many of the other computer pads like the Samsung but I think the Apple Ipad beats them all hands down. If it was not so expensive I would have purchased at least two more, but the price keeps me from doing that.  I rate this device with an A+
