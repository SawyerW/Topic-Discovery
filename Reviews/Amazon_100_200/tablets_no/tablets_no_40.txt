I originally purchased the 16gb model when the Nexus was first released.  I loved it but quickly ran out of space as I like have several movies and pictures, for travel.  So I purchased the 32gb model as soon as it was released.This size tablet is the perfect size for me, large enough to see well and small enough to carry in a bag.  jellybean firmware is excellent - very smooth and fast, and google are constantly updating the firmware to take advantage of new developments.  Easy to use the google play store, and also the Amazon app store together.  Great colour screen.  For me, this is the perfect device.
