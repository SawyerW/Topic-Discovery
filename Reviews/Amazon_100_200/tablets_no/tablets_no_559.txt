I just received two of the three I ordered for Christmas gifts. It was partially charged and gave me enough time to get the Kindle App on and TuneIn App and a youtube clone that allows you to save videos. Video quality seemed good to me. The sound is a little low but not tinny. I'm sure headphones work better or speakers. Seems like a great little device. Had no trouble setting up wifi - and since a Droid user am familiar with the way it is set up with the Android operating system. Cruz store sucks - so recommend that you use try [...] android to find apps to download from your browser. You will need to adjust the text but it is easy to download from and has a lot more applications available. Thanks to another reviewer who provided the above link - just want to make sure everyone sees it!
