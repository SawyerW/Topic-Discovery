I had given my son and daughter-in-law and iPad for Christmas.  What none of us counted on was how much my 4 year old granddaughter loved spending time on it.  So, I decided to "spoil" her a little and bought this one for her.  She absolutely loves it, and since she is also home schooled, this is a tremendous asset.  The only drawback is that my son and daughter in law have to limit the amount of time she spends on it...she is like a sponge when it comes to learning!  I just wish these were around when I was her age!
