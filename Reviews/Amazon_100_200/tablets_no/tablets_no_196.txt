I love my Ipad 2.  It is so light, so convenient and so full of promise that I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.  Actually, I'm a PC person and I have ALOT to learn about using the Apple technology, but so far, I think it's been worth diving into.  The camera has very good resolution and even I was able to take some good movies. I bought this instead of a laptop because I find the touch screen to be soooo intuitive.  I think that's really the best part.  I had a little trouble getting the email system up and running because I'd ordered it through the internet and there's not an Apple Store nearby to set up the product initially.  However,it comes with several months free telephone help and the tech person who assisted me was very patient, skilled and spoke impeccable English. My biggest issue is the delicate touch and size difference of the keyboard compared to a laptop but I am getting real fast at hunt and peck typing- though I may consider buying an auxillary keyboard.  I would definitely recommend the IPAD 2.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies
