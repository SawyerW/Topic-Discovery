The ipad 2 has really changed the way I stay close to information both personally and professionally.  With a wide range of available applications from the App Store and also through my company, I have everything I need to stay productive.  Because I also got the 3G model, it works whereever I go in the United States.Hardware: The screen is bright and a joy to look at.  Multitouch works very well and instantaneously fast.  There is no lag at all in moving across apps. The battery lasts all day long and worked well on 10 hour international flights.Software: iOS 5 is a joy to use and gives me all the flexibility that I want. I wish you could use it as a wifi hotspot but maybe they'll allow that one day.
