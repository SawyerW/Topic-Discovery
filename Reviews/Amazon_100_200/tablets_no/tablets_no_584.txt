When I first acquired the Archos 43 I almost returned it to Amazon due to the difficulty of using the resistive keyboard. I kept the unit, and I'm glad that I did. Once you get some experience with it, the keyboard is quite usuable. Although, sometimes I have to hit a key more than once. My Archos 43 has never frozen up in four months of use. I have found the range, and reliability, of the wifi radio in the 43 to be exceptionally good. Video and audio from this unit are very good. Android is an open, and very flexible, operating system. The Archos 43 easily fits in a front jeans pocket, but I recommend buying a padded leather case for it. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, although I wish it had GPS.
