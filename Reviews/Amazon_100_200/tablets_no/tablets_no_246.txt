I've had the Apple iPad 2 for a few weeks now and I love it. It's so much easier to bring along when traveling than a regular laptop. Most of my iPod apps work on the iPad as well, and I didn't have to purchase the apps a second time. The iPad camera's resolution is not great when zooming way in on a subject, but I didn't really expect the iPad to replace a good quality hand-held digital camera anyway. It works well with Wi-Fi; haven't yet had a need to sign up for the optional Verizon service. Overall, it's been a good purchase.
