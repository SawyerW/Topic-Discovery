This is a 5-6 year old laptop, so every dealer and item will vary somewhat.  My experience was: Bought an inexpensive X61 advertised "battery not guaranteed."  Battery was defunct, but unit was very very clean, with refurb hard drive and nice clean Win7 install.  The unit I got from the dealer I chose was an X61S not X61.  Note that X61S and X61 use the same battery but it is confusing, there is a 1" plastic dummy attachment for use in an X61S that is absent in an X61 battery.  (Before I realized this I bought a new aftermarket $40 battery). X61S supposedly was a slightly premium version in terms of chip generation, etc, over X61.  My good 256MB_SSD from my dead X61 instantly worked in the new very inexpensive X61S chassis, so that is what I wanted for minimum cost.
