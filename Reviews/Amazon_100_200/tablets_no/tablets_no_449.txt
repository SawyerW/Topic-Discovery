Considering that the Archos 7 costs less than half of what an iPad costs, this tablet is a great value.  It surfs the web, grabs your email, has apps and can do Flash.  The built-in Wi-Fi is easy to configure and can pick up signal easily.  The screen is bright...very bright...enough for outdoor use with ease.The only drawback would be its touchscreen.  It is older technology and not as sensitive as the iPad, but again - less than half the cost of an iPad.Watch out Apple!UPDATE 06.25.2010I finally had a chance to install the Skyfire browser.  It immediately doubled this tablet's value.  I now can view Flash videos, including Youtube and news site videos - i.e. CNN.The Skyfire browser was a little hard to find especially since the Archos does not have access to Android Market.  I had to search and download the .apk file from my desktop computer, copy it to a mini-SD card, and run the install on the Archos.
