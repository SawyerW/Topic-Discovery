I bought the iPad 2 after I had accidentally sat on my Kindle on an airplane and needed to make a decision - do I replace the Kindle or go with the iPad.  I had always told my wife that her iPad was little more than a toy, but once I got mine, my world began to change.  Sure, I have 40+ games downloaded, so I definitely enjoy the "toy" factor, but I also use it to take notes at meetings, keep up to date on emails and have even used "docs to go" for verbal presentations.  It has become an awesome tool in my life.
