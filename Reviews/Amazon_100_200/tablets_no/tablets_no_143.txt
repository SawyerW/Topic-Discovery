My husband insisted on buying me an IPad 2 for my birthday. I told him that I did not need one and I am glad he didn't listen to me because I love this thing. I use it every day. I download books for kindle on it to read, I check my email, play scrabble and Spider Solitaire on it, Use Evernote on it to input my work schedule, and other reminders, use it for work and so many other things.I can even use it to pay bills. It is great. Now that the IPad 3 Has come out he wants one of those for himself.I highly recommend IPads.
