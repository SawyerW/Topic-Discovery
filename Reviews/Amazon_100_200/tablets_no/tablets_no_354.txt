I bought this iPad because I needed an extension of the machines I have at home. As an older college student who commutes on a motorcycle, this thing saves me a lot of weight since I can get college e-textbooks, and I don't have the need for a full laptop while at school. It's also nice because I can use it to write a paper in my own cubucle, not having to be surrounded by a bunch of other people in the computer lab. I will however be looking into getting a portable keyboard to go with the IPad, my hands get tired from using the onscreen keyboard. It's in no way a full laptop, but serve many needs perfectly.
