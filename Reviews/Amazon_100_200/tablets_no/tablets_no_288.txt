After suffering with the iPad for several month, I finally got a real tablet - the Acer A500 Android tablet. The iPad is primitive and awkward in comparison. Major failings of the iPad.- Requires tether to a PC. Seriously, just like its 1999.- Very slow- Awkward web browser. Not even any tabs.- "multitasking" only in marketing. It doesn't actually work- Requires daily reboot to update apps, and prevent slowdowns (very little memory)- Really just a big ipod touch with bigger apps- 4:3 prevents watching HD movies in HD- Frequent app crashes- Poor wifi - slow and frequent loss of connectionAnd the list goes on...
