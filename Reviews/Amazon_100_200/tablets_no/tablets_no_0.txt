In the past month, I have owned two beautiful, zippy, but ultimately defective Nexus 7's.The first worked very well for about three weeks. I enjoyed it. It handled everything I threw at it, the screen was vibrant, the battery life surprisingly good, etc. Then one day it had a meltdown. Understand, I was very gentle with this thing. I never put it loose in a bag or dropped it or even set it down hard, so I was quite surprised to turn it on and see the screen go haywire (I'd describe it as multicolored snow.) It never recovered and I was forced to return it. I then bought a replacement from my local OfficeMax, and it did the SAME THING right out of the box. If you google "Nexus 7 Won't Turn On," you'll see that unfortunately this is a common problem. The factory reset does nothing, and if you open the back to poke around, you'll void your warranty. I can only assume that it has some serious hardware issues, and until these are addressed, I'll be trying my luck with another tablet.
