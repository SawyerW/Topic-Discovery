I bought this internet tablet a little more than a month ago, and it still looks like new. It is very well constructed, and does all as advertised except the bluetooth tethering.The battery life is amazing on it. The Keyboard is tricky to type on unless if you type with a stylus. I wish it had a capcitive screen, but it still works very well. I have already dropped it several times and it seems to hold up well. In order to really enjoy this device you NEED TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW A FILE EXPLORER WORKS. Also certain apps don't work with it. The interface is awsome. it is very easy to figure out. If you are considering buying this tablet wait until the next genaration, it will have 3 times the power and a nicer screen. also 3g capability.
