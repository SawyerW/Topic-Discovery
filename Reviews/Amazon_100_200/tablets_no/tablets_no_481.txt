I bought this last year when there were limited tablet options. It is nothing like the Archos 5. Android devices can be quirky but this was ridiculous. Rumor has it that Archos lent their name to this device but actually didn't have much input in it and it falls way short of *any* expectations. It has Android 1.5 version, would freeze often and was extremely sluggish although it did play movies well. Resistive screen worked irratically. Device would turn itself on in my purse and become overheated. Device would change its own settings and have to be reset often which would lose all your bookmarks etc. These are COMMON complaints across the board. Unable to use any apps with this. Device cannot be upgraded.Do some research at archosfans site and look into the Archos 70 tablet instead which has Android 2.2 and is much faster and smoother and a capacitive multitouch screen. Or research some of the many other tablets now available with advanced Android versions.
