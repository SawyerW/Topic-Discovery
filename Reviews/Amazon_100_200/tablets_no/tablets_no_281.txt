If you already have a number of Apps and plan on buying more consider something else? Any purchases you make at the Apple Store are forever linked to your ID and password used at the time of purchase.So if you buy a new system and/or want to change your e-mail address and passwords you will still have to use the old addresses and passwords in order to maintain or upgrade your Apps. Some of my Apps werefree, others were 99 cents and some over $45.00. Apple would not care. You would have to enter all the old e-mail addresses and passwords separately. After nearly 4 hours on the phone Apple suggested that Icould buy the same Apps again?Norm Clark
