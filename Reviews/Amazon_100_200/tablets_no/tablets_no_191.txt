i am always worried when i purchase from a site outside Amazon, especially when the purchase is hundreds.  i took a risk to save some $$.  the ipad came in a week.  it was in a sealed box, everything on the outside in the description was as ordered.  i do not believe this was previously opened.  the device works as expected.  yes i understand it will make way for a newer model in a few months, but the value so far has been fine.  if you are worried, you need to check the return policies.  i would buy this again, especially for commodity items.
