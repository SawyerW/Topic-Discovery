Woman falls in love with a machine.  Sounds like the starting line of a trailer for a science fiction movie?  Nope... sounds like REAL life!  Sounds like I bought myself an Apple iPad 2 MC774LL/A Tablet (32GB, Wifi + AT&T; 3G), and have fallen head over heels for it!  How did I EVER do without it?  This thing is amazing!  I keep finding out more and more with each passing day, and falling deeper and deeper!  Amazon shipped it very quickly, and made me very happy.  Easy purchase and no hassles!  Thanks, Amazon!  Thanks, Apple!  Oh, I just sound like a woman in love! *smile*
