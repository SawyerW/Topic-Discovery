I am really happy with my Asus Eee PC T91. The keyboard is perfect for my wrists (I have thin hands and long fingers). I love it so much I have bought a replacement battery and went through the long involved process of installing it (it is not user accessible) with the help of a youtube video.It is now a lot heavier than it used to be. Probably because everything else has gotten lighter and so now it seems more cumbersome.It does have a problem with the screen. The left fifth of the screen looks like it has an overlay of a transparent magenta. It has been that way since a short while after I got it. It just wasn't worth it to me to deal with doing something about it. About two years ago it lost the ability to notice when the lid was closed so it didn't go to sleep on its own. Now I just use the zzz function before I close it. It is old and this is a minor thing compared to what else could go wrong.
