I was excited about this item, even pre-ordered it.I get it, and 30 days later, it's broken.  Won't turn on.  Factory reset (pinhole on device case) didn't work.  Charging light still lights up when plugged in, but will *NOT* turn on.Don't buy this device -- wait for an android tablet that actually *works*--In terms of the device itself, here are some comments:  Touch screen works OK, for a resistive touch screen device.  But don't expect to be using your fingertip.  Screen calibration is tricky and expect to do this over and over.  Battery life is quite good, but app selection is horrible.  Even standard android apps such as Pandora don't work correctly on this 1.5 android OS device.  No Google marketplace support.  Onscreen keyboard is tricky to use.  Pretty laggy device overall.
