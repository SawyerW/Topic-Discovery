As an android fan I found three things about the ipad that I liked1) Battery life is PHENOMENAL2) Some of the apps I use on android have better versions on the ipad (this is largely due to the OEM fragmentation of android and a more uniform OS and hardware situation with apple)3) Lots of accessoriesAs an android fan I found a bunch of things I didn't like1) Almost everything has to go through itunes/apple2) No widgets/home screen customization.3) No Amazon MP3 downloads4) No CLEAR access to device flash memory.5) Only apps from the apple app store can be installed6) second hand google apps7) Maps and GPS don't work WELL8) No flash. (although there aren't anymore official android flash player updates. It can still be installed)9) One app at a time (I'm spoiled by my note 2)
