I work a lot away from home/office and wanted to buy a Kindle and a netbook, but a friend suggested an iPad instead.  I was not sure that the cost was worth it, but, so far, I'm enjoying it.  It's nice not having the weight of my laptop on my shoulder.  And it's good to have the Kindle app as I love to read.Two negatives for me - of course everyone comments on the lack of Adobe flash and this is a problem for me as some of the websites that I must access use this feature.  Second I MUST be able to read pdf documents.  I downloaded iBooks then purchased pdfReader Pro and still cannot read the working document for a meeting in London; this is the main reason that I bought the iPad - to avoid having to travel with a laptop - so I'm very disappointed!
