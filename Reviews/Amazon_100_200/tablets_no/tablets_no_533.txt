I got this reader because I wanted one that supports color. I was looking for a READER, so the added capabilities were just a bonus. I set it up within fifteen minutes of getting it and so far I love it. The only reason I gave it four starts is because it is a bit slow and it does hang on occasion; however, this is not a deal breaker for me. I was wary because of some of the bad reviews, but I don't regret having purchased this. It's easy to get excited with the extra features of this reader, but you really do have to keep in mind that it isn't a tablet. It's a reader with a few extras.
