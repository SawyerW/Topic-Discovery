Got the iPad after checking it out at Best Buy. Just to be clear it is not an iPhone, it is not a laptop, it is a new device that has instantly been a hit for our family. We use it to check email, watch video, and surf the web. The instant on feature and the large screen make it a fundamentally different device than any product we've used before. The interface just seems so intuitive. We have a MacBook Pro and several iPhones and an iPod touch in our family and but this feels more useful than any of these devices for common tasks as mentioned above. Oh and my wife loves the games, most of which are free on the iTunes App store.Is it perfect, no. It is a bit heavy and don't try to read it outside. But for nighttime reading and viewing the internet, it rocks! Top apps so far are ABC, Netflix, and iBooks/Kindle. I suspect it will only get better as more useful apps are released.
