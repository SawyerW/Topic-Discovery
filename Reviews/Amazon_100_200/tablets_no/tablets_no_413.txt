I purchased a "used - like new" iPad 1st generation from Amazon Warehouse Deals and I couldn't be happier. The iPad was in beautiful condition and (so far, at least) it works perfectly. As a 1st generation, it cannot be updated with the latest iPad software so it does have its limits but this iPad was intended as a gift for my 6 year old son and is primarily used for games and music. We've had another 1st Generation iPad for a couple of years now and I am very impressed with how durable it is at the hands of two young boys so I feel like getting this used-like new iPad was a fabulous deal!
