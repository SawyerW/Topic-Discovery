This device is totally and completely useless. I have never written a review in my life before, but I had to for this to warn people not to buy this.It basically doesn't do anything. You can't use the android ap store, so pretty much all the useful functionality of your droid phone you can't use. The touch screen is awkward and slow, so it's not useful for web browsing. None of the aps that it comes with are useful. You can't watch videos, you can't listen to music, you can't browse the web, you can't play games.I use it as an alarm clock.I ignorantly thought it would be a tablet version of my android phone. Wrong.Terrible.
