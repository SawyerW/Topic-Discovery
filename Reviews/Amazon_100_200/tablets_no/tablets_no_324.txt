I kept hearing that an upgraded iPad was coming in a few months, but I decided not to wait. I'm glad I didn't. This is an incredible device. When used with a small wireless keyboard and the DropBox app, I can do almost everything with my iPad that I could do with my laptop. During a recent trip I edited an entire manuscript on the iPad using the Pages app and then used the DropBox app to share it with my assistant. The games, movies and amazing educational applications such as SkyWalk are hard to beat, too. Despite what you may hear, this is more than just an oversized iPod Touch.
