I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also. I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I didn't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading. The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading. The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook. I am hoping that will change.
