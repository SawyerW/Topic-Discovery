HP has made a hit here.  More than an Ipad or netbook, the Slate is a touchscreen with full Windows 7 OS.  I have replaced my laptop with this product and am pleased. The one con I have is the speed.  Although faster than my 4 year old lap top, I have been spoiled by my HP Desktop and become impatient with the extra few seconds it may take for the Slate to load the same program.  Still, the convenience makes it worth it.  I can slip it in my purse and go.  The writing recognition cpability makes it a real winner for the office for quick notes and signatures
