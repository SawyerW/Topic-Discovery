Ok it took me a while to jump on the Apple bandwagon, but I finally did.  Although I purchased a used Ipad2 (didn't want to still pay 500.00) I have to say it is worth it.  I have 2 kids 8 and 4 and as I told my father, there is just something about a device that you hand to your 4 year old and he can figure out how to use it.  He definitely knows more than my husband.  I use it for games e-mail, news.  My kids do games, math, watch Disney shows and fight over it, so much so that I might have to get another one but I am still not willing to spend full price will probably still look for a used model, works great for us.
