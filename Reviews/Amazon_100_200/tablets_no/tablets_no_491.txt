I was told by an Office Depot employee not to get this Android Tablet that this store was getting a lot of customer returns. The main complaint was customers having problems upgrading the operating system and programs on this devise.  I also checked out if I could download the Barnes and Noble Nook application and there isn't on in the limited Archos 7 Market Place. They do have an application for the Amazon Kindle to download for this devise.I like the size but after talking with the sales rep decided not to buy it. Too bad it has a great price.
