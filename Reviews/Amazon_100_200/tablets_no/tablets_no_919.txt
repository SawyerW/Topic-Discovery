The I Pad 2 was a gift for my daughter who is a sophmore in college.  It was an instant success, she loves it and I believe it will help her in her studies, it is mobile, and super fast and easy to use.  Ordering it on Amazon was easy as ell and we got a great price and did not have to wait in a line.  When I first received the box I thought it was the wrong item and sent an E Mail to Amazon, the response was immediate and I was assured I has the correct product.  I would recommend Amazon to anyone shopping for anything at all, I have had nothing but good experiences with them.
