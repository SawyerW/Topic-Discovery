Was expecting U.S. market XOOM, but received Singapore grey market XOOM MZ604 which can not be updated to the most recent U.S. updates (will not update to 3.2.1 as of this writing.) and lacks certain U.S. market apps (you will pay more for the apps as well). From what I understand Motorola will not honor the warranty on it. This description needs to specify this fact. Sold by UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC and fulfilled by Amazon.Edit: I will say it is of the same quality as my wifes US XOOM and if you are handy with basic programming you can convert it to a US market XOOM in less than 20 mins.
