I purchased this just as a toy to play around with and I first installed a Windows 7 upgrade that I had lying around here, which worked great.  It's very easy to find drivers and everything that you need online for the upgrade.  Then, I tried installing Windows 8 Professional, which didn't work out because I could never get the touchscreen working.  There are some instructions online and videos on YouTube of Windows 8 working on the X9500, but even when I followed the instructions, I couldn't get it working successfully, so I went back to Windows 7.The worst thing about the HTC Shift X9500 is the battery life.  The claim is 2 hours, but I never got more than 1 hr and 15 mins.  There are extended batteries available online for around $200 that are supposed to give it 4 hours of battery life, but I felt like it wouldn't be worth the expenses and decided to sell my Shift and purchase one of the new Clover Trail tablets instead.
