I bought this a year ago, my first experience with an Android device. While it performed well enough to sell me on the concept, the limitations of this device became quickly evident even though I had no prior experience to compare it to. The Froyo deployment is maddeningly slow at times, with clicks & swipes lagging by several seconds. This problem is compounded by screen response that is often marginal.For those wanting a phone bill free android device, the Samsung Galaxy Players are a much more capable choice, and increasingly price competitive.The good points of this device are (1) the kick stand, which is quite handy & really should have been copied by other manufacturers by now- and (2) the ability to browse & play media from network shares out of the box - this feature is conspicuously absent on other tablets,  which require a  host of apps & plugins that often don't work reliably.
