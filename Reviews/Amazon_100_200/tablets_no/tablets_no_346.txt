I bought this to have an additional iPad in the house for when family comes to visit and everyone wants a device (especially the kids). I bought this one used through amazon. Trying to be "green", recycling the device, plus it was purchased for significant less than a new one. I have had no problems buying a used device through amazon. The product arrived quickly, was as or better than described. It has worked perfectly. It was reset to factory settings, so I only had to connect to iTunes and set up as I would a new device. Absolutely no issues. I have purchased other used devices through amazon, and would do so again with confidence.
