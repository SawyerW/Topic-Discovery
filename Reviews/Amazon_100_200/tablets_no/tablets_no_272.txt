it is a great item that can be enjoyed just about anywhere.  The problem with the ipad2 is it doesn't support FLASH.  Steve Jobs has this problem with flash and won't let it be used on the iPad.  Well, Steve should get over it, concentrate on himself and Apple should provide services that customers want.  I can not Downlod many email messages because the attachments are in flash.  I did not know this when I bought it.  It should be very clearly posted in the store and on the the box.Had i knows this I would have purchased the XOOM.THINK ABOUT THIS BEFORE YOU BUY BECAUSE IT IS FRUSTRATING.
