The good news for those hungering for apps is that you now can install the Amazon Appstore from the Cruz Marketplace. The Amazon Appstore is a very healthly alternative to the Android Marketplace.The Cruz was bought primarily to read documents - pdfs, notes, basic stuff. If you need to zoom into a document then things become tedious and tricky because of the uncooperative resistive screen and lack of pinch to zoom. I tried calibrating the unit but that did not alleviate the pain much. You are not going to enjoy typing or manipulating stuff on this thing, even with a stylus. Some clicks are almost capacitively responsive. Others will have you stabbing the screen with a vengeance.One last disappointment is that it does not have a mic - something I would consider really basic and dirt cheap to include. Means I cannot use it for Shazam, Sound Hound, or any sound recording.It probably makes a good straight-up ebook reader and can run apps that require minimal input. If you want more than that I'd advise you look for something better.
