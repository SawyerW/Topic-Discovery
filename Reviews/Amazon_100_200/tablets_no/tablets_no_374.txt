I wanted an iPad and thought about getting iPad second gen. But was kinda pressed for money so just wanted an experience with it first before dumping loads of money on something that might just be sitting around after a while but boy that isn't the case with the one I received. It was in mint condition not one scratch! Now it doesn't have a camera sure ur for me that wasn't a big deal because my girlfriend takes the pictures in the relationship lol! Plus how ackward is it to take pictures with these things lol just get a digital camera or something. though it would be nice to ovvoo or FaceTime or what have you. I have no collimating though. It's wicked fast well at least faster then my computer so I got no complaints.I also put the otterbox commuter case to protect it giants future scratches. If you're looking for a cheap way to experience the iPad generations then I suggest you just trying first gen.
