Purchased this iPad 2 for the family so wanted to pay a discounted price compared to retail.  Could not be more pleased with purchasing our refurbished iPad 2 from RockerJakes.com.  We chose RockerJakes because of the detailed description of the unit and prompt reply when we inquired directly to the company before making the purchase.  The unit was described as having 3 scratches which upon arrival were very minimal and acceptable - especially after putting it in a case.  Seems brand new actually!  The unit came with a protective screen so we put that on right away before the children used the device.  Within minutes we were up and running the iPad 2 full force testing it out.  It works great and seems just as great as the iPads we have purchased brand new.We did have some hiccups with shipping.  Didn't realize a signature was required to receive the package.  After wrestling with Amazon and UPS, we worked something out and Amazon was very customer focused and willing to help make things right.  Thank you!!
