Great gadget. I got it as a gift and honestly, before receiving it, never thought that I would use one, especially for productivity. Well, guess what--I am using NoteTaker HD to WRITE (with stylus) down all my notes at work, I browse the web on the iPad, I watch movies on it, I watch YouTube on it, I type notes on it when I want to, I read books on it (through the Kindle app), I study on it--I can keep going for a while. No, the iPad does not replace my macbook pro at all, and I do wish that the iPad had better graphics, but for what it is right now, the iPad is by far the best tablet out there (and I've played with a few Android tablets my co-workers have) and surprisingly (very, at first) useful, both personally and professionally. And no, I am not an Apple fanboy, as I do have an Android phone (need a keyboard).The selection of quality apps is also unparalleled.
