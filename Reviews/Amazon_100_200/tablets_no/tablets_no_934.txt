I was looking to either pick up an ipad 2, blackberry playbook, or the asus transformer. I decided to go the ipad 2 because of ios. It has it's limitations such lack of flash, more expensive, non extendable storage, not as many ports, and I'm sure there is more. I don't care much for apple hardware specs because it's competitors usually will give more bang for the buck. I bought it mainly for ios. With ios I can feel confident there will be updates and future support for the next few years unlike blackberry or a windows tablet. I really wanted to get an adroid device, but the lack of security and hardware optimization and support made me go with apple. Apple does have security issues (pdf exploit) but that was fix with the 4.3.4 ios update. I can always count on talking to someone when I need support (within my warranty). I was bleh and asked myself why didn't I go with an adroid device when I first got the ipad 2, but as I start using it I am liking it more and more.
