Why? Compare two things and you will know. Time and Living. If these two matter to you, then look at how convenient it is to use an Apple based appliance. Some say intuitive. I say easy. Basic. Bottom line - resourceful all the time. Time is what you save with Apple iPad 2, second generation. The core of Apple is it's safety, not programs that take up your memory and time, costly in cash and down town, called security programs. You know what I am talking about. Security for the designers and owners, but un-necessary with Apple.Easy to take-along with its weight-less characteristic, yet durable on the road in performance. Best buy for the iPad buck so far.iT InterestedMichael T
