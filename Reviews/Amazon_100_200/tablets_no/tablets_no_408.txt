If your computer doesn't have an Intel chip in it, DO NOT BUT AN IPAD! It will not sync with your computer. I have been a lifelong Apple fan, and this has upset me so much that I will never buy another Mac product. I have a perfectly good Mac G5 desktop with a PowerPC chip in it. It's a bit older, but it's in great shape and I record all of my music on it. I bought the Ipad for my wife the day before our 3 week vacation, assuming it would be plug and play just like all my other Mac purchases. Not only was it not plug and play, it doesn't sync at all with my computer and it never will. I called the Apple help line, and they told me I basically have to buy a new computer that has an Intel chip in it. Nice trick Apple - if you want to lose customers. My wife loves the Ipad, but we are hugely disappointed in Apple for doing this to us.
