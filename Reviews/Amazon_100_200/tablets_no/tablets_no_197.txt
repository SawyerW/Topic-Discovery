Ipad 2 is so much more than just a "big iPod touch". People making such claims obviously do not own one.I agree that because applications are similar and they both share the same iOS, the experience might not seem that different, but once you get your hands on it, the bigger screen, the dual core processor, larger memory and longer battery result in much much better overall experience.It's more practical for almost everything, except of course portability as your iPod touch fits in your pocket but leaving that aside, it's really portable, you can take it with you everywhere.This product has literally helped me get over my Ex.
