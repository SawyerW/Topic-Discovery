The Nexus 7 is my personal favorite in the realm of tablets of it size. Based on objectively comparable features, it is better generally better than the iPad mini, other than in the case of cameras, as the Nexus 7 has no rear camera to take pictures. This tablet is also a bit smaller than the iPad mini, making it just the right size to fit in a cargo pants pocket. The Android operating system, however, is more compatible with other devices than iOS, making it easier to import pictures and other files to the device. The Android operating system also allows for much more personalization than iOS. The Nexus 7's powerful hardware, crystal clear display, and exterior construction also set it above most competitors of its approximate size including the iPad mini. Surprisingly, one of my favorite features is the backplaye, which is plastic, but has a nice grippy, anti-slip texture that contributes to how perfectly the Nexus 7 fits perfectly in one hand.
