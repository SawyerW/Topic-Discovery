My first iPad.  When I opened the box it looked brand new, and contained the cords as advertised.  About a week later I took a good look at it at an angle and noticed some slight scratches around the edges, but by then they could have been mine.  Great buy as "used" product.  And I love it, have not used my desktop computer since (and my laptop died which is why I got this).  Everything from my iPod touch was automatically loaded on startup, just had to turn it on.  I have used it constantly - email, surfing, twitter, Words...  Much easier to use than laptop, handy to take room to room, easier to use lounging on sofa, reading in bed, etc.  I love it.
