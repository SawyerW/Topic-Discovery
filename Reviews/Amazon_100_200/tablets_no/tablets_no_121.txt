I have owned this laptop for 2 years now and I have not been able to use it for more than two days in the past year. It seems that there is a defect in the design of this laptop and after awhile the overheating literally causes the motherboard to warp which causes a variety of problems in various laptops of this make. With mine, the screen goes blank as it fails to engage the hard drive. Some companies who specialize in the repair of this particular model place a copper shim (a penny) between the motherboard and ????? Well, some have claimed that this remedied the defect. I'm really happy for them. But for me, this will be the 4th attempt to get it right.If you're one of those unsuspecting owners of one of these puppies, you may want to contact PC Mania in MA. They are the ones who, for less than $100 (includes shipping both ways) guarantee they can fix it. They can be found on eBay as well. Hope this review has been helpful. Good luck and God's blessing.
