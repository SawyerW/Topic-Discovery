Since the day I have received my iPad, I have yet to dig out my 17inch HP laptop to use.  I have also cut down on the use of my quad intel core Dell pc desktop, which I use to use everyday like clockwork.  It is far more handy and quicker to activate and get online than my old laptop or pc, which take far longer to startup and go, the iPad is a punch and go device for me and very convenient to use, it has a few drawbacks, like the lack of flash but to me that's no biggie anyhow, flash is mainly for the poor Porno geeks who can't get laid anyhow.  All in all, I love it, get one today!
