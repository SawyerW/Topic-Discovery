I've had this computer for about a month now and it is great. It so great not having to use yout mouse for everything and it's fun being able to interact with the computer. People say there are all kinds of problems with this computer, but I have yet to find one. I can burn disks, watch videos, and write notes. There's even a special kind of word program and notepad that is on here. I would suggest this computer for people who can't type or have issues with their wrists. And it's also nice for college students so they can write and then automatically convert their notes to typed. IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS BUSINESS PERSON OR WANT THIS FOR GAMING, DO NOT GET IT!!! If any problems occur with this laptop I will write another review, but I doubt anything will happen.
