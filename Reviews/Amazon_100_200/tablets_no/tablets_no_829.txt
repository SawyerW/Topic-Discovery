Received faster than anticipated with standard delivery.  As advertised.  Works perfectly.  Recommend this seller.This is a luxury item for me.  I do not NEED it.  I just WANTED it so I can have my 6000+ electronic books relating to my study of Christ and the Word of God with me at all times.  This iPad fits in my purse and I take it everywhere.  I can read for 2 minutes; close the cover; and pick up 2 hours later at exactly the same place.  No carrying around an extra satchel and highlighters and post-it notes.  Its all on the iPad.  Thank you Lord for this gift!
