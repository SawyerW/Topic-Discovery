I received my I pad about 3 to 4 months ago. I did not get this item from amazon, I am in high school and my school issued out iPads to 11th and 12th graders. It's a wonderful device, nice browser and it has a very responsive touch screen, not one scratch is on the screen. It has almost a glass feel to the screen, very good quality. It's light, the speaker has good sound. I have heard people complain about the camera quality, honestly I love the camera and I think it's great. I know its not the best quality but I thinks it's fine.
