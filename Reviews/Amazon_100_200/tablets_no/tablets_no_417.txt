The product was delivered in great time!But- it would not hold a charge.This was a Christmas gift I was very upset that the unit was not tested before it was released. I was more upset that it was not completely ready to go when we received it. What is most upsetting is you get our money and we have to trust you then we get a product that is not up to speed.Don't do this to another customer. We will keep the iPad because we don't have the time to return it to you with out an upset 8 year old! She would not understand why Santa brought her a gift that does not work! We will keep it but I am not a happy Amazon customer right now! Thanks!
