The Archos 7 8GB Home Tablet is an okay device for web surfing and decent for video viewing and listening to music. Its small size (about half of the Ipad) makes it convenient to use just about anywhere in the house, but the device has many drawbacks. The touch screen is not very responsive at all, you really have to work to type in letters or numbers on the virtual keyboard and scrolling down requires the accuracy of an eye surgeon, many times you open something on the page rather than scroll down. Less than desirable is the fact that there is no portrait mode, everything stays in landscape mode, unlike the Itouch or Ipad where turning the device will turn the screen. For $200 the price is decent but for another $300 the Ipad is much more responsive and my Asus Eee PC for $329 is a million times better. Save up and get a netbook or Ipad.
