This product isn't just bad - it's ridiculous.  What company charges $250 for an mp3 player that doesn't even sync playlists with Windows Media Player?  I submitted a support ticket for this problem and here is the response i received almost two weeks later from Archos tech support:"The unit does not accept playlists through syncing.  You will need to create the Play list on the device"Thank you,Andrew HArchos Technical SupportNot only doesn't it work but Archos doesn't even believe that this is a shortcoming!!!!  Un-Be-Liev-Able.The touch (or not so touch) screen works about 1 out of 4 tries when using my finger so it's useless without a stylus.  More than half the apps I've tried to download from the Android marketplace don't work on the 43.  I can't imagine how they could make this thing any worse. This is a good example of why people buy iPod's.Update: 3/25/12 This awful piece of trash has now managed to corrupt (i.e. ruined) two SD cards.  It just keeps getting worse.
