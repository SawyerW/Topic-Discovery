depends what each one is looking for, as this is pretty much an overgrown phone without the phone capabilities!!If you are looking for a net/notebook replacement this is not the place for look, for sure.the lack of flash support is not only annoying but seriously handicapping an already handicapped (hardware-wise) devicegood for gaming for kidsgood for accessing your emails fast, especially if your eyesight is not as strong as those crackberry usersweb browsing is good and fast but .... that damn flash issue again.Basically apple has repackaged an old solution into a glossy package with average hardware and sells it for gold, a feat which noone but apple can achieve and no less commendable since for the same money you can get 3 netbooks or one kickass notebook...A word of advice to those guys queuing outside Apple stores to get this, guys relax, get a netbook, an extra battery and buy a nice gift to your girl/boyfriend with the rest of the money and you will feel better in the morning!
