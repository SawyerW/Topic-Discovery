My husband and I love our IPads!First I purchased a 16G, but used up most of the space with books, music and pictures.  So my husband got that one and I purchased a 64G (model 1). Love it.  Then I was fortunate to have another loaned to me as part of a Board of Directors (it sounds like an expensive prop, but considering the copying, etc., storing of paperwork, and all else that goes into a Directorship, this is a real bargain!).Then we continued to have issues with our ISP, and would go days w/o internet service, so I felt it was necessary to move up to an IPad 2 with Verizon.I just couldn't be happier!
