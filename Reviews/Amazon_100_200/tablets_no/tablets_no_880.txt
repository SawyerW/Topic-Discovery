I have been a Windows gal since the 1980s. I've owned many PCs and one laptop during that time and never even considered getting anything other than Windows. When I got a phone I made sure it ran Android. I was anti-Apple. I thought people who bought Apple products were members of a cult who'd been brainwashed.Hmm. I got an iPad after my partner said she wanted one. I was seduced the second I held it. Wow. Unbelievable. It took minutes to set up. There were no error messages. Everything worked perfectly. The design is elegant, sublime.I never thought I'd own a tablet let alone an Apple product, but I can honestly say this was one of the smartest, coolest purchases I've ever made. The apps are great, the battery holds a charge, and it's an incredibly freaking fun toy.I was wrong. All you Apple people were right. I am now a member of the cult and will probably only buy Apple products in the future.
