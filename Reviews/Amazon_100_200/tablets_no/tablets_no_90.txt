First, the color in the picture is not AT ALL what I recieved. This one is a Dark Hot Pink, not the pale, lighter pink featured. Had I known that, I would have gotten it a bit cheaper with another seller, but my daughter wanted this one. Second, it did not come with the gel pad or a pen. I purchased the same one in red for my son that came with both, but that is my fault for not CAREFULLY reading the product detail. Most definately a misrepresentation on the color though. Other wise, they are charging, and my daughter will either get over the fact its a darker pink, or I will have a new ZEEPAD!
