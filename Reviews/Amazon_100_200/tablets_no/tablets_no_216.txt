I am having so much fun with this ipad!! It is amazing how much I can do on it. There is only one little wee tiny thing that makes me wonder about its volume function; when I am playing my music, I notice that the volume sometimes goes lower and then just as suddenly, it will come back up to the set volume. I don't know if that means anything is wrong but I hope not. I don't want anything to be wrong with this ipad as I really love using it. It also has the very best tunes for alarms, notices etc. So glad I bought it!
