HelloI bought two pieces of this product (Velocity Cruz R101) back in march 2011 while visiting the States as presents to my wife and kid.For approximately one month they both performed well, despite the fact they were responding kind of slow to the clicks and actions (but hey, this is what you should expect for this money).After one month since I bought it, and being used only occasionally (!!!), my wife's tablet started to connect slower and slower (one successful connection @ 3-4 trials) to the WiFi in my house, and finally now it isn't connecting at all. I don't believe I have a problem with my wireless router since the second Velocity Cruz tablet, laptops and smartphones don't have an issue connecting.The 30 days were gone so the return policy was off, right now I am holding in my hands a crappy decoration object of the modern technology.I do not recommend anyone buying this product!
