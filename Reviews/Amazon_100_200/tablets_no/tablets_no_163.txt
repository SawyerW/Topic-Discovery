Be careful!!  I received this "new" iPad yesterday...turned it on, but the screen was completely blank! Called Apple support and they kindly walked me through the restore porcess...which did not work unfortunately.  I now have an appointment at the Apple store today for them to see what the problem might be.  The really weird thing is the ipad had a user name on the setup screen that was displayed on my macbook. as if soneone else owned this ipad before.  I thought I was buying a brand new iPad, and I paid full price.  So it should not have been used before, right?  Is Amazon/ShopVius selling referbusided products on the cheap or just unknowlingly doing so through a second party??  Not a good business practice Amazon!  Buy from Apple directly if you desire their products.  Safer by far.Not a happy camper!!
