I am usually known as the Apple hater, but I did cave in and buy the Ipad 2. That being said... I like it, I would like it better if it were flash capable and if it had a USB port. Also I think that although you can purchase data if you have the 3G version without signing up to a contract... I think it sucks that if you don't use that purchased amount in 30 days you lose it. Damn!!Why can't I keep it until I use it up? That prompted me to purchase the Wifi version only (Either it is pay as you go or it is not) with Apple IT IS NOT. Things like that continue to make me a Apple shall I say... disliker if thats a word. All in All I will say I am enjoying the Ipad, I've only had it a week so give me time I might change my mind.
