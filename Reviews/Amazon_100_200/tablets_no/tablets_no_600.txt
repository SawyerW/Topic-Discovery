I love my tablet. I use it for graduate school. It's great for reading assignments in PDF, reading ebooks, typing papers, keeping up with emails, and so much more. I use it with an iGo/ThinkOutside Ultra-Slim Stowaway Keyboard I used to use for my Windows Mobile PDA. It's also great for watching videos, playing games, and browsing the web (with Flash, of course!). I have absolutely no idea why online articles are still complaining that Android doesn't have enough apps just because it doesn't have as many as iPad; it simply doesn't have as many worthless apps to sift through. Everything I need is available and most of them are free. My favorite apps are ezPDF Reader Pro for PDFs and OfficeSuite Pro for documents/spreadsheets/presentations. The latter app, although it costs $10, I got for free because of Amazon's free app of the day--definitely a huge benefit to Android users.
