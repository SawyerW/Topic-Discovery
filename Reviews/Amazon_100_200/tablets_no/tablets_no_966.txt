I have resisted getting a tablet for years. As others have observed, a computer without a real keyboard is weighted toward content consumption rather than content creation (otherwise known as work). To fill the need for a lightweight, long battery life, zero fan/vent portable, I had purchased a Chromeook. Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.Well a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.Now, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable. It is really an integral part of my life and work.I will probably sell the Chromebook on eBay. This will be the first of many iPads to come as they come out with newer versions.
