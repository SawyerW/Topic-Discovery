We were disappointed with the Archos 7. Perhaps it is a generational thing as we are in our sixties. But the screen was not particularly sensitive, the battery seemed to deplete faster than one might expect and, most importantly, we kept losing wireless connection cutting us off from the internet. We returned the Archos 7 to the vendor, along with the accompanying scan disc (never used) that we had purchased, but have received a refund only for the Archos. We went out and bought an Acer netbook for about $100 more and it has met all our expectations. Not once has it lost wireless connection with the same router we had used with the Archos 7.
