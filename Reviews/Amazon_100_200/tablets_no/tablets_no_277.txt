love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love itand i am reading Steve Job's biography on it .... ahhhhhhhhonly thing is that like all macs you can't do much if you are a PC person. i can't do anything on it work-wise. only for browsing and app playing. yes yes i know that's what Steve Jobs intended - what with the right management and all the 3G cord disables the video out so you cant export video - PAINFUL !!!!AND!!! none of my old charger works - i know apple just wants you to spend more money buying accessories!!! what happened making stuff affordable for the masses? Where's WOZ on this ?
