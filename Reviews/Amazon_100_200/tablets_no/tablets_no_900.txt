I have had every android tablet on the market, from the acer aconia tab, to the samsung galazy tab, to the blackberry playbook, all the way to the amazon kindle, and now i have the ipad as well. The ipad is noce, the app store is nice, the screen is big, but i like it. I have it in an otterbox defender series case which makes the tablet seem heavy, but the protection is well worth it, and the case's weight I became accustomed to. This is a great product, woth a lot of features, and completely worth the money. But there may be a few cheaper sites to find it (cowboom) but that is only sometimes. I received mine from amazon and am completely happy and pleased. Awesome tablet.
