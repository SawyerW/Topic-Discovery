There are several positive things to be said. First Hi-Tech Deals got my order to me quickly. Second, the iPad2 works great. Third, The case that was sent with it was a nice extra. Fourth, the iPad 2 works great except for its inability to stay on the WiFi. After doing some research I found out the problem is not the iPad but the new Apple 6.x update for the iPad2.  (Warning to owners of iPads, be careful of Apples new 6.x update as it does not help like it should) Otherwise I am very happy with the tablet and am having great time learning how to run it.
