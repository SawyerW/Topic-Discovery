I do not own one of these devices but I have had extensive experience with Archos support and there is something you should know before you order one of their products...No matter how nice their devices may seem to be. When it comes time to fix them (and they will need to be fixed) you will have a nightmare trying to get it taken care of. The support staff are rude, unhelpful, and downright liars! I am now on my third replacement of a device which cost over $400 not one of which has lasted for longer than 4 months! This third device which just showed up this evening is also defective. This after being assured that the device was stress tested by a top tech to ensure that I did not get a lemon this time.Save yourself the headache and go with a different company.
