the kids like the nooks, the construction is sound, and it is fast enough with a very good screen. I'm glad barnes and noble granted access to google play store,  HOWEVER, i do wish i could go to Amazon App Store also this is why 3 instead of four stars...... setup was easy enough but not as easy as apple. Eventually i'll get a couple of ROOT MY NOOKHD sd cards and then we will have 4.5-5 star tablets.just a little too controlled,... as in proprietary control, for my liking but as i said good input response .Ok it'b been 3 months one of the tablets doesn't work anymore i'm going to talk to square deal since Buy Accessories, the seller won't help me with the 1 year warranty that is supposed to come with the tablets. Neither charger works well, one charger doesn't work at all the other charger you have to play with to get it working.  3 months............. all I can say is both of their iPod touches are still working just fine and they have had the iPods for over two years. If I could get my money back I would get iPad minis
