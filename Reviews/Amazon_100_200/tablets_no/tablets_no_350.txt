The iPad 16 gb wifi only is the best value for money in the iPad series. The screen display is absolutely gorgeous as well as the overall finishing quality of the product. Internet browsing, checking multiple mail accounts, watching videos and pictures, listening songs or just spending loads of time playing games and trying out loads n loads of fun filled applications is just an out of this world experience. Ofcourse you can't compare the ipad to a regular pc or a laptop (when it comes to heavy document or graphic processing) but for everything else specially while being on the move there's the iPad.
