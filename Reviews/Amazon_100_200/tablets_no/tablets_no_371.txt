Yes, it actually works if you willing to waste your time. Very unfriendly tablet. No paperwork. As I compare this tablet to regular PC this tablet worth exactly  10 bucks. The only valuable future is Internet access. Its not really fast either. Other strange thing is everybody told me Apple protected against viruses--nonsense. In first 10 minutes some program attacked tablet and luckily for me I was fast enough to shut tablet down. If I have question and I do I have to drive to Apple store and ask.Avoid.after having this toy for some time i realized anything i want to do i need second computer like printing or word prosessing and they always trying sell me music and install upgrades on my regular PC so finally i shut it down. useless toy. now i am planning buy Toshiba with 4G.
