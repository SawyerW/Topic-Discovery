The nexus 7 is a powerhouse I knew this when I bought it. It has a 1.2ghz tegra 3 quad-core, 1gb of ram, and up to 32gb of storage. It does have a front facing camera but to be honest I'm not a fan of that my GS3 has a better front cam and the other thing I don't like is that the memory isn't expandable, I would've liked to add a SD card but it's not an option. Those may seem like big faults that would require a lower rating but this tegra 3 quad-core is super smooth even better than my friends iPad 3 so for that alone I still give it 5 stars super awesome tablet!
