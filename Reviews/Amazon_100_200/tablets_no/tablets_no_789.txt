I would recommend this product for everyone. The controls are simple enough for even my parents to understand (lol, I love them, but they're a little slow on the technological uptake), but the functions it provides and the apps that can be added are able to provide complex operations tailored to suit any need.The battery life is amazing. I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents. I hear that there may be a way to get them, but I haven't had success thus far.All in all, a wonderful device. I love it, and would buy it again.
