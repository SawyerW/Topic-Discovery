I bought the first ZeePad for my grandson on Christmas. The second I bought for my girlfriend in the Philipines.  I hadn't sent it to her yet and my laptop's hard drive failed. I used the ZeePad to order a new hard drive online. This just happened yesterday so I am writing this review from the ZeePad. This little machine does pretty good considering the price. Yeah, they're slow from site to site and page to page...but it usually gets there. If you ever experienced the old dial-up service you've got a pretty good idea of the speed of this Tablet. Games work really well. I've uploaded several movies onto it to send to my girlfriend and they play really nicely. I installed an equalizer app and it doubled the sound quality. Music and movies sound fantastic now with even cheap headphones. I've been talking to my girlfriend in the Philippines on the chat messenger using the built in webcam. Not a bad little machine. Really glad I have it till I fix my laptop. Sorry Anamae, you'll have to wait a little longer.
