This Zeepad is a replacement for one I bought for my daughter because the first one stopped working.  In the instructions you receive it tells you not to charge it for more than four hours.  I found my 10 year old charging it more than the four hours because she forgot about it.  I told her over and over not to but heck, don't we all plug in our other devices and forget about them, or plug them in overnight with no ill effects?  Overcharging is the only thing I can figure that caused it to COMPLETELY STOP WORKING.  It worked fine for the first month and a half but of course now the return time period has expired so I am out the $75 for the Zeepad plus $15 for the cover I bought for it, and my daughter is disappointed.  Buy the tried and true, a Kindle or ITouch.  You get what you pay for I guess.
