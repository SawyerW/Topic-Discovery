This seems like a pretty nice little device if you think "e-reader" and not tablet. I've had it about a  month and have only read a couple of books using the Kindle app and have surfed the web a bit with no problems. The touchscreen takes a little getting used to. Also, the processing speed is a bit slow so when you think it is the touchscreen it is really just slowly processing your last command. For around one hundred dollars I am pretty happy with it.I've easily copied a few movies to it as well as mp3's and have been happy with both. The usb connector it came with did not work at all. When i used a different one the computer recognized it but sometimes I have to try a few times for it to recognize the device. That has probably been the worst issue I've noticed with it.
