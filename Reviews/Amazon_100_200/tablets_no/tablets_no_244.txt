I had an IPod 4G and it was amazing. I have never owned an Apple product before, I was so impressed with the touch that I sold it to upgrade to the Ipad2 could not be more happy with my decision. I use this device for browsing the web and playing appa which are amazing and second to none as far as quality and selection. I got this device at a killer price from amazon. The only remorse I have is that Apple will have a better device in a matter of months, but that is battle you will never win.
