The iPad is light, very portable and has a very crisp screen. The 3G makes it a priceless addition for anyone who travels a lot. You can pretty much turn it into a phone with the textfree program. The pro's  do not out weigh the cons for me though. You are restricted to mobile device set backs. Jailbreaking mine allowed me to get past a lot of the restrictions set by apple, but if your not tech minded, this could be a big head ache. Videos can be hard to watch online, and with no usb ports or a camera, the price tag seems a little high. The next model is rumored to have a camera and maybe a usb port. If either of those is not a big deal to you, then this iPad model is for you.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
