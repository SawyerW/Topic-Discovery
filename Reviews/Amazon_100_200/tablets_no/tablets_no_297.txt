While a very cool concept, this product is fraught with little bugs and glitches that mar the overall experience. The main issue seems to be almost entirely due to the slow processor speed and cobbled together software package.The computer runs significantly better on Windows 7, but is more prone to glitches and ominous blue screens. (Though perhaps a fresher installation of Windows 7 would fix this). Once support comes out for Windows 7 from Asus (drivers) and W7 is released, I think this can once again be a handy little machine. Though at this point it sits on my desk since I don't have the time to fix it but know it has the potential to do better.Hardware/package/look- is very good except for the slow processorSoftware- needs plenty of work to make it viable
