The i pad is a great machine with terrific versatility although the lack of multi-tasking is starting to irritate me a little. But if you are going to use it as an e-reader, be careful. The backlighting is great for reading in bed but it can, in my view, damage your eyes. I became very tired using the i pad to read both at night and during the day, and started getting  headaches ( I would typically read 50-100 pages of a paperback in one sitting). I find the kindle much better for reading and I can do so for two or three hours continuously without any fatigue The only downside is that a separate light is required to read in a dark room (for example, when you in bed).
