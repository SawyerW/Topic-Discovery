I bought this after doing a boatload of research.  I bought it to watch movies while traveling and quickly check emails.  It wasn't bad at first, just playing around with it.  Then I realized I'd need apps to play movies and they'd have to come from the App Store.  Couldn't get into the App Store without registering the product with Archos.  The Archos site wouldn't accept my serial number, so I couldn't register.  I called on the phone.  In order to speak to anyone, I needed a serial number.  It was an unrecognized serial number.  This POS was a paperweight as far as I was concerned.  Thank goodness the vendor gave me a refund.  Unless you want to waste 3 days of utter frustration followed by returning the device, don't bother with this one.
