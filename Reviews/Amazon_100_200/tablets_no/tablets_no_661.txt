Upon receiving the Ipad we had taken it out of the packaging and went to charge it.  It wouldn't charge so I had sent in a rating and note to this supplier to have them contact us or advice us of next action.  They immediately called and was completely helpful and understanding.  It turned out the ussue had nothing to do with the purchased item at all.  The ipad wouldn't charge because the outlet in the house was not working.  Thanks to this purchase....we were even able to find out that we needed to get that outlet repaired.Thank you for your immediate attention and i do apologize for any inconvenience or possible reduction to your excellent service.My intention was never meant to do that but only have you contact us to advise how we could fix this issue.Many thanks,Steven Sousa
