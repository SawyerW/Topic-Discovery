Awesome tablet! I was skeptical at first, because I've never been an apple fanboy. This is only my 2nd apple product. But needless to say, this definitely won't be my last. It will not replace my laptop/desktop for big tasks, but when I leave the house this iPad always goes with me. I got the wifi version, so no 3G experience, but the wireless signal is almost always great. I can't type quite as fast on this as I can on my laptop, but I can bring this anywhere and battery life is awesome. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about it. Awesome product, and I am typing this review on it right now.Thanks for reading. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask.
