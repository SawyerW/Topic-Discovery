This tablet may have pretty good graphics but there are a lot of faults with it to. Like both cameras really aren't that good really Apple a $400 tablet with only 0.7 mp front and back camera. Not to mention there's no micro sad card slot wich i know none of apples devices have but still they should add it in to them a lot of people wind up needing more space. And why was Siri not added in it was out before this tablet was and it was put in the iPhone 4. People who actually read this review before you buy it ur better off getting a galaxy tab 3 lite it's a lot cheaper then this. its graphics are equal if not better and it has a 2mp camera a whole lot better than this one it alson has a micro sd card slot up to 32 gigs of memory.
