There's NO WAY I'd spend $500-600 on a tablet that does NOT have ADOBE FLASH and thereby can NOT get much of the content that's on the internet.Also, being restricted to having to use ITunes for everything makes the IPad far to dependent on my laptop.The SAMSUNG GALAXY 10.1 Tablet DOES have ADOBE FLASH which gives MORE access to internet content, and it's NOT dependent on an "ITunes" type set-up for everything... Ahhh!.. FREEDOM!!The SAMSUNG GALAXY 10.1 is now the BEST most functional tablet on the market.NO THANK YOU to having NO Adobe Flash with an IPad... I've already been down that road with an IPod Touch.. It SUX!!I'm buying the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 with NO regrets!.
