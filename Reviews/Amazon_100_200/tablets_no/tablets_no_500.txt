I got my Lenovo Ideapad just a few weeks ago.  I have been bery impressed. I had doubts about the Atom processor and frankly,  I had doubts about Lenovo. I have been very impressed. The size and weight are what you would expect in a netbook,  but the "flip" and touch capability of the screen is great. It is a tablet and netbook in one. The touch interface is not quite as good as the iPad,  but the flexibility of also using it as a netbook with multiple USB slots and a full (real) keyboard, make it a great tool. I have tried the iPad and the Lenovo Ideapad beats it.
