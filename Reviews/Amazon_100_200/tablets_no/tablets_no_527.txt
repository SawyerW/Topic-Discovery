I got this tablet about a week ago. It looks very nice and works fine right out of the box. I was able to install the firmware from xda site and that worked fine too with added Android market.The only major problem IMO is the Display. It is unfortunate that the company tried to cut costs by using this cheap display, because the product itself is very good. The viewing angle in landscape mode is very narrow and that is a major problem.Other (minor) problems are:1)Pinch to zoom is not perfect.2)In my unit the system clock wouldn't synchronize with the network, not even after 3 hours being connectedto wifi with browser open(it was set to AUTO with a correct time zone selected). I set the clock later manually.I could live with all that except the lousy display. I returned it and will probably get a DELL STREAK WIFIfor $379
