I wanted an ereader when I was studying abroad so I would not have to bring a lot of books, and I was hoping to find one with a few other functions.  This is more than what I was expecting.  It is not an ipad, but it is also only a seventh of the price.  The touch screen is fine once you get used to it.  The internet is easy to connect, and the functionality of the ereader increases with the vast number of possible apps to be added.  It is very sturdy and the 7 inch screen is perfect for reading or watching videos.  I would highly recommend this reader to anyone wanting an android reader or tablet that cannot afford the $500 dollar price tags.
