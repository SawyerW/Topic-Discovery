Upon recieving the device my initial impressions were very good, especially after I got Froyo installed. However, I decided to return it to Amazon because the interface is buggy, slow, and often unresponsive. Apps will disappear, the screen will rotate but leave the icons where they are and not accept input, and it freezes 1/3 of the time disconnecting it from USB even when unmounting before removing or after choosing "Charge Only". This is also the worst typing experience I have ever had on any device. The wrong letters are often selected, even after recalibrating the touchscreen, so that cleartext typing is hard, and typing passwords is nearly impossible. On other android devices, typing is much easier. Finally, the camera does not work in "low light" (read "indoors unless under bright fluorescents") and is of poor quality in good light.
