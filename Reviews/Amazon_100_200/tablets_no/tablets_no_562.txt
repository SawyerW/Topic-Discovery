I bought this ereader to be an ereader; I had no expectations of an iPad or anything similar, but I was still EXTREMELY frustrated.1)No android app access, and the apps it does have are terrible2) S L OOOOOOOOO W. I timed it and it took over 2 minutes to load a pdf.2a) I bought it to read pdfs and they were illegible.3) Navigation is cumbersome. It's confusing and the touch screen is only selectively responsive.4)The charger isn't working properly.It's unclear to me how anyone could be happy with this product. I actually punched the screen out of frustration.Don't buy this product unless you are looking for something to drive you crazy. I am extremely disappointed and plan to return it.
