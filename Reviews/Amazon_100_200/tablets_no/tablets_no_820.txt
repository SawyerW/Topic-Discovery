This is by far my favorite toy.  It's more usesr freindly and even more helpful for almost everything I want it for, except the portability issue since theiPod touch fits in your pocket but leaving that aside, it's really mobile, you can take it with you everywhere. This product has literally helped me get over my Ex. Ipad 2 is so much more than just a lareger ipod toch instrument.  People making such claims dont seem to have used one. I agree that because applications are similar and they both share the same iOS, the experience might not seem that different, but once you get your hands on it, the bigger screen, the dual core processor, larger memory and longer battery so I like it better.
