I have 2 of these. Bought one for my wife and then couldn't stand it had to have one for me. Simply awesome. great battery life. phenomenal screen and simpply well made. there is a reason this won CNET award. even 6 months after it's release it is still hands-down the best tablet on the market.I did get some "best skins ever" for the screen. not for the protection but for the fingerprints. fingerprints on the glass can e quite annoying. We were always cleaning the glass. added the BSE and haven't looked back. touch screen is unhindered (maybe better) and no glare or fingerprints.just BUY IT
