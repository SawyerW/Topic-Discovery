My company gave me the iPad 2 to use for several months and I really liked it. The iPad made taking notes at meetings easier, for the most part how light weight they are is one of the best benefits. I did not like the camera the iPad 2 came with because they used the same camera as the iPhones which made the picture of the video real grainy... The iPad 1 and 2 are vary similar. The iPad 1 is alittle heavier and does not come with a camera while the iPad 2 has a camera, is thinner and weighs less. Really not much of a difference. The only other difference is that the iPad 1 is only updated to the 5.1.1 os while the iPad 2 can go to 6.1. I'm sure I will find a work around for that. I bought this iPad from a great seller at a great price. The iPad came in excellent condition with a $90.00 otter box! The shipping was only 3 days and was well packaged. I am vary happy with my purchase and the seller. One of the best buys. Thanks again.
