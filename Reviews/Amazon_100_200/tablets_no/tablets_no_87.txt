The manual is very small and not user friendly. Had a question so thru Amazon went to a email trying to get an answer. that was a joke. No where in any of the paperwork does it give you a manufacturer name or contact infro. so if needed for warranty, guess I will be screwed. said not to charge over 4 hrs at any given time. Do not Use while being charged. Charge holds about 2 1/2 hrs at the most. So this could be a challenge. UPDATE: I ordered 1 for me then 4 days later ordered 1 for grdkid. On 9th day mine quit, so I returned to Amazon. Other kept locking up and in 3 1/2 weeks quit. She did not save her box and it had to be returned in orig. box. Plus with No factory service infro available, I might as well roasted marshmellows with that money.
