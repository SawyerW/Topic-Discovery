I got the ipad2 for Christmas, being I'm a big kid (50) I got to open it 2 weeks ago.  I have not needed to pick the laptop up once sense I had it.  I got the Acer500 for Christmas last year and although it was nice it was very slow ever sense I did the last up date on it.  The iPad 2 is so much faster and does not loose the browsers like the Acer did. The only one era back on the iPad is it seems to me that a lot of the apps that re suppose to be free are very limited and require you to purchase something to go further in the game or to play it more than twice a day. When I used the Acer they had lot more free apps than apple does and for the most part when they are free they are not limited. I gave the Acer to my son he has lot more games to play on it than I do. Over all I love the Ipad2 mostly for its speed.
