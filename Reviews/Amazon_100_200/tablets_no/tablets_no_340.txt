I decided to get an iPad on a fluke about a year ago. Use it a lot more than I ever thought I would. Love the apps and the ability to take it with me when I travel.The downside is that I feel that I can't get a break from the computer as easily as I once did. This thing can be in any room of the house and that has its pros and cons. Have to watch to make sure I'm on it all day.I DO NOT like it for reading books. It's too heavy and it's like staring at a computer screen. An ereader is much better for books. Lighter and doesn't turn into a mirror when you use it outside.Overall, I really like my iPad.
