I really have positive feedback about this product. As a business tool this slate cannot be beat. It is nice sized, responsive, and is actually productive with a full Win 7 and then I installed a full version of Office 2010 Pro. With that software this small computer is truely able to be productive on the road. The battery life is good, not great, but sufficient for off and on use during and entire day. The touch screen is responsive and reacts well using one or multiple touch guestures. The stylist is one of the huge advantages, it allows this computer to take notes and text input almost everything. That alone is worth the extra price over the other slate and tablet computers. I would reccommend this computer to anyone who needs to not only consume information but produce some information on a limited basis. This is a pretty nice example of a very capable commputer for almost any task and think it will only get better with Windows 8.
