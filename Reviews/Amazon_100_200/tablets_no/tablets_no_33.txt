Title says it all. Very nice display. However suddenly started to behave strangely, with the image jumping around and bleedings, then stabilized in a state where half the screen is pale, lacking intensity, and also some "bleeding" in that half part. I used it occasionally in a nice and thick leather cover. It never fell on the floor. I never hit it hard. It is just very weak I guess. And the display problem, categorized as LCD internal "cracks" problem is not covered by warranty as I was told by the retailer, who asked ASUS and co. Then it would cost ~90% of the price of a new one to repair. It is the end of the story for me with tablets, android and Google. My small light portable PC is so great in comparison (though cost 6X this tablet).
