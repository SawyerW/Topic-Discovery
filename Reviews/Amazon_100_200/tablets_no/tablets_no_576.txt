I've had this for a few months as a replacement for the tried and true Palm Tungsten T3.  So why this product and not an Android phone?  I use my mobile phone as a phone - it's not for anything else.This device has a decent feel, and is easy enough to set up and use.  The only problem I had was with one of the apps, and with my personal wireless router. The problem with the app has been resolved.  I've not been able to resolve the problem wiht my personal wireless router.  That being said, I've had no problems in airports, lounges, etc getting a signal and surfing.There are some apps that will not install, though to date, very, very few.The Archos.com site has all the updates necessary, and downloading is easy.Overall, this is a nice first step for me into the 21st century - with respect to gadgets.  I works as advertised, and with the Tuff-Luv case, I'm more than satisfied.
