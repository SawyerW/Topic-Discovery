I sold my old iPad and thought I would put the proceeds towards an iPad 2, however after playing with a Xoom in person, I just couldn't go back to iOS.I've had a few iPhones, an iPad, as well as an Android phone. Android had a few advantages over iOS in the phone world (notifications being a big one), however in the tablet space, Android just feels right.  Widgets were a bit of a gimmick on a phone, but having them on a tablet is great... I can see my most recent e-mails, the song that is currently playing, my browser bookmarks, and so much more... a little configuration and everything I want to see or quickly access is right there in my face. :)I'm not going to drag this out, I just want to say that so far I'm loving my Xoom, and Honeycomb is a great step for mobile computing!
