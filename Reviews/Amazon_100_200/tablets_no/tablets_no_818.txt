Love this ipad! This is my first tablet purchase for myself, and I really love it! I'm still trying to figure out all that can be done with it, but so far have not had anything bad to say about it. It so far has exceded my expectations, in all areas except for the camera part (not great pictures)..if it didn't have it I wouldn't mind.. I didn't purchase it to use the camera.. I have a dslr for that. It's easy to use , so easy that my 2 year old grand-daughter knows exactly how it works.. :)  4 stars just because of the camera issue...
