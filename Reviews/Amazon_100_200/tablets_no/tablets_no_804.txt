The ipad is beautiful. Works perfectly, however I chose this ipad from this seller because the description said that the ipad was covered under applecare.Upon receipt, I couldn't find any applecare contract.I emailed REPEATEDLY and asked how long remained on the agreement. While they responded, they NEVER answered that question and just kept saying things like:On 8/17/12 12:10 PM, "Nimlow Electronics - Amazon Marketplace"<[e-mail address removed]> wrote:Hi, Apple only needs the serial numbers on the back of the iPad for AppleCare.-----------On 8/18/12 8:58 AM, "Nimlow Electronics - Amazon Marketplace"<[e-mail address removed]> wrote:You only need the serial number for warranty, I have gotten warranty manytimes for my macbook pro.

But No APPLECARE at all, which includes phone and in person customer support.So I just paid $79.00 for Apple Care.It's hard to do business with people that you cannot trust. Be careful with this company.
