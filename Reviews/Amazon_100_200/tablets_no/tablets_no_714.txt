This is a refurbished item and it started having problems on the same day the return window expired; the rotation feature is broken and I will have to get it fixed at my cost because I have been unable to contact the vendor. When the item arrived it didn't include any type of warranty. So I now have a one month old i-pad that doesn't work properly. I am not prepared to give a positive review and I do not appreciate the difficulty in contacting the vendor directly. This is Bargain Devices, sponsored by Amazon.UPDATEActually it turns out that all I needed to do to correct this problem is to reset the i-pad to factory standards using i-tunes; the apple people were patient and helpful and it didn't take too long.  Apparently this is a common problem but fairly easy to solve. I am now very happy with my i-pad
