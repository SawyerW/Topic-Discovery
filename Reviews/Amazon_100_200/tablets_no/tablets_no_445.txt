Apple again did a very good marketing. I saw many people rushed to buy it because they saw good reviews and they though it was cool, but not thinking as an adult whether it is really useful. I posted my review on ASUS netbook when it was out at $399, saying it worth $199. That is the price of it in 6 months. For iPad, the cost to produce is about $250. So $350 should be a reasonable price. Note that you have to pay for wireless providers. It is not even close to a laptop, for sure. Will I get one? Probably, but not at this price. Oh, I am sure Apple's CEO is happy that you pay for his dinner. He did a really good job, though. I actually likes a color digital device to read magazines/books, but not that small. I bet either Apple, or other company, will release a better device at the size of a real magazine soon.
