Product was suppose to be new.  Took it out of the box and noticed it didn't really look right.  Didn't feel clean like a new ipad should feel. Looked on the back to see faint scratches.  This was def. not new!.  I looked at my order history to see if I made a mistake in ordering a used verses new one.. but I did not. In print right there the seller states the devices is NEW.Then really looked at back of ipad and saw that it said , 'DEMO NOT INTENDED FOR SALE'Wow, this thing was a floor model at some Apple store.When I contacted the seller he said he'd take $100 off !  What a joke!
