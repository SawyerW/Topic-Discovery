I love this tablet, I've had it for about 2 days only so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that this will not be a review as such given the fact that there are a number of excellent reviews already here (i.e. Sidroy and D.L.C users).So far the tablet has stood up to everything I threw up at it and laughed it off. I have installed the Flash (version 11.1.115.12) and coupled it with the Mozilla Firefox Mobile v.17.0.1 and it seems to be working flawlessly. Also I am running the latest version of Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean) without any issues (not that any were expected).Anyhow all in all if you're thinking of getting yourself (or someone else for that matter) a 7 inch tablet you should by all means get the Asus Google Nexus 7.For actual reviews visit:Sidroy's excellent review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUOLVBTVKIPE/D.L.C.'s review (another great review): http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPE6S6DPRB7C/
