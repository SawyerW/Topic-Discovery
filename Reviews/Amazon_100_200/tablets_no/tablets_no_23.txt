I honestly recommend this tablet to anyone.PROS:- It's fairly easy to use.- It looks and feels great on your hands.- I personally love the fact that it is in the 7 inches form factor.- The back has some sort of texture that adds a sufficient amount of grip to the device.- Runs pretty fast and has astonishing graphics.CONS:- You have to manually add VPNs for abroad use.- No default tethering option.- No cellphone (unlike most samsung tablets).- No whatsapp - like apps.All the cons have some ways around them, but you are required some technical knowledge. Most of the stuff can be found on xda forums though.
