Well, just came home and found that the ipad 2 I ordered arrived today. It arrived sooner than I expected  and I am very happy for that. I opened the package and found the ipad 2 in great condition and it even had the original box.  I was delighted to see that it came with a charger as well. It seemed that some of the ipads did not come with a charger or even a box. It came with new glass and they even updated the software to the 7.0.3 os. I was expecting to have to update myself. They even gave me a brand new magnetic cover for it.  I'm very happy with the seller and will buy from them again.
