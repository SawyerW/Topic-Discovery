I was surfing the web looking to book my summer vacation.  But it was next to impossible given the restriction of Apple to use only their software and applications.  I was looking at Florida beach resorts, but when I went to download their programs, say to look at the facilities or availability I would get a message that "Apple does not allow the use this software on this device".  I guess as a life long PC user I found everything about the Apple system counter intuitive and difficult to use.  Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks!  So maybe it is just me.  But the little things like the autofill that I found difficult to use.  When I was filling out forms it would change my lower case email address to upper case at the most inopportune times.  I found the IPad lightweight and compact enough to carry around.  It worked really well for email, and fairly well for shopping online, until I was looking for vacation spots (see above).  I am sure it would make great sense if you were brought up on Apple products but I was sorry I did not get a laptop!
