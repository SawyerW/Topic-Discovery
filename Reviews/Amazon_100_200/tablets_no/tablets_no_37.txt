I ordered a Kindle, a Nexus and the Samsung Tab 2 for Christmas for my kids ages 22 and 24. I figured they could try all three and whichever they chose I would order a second one.  Well, they had great things to say about all of them , but by far the  Asus Nexus did everything they needed.  The storage is great,  as well as the speed  and graphics .They are both die-hard Android users.  The only tablet that came close  was the Kindle but the user interface on top of the Android OS made it difficult for them to navigate..... Since we did a product comparison , I can truly state the Nexus was the best!!!
