I purchased a refurbished (IPad first generation) as a Christmas gift for my grand daughter ,I received it on Nov, 12/2013. On receiving it I charged it enough to see that it powder on, andIt looked ready for set-up. So I wrapped it; ready for Christmas right?On Christmas day when we started the set-up the lower (half inch) of the screen didn't respond to the touch,So we were unable to complete the set-up process;I contacted seller, they said, (Sorry but it's past the "30 day" return policy;)So please ... make sure your items are in "complete functioning" order!!I only wish mine; was as described........ It would have saved  alot of heart ache!
