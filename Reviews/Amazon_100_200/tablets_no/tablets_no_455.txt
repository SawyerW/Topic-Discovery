I really tried to like this little tablet as I purchased four of them for myself and my children.  It had an incomplete and very basic owner manual and customer service was unhelpful and untrained.  The most frustrating thing is that if you want to download something, you are not able to download something like "updated firmware" or the "AppsLib" applications from the device itself.  You must first download and save them to your computer, then drag and drop into your plugged-in device.I maybe could have lived with this, BUT not if they are having server issues, which apparently is quite a lot.  I spent hours trying to get this device up and running.This is a very flawed product and I do not recommend it to anyone.
