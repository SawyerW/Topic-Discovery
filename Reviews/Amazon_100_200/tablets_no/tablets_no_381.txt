For everything I do on the web--this is the right device for me. It is beautifully crafted and exceeds all expectations of what a powerful portable should be.At times I think it can be a bit faster and the Cellular could be a lot more robust. But in the end, I would highly recommend this device instead of a laptop ifyou browse the web, listen to music, watch videos, do email and play games. I would like to try this with a regular keyboard one day. It IS magic---and it ishundreds of times superior to an iTouch (which I love too).  And as I get older, I appreciate the crisp screens, the vivid colors, and wonderful portability of this device.It is a WOW if I ever saw one!
