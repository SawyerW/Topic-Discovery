The is an unbelievable tablet/PC for the price. It was a gift for my granddaughter who just turned 6. She loves the fact that she has her own computer.I tested and set it up for her before I gave it to her. I must say that as an iPad 2 user I was a little jealous of some of the features it has being a PC also. I love that she can call me on Face Time since I have trouble understanding her little girl voice on the phone. Somehow I can understand a little easier on Face Time.Goodios's service was very good. I received the tablet quickly and it was well-packaged.Thank you!
