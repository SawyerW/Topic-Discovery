In November, I purchased the iPad Mini, which, was my first iPad.  I was thrilled to death to have it, and after a few months, I knew that I wanted a larger screen and more GB, so, I spent time trying to find out whether or not I wanted to spend for the iPad 4.  After some thought, I decided to get an iPad 2, since the mini and this one were built the same.  I am not disappointed.  As soon as I added the upgrade, I was able to use Siri, even on the iPad 2.  I personally can't tell the difference between Retina display or not, so, I am pleased with this purchase.  You can't go wrong.
