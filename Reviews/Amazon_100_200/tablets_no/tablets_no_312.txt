I've had a couple of weeks to sit down with this netbook, and find it to be quite wonderful all-around.  The big selling points include the touchscreen, which works like a charm.  I didn't expect it to scroll so smoothly.  My version has the 2G of RAM.  I'm sure this helps.  It's a joy to use.  The other great aspect is the keyboard, which is full sized.  The ability to toggle between keyboard and touchscreen is terrific.There are a few minor drawbacks.  First, the speakers are probably the smallest and tinniest of anything I've ever heard.  The netbook is just barely usable in terms of speakerphone/skype applications without external speakers.  Also, while the keyboard is very nice, there's an initial give to the keys that makes them a bit noisier than usual.  Finally, at least on my model, the accelerometer is a bit off so that it doesn't switch orientations at the midline.  Some directions need more tilt than others.Aside from these misgivings, I'm perfectly satisfied with this netbook.  It's small, but I have no problem using it for all of my work.  I really like reading pdf's with it and browsing news sites.  Very comfortable.
