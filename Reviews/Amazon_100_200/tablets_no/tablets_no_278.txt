My first iPad. Sad it could not be made in USA. The first one malfunctioned in less than 4 hours (sticky home button). Seller was very helpful and offered an exchange. Apple store wanted to give me a refurbished one right away. I purchased AppleCare extended warranty and support and Apple express shipped a replacement. YOU MUST BUY APPLECARE FOR THIS, so increase your purchase price by $80. The iPad is light and fast, has good battery life.CONS does not do Flash, hey Apple, GET OVER IT! I cannot find a browser yet that supports ActiveX and emulates IE so I cannot remote to my work desktop.Overall, a very light, fast and fun $900 TOY, not for serious productive work.  Such a pity.
