This is a great device for browsing the web (non flash pages of course), emailing, listening to music, playing games, watching movies, etc. This is not intended to replace a desktop or laptop. I personally have an iMac and iPhone and needed something in between without spending $1000 on a macbook. For $500 i have a device i can travel with and use for all of the above functions quickly with ease. Ive had an iPhone from the very beggining and one thing i can say for certain is that apple will always push out updates to improve their products. rumors of the next update promise a printing feature (which you can do now with an app) as well as folders to stay organized :) can't wait! Bottom line, it is what it claims to be.
