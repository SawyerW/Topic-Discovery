Total POS, plain and simple. went through 2 of them, neither one would connect to my home router. So I brought it to Barnes&Nobles;, Starbucks, etc to see if could get the WiFi to connect, didn't happen. Overall the interface was very slowand unimpressive for an Android OS. I own a Droid Incredible and love it, but this reader's OS needs help.I tried giving it the benefit of a doubt and make it work because I thought it could be a great reader with it's ability to read across many platforms, memory upgradeable and was a color reader for a modest price.Ended up buying the color Nook for the wife and she loves it, works flawlessly so far and connected to my home network in minutes. Kudos to Amazon for their handling of this matter so quickly and efficiently!!!
