I was hoping this would be able to stand alone as a computer should, more so as a portable device. I was hoping not to need another device to bring along to my Acer netbook. it was on a recent trip to Puerto Rico that I was able to compare the two.In terms of reliability, as a travel computer, the netbook wins. My hotel, Sheraton, only uses wired connection (Ipad was pretty much useless). Also, web pages load differently in the Ipad and I'm always wondering if I'm missing information I would have seen on my PC. Videos are always hit or miss. Imagine pulling up a video and 50% of the time it won't work.However, the things that it does do, it does well. it shows pictures remarkably well. it has much more decent battery life than my netbook and it shows web pages (those that it can handle) easier for me.On my next trip however, the netbook will be my companion and the IPAD stays home.
