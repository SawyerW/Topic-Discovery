The tablet exceeded my expectations except that I couldn't get it to syc with my Mac computer. I even downloaded Mac Android File Transfer but that didn't do the job. Fortunately I have a PC to do my Transfers with. Another way to put stuff onto the Nexus is to email the files to yourself and the download the the files to your your device. My Jpegs and Mp3's are the main thing I bought the Tablet for. The screen resolution could be a little better but that's not that important. I'll  be hanging on to my Nexus for the next few years for sure.
