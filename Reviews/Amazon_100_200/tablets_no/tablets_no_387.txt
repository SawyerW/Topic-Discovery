I purchased the 1st gen iPad a few months after it was released back in 2010.  My oldest has been using it for 1st grade.  I decided to purchase another 1st gen a month ago for our youngest who will be starting Kindergarten.  I could have purchased a 3rd or 4th gen model, but I wanted to save money.  Besides, the graphics and display and processing speed are plenty fine for a 5 yr old and his learning/education apps.  AND most importantly, I didn't want my two sons fighting over which iPad was better....no reason to cause a unnecessary fight over something so expensive.  The only real hurdle was still finding some of the 1st cases in stock somewhere.  I'm a little bias to the Sensa leather zipper case.  It came in red and black.  It's easy for my boys to use and it has a snap kickstand.  Also the leather case has some padding to it to help protect the iPad.
