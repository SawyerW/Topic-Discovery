I bought this unit hoping for a gadget that has the interface of a Droid phone and got something far less. It looks like the interface of a droid phone but the similarities stop there. The touch is is nowhere comparable to the droid. Basically I thought I was buying a Droid without the phone. Now, this is probably an oversight on my part. It does do the things it is supposed to do quite well. I just wish the touch screen was a ton better. It has a very large, nice screen and it looks stunning and great. The battery seems to be doing fine. I have yet to re charge it after the initial charge, but I have not used is frequent enough to belittle the battery life.Overall not a bad gadget. Need better or improved touch screen technology.
