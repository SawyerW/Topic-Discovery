MS had a tablet in the early part of the 21st century and I really wanted to like it, but even after years of work it was unusable. When I first used the iPad at the Apple store I realized this was what I wanted. Simple, elegant, easy to use, and the battery life is amazing.I know most MS fanboys will tell you to wait for the new windows version, the problem is they were ahead of this market for years and still its unfit for my needs ( besides simply web browsing a light device to take notes, run spreadsheets and do email on, lightweight is the key here) I think at this price it is an easy decision to buy ( I work for a living so I actually have some disposable income to spend on decent products, price ISNT everything, but this being one of the cheapest options so far helps)And I didn't realize it when I bought it but the ereader options are great. I may never buy another physical book again. Kindle for the iPad, iBooks, and BandN work really well.
