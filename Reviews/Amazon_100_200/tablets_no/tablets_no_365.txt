I could not ask for any better service! When you buy something online from a person you don't know, it always makes one uneasy. Do not worry about doing business with this guy, he is very honest. He was very concerned I got my ipad on time. Do not hesitate to buy anything from Matthew. He emailed during the whole process to let me know when my ipad would get to me.It got to me exactly when he said it would. I was very comfortable working with him. I only wish all sellers were this easy to work with. The product I ordered was in the exact shape he said it would be in. Very easy to work with. Best experience I ever had on Amazon.com 3rd party...
