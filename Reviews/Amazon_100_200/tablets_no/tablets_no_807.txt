Ive had my Ipad2 for 3 weeks now and found that i cant put it down. I aldready have the Iphone 4 and the Ipod touch 16 gig model. What i love about apple is the inner connectivity between all 3 products. Icloud hasnt been a disappointment and love all the great apps. Its very customizable to fit all your needs and has really improved my daily living. though id like to have gotten the higher storage model for the storage but the price is very high. The cameras are great and takes great pictures. resolution for gaming is great and video chat has worked well with staying in contact with family and friends. the Ipad is a great size and very convienant to carry. i used to carry a large laptop everywhere. it was very heavy and alot to set up. This has made life alot easier and travel alot more plesant. Ive been very happy with apple products and look forward to the future and thier new systems
