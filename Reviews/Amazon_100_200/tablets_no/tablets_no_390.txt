I can truly say that out of all the devices I've owned, this is the COOLEST!  I am absolutely in love with the iPad. I do all my readings on it since I got it. I read books, pdfs, documents.. etc. The gaming experience is MUCH better than iphones and ipod touches. I use it a lot so sometimes I get into a state of "ergonomical fail" (if that's a word) and it could get heavy on my hands and it hurts a bit. But other than that I am absolutely fine with the product I think it's sleek and advanced. You could do a lot with it and it's much more practical that a laptop, given it's weight. I once used it as a GPS for an hour and a half drive -WiFi model. So you could do a lot of serious work with it. Hands down, the coolest device I've ever owned!!!.oO..If only it had the iphone 4 camera and facetime, ohhh it would be heaven!..Oo.
