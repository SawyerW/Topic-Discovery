If all you're interested in is a color reader, this device may be ok. Otherwise, do not waste your money.I was hoping to read PDF files on the Cruz, but it does not handle PDFs well at all.All else (browsing, Youtube, even setting the time, music playback) are all substandard.I wasn't expecting an iPad when I got this device, but it amazes me that companies spend resources on these devices and then come way short. Are these even tested?? I have the sense the management is anxious to get the device out of the door and to the market hastily, and thereby they shoot themselves in the foot! It is a shame.
