After 21 months my Fujitsu U820's hard drive quit.  I replaced it after Fujitsu Tech Support told me the error message I got meant the hard drive was no good.  I then attempted to restore it's Windows 7 Operating System with the restore discs I purchased from Fujitsu.  The Vista Restore disc worked, but when I went to use the Windows 7 disc, it told me that it was not for the U820.  After reapeatedly calling Fujitsu support and them trying to send me to third party companies, they admitted that they had no resore discs for Windows 7 (even though they include one in the set I bought) and they wouldn't help me any further.  Be wary of buying this unit, it's hard drive might give out early and all you get from Fujitsu is a runaround trying to restore the machine.
