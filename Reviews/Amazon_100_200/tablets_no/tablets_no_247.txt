After nearly 6 months of everyday use, I love this device. It still isn't a full-fledged replacement for a computer, but it's close. iOS 5 is a great step toward that kind of functionality and further improves a product I already loved. I use it for classes, entertainment, work, and as an interactive toy for my 2 year-old son. He LOVES the Sandra Boynton apps and is confused by the physical book versions since the characters don't move like they do on the iPad 2.This was a great purchase for me and my family that we will enjoy for years to come.
