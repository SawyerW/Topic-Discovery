I have always owned Windows operating PC's so this IPad 2 is a whole new experience for me.  I am venturing along with it & am now fairly comfortable with using it for basics.  I purchased it because it was available with Verizon  which I think will be a great way for me to use a computer when I travel without the need to seek a hotspot, somewhere.  I doubt that I will use it or any computer to run my life with but browsing, e mail & reading books on it is great.I bought the IPad 2 rather than the newer model as my needs do not justify the additional cost just to have the latest model.
