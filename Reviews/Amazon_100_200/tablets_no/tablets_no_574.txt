I upgraded from the Archos 32 with a little hesitation because some of the reviews I've seen say the screen on the 43 isn't as good.Maybe it varies with each device, but that was wrong in my case.  The 43 beats my 32 hands down.  The screen is bright, hi-res and looks FANTASTIC.  The SD slot is a great addition.  I also love being able to plug in a USB keyboard for writing emails/documents--this makes it my new travel computer.If there's a downside vs. the 32, it's appearance. The 32 was very classy looking, tough, compact and metal all around. The 43 is plastic with a weird, super thin metallic piece on the back. It seems sturdy enough, but it has a cheap feel to it.  But aside from appearance, the 43 is easily worth the price bump from the 32.Feature for feature, this device also  beats the similarly priced iPod touch on every point except for the resistive vs. capacitive screen.  For me, it's no big deal to just tap a resistive screen, and multi-touch is just not a big deal.  If it's a big deal to you, get an iPod.
