This iPad 2 is my first tablet. I got 64g wifi + AT&T; 3G in white. I plan to use wifi only and add 3G at times I think I might need it.The iPad2 comes with some fantastic apps. and many, many others are available at the App Store. Lots are free!!!In my case the advertisements about using the iPad2 "right out of the box without the need for a computer," were wrong as I had to set mine up using iTunes on my computer!The browser is fast and no waiting for pages to load. . . with a full signal that is.  The weaker the signal on wi-fi, the slower the load but I guess that's to be expected. Dropping even one bar makes a huge difference. Also it's not compatable with Flash which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.I love the portability, the design and mostly everything about my iPad2. But it IS costly so if you need the functionality of a laptop, this will not be a replacement. But if you just surf the web, check your e-mail and play games you'll love it!
