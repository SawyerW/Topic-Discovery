I can't find anything wrong with Ipad2.  I don't even know why anyone would want Ipad 3 or 4.  If your eyes aren't what they once were then don't make the mistake of getting a smaller tablet.  This one is perfect.  Not heavy.  Not thick. Best Apps you can find.  I hardly ever use a computer anymore.  Now idiots writing virus programs for Windows operating systems doesn't matter.  My Kindle Fire books load into this via a terrific App and I can read them with comfort.  I can watch movies on it although I rarely do since TV technology lets me do that on a 55 inch screen.  But you "can" send video from the Ipad via an "air video" capability and view it on the big TV.  World Camera Apps let you see the world live on mounted video cameras.  Watch it snow up north while basking in 70 degree warmth in the south.  Cool.  Push a button and see the total of all your investments and bank accounts.  any time.  That's the MINT App.  Just save up and get the thing.  Great technology.  Gotta love it.  I use it every day.
