I really don't like technology for the sake of technology, and anything I buy I want it to have a specific purpose. I bought this IPAD for a specific reason, and following it's use for that purpose, I am trying to figure out what else this thing can do, and what it is good for. Sadly, the only thing I have found so far that made me smile was when I got to watch Family Guy on HULU while stuck in the Las Vegas Airport. So, all in all, I am unimpressed. Outside of the "cool" factor, I really don't understand the flurry of excitement over this technology. Service from Amazon was amazing and hopefully I will get something to use this for. If not, I guess I will give it to my daughter for use at her school that is now issuing them to students.
