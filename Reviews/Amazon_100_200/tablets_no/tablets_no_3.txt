I really enjoyed this tablet when I first purchased it.. It had the newer Android system, a sharp screen, and enough memory to last for awhile.. Unfortunately "awhile," was 1 year and 3 days. I opened up my case and saw a crack right down the tablet screen. I did some research and found out that this is a major defect in the product.. both the this one, and the newer one. You can Google it and read all the horror stories of people with the cracked screen, for no reason at all. To make matters worse, Nexus does not warranty the cracked screen. If you still insist on purchasing the product, I highly suggest that you purchase  a warranty plan... I'm now researching out other tablets...
