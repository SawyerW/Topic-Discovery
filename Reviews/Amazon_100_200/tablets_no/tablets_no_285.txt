I got my iPad2 last weekend. I had ordered one from apple.com. I had to wait for close to 4 weeks. I didn't have an iPad before. It felt heavy for me to hold with one hand as an e-book reader(which was my primary motivation). After using the iPhone4(and a very happy user, I must say) with retina display, I found the display not very crisp and somewhat underwhelming.Some of the iphone apps have different look and feel on the iPad2, gmail for instance. Overall, I was satisfied, till yesterday.It fell from 2 feet from my son's hand on to the concrete garage floor, and the glass shattered. the Ipad2 works fine, it has a cracked screen. The touch functionality works, even over the cracked screen(an engineering marvel!)I called apple support today, and they want $269 to replace the screen, that is more than 50 percent of the product.  An outrageous amount! Now I am stuck with this magical device!How can they design such a fragile portable computer. Get some industrial grade aluminum with a cushion for the front. This glassware is no iPhone. Handle with extreme care!
