i just bought this ipad 2 on the may 19th  and i got on the 22nd i recieved it fast and i am very pleased with this it and it is a 32 gb and the price was 314.00 that was a great price and i got it just in time because i got the last one but i only paid 300.00 because of the money i had saved on my account and bought some cases and other items with the money on my account it said used but it only had 3 marks on it 1 on the screen and 2 on the back it was like new to me just for 3 marks thats nothing and coming from a andorid tablet to an ipad it feels amazing and i love it... once again i paid 300.00  but the price was 314.00 for a ipad 2 32gb used.  AMAZING AND WONDERFUL....
