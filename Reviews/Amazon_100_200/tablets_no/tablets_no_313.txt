I had this netbook/touch screen for about month now. I like using the netbook for pc apps. The touch screen part takes some time to get use to. Over all I like it. Pros: 10 inch screen, white keyboard-touch pad (easy on the eyes), good battery life for its size, solid feel, nice touch screen function, comes with good software utilities, and it is light weight. Cons: fan is a bit loud when it kicks on, buttons on screen are easy to hit by accident, battery extends out from the back of the unit, Windows starter (need to get the Win7 upgrade $70), and needs memory upgrade.
