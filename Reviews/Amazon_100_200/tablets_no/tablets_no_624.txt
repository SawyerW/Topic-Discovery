I was impressed as to how quickly my Xoom arrived, but I wasn't impressed as to the quality. I did buy a refurbished one but it stated like new... when I got it, it did look new I will hand them that but it was not the American version and did not update as quickly as the American version. Also after only about a week of owning it, it froze up completely and would not even turn off. I was very upset needless to say. I did return it and they did refund my money entirely so they did what they could. I do think they should've paid the return shipping though since it was not my fault that the product was malfunctioning...
