I received the 10 inch Kindle Fire HD for Christmas but never liked the platform so I exchanged it for the Nexus 7 and I've never regretted it. Oh sure, I can't stream Amazon Prime Movies like I could on the Kindle and I don't have Dolby Stereo but I can at least use Google Earth and a bunch of other apps that wouldn't work on the kindle fire hd.  The nexus is easier to use, more intuitive and I just like the presentation of the apps better with the small symbols rather than the enlarged kindergarten style of the 10 inch kindle fire HD.  the 7 inch size of the Nexus is more portable than the 10 inch  kindle and I can still see and read everything with ease.  The price is a definite plus compared to the iPad mini.  So what's NOT to like about the nexus 7?  I haven't found it yet.
