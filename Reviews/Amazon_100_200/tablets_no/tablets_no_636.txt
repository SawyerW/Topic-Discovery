(Ipad 2 32gb wifi no 3G) Not much new here, the hype is right these are fantastic devices. I purchased to see if I could replace my laptop with the ipad for the things I most often do with the laptop (email & surfing)I just got the wifi version since I did not want another $20-30 month for a data plan for the Ipad, and besides everywhere I go I seem to have wifi access (home, hotels, coffee shops,etc..)  All initial aspects worked perfect, easy to set up email, networks, bluetooth.  battery life seems to be good and there are many free and low cost apps to make even more use of the ipad in work related functions.  There is a nice app for working with things like MS Word or Excel documents.  Its nothing short of amazing.  The only thing needed is they should add a SD card slot to the unit or a regular usb port.  I would just like an easer way to exchange data/pictures & other things.
