What can I say?the iPad is clearly the best in Tablets, and this is Generation 2 So it's just Amazing!I'll skip talking about the device and it facilities, cuz it's everywhereabout the seller and shipping, actually first I was a little bit afraid of ordering from a seller, because all my previous orders were from / fullfilled by Amazonbut eery thing went very smooth and easy, i Think processing took less than a day, and it was shipped and i got it in my mail box after 4 or 5 days (including weekends)I'm an International customer, I got it shippied from Seller to my Aramex Shop and Ship Box then Aramex sent it to me in Bahrainit arrived safe, brand now as it is from the factory, packaging was ExcellentIf I needed to order any similar thing, I will sure buy it again from Stoobie if it's offered by themThank You
