I received my new iPad this past week and have been exploring the capabilities. I have to agree that the iPad is a very impressive device. I've only used my iPad with my home wireless network, but I anticipate that will I use it for casual browsing and reading more than my laptop. For more detailed browsing, correspondence, etc., the iPad is not really a practical alternative to the laptop. The iPad is well suited for the social networking functions with some nice apps for accessing Facebook, Twitter, etc. For those who are considering purchasing an iPad, I recommend it for entertainment use though it is not an essential product for the average computer user.
