I am posting this from my elocity a7 tablet. I will admit I bought one most out of curiosity, but now that I have I feel like I can't live without it.Thing to know before you buy it:1. put the dexter firmware on it... it will give you access to the android market  and gooogle applications. the original firmware is ok, but dexter's will givee you the full android experience.2. no true multi- touch which means the screen can only sense one tap at a time (at least with dexter's firmware)... this limitation has only in part affected my ability to play some games like emulators, which still possible using the control buttons: search and back. Plus, I don't like mobile type of games other than Angry birds which plays fine.3.  Get a microSD w/ a SD adapter so you can upgrade your firmware.Overall, for the price, the performance anb IO connector options... this a great device... very very happy with the purchase.
