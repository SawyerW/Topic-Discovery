I WAS LOOKING FOR AN I PAD FOR MY 12 YEAR OLD GRANDSON WHO IS MILDLY AUTISTIC.  I PICKED A 1ST GENERATION BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO BE USING AT SCHOOL AND HE LOVES TAKING PICTURES WAY TO MUCH TO FOR HIM TO BRING AN I PAD W/CAMERA TO SCHOOL.  IT WAS LISITED AS LIKE NEW CONDITION, RESONABLE PRICE AND FREE SHOPPING.  I RECEIVED IT WITHIN 7 DAYS AND BOY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD JUST COME OUT OF THE BOX.  ONE SCRUB MARK ON THE BACK, SO FAR IT WORKS GREAT.  THERE IS ONE BUT,  IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND A CASE (OTTERCASE AND SCREEN PRTECTOR) FOR A 1ST GEN.  I GUESS THEY DON'T MAKE THEM ANY MORE.  THAT IS THE DOWN SIDE TO MY PURCHASE, MY WORK WAS NOT DONE, I HAD TO GO ON TO EBAY AND BID TO GET ONE $91.00 AND IT'S USED.  MY GRANDSON LOVES IT THAT IS WHAT COUNTS, HE GETS TO LEARN WITH IT AND PLAY GAMES AS A REWARD.  THANK YOU AMAZON.
