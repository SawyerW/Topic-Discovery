I must admit when it comes to purchasing "used" products it can be a scary process.  You don't know if the seller is "inflating" the qualities of the product and the product really is a peice of trash.  Well I can honestly say that isn't the case with this ipad 2 that I purchased from this seller.  This ipad 2 has been great so far, and I am totally pleased with it.  I would definitely buy other items in the future from this seller.  In fact, it is almost impossible to tell that this ipad 2 was not brand new to begin with.  I hope who ever is reading this and is thinking about taking a chance of buying anything from this seller to go for it...I know you won't be disappointed! :D
