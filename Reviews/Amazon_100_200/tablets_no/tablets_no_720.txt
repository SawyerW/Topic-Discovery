I'm a true Amazon.com fan-boy. Get as much as I can from Amazon.com, including by much-loved breakfast cereal (Mother's Oat Brand). Request at all Christmas Gifts, Father's Day Gifts, and Birthday Gifts be Amazon.com gift cards. My oldest son talked me into an iPad instead of a Kindle, so I took the leak. Much to my dismay, Amazon.com was (and continues) to charge a premium over the going price, so I went elsewhere for my purchase. Got my case from Amazon.com, and will get any other accessories the same way.Day-by-day I discover new delights (watched my first movie using WiFi and the iPad last night ... cool experience, especially with stereo headphones).  Highly recommended!
