First let me begin by saying this a good, but not great product. What it has done though is show me how I would use a tablet device and what features I would like or not like in a device, all without me feeling buyers remorse for what i paid.Positive Attributes:-Fairly Clean Standard Android User Interface-Just Right Sized, Not Too Big, Not Too Small-Great Battery Life Around 7+ Hours Surfing with WiFi-Great Sound through Headphone Jack-Plays Ripped DVDs Flawlessly-Loads of Free Games for download around the internetNegative Attributes:-Somewhat Flakey Resitive Screen-Builtin Speakers Sound Terrible-A few Bugs that crop up every so often and require poking the reset button.Overall I am really enjoying this tablet and think it will hold me over till the next generation of tablets make it to market. I mainly use it for general web surfing, basic games (not 3d), music listening/pandora at home and on the run and for these purposes it serves me well.
