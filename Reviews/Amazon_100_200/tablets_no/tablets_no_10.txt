Since I bought the Nexus 7, there have been two Android updates, first 4.3, and then 4.4.  Every time there is an update, the auto rotation will stop working, and then there are suggestions you reset the device. Even that does not always help. Apps also crashes.  I have the minimum number of apps installed.  This is the worst experience I ever had with a device.  If you have to loss data all the time due to it the updates and you have to uninstall or reset your device, then it does not even qualify as a toy.  Not sure what the problem is, and google would never give you an answer.  What a shame!
