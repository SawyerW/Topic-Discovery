I experienced the same troubles with this computer as other people. First of all, this computer generates too much heat enough not to touch the back side of it. Second, WIFI went out about a year later. Third,monitor screen did malfunction a year and half later. Fourth, hard drive didn't spin. That crappy computer was finally dead when the motherboard burnt out. Total money I spent to fix the sequential problems was ~$200. I am neither spending money for it any more nor buying any product from HP now and forever. HP might earn money of $1200 from me with that crappy computer, but HP lost a costumer's confidence. HP lost buying potentials which would be more than $1200. Still HP is not admitting their fault. I abhor HP's business ethics.
