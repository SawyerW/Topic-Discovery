This iPAD makes a giant leap in ease of use, simplicity, speed, entertainment, battery life, functionality, instantaneous on/off, screen, ergonomics (sits on tummy in bed), reliability, durability, productivity...I've explored the world through Utube and Google Earth, learned about everything I want to know about, joined Facebook, bought real estate (killer deal), kept up on email, Fixed my boat, mind mapped our strategies, enjoyed addicting games, read the Bible, watched great movies on long trips, use it as control panel for Netflix, use the global clock for planning trips, puts me to sleep, wakes me up, makes me $ in investments, slide shows, a compass for positioning HD antenna, etc. And most apps were free.Only issues are my home network occasionally bogs down, I get less sleep, and my eyes can get tired.My favorite non-transportation device product of all time.
