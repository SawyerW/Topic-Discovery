I agree that this is a fantastic device and a great buy BUT. Unfortunately the Nook HD and HD+ charger/cable has a tendency to fail. Mine is 6 months old and intermittently just won't charge. The company (Barnes and Noble) has been out of stock of chargers for months - web site and their stores both.  This is the wide (30-pin) USB that looks like an iPHone plug but isn't. It's apparently only used by BN because nobody else makes anything that fits.I was astounded at the dismal level of customer service in which they won't (or can't) give a clear answer about when or if it they will replace the charger - it looks like I will have to have the entire device replaced under warranty - only because they have been so resistant to replacing the charger.  Conflicting answers from their customer service and help staff. They obviously don't have their act together.Also interesting: it's not possible to review Nook devices on the Barnes and Noble website - no review options that, possibly because of complaint related to the issues with their chargers. This suggests to me that the problem is widespread.  So I would be careful!
