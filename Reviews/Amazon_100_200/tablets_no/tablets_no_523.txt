This tablet is amazing. It is super fast and can run almost any app. It also already has an amazing support community at [...] that is releasing custom roms for this unit that give it Google Market access. (A rom is the software that runs the tablet.) Flash on websites runs extremely well and I have not found any flash that would not work. I gave it 4 stars because there is not much out in the way of accessories, however the unit was only released in the middle of December so given a little time I am sure we will see a Bluetooth keyboard, a case, and a dock for charging and transferring files.
