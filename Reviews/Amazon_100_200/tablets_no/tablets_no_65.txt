I own an ipad, a windows phone and a netbook and this fills in the gaps between them all, the ipad's great for around the house and the window's phone is my music player and gps but to play games and watch movies on the go the Nexus 7 is perfect. The app store offers a lineup that's comparable to the Apple and is light years ahead of the windows phone app store. I was trying to find one tablet or phone that fit all my needs but I guess that wasn't going to happen, the Nexus 7 fills in a lot of the blanks.
