I wish I could give this guy more than 5 stars! I chose this seller because of his reviews and they were spot on.Because I did not read the entire listing I didn't receive the item I thought I had ordered. This fellow was incredibly prompt in responding to my questions, remained professional, curteous and helpful even though the mistake was mine. He would have been within his rights to give me a hard time about MY mistake, but he didn't. He apologized for my confusion, graciously accepted my return and refunded the shipping both ways! I recommend him very highly and would be happy to do business with him again. A standup guy!
