I wanted to love this - perfect size, accepts additional micro-SD cards, android system - but it simply doesn't work.  Or at least my copy of it didn't work.  Froze during the intial setup, screen was non-responsive and typing was nearly impossible with my finger.  Yes, I could probably use a stylus, but with a "touch" screen why should I have to?  The apps store wouldn't work - couldn't connect to the server.  Apparently a long running problem.  And I tried updating the firmware, but after a half hour of nothing happening, gave up and boxed it up for return.  Scrolling also didn't work well if at all - usually random apps or windows would open instead.  Very frustrating and totally unusable as far as I'm concerned.  For $30 more I can get twice the memory, a capacitive screen and a device that works - along with countless apps....  not a hard decision.  I just feel stupid for even trying this now
