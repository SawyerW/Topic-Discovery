This is the only product in eight years of using Amazon I have returned simply because of how bad it was. Amazon was prompt with my refund and did an excellent job of customer service. The Micro Cruz Reader R101 however, as a product, is unusable. I had plans of only using it for eBooks, but the screen required me to press so hard my fingers popped. After a day of use I had rubbed a blister on my index finger. When it would respond, it was sluggish, and the battery life was atrocious (a maximum of 1.5 hours of use compared to a Kindle 3G which has a MONTH of battery life with use). Now that the Kindle 3G is the same price as this item, with special offers, I recommend skipping this slow clunky pretender and buy the real deal. If you're wanting an tablet primarily for eBooks, or anything really, this is not the item you're looking for.
