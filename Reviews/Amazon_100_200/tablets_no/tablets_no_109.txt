I purchased this used laptop for a bit over $200 bucks.  I wasn't expecting much. My Motion Tablet died and I needed a replacement. I had purchased the newest cutting edge Asus tablet and was sadly disappointed.  This was a "what the hell" purchase and I am DELIGHTED!!  The laptop is in excellent condition and what's more it does everything I wanted! Even though it uses Windows XP, I can surf and shop and chat and write letters and balance the checkbook.  The pen and keyboard are both easy to use and in great shape. But there is more!I am a frustrated fan of MusicMatch and I wanted to be able to use that program to play my music But it only works with Windows XP.  Since this laptop uses XP, I can use my beloved MusicMatch and link to my music on my pc and play music with bluetooth speakers anywhere in the house. Heaven!It's not just that the hardware seems to be in good shape, the installed programs are very helpful.What a smart little shopper I am!
