Did my research. Was thinking about a mini at first but then this option came. Did my research. Saw some comparisson videos on YouTube and CNET, and simply found that both fit my needs can get the same accomplished but the nexus 7 has a much better price and more storage 32gb.  Google cloud services really help me get the most out of my 32gb. Really love the size. 7' is much more comfortable to hold and convenient and fits right in your pant pockets.  Oh and did I mention android jellybean is great? Had android on smart phones and got hooked on androidb since. Jellybean only makes the experience better.
