Everyone should be familiar by now with the capabilities and limitations of the 1st Gen iPad. Having said that, it's great for what I'm using it for, but it is not, nor should be expected, to be as fast as later generations. It's great for email, web surfing, social networking, light gaming, music, and reading (e.g. Kindle app). While my iPhone 4S is infinitely faster, this meets the needs again that I use it for, particularly watching videos, reading, etc. More importantly, at a price point under $200, it's not bad. There are probably newer generation tablets that are better, but since most of my stuff is Apple based, this worked well. No complaints.
