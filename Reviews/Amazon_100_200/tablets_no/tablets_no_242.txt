I first got this ipad 2 because my computer broke. It functions well and I like it, but not as a computer. If you want a computer, get a computer, not an ipad. If you want to use the ipad for reading or playing apps or even watching movies, then this would work great for you. You can listen to music through it but it is so bulky I don't see how you are supposed to do so in comfort. It would have to be sitting next to you and you can't really carry it around and do stuff. If you want to listen to music get an ipod. The ipad is also very durible. I have dropped it many times and nothing is wrong with it. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope it helped you.
