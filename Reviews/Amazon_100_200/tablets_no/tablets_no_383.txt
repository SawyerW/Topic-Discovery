i ordered an ipad1 from IMG Direct through amazon and it came today.  the ipad was DOA (dead on arrival); it would not start regardless of the type of reset i tried.  the ipad is a 3G device but there was no sim card in the tray.  when i looked at the box, the original serial number was scratched off the barcode label, telling me that the vendor had sent another (broken) device instead of the one that was originally in the box.i have returned the product to amazon and requested a refund.  it's a miserable business practice to ship defective, incomplete and altered products, especially when the vendor clearly knows what they are doing.
