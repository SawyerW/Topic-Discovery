There is no doubt that the iPad in its 3 versions and the new Mini are by far the best tablets in the market (WSJ analyst and NYT analist concurre). The premium that the Apple models carries is justified since you are getting quality, service, reliability and most of all usability.As one analyst put it. the iPad is the Rolex or the Porsche of the tablets, all others are cheap copies with hype and are considered a Timex or a Kya (nothing wrong with Kya or Timex only not to be consfused in terms of its quality and performance).I have being able to upgrade all my iPad, since the resale value of the older ones is high, therefore with minimum investment I can have the latest model, nothing wrong with previous. I highly recomend to pay extra for value. You pay what you get.
