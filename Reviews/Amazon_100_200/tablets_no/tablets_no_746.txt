The basic iPad gives me:  (1) a book/magazine reader (2) an iPod  (3) a very convenient camera and video camera  (4) web browsing  (5)  E-mail  (6)  A virtually limitless number of apps that I can download  (7) Very simple and intuitive navigation  (8)  Pretty good sound  (9)  Crisp display.  I've owned iPods and now the iPad for about 6 months.  I haven't had the slightest problem w/ either.  Amazing devices.  Would I pay $499 for an iPad or $199 for a Kindle Fire?  You're right, I'd pay the extra for the real McCoy.  The utility to me of the iPad and all of the apps that I have is far greater than $499.  Wouldn't do w/o it.
