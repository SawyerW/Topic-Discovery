The 1 st iPad has issues that apple will not fix.  If you go to the apple store they give you refurbished, they call them like new 1 st gen as a replacement.  I bought a two yr warranty and in two yrs I have had four iPads.  Apple genius have admitted that this iPad has software issues.  It blacks out when you are trying to surf web, play a game, Facebook  etc.  if you read reviews from other forms it will show this first iPad is NOT the one to buy.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE MY IPAD, I just get so tired of the problems.  It's getting to where I can't even read something without it blacking out three or four times.  I'm surprised  I've gotten this far in writing this!!! Off to buy an iPad air, like I said love apple products just not the geniPad .
