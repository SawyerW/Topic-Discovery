The iPad2 is my first Apple product. The packaging is very nice. iPad itself looks amazing, but a bit heavier than I thought it would be. That might be me... but I always thought iPads would be a bit lighter. Nonetheless it is amazing. I use the iPad for any e-textbooks. It is easy and simple to use.The downside is that I upgraded to iOS6, anddd the preinstalled YouTube app is no longer there. I wish the app store had a better selection as well. Most apps are mehh-- ok. Also wish that one day you can delete the preinstalled apps. Some apps I really don't need.
