I was able to play a lot of games flawless and was able to try out the Tegra versions of games that exclusive to the Nvidia Sheild on this tablet but the yellow tint and not as bright screen hold it back for me. I got the 2013 Nexus 7 instead and sold the 2012 because its a bigger upgrade but for now for $160 for the 32gb thats a steal this was a very powerful tablet and after the 4.4.2 it was running as good as the 2013 but like I said it didnt solve the yellow tint and Google wont replace it since its out of stock from them. I got the 2013 which the colors looks a bit more natural a bit of the yellow tint on this one also but not as noticeable as the 2012 edition. I guess Im cursed at getting these Nexus 7 tablets with these bad screens with bad color temperatures but I say get this one, it can still perform well in todays standards of Android tablets and if your not so into wanting high pixels on a small 7 inch screen.
