I ordered this for my grandson. When it came, it was a 16 gig instead of a 32 gig, but Amazon adjusted the price for me. I'm still happy with it, as I wanted something to put some movies on, and to allow him to play some educational games. The N7 is by far the best 7" tablet out there. Even though this is a 2012, and not the 2013, it's still a great tablet.The unit didn't arrive in the original N7 box, but it was packaged well, and worked flawlessly as soon as I charged it up. I got it for a good price, so I'm happy!
