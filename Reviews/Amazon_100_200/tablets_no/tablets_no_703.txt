I ordered a NEW I Pad Generation 2 White.  It did say that on  the wrapping on the outside of the backage.  When I removed the wrapping my husband noticed that the bar code on the box said that it was a RFB (refurbished) I Pad Generation 2 black.  To my disappointment that is what it was.  I returned it and ordered straight from the Apple web site.  It was cheaper as well.  Now I wonder if ALL the things I ordered from Amazon throughout the years are really the brand and quality that I ordered.  I think that they should check on their companies that they contract are on the upright.  I may think twice now.
