I bought the Archos to use as a small/lite ability to access the internet both here at our summer lake place, and at my office in the Twin Cities.For five months out of the year, we are here at the lake place and I need the device to work.  Our resort has WiFi and my desktop, portable, and my iPhone have no trouble linking solidly to the WiFi, but the Archos seldom can link at all and for sure will drop after a very short time.  Because this is the use most important to me, it is almost valueless here at the lake.I will be returning to the Twin Cities in a few days, and will see if it can do better with my WiFi in my office (a much stronger signal).But even if it works better there, it is almost wothless five months out of the year to me.So if anyone has less than a very strong WiFi signal, I would avoid this device.Bud Jay[...]
