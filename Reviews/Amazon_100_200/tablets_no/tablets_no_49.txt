I had no problems at all with this tablet. Fast, great screen (although a little on the glary side), and google constantly updates Andriod so you don't get stuck in an old version like with a Samsung. The battery life stinks. But the trade off is it's thin and light and at this point in time, it's very inexpensive.Now for the 2013 model. If you buy it, you will be very disappointed. First off, it's barely faster. The screen looks a bit better and the battery life is for sure better, but here's the rub: #1 it's doesn't work. Apparently there's a compatibility issue between the screen resolution and Android, which means between azus and google. It will make you crazy. #2 the form factor is different, so you'll have to buy a new case.
