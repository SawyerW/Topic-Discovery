I tryed out this tablet it was not at all bad but the problem is it is very complicated to add apps. I had originally bought the tablet to surf the web add book. Surfing the web isn't bad if you have internet. With out internet the connection tend to fall constantly. It got pretty annoying after a while. As for the book I couldn't really add any a book which suck. In the end I return the tablet also it took forever to switch pages and the taping on the page really isn't impressive. Overall a 2 out of 5.
