Im an IT Manager at a research institute and so many laptops come to me each monthThis slate is ok for browsing and some basic computeing but not for heavy duty computeing1- screen size is small and haveing a keyboard is better2- one usb isnt enough3- the cradel cant be used while the slate is in its cover (cover comes with it in box)4- screen sometimes jitters - not a big situation but is still a problem5- no hdmi on the slaate but there is one on the cradlei was satisfied with it installed alot of programs and it was still working smoothlyfor me the only problem was the small screen size but im guessing for someone other than me it would be ok
