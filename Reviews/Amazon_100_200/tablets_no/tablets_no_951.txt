Me and my dad share this tablet and its great, we bought this from verizon in 2012 it's a great tablet it does crash a little that's because it's over 2 years old but its just down right great i use it for youtube and web browsing, my dad uses it for some video, email and web browsing and it works almost flawless and it never let is down its just the perfect tablet but if you want tethering i would get the ipad 3,4 and air for wifi hotspot but this is great for everything else and that explains it all
