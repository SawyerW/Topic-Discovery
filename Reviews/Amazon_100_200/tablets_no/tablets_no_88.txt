This is made in China quality at it's best. The tablet is very functional and perfect for my 9 year old. She wanted a Kindle so I cheaped out and got this. The android interface is just like the phones and the Google play store is great. The internet browser is horrible but I just installed Mozilla and that works fine. There is a lag sometimes and I did notice banding in the screen. Games that use tilting motion are not recommended. The camera is crap but Skype is fun on it. There are lights behind the plastic that you can see and feel the heat! Overall I am happy with it. We saved $100 on something she will probably break or lose before it goes out on it's own.
