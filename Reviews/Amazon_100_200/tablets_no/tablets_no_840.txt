The company treated my return expeditiously and was very courteous.  The product was well wrapped and shipped in more than adequate protection.  The glass was new and the back was used as per the description.  The back was chipped severely on all sides like it fell from a moving bicycle--it should not have been used.  Under the glass was a dark splotch about 2x4 inches.  Its wasn't subtle--it was a glaring defect.  Once turned on, the splotch selected whatever was underneath it.  Apparently there was not even the breifest of efforts given towards quality control.  The tablet was unusable.  A horrible disapointment.
