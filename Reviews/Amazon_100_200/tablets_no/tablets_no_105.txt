I decided to get a tablet computer for when I travel.  After looking over the Galaxy Tab 3 and the Kindle Fire owned by other family members, I found that the Nook HD had more features that suited my needs.  I liked that I could add a micro-SD card for more memory. The screen is larger than the Galaxy.  The frame is easier to hold without bumping the screen with your fingers.  Love the clarity of print for the e-books.  There are more apps for it than I have had time to explore.  I can carry books, my Bible, and internet access with me, all in a very small case.  And I can download my granddaughter's favorite games.  Awesome!
