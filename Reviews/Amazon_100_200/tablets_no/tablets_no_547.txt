I bought my Micro Cruz back in November as a Chrstmas present to myself and I must say I have really enjoyed it.  It is great as a e-reader.  It is OK as a Tablet.Pros:  I really love the fact that you have the ability to use a SD card and expand your storage.  If only the other companies (Apple) would catch a clue that this would be a good thing.  It has some apps that are available that are really good ones (Thank you Kindle) and alot that just plain don't work on the thing.Cons: The sound however is crappy. Alot of the apps you can download don't work.But overall I love it as a reader.
