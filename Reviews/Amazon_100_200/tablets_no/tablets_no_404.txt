The iPad does what Apple says it will do. [...]It is not perfect.  The screen is weak in sun light (Amazon Kindle ads make sure that you are aware of this weakness).  For prolonged usage, the iPad begins to feel heavy, and it could have better connection to other devices for data transfers.It is the very best Netflix portable viewer.  It is a fine eBook reader.
