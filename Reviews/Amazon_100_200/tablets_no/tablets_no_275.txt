Two months into owning it the glass got cracked and had to be replaced.  I had to replace the glass on an Iphone once before, not a big deal, totally different story on the Ipad.  I used a heat gun to soften the glue, but it seemed to just spread the cracks. A million flakes of shattered glass later, it was repaired, but it was by far the most difficult electronics repair I've attempted.  Apple will repair the glass for $199-$399, depending on the trim level of the Ipad.  Not only is that expensive for what essentially is a sheet of glass, but it's doubly insulting that the cost of the glass depends on how much the Ipad originally retailed for.
