once again apple gives us something great!i bought this ipad because of work actually. I work in a hospital and its great to be able to access electronic records/labs/orders quickly while doing rounds. Makes life a lot easier than finding a computer, logging on, then doing it. After work, I can use this if I'm out, sitting at home on the couch, showing off things to my friends, youtubing vids, facebook (stalking), and even watching movies.The screen is beautiful, the weight is just right, and everything about it is so clean and perfect. I do wish the resolution could get a little higher as you can see a difference between it and the iphone4 screen, but i know thats something that will come in the ipad3. If you can wait, the ipad3 should be worth it as it will probably be the same price. If you can't wait, get this, you won't regret it!
