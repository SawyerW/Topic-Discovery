Bought this machine a few years ago, it has excellent screen, super long battery life and runs quiet. I have upgraded it to an SSD and this baby is fast, much better than other micro PCs. The keyboard IS small, screen IS small, but if you are looking for a spare/backup laptop to travel around, you can't beat its combination of performance, battery life and ports. Comes with VGA, USB and SD card (full size). I have the extended battery and it can routinely provide more than 8 hours battery life. Flip it and make it a tablet and you have your modern windows 8.1 tablet! Even Win 8 apps runs fine. Five stars for aging gracefully!
