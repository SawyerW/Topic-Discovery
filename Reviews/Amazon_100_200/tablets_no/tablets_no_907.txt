Was in the market for a tablet to be used during a planned international trip. I didn't want to lug mt 17" laptop through airport security and on to my destination. After considering cheaper options, including Samsung Galaxy and small 10-12" notebooks, I decided on the Apple. I've been using Apple IPOD's Classics for many years to store my ITUNES music library to play while at home, during trips and in my motor vehicles without any issues during the warranty periods and beyond. After speaking to both friends and family as well as reading reviews here on Amazon I decided to purchase the IPAD 2 16GB version. It's my first tablet & all I can say is it functions perfectly in my home using a refurbished Netgear 3500 wireless router for WIFI and a Bluetooth keyboard case from Trent also purchased here on Amazon. Screen resolution for the IPAD 2 is sharp & using the Safari browser for accessing my emails & internet browsing is easy to get acclimated to.  For those who wonder if they should purchase the Apple Care extended warranty I suggest no unless you are planning on dropping the IPAD on a hard surface!
