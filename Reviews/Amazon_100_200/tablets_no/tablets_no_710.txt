I got the iPad 2 in white and 64 gb with wifi+Verizon 3G and I absolutely love it! I suggest getting the biggest one you can so you don't have to worry about running out of space! I was worried about the white only after reading a few negative reviews about finding it distracting and I haven't found that to be the case for me. However, the screen protector I bought does not seem to fit as well as my mom's (same everything except hers is in black). I don't know if it was just a problem with that protector or if there is a slight size difference. Other than that no issues!
