I will admit that the cameras on the iPad 2 are not the greatest but the naysayers have to admit that the iPad 2 is so much faster and thinner than the first generation (to me, that makes it a great update).  I Skyped my parents in Florida for the first time last night (there is no HD version of Skype, so you have to 2X it to fill the screen) and it worked very well.  Last year, I played around with a friends original iPad and decided to be patient and wait for the iPad 2.  So glad I did, the iPad 2 is FAST.  Apps open instantaneously and it is a sleek machine.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I realize that the iPad 3 will probably have some major upgrades but if you have waited for the iPad 2 just get one and enjoy it.  It is the best tablet out there!
