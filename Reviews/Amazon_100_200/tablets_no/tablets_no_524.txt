It shipped very quickly, which was great. But On the information page for the tablet an HDMI and 2.0 usb  cord is promised. There  was nether of the cords in the package. And i am pretty sure that i stilled payed for both of  those cords.Cons:The 5 "android" buttons are NOT illuminated, which is bad in the darkThose of you getting this device after owning an ipod touch, ipad, iphone will notice that the on screen keyboard is hard to type on quickly.There is no android market, which leaves you to use other sources to get appsPros:It has a  very responsive touch screenSim and microsd slotsQuick Flash player
