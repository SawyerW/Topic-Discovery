PROS  * Fast, very fast. Got 2400+ on Quadrant, and it's not just a number, it feels it.  * My Vibrant phone (also 1 GHz) takes 3-5 times longer to download and install an app. The A7 is amazing in this regard.CONS  * Feels heavier in the hand after using it several times.  * No USB-to-computer connection... unbelievable...! adb over wifi requires the talents of a contorsionist...  * In bed, I rest the tablet on my lap/stomach... yet they placed the AC connection at the bottom... another unbelievable decision...!  * Poor battery life, well under 5 hours in use.  * The screen resolution is only OK (but acceptable). Web pages with small type don't look good.  * "Pinch to zoom" doesn't work for me (2 point multitouch). On Angry Birds or Dolphin HD, it's worked on Gtab and Archos.  * Dev support is quite lukewarm, except for Dexter (who doesn't have a tablet though). The Gtab was much more active at this stage.
