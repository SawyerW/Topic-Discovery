The only Mac I have ever owned was a lipstick.I am afraid of the Ipod, I own the cheapest phone because I lose my phone about twice a year.August 12, 2010 I received a gift that changed my life... My Ipad!I have no idea what the other reviewers are saying?  All I can say is that this is amazing!  I cruise the internet check email and now spend a ton of money on "apps".  My only complaint is that I can not see some videos on "you tube".  If you have the money and you are curious buy one.  Surprisingly my 4 yr old loves using the iPad and there are a bunch of educational apps.  I am not a video game parent my kids dont even watch main stream TV and I am in love with the activities available.  For some reason my 4 yr old figured out how to use the iPad with out much guidance.
