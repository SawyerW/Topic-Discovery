The product itself is excellent, but if you order from this seller be sure to ensure that you receive the correct product!  I ordered and paid for an AT&T; 3G model with WiFi, thinking I would primarily use it on WiFi and then activate the 3G when needed.  Then I went on vacation a few months later and tried to activate the 3G only to discover that the iPad I received was only a WiFi model.  When I contacted the seller they said they couldn't even find the serial number in their records and were of little assistance.  It was like buying a car with heated seats in the summer, then in the winter you discover the heated seats aren't in the car.  Very frustrating.  I have subsequently learned that you can tell the difference in a 3G model by the black antenna across the rear of the device.  Be sure to verify that you receive the correct model as soon as you receive the product!
