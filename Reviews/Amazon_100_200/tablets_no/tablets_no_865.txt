This is less of a review and more of a heads up. Apparently the seller "Pavilion Electronics" here on Amazon is selling return/refurb iPads as new. I just discovered this as I called Apple support on the 1st of 2 iPads I have purchased off of Amazon when the touchscreen stopped responding. Apparently it was registered with Apple almost 6 months prior to my purchase of it putting it out of warranty early (at least as far as my purchase is concerned). So, I now have to pay $270 to get it replaced after year of light use in a church environment (5-6 hours a week).
