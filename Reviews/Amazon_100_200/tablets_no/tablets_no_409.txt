Loved the flatness, the portability while traveling, the endless apps and all the free book downloads (mostly of the 'classic' variety).In the end, I returned it to the Apple store even paying the 15% restocking fee. I didn't find it appreciably better than my netbook except for size, and it had disadvantages even: no easy way for a non technical person to save photos, incredibly awkward while lying down - which is the way I often use my laptop/netbook, semi reclining.I know there are nice accessories that allowed it to stand up, and accessory keyboards, but in the end I just found it a gimmicky little toy. I heard a better version was coming this fall so I will look for that.If I were not a lover of physical books I would rate it higher, because the bookcase /library feature was cool. I just can't dive into the virtual books with the same interest -- perhaps I'm a dinosaur but there it is.
