I am very pleased with this little netbook. Very easy to use. Touch screen is very responsive and the screen size is just big enough to read books without any problem. I will be using this netbook for all my textbooks next semester since I can get them in PDF form.An upgrade of Windows 7 from Starter to Professional or Home Premium is essential to get the full functionality out of the tablet. Battery lasts 6-7 hours while running Winamp and working with MS Word or surfing the net at the same time. The 8 cell battery could potentially last the full 10 hours if you're not doing any high processing activities.My only complaint is that some flash videos and .avi files will not play with the netbook in power save mode. This is kind of expected with the slower processor.Overall, this was a great purchase. I got it used/like new, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who travels or needs something ultra portable.
