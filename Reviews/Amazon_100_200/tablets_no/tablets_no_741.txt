Who needs a netbook or even a laptop as a second computer? Well at least not me. Two weeks ago I decided to buy an ipad 2, so I went to Best buy and bought one. I have no iphone or ipod touch, I have a imac 21.5, a white macbook and ipod classic, then this was my first experience with IOS, which is super easy to use. Aesthetically it is a beautiful piece of design, no bright LEDs, and only a few buttons. since I bought my ipad 2. I have not used my macbook and it is much more practical to take with me. Common uses are videos, web browsing, email, internet radio and some games, no music stored, because most of my audio files are lossless, the battery lasts 2 to 3 days, not really a heavy use, But still ok .Cons in my point of view:No expandable sd card.No flash on camera.Cameras not very good.Glossy screen.No flash player.Pros:Size is excellent.Software easy to use.Too many appsDesign.Many more accessories than its competitors.Portability.In short almost a great product, and waiting  for iOS5 and iCloud.
