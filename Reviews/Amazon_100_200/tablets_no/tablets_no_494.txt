I am very interested in the Archos 7. I was going to give my current ipod touch 2g to my son and purchase a 4g touch...then i started looking at this.  I have a couple questions:1.  I am not sure if i am reading it right or not, but does it have a slot for added memory to upgrade the current 8gb to whatever flash memory i purchase?2.  the battery.  I hate the internal battery on the ipod touch.  I have returned my current ipod 3 times in the last 6 weeks because the battery keeps failing and everytime they give me a refurbished ,ipod touch, piece of cr@% that i have to keep returning.  Is the battery, on the Archos, easily reached and easy to put a new one in when needed?3.  is there a kindle app available for the archos?4. does the archos 7 have attachments available that can connect to TV's?Thanks!
