I bought this device so I could listen to some relaxing music on my hour drive to work and back. Instead I get home more stressed out than when I left work. The touch interface is wayyyy squirrely and when you are driving along and it shuts off, in the middle of Dallas traffic, and you manage to get it to play again it has changed to a different playlist, which took me hours to create BTW. I cannot recommend this thing, it is unpredictable and basically useless. I'm sending it back and purchasing an iPod. At least the interface on those is usable. I'm tired of looking at an upside down display because the accelerometer is so poor. And I'm tired of the shuffle option either playing the same song over and over or going through the same album, over and over. Done, I'm out of here.
