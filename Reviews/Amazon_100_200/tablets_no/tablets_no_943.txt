Purchased this iPad for my son.  It works very well, screen has beautiful color and resolution.  My biggest complaint (this is more my fault for not researching the product before buying) is that what you buy as far as memory is what you get.  You cannot increase its memory like you can a computer.  We've had to delete video and apps over the past year to make room for more.  My son really hates losing apps from time to time, but we have to if he wants to make room for a new one.  Buy as much memory as you can afford, because after a few months you may find yourself stuck.
