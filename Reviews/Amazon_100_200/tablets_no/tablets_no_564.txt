The keyboard was off by about a half an inch. By this I mean, when you press a key, you had about a 20% chance of the correct letter or symbol appearing, and that includes the space bar and the backspace key. "Impossible" does not even begin to describe the level of difficulty presented by this keyboard.I thought maybe it needed the oft-mentioned firmware update- nope. After 20 minutes not only was the keyboard still not fixed, the entire device was locked and frozen. I just want to read ebooks, not spend an hour a day on maintenance for this stupid thing.I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy. It is flat-out, absolute, unadulterated garbage.
