This is a physically solid computer with good battery life.  Mine shipped with Vista.  It was predictably slow.  I upgraded to Win7 with the disk provided (after much haggling) by Fujitsu.  Under Win7, the pen created random cursors, and calibration was pointless.  The computer couldn't tell whether it was in notebook or slate position, so it was cumbersome to change the screen orientation.  The touchpad was also mis-oriented. I had to reinstall my bluetooth mouse weekly.  Finally, the tablet buttons didn't work (though I don't use them very much).After literally hours in chat with Tech support, they admitted that they didn't have drivers for windows 7, and wouldn't for another 6 months.  They were able to send me an XP 'downgrade' (for $25) [not worth arguing over], and all is well.  Except for lost time and productivity.My advice?  Get it with XP Tablet edition if you can.  In a year or so, I may get up the courage to upgrade to Win7.
