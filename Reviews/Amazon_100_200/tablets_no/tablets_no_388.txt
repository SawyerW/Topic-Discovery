I pre-ordered the IPAD so was one of the first to get one.  It was also my first Apple product.  My friends with Apple computers always told me Apple makes good products and the IPAD should be almost perfect.While it is rather neat to play with, it crashes when surfing the Internet.Apple restricted it so much a lot of standard Internet products do not work, such as Adobe FlashPlayer.  So no watching TERRA NOVA direct from the Fox website. The IPAD has been out over a year and still can not fix that.Bottom line, too much Big Brother.  I shall not be replacing the IPAD with a newer model, I shall not be buying an Apple computer and I shall not be getting an IPHONE.  There are too many other products out there that are not so restrictive,  such as Droid based tablets.Before you buy, be really sure an IPAD will let you do what you want to do.
