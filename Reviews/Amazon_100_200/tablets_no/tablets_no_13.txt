I wanted a tablet, but couldn't even fathom spending so much money on an Ipad and didn't want an e-reader because the app selection isn't as great. I am so glad I bought this tablet I have had it since December 2012 and use it constantly, the only complaint I had was I had an iphone and I couldn't get the most out of Google Play because of it. I am now a proud owner of a Samsung S3 as well as this Nexus and couldn't be happier from the Apple to Android switch best decision I have ever made! Another slight disadvantage is that it isn't the most popular of tablets so it is hard to find accesories specifically for this tablet, but this is coming from someone who used to have an iphone and they have too many options.
