I have used this product heavily for about two months now. Most of the time I use it to surf the internet.  My experience with the web browser has been frustrating. Sometimes the browser takes forever to load a page. This happens frequently. Also, the browser spontaneously closes. This also happens frequently.The latest versions of the browser and system software have been installed with little improvement. The browser cache has been cleared on a regular basis and the unit has been power cycled numerous times.In all, I really like this tablet but, in my opinion, this device is not quite ready for prime time. If I could do it over,  I would wait for improvements to be made before purchasing it.  The browser issues interfere too much and significantly detract from the pleasure of using this device.Definitely could not recommend this to a friend. In the mean time I will keep hoping for a software update that improves the browser experience.
