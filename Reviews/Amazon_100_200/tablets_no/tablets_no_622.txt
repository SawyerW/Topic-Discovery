I bought one of these in October 2012. It is a great tablet and the price has come down considerably. When I bought mine, It was in BB and cost around $500.Things you will like:  The large array of features such as the built in camera, video record, wifi, and of course the fact that it runs genuine Android operating system that gives you the ability to download tons of new applications from the Google Store. There is even a Kindle application so you can download ebooks from Amazon :).The tablet itself is very high quality. It does not feel cheap or flimsy like many tablets do.Things you may not like: The tablet is HEAVY. It weight a bit over a lb, which doesn't seem like too much until you're laying on your back in bed trying to hold it like a paperback book. Your arms and wrists will hate you for it.I also didn't care for the power charger. On a high end tablet, you'd almsot expect a microUSB charger, but instead it was just a single prong and reminded me of the one that came with my 10 year old $20 tracfone.
