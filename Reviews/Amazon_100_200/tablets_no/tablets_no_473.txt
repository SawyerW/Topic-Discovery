I'VE HAD MY ARCHOS 7 FOR ABOUT SIX WEEKS NOW AND LOVE IT. I OWN AN ARCHOS 5 AND THOUGHT THE BIGGER SCREAN WOULD BE EASIER ON MY EYES. I AM NOT AT ALL DISAPOINTED WITH THIS DEVICE. ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT AND TWEEK IT YOU WILL FIND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO.WHERE CAN YOU BUY A TABLET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO $200.I PURCHASED A USB CHARGER CABLE CORD FOR ARCHOS 3G ON EBAY FOR LESS THAN $5.00 IT HAS THE SAME CONNECTION AS THE AC POWER CHARGER THAT CAME WITH THE 7 .ONE END  IS USB AND THE OTHER A STRAIGHT PIN.NOW I CAN CHARGE THE DEVICE VIA A COMPUTER.YOU CAN ALSO  USE IT TO CHARGE IN YOUR CAR IF YOU HAVE A PLUG THAT ACCEPTS A USB CABLE.I'VE TRIED BOTH THESE METHODS AND THEY BOTH WORK .JUST MAKE SHURE YOU PLUG THE STRAIGHT END INTO THE CHARGING PORT AND NOT THE AUDIO.ALSO YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF HELPFULL INFO ON THE ARCHOS FANS WEBSITE. GOOD LUCK.
