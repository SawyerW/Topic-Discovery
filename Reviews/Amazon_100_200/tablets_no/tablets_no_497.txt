I borrowed one of these for a weekend, in response to a bet that it was "just as good as my ipad."That is like saying that a beaten down car that doesn't start is just as good as a new Ferrari.I played with Archos 7 for hours and although I was finally able to check my email (it took hours to get into my email -- compared to less than a minute to set up the ipad to check my email the and less than a second once the ipad was set up), I was not able to get the Archos 7 to do anything else.Just spend the extra hundred bucks and get a real ipad.
