The Archos 43 has a very sensitive screen for a resistive screen. You don't need to use your fingernail or a stylus. All in all a very nice device. I have to say after having the 43 for several days now I'm very happy with it. I have tried the HDMI out and it is excellent, no choppy playback and the audio quality is excellent with some samsung earbuds. Battery life is good, the wifi is good and the bluetooth is excellent. The camera isn't bad. I have paired it with a GPS and you can tether it to a phone of you want a mobile connection. And there is already an 3rd party app that allows you to use the Android app store. When Android 2.2 is released for it browsing with flash will be great.
