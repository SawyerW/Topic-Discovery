This has got to be one of the best purchases I've made.The good: This netbook with the proper mods is really awesome: I added 2GB of ram + 4GB Class 4 SDHC for ReadyBoost and upgraded the default Windows 7 starter to W7 Ultimate for the multi-touch experience. I've also picked Firefox as my main browser because of it's touchscreen support. I really can't say anything bad about this netbook because it runs so smooth and the touchscreen is super responsive, I've even run Android x86 on VMWARE with 300MB of reserved RAM without any major issues except the touchscreen calibration. I consider myself a very demanding user and this netbook has exceeded my expectations, I find myself using it in tablet mode more often while watching TV or reading before bed.The bad:-The windows 7 version that comes with it is not the most adequate for touch screens-The 1GB of ram that comes with it is not enough to decently run windows 7-No 3G-No BluetoothFor the price, I would highly recommend this netbook to anyone.
