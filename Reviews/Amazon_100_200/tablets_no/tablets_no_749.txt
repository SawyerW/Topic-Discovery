The product is fine with one exception.  You're pretty much stuck with the lousy Safari browser on this.  It is totally worthless as far as I'm concerned.  You can't import existing bookmarks without going through a big long scenario to do it.As far as the shipping is concerned, I have other concerns and the fact I will no longer waste my time paying Amazon for a prime account.  When I ordered the iPad it said on the screen "if you order in the next 2 hours and 22 minutes" receive it by Monday 12/30/13.  This never happened.  A word of warning to anyone buying from this Shopvius company.  They are worthless when it comes to shipping your product on time.With the exception of piece of trash Safari and the shipping the product is fine.
