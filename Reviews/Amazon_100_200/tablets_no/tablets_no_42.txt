This tablet failed to turn back on after just a few hours of use on the same day I took it out the box for my son. This was really annoying as the item was a gift. After searching google with "my nexus 7 tablet wont turn on", I found a slew of other users that bought the tablet and experienced the same thing. I got the tablet back on after reading different "solutions" like holding different buttons down simultaneously, pulling off the back cover, etc, and was eventually able to get it back on. It's working now but this problem seems common and should be addressed. My cheaper Galaxy Tab 7 seems much more sturdy and has never given me any problems even though this Nexus 7 is supposed to be better. I'll give it 3 stars because when it's on, it actually works even though its superiority over the Galaxy Tab 2 is barely noticeable (if at all) in my opinion. If I had to do it again, I would gift another Galaxy Tab 2. It's super lame and embarrassing to give a gift to someone and have it break down on the first day of use.
