The IPAD2 is an incredibly lightweight, capable tablet that is very easy to use.  Just getting used to not having to use a mouse is incredible, and the weight saved versus carrying a laptop or even a netbook is awesome.  I travel alot, so this makes a big difference to me.  In addition, the ease with which it was purchased on Amazon versus trying to find one at a store, due to the short supply, was simply wonderful.  It arrived within 4 days, at a better price than in the stores.  All in all, a great purchase with which I am very satisfied.
