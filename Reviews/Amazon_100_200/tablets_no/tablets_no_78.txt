I got this as a cheaper alternative to the ipad for my kids (age 3 & 4) and I truly got what I paid for. I'm still unsure if the product I received is actually a Zeepad or a knockoff.PROS:*Only $70*I was one of the few buyers to actually receive their order from the seller.*Easy to set upCONS:*The packaging looked cheap and the pads themselves feel like they will break if not handle carefully.*I have tried adjusting the sensitivity of the screen but it's still a bit hard to use, many times you have to jab at things a few times and the stylus is useless.*The audio port is tiny and you can't plug in headphones.*The prong inside of the power port is offset a bit, as though someone pulled the power cord out at an angle. I have to carefully shimmy the power cord in whenever I want to charge it.*The date and time won't stay set.*Screen has lines.All in all they are okay but I should have just paid the extra money for a nook or kindle. At least I won't be too upset if the kids break them.
