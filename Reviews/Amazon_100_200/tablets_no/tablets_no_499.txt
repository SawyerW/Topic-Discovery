If you're reading all of these reviews, you're wondering what the deal is with the trackpad.  Honestly, it's downright annoying.  It's not like the pad on the new apple computers.  The only clickable area is at the very edge because the hinge is pretty rigid.That being said, I'm pretty happy with the netbook.  I tend to tap the pad rather than depressing the clicker.  Moving a file is somewhat aggravating.  If you're a mouse person, you have nothing to worry about.The battery life is pretty good--about 5 hours of web surfing.  I hardly ever charge it and I forget to shut it down, but the batterysaver seems to mitigate my negligence.
