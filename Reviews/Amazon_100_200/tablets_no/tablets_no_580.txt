This has been a nice gadget for me. Nothign over the top, but i love it none the less. Music plays well. it doesn't hook to itunes, and it sorts all music automatically. thats a little annoying having all the singles come up in album and artist view, but i ignore it. you have to put playlists in manually.buuuut. the speakers are FANTASTIC. i woudl say 3 times as loud as ipods? screen is bigger, and internet connection is solid. it doesn't have multi touch, but the camera works great in good lighting. i couldn't tell the difference between pictures taken with my archos and my digital camera as long as it was daytime, outside!i find it work a bit like a computer. after sitting around for awhile, it gets slow and has to warm up for a few seconds. also doesn't work well at low battery. a lot of people would get frustrated with it, bu tit has many redeeming qualities and most of the time, is awesome. and, and by the way,Sweet!
