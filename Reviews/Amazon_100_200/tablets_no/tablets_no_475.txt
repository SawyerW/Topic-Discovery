It is a very nice item. I had to get a replacement the first one I got was basically dead out of the box. It took some waiting but Amazon handled the return and replacement.Does every thing I need will surf the web. Handle Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF. Yes you need a third party app. (Documents to Go") Not all of the Droid apps will run on it due to the very large screen, which is nice. Have not really figured out how much battery I have. It seems sufficient. I wish it was removable though. Multiple web browsers to choose from. Skyfire, Opera Mini 5, Built in browser. Good memory size. Good Sound, USB is a CON because you need hardware to change it to host mode. For sale by Archos. easy to Flash to the latest firm ware. I wish the email client had a place to store contacts. I want to replace my Netbook with this thing but that is what I am lacking along with a Torrent app.
