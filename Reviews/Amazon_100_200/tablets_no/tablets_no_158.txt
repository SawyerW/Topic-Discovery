From my experience in communications and technology, the i-Fad has got to be the most tedious and frustrating product I have ever owned.  (Actually it's for a child's 'education' but I have to do the tech support.)Fundamentally it's a closed system of applications that are all 'one trick ponies'.  (Most are lame.) Each time you need to do something it's buy another app.I'm not convinced it even works properly.  There are issues with the screen not responding to touch.  It also has problems connecting to Wi-Fi and to iTunes via a PC.  When connected to the PC there are messages that it can't sync or that the iPad is unrecognised.  I-Tunes is an appalling waste of time and had its tentacles onto my credit card before it was even installed.
