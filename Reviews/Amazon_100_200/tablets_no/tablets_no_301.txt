I have this to say about the PC t91:It lasts!My wife has been using hers daily for about 3 years and it never quits. She used to have a lot of lock-ups when using IE as the web browser, but switched to Chrome and seldom has to restart her computer.It is light-weight and portable. She never tries to run videos on it (other than YouTube). She frequently has used it for music and it has performed flawlessly.If you can find one of these around, it is WELL WORTH the investment for web browsing and other light use.21Feb13 Update. Still running strong. She uses it daily, mostly for Kindle, web-browsing, email, and Facebook. NEVER fails. The best microelectronics investment I ever made.
