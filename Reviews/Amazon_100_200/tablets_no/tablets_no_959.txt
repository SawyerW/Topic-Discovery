I love my Ipad 2, Apple created the market and they have the best products out there in my opinion.  The device is a little on the heavy side but the way form meets function is beautifully done and apps are the best out there.  Apple devices are more expensive than other tablets but you really get what you pay for...you are going to be spending a lot of time on your tablet so choose wisely.A word of advice, if you have small children who will be using this device make sure that you get an Otterbox Defender case.  They will drop it, spill food on it, etc...and the Otterbox case will save you from sending your device back to Apple and forking over $250 for them to fix it
