After owning an iPad 2, an ASUS Transformer, Galaxy 2. 7", and a Kindle Fire, I can safely  say that the Nexus 7 outshines them all. The Nvidia Tegra processor makes gaming a lot of fun on even a 7" display. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas plays better and loads faster on my Asus Google Nexus 7 than it did on my PC, PS2, or XBOX did at the time of the game's release. I find myself using this tablet more often than I do my game consoles or PC lately. Though the resolution is not 1080p like the newer model, it is still very modern and very functional. I hear a lot of people complain about only having the one forward facing camera and wishing it came with a high end rear facing camera as well. To them, I say: "Stop taking selfies with your tablet and invest in a really nice digital camera and the USB host adapter for your Nexus 7."
