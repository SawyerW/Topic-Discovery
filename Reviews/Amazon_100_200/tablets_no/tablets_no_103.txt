The original reason I purchased this device was to use it for my textbooks. But to my displeasure, Barnes & Noble doesn't allow for any of their tablets to read text books from NOOKStudy (their ebook reading program). It has been a rather irritating discovery because they hide that fact in the fine print.I feel that anyone who is thinking of purchasing this product should know this fact up front. If the user does not intend to use it for that reason, great. But if you do, be warned. This will be a waste of your money.Other than that, it is fine. It runs like an android for internet. My wife and I use it mainly for quick searches and to watch videos. But being run on android programming means it can be slow and cumbersome at times. And you cannot download anything without it being through Nook.If you so choose to buy this product, I recommend a stylus pen to prevent the screen from building an oily film.
