This was my first Apple purchase.  I wasn't quite certain what I would use it for, I just knew that I wanted one.  Absurd to spend $500?  No way.  I love it!  I start my day and end my day with my ipad in my hand.  Anything you want to do - they have an app for that.  I love the instant on, 10 hour battery, and the portability.  The US Today App is my favorite news source.  Weather plus keeps me completely ready for whatever weather is coming my way. Flixter keeps me informed about upcoming movies and DVD releases.  Realtor.com is helping me find my dream house.  Do I need it? No.  Do I love it?  YES!
