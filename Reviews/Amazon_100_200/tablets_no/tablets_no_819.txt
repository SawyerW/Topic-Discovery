If you want to make pictures you have to choose the iPad 3 with the better camera. Also if you want to use it with GPS Navigation, you need a iPad with 3G - this iPad is only WIFI - so it don't come with an GPS! But for using it for checking Mails, or for Facebook it's perfect. If I don't have Wifi where I am I switch on my Hotspot from my iPhone and I Internet where ever I want. For the way I use it, it's perfect!And the shipping was really fast. The dealer was nice if I call him and ask, if he can sent it as soon as possible! He does it!!!!!
