Got the 64 GB one from my brother-in-law for Christmas. I really love it. The look and feel are excellent. Everything is nice and works well. I love playing video games on it. reading Kindle on it is excellent. I bought a $ 20 leather case for it online at Amazon, and bought a $ 30 Menotek rubber keyboard for it, which actually works nice and even rolls up. Overall, I am very happy with it and have yet to discover anything I don't like, except maybe multi-tasking. Also, the typical issue of not being able to get at the battery, but you know that already when you buy any Apple product.
