Ok I'm not a computer Geek by far! I purchased this Nexus 7 for my 14 year old son for Christmas! Of course I had to turn it on and make sure it worked! HAHA who am I kidding! I wanted to see if it was I thought my son was expecting! Turned right on I set up his account and then started exploring what this device can do! Then I wanted one! So I got one for myself! I thought a 7inch screen I'm not going to like it! BUT I LOVE IT! Great checking email, facebook ect. Easy to carry around. Pictures and games have such great quality! I would highly recommend the Nexus 7 to anyone! I have also convinced my 71 year old Dad to purchase one!
