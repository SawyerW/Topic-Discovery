I love my iPad.  Previously I had a kindle fire which I loved also until I tried an iPad my wife brought home from her work...I was hooked.  Graphically it is far superior to the kindle fire in my opinion.  Absolutely love the fact that the calendar, photos, etc...will sync with my iPhone.  The available apps from Apple far exceed anything amazon has to offer.  I'm am a freelance graphic designer and love the amount of helpful design apps available on the apple store.  There is even one that allows me to open a file from my computer and edit designs for customers if I'm away from my desk.  The larger screen size in relation to the kindle fire makes this tablet even more appealing to me.  Don't get me wrong the fire is a good product, but with a kindle app on the iPad to make it a reader for your amazon books...who needs it.  Recommend this product any chance I get.
