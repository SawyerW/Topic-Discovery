This tablet is wonderful with its high specs(at the time) and its nexus experience. It did everything I wanted in the perfect form factor. It was working fine until one day for some reason it wouldn't turn on, I left it alone for a while(about a week) and it still wouldn't turn on. It was already out of warranty at this time and sites told me it could be a bad connector inside, I opened it up unplugged and then replugged the battery and it turned on. When I closed it, it was working perfectly but it had no wifi and when I finally got it to connect it only had 1 bar, even directly next to my router I only got 2. This product works perfectly until you try to fix it yourself. Overall 3-5
