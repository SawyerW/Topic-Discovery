Despite the newer iPad being released only a short time ago the older second generation model remains on top in my opinion. If you are considering a tablet this is definitely the model for you. Apple has put a lot of work into making iOS as easy and accessible to the masses as they can, and that makes for a very pleasant experience. The iPad is great for watching videos, listening to music and reading books. I use my iPad more than I use my computer! There are so literally millions of apps to try. So you might be wondering why I still think this second generation model is King over the newer model? Well the reason is simply the price. The current gen iPad has always been a bit pricey but since the latest one came out this "outdated" model has dropped significantly making this the time to get an iPad 2.
