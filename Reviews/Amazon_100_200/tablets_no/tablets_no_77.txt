Great product for my 9 year old!! Does everything u could want and more!! Fast on the internet!! Nice that it has Google play unlike some other tablets that u buy under $200. My daughter loves to tango chat on it. Lots of stuff it will do!! Camera takes quality pictures and video... would recommend this to anyone and have.. my daughter has dropped it already and all that happened is it popped apart but snapped right back together and there is nothing wrong with it. High quality made. Husband is a computer tech and picked it apart before we bought it he was thrilled when he saw and started playing with it!! A+++++++++
