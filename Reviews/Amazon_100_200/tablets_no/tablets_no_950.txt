The ipad I received had a little scratch on the screen as it was stated when I purchased it, but as I started to use the iPad a week or two later the screen started to go out until the Apple sign appeared on the screen and then the screen shuts off. I thought at first it was just rebooting itself but now it is happening more often and now I have lines on the screen, and it won't shut off even if I hit the start button or power button. I just have lines going toward the top of the screen please contact me to rectify this matter.
