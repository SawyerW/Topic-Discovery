While the iPad 2 is indeed the coolest gadget to own at the moment, it hardly does anything productively. This is not to say I do not love my iPad 2. I use it to watch Netflix, type company notes, play games, and occasionally listen to music on it. That is precisely where I find the problem. I use it to do things I do perfectly fine on a computer or laptop. I can watch Netflix, take notes, game, music on my computer and it does an even better job! The truth is, I often have to find an excuse to use my iPad 2 instead of getting on my laptop.So why iPad 2? Because it's a luxury item and everything looks more beautiful on an iPad 2. At least that's what you'll convince yourself, well, I did...
