The Google/Asus Nexus 7 tablet is a beautiful work of art. Everything about it is nearly perfect.This is my first tablet, and I have to say I'm slightly addicted. With all of Google's premium features right at my fingertips, the Nexus 7 is incredibly diverse for its price. I use this tablet for nearly everything: GPS while I'm biking, note-taking, music and videos, etc.The app store is huge, providing an enormous array of apps. And now, with Google Play allowing the uploading of your own books, music, videos, and documents, this tablet can be used for nearly everything. I also use it as my digital wallet, utilizing the Google Wallet NFC features.Though nearly every aspect of the tablet is amazing, I recommend that anyone buy a security app so you can find it if lost or stolen. After that, it's perfect.
