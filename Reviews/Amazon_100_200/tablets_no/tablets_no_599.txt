I have played with my Xoom for multiple hours and would just like to share my experiences really quick.  The tablet is super responsive and I haven't noticed any lag in switching through screens.  I used it a lot from switching between a Facebook app (Flow) and the internet (Dolphin Mini).  I tried the YouTube app out for a little bit as well and it worked well.  I still have to test audio and videos a little more.The only downside I noticed was that audio, when maxed, it just a little low but it isn't a huge deal.  Watching a movie by myself will be fine.  Another thing is that it is just a little heavy.  I am sure after a few weeks of heavy use my hands will be pretty muscular :).Overall, I'd give it the extra star when more tablet specific apps come out.
