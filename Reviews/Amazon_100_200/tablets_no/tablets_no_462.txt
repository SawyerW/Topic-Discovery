This tablet is an exceptional travel companion with the WI-FI, very easy to access.  It works easily with secure system as well with it's own MAC address.  It does how ever lack two things that I expect to be supplied in the near future (I Hope) (1) is useability with AudibleBooks and (2) an upgrade to the OS for using flash for viewing. For less than $200.00 with these minor faults is one great buy. J&R; Music and Computer World  provides fast and excellent service - I highly recommend them as they have the best price on the net. I will always give them a try when making a purchase........Regards
