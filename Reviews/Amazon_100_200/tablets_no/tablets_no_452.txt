I really like it for what it is. I did not buy it to replace my cellphone, computer, pda, or what have you. I bought it to display pictures and videos, to store a book or two and to have access to the internet while I wait for my wife to get off of work. For all of these things it is great. Initially it was frustrating training it (or me) so that I can use the touchscreen, but now that I am used to it I like it but it is not as responsive as my wifes Ipod Touch the screen is way bigger and like I said when you get used to it, it works great. I especially like that it holds so many pictures and they look so good even when they are saved with high compression. I will say it again it is not a netbook, Ipad, Ipod, computer, or anything except an Archos and that is good enough for me.
