I bought this netbook a few years ago and absolutely love it. I love how it is a touch screen and how the screen can turn around when I want to show something to someone else. It can also be used as a tablet if you upgrade to windows 7 full version. It comes with win 7 starter, and that is about the only thing I don't really care for about with this computer. In my opinion, they should have installed the full version. I feel I paid enough for the computer to not have to purchase anything further, just to use all the features on the computer. But all in all, this is a really great computer for surfing the internet (mainly what I do). I haven't been able to use it for about a year and miss it very much (It got a virus and windows got corrupted. My fault, not the computers or company's). So I am having windows 7 full version installed so I can have my baby back. :)
