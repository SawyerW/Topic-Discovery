I bought this device about 3 weeks ago and i love it. I was a little worried at firt because of all the bad talk about the resistive screen, but once i got it, i loved it. The resistive screen is not like the old ones, and feels almost exactly like a capacitive. The screen colors are amazingly vivid, there are so many apps, and the battery life is excellente. I bought a skinomi carbon fiber skin for it, which oritecs it from literally everything, and now i dont have to worry about fingerprints or anything else. I also have a zune hd, and i would choose this screen over the Zune HD's anyday. This is a great device, especially for the price, so i wouldnt miss out.
