I bought the iPad 2 wifi 16g to take with me to Afghanistan. When I first recieved it, it was amazing. It was new, flashy, fast, the charge lasted forever and all my friends wanted to play with it. After about a week or two, the battery didn't seem to stay charged as long. It wasn't that big of a problem though, because I was never far from a plug. When I got to Afghanistan is when I lost all respect for the iPad 2. The lack of constant signal caused apps and updates to half download which left permanent gliches in the programs and the main screen as well, that I cannot get rid of. Problems, that none of my friends with other brand's tablets had. The battery life was almost cut in half and its a hassle to do anything with it now because of the poor state of apps and the whole iPad itself. I would recommend this if you will always have perfect signal and never be more than 10 feet away from a plug.
