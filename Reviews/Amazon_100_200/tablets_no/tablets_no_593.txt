I have an Apple iTouch and the user experience is much better on it than the Archos. I simple can't use my finger to scroll the Archos screen without inadvertently get something wrong. For example I touch the screen to swipe and instead of the screen scrolling, the option where I touched opens instead. And I have to press a little hard. Sucky experience. I have to use a stylus instead and that means I have to carry it around with me. Cumbersome. The iTouch's capacitive screen is much responsive to my intentions. Also the Archos doesn't support pinching to zoom in/out on the Archos. You can have to use the zoom feature of the opened app and they can be different from one app to the other.Not Archos's fault but the Android apps are not polished as the the ones for the iOS. For example, I've yet to find a good pdf reader which allows me to view a full pdf page without horizontal scrolling.The only plus for the Android over the iTouch is the bigger screen. I would prefer iTouch's smaller screen if it means it's more useful for me.
