Love the product. got it before the estimated arrival date which is next. Shipped on the same day i ordered it. Ipad was new and had original packaging. Everything on it functions and im loving it. Deff a good buy. Good product. Got this ipad 3 stylus and a leather case for 590 something. totally worth it.This really comes in handy if your a college student like myself.the screen is big the keyboard is bigapps are lovelybattery life is pretty good (last long)i got this instead of the new ipad because itscheaper than that ipad and still a good product.Books look awesome on here.Con: Apple doesnt have microsoft office (they do have apps like keynote,etc which are somewhat like word,etc.) but i suggest everyone buy quickoffice pro hd. its price (20 dollars in the app store) may bug people but its cheaper than microsoft officeYou can use excel,powerpoint,word,etc. i use it for homework.10/10
