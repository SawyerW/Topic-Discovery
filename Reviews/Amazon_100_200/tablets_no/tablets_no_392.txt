I truly have no need for a laptop anymore after purchasing the iPad - gave mine to the wife.  The gap between what you can do (and realistically would do on the road) on a tablet vs. a laptop is closing rapidly.  I do use my desktop at home for a few programs (photoshop, illustrator) but even at home I often find myself reaching for the iPad before using the computer.  It is excellent for reading (Amazon books and PDFs for professional material).  I also use it for language studies, finance, news etc.  I type on the screen just as fast as on a keyboard.  And drawing on the iPad (takes a little getting used to) is a lot of fun.  I can print on the WiFi too but the printer list that is supported is not a long one yet (do some research if you intend to use it for this) The battery life is phenomenal.  Tablets really are the best way to go and the iPad is a great choice!
