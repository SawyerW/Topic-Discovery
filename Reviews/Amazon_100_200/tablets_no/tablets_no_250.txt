Not being a techno-whiz, I need all the cue cards I can get. No cue cards w/ the iPad (original). No instruction book. Even w/ tutorials, lots of info re how to download ($),but no basics like how to access and play the music you have downloaded. Took LOTS of trial and error to figure out.On the up side, having a store nearby to take 1:1 classes is wonderful, and will learn much in short order.One other concern, I downloaded Sketchbook Pro to learn to draw in the computer. Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to "read" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient. Perhaps a wacom tablet would have been a better choice.Overall, it is amazing to have music, mail, drawing, search, calendar etc in such a small package.  The problems...no doubt more my abilities than the product.
