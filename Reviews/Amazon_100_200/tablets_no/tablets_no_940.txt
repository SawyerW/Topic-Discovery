Bought an IPAD for my wife so we could talk while I was out of the country for 9 mo. It worked great the month before I left. One week after I left, it would not go online any more. Since it had only been 40 days she called apple and they reset it, but that did not fix it. So she had to send it in the day before she was going away for a week, the one time that she really needed to keep in touch with me. Apple should have replaced it and sent us a new while they fixed our lemon of an ipad. We have been apple customers for 3 mo, not so impressed with their customer service. I thought their OS was supposedly without problems. Story to be continued after they send back our now refurbished $700 Ipad that is 40 days old. If I wanted a refurbished one I could have paid $400, and I would have expected this kind of action.
