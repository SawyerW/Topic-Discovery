The Ipad2 is generally well responsive and quick however there are a few malfuctions/weak points where it could of been made better. I test out tablets/ e-readers because I need them for school/coursework however The Apple Ipad has poor buisness apps and tools. The notes apps are very basic and less focused on. Apple mainly foucuses on its apps and games which attract the younger population. For example it has more Angry Birds Apps then your fingers on your hand! Some strong points are the Facebook app, Facetime(Similar to Skype) and Itunes. Not my taste of tablet and I will be selling it soon.
