I spent $900 on my asus laptop over a year ago and it can play video games equivalent to a PS3 or xbox360.  i can connect to my TV with an HDMI port, which are built into every single new HD TV for PC users.  Obviously ipads dont have HDMI ports because apple wants you to spend hundreds of dollars to hook ipads up to your TV.  They know you are stupid and will spend money on anything.  if you have this device you probably know nothing about computers. 1 GHZ processor?  really? my $900 laptop has 3.6 ghz processing speed.  64 gb memory? really? my laptop has 600 gb memory.  the ipad is still missing many notable features and if you buy this you will have to spend money money money! if you have no problem giving away your money to a scamming company then buy this.  otherwise, buy anything else.
