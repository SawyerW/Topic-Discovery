You know, I have owned possibly the largest collection of tablet pcs in America. Every time any company releases another I am the first in line to buy it. I am extremely picky and after trying a whole slew of convertibles, I decided that the only tablet the I was going to use would be a slate. My main use of the tablet is note taking for college. Secondary uses would be web browsing and word processing.Pros:1) Amazing resolution! I actually upgraded to the newer models and was very dissapointed that they lowered the resolution on their tablets. I went back to the LE1700 primarily because of this reason.2) Extremely lightweight batteries. Spares can be easily carried around without adding much weight.3) With the SSD is runs like a modern laptop. Fast and efficient. A MAJOR upgrade from the built-in 4200rpm drive4) Lightweight5) Fingerprint reader, bluetooth6) PriceCons:1) None?Hope this helps!Mark
