So disappointed in this Google Tablet purchase - AVOID, IT IS LIKELY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CHARGE after just a few months of use. We'd bought a ASUS Google Nexus factory reconditioned (our mistake), and it worked for only 4 months of light use before the port quit charging. A google search (ironic, I know) reveals literally thousands of other users that encounter the same problem. The only solution is a very expensive repair (which will only restore it to the original flawed design) or to purchase a docking station, which has it's own problems and mixed reviews. It may or may not charge unless you sit and hold it down on the charger. On top of that, sellers are scalping users because the problem is so common - docking stations prices have increased from $40 to 70- $95 IF you can find one in stock for the very same, reportedly cheaply made dock. This is a nightmare - we thought we had a great Christmas gift for my grandson, and instead it is essentially trash. Shame on you Asus and Google.
