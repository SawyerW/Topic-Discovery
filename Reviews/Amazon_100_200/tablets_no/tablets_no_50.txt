I purchased this for a grandson...his older brother has a nook...with a long road trip to Florida looming at end of month...something was needed! I set it up for him..and it seems to be a nice tablet...a camera app has to be downloaded to use the camera...something I think should have been on the device on arrival..but have that squared away..it plays fast for games, which is the primary use of course... this does not have a micro card slot...but I just hooked it up to my laptop and downloaded four movies easily...with loads of memory to spare! I feel this is a great tablet for the money! Youtube is the way to go for help...and...although I don't have it set up yet...this device can be used as a phone when properly set up...will be doing that on the next visit to Grammy's!
