My fiance was in the market for a new e-reader. It would be her first one, so I thought I'd get her a nicer one that she'd probably buy herself as a Christmas gift. After doing the research and speaking with owners of both the Nook HD and Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook. Then in conversation with my fiance, she basically said she'd taking the gift cards that her students gave her to buy a Kindle (much to my dismay). In her mind, she thought the basic model Kindle was better than the basic Nook. So I had to spoil the surprise so she wouldn't buy the Kindle. However, once she started using the Nook HD, she was blown away! Now she thanks me everyday because her reading (and internet browsing) experience is so much better than she had hoped for.
