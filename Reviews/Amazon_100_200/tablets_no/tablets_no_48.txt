We have 3 of these in my house now.  It's a nice size, easily portable.  My husband and I got ours when they were first available, and there is still nothing that it won't run.  My son just got a great deal on this model last week, and is also loving it.  The only negative thing I have to say is that for me, I didn't like using it as an e-reader.  There are some great apps for reading, but I didn't like the back lit screen for reading at night.  For anyone who wants Android, this is a great tablet.
