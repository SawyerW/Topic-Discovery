My i Pad is a wonderful product, I am happy I bought it.It is easy to use, as intuitive as can be, and is a delight to own and use.So far, (two weeks after delivery), I ha ve downloaded a few games, plus chess, and a book, plus my subscription to two magazines.The iPad is kind of like a cyber-friend, it is there at the ready to play or do whatever, just like a happy puppy.  As a matter-of-fact, were I in charge of product-naming at Apple, this thing would have been named the iPuppy, it is just a fun creation all the way.Had I to do it again, I would repeat the purchase.Dan Elliott Jr.
