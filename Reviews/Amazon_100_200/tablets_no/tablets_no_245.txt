The iPad is a wondeful fun device great for casual web browsing and such.  The interface is typical Apple excellence and the quality of the device seems quite good.It most certainly is not a laptop replacement.  Two absolute killers are that you cannot run MS Office and printing anything is pretty much a joke.  Yes, there are applications that sort of kind of read and write Office files but they are very limited.  Printing can also be done as long as you get an application, save this way and that, stand on your head and hope for the best.  Again, it is fun and cool as all get-out but not a business machine.
