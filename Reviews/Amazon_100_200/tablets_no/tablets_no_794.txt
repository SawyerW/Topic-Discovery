Destroyed my laptop in a usual manner - drop from the counter.  Bought an iPad 2 and tried to use it as a laptop replacement.  I did last several months and didn't really feel that my range was somehow limited.  Eventually I purchased a laptop to use on a long trip.  It was a huge relief to go back to a bigger screen, fixed keyboard, windowed environment, and faster processing speeds.iPad is a revolutionary device and I find its design and build quality outstanding.  However, once the novelty wears off, it becomes apparent that it is best at supplementing your other mobile devices, not completely replacing them.The device is also fragile, so make sure to buy a sturdy case, especially if you plan to use your device in the field.
