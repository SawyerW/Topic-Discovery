This stand is great.  I was concerned that it would not hold the iPad with the case but it does.  It looks sharp and it works great.I can use it while seated in the Living Room and as a music jukebox or digital picture frame in the Dining Room and mainly as a permanent stand in the bedroom so I can recharge it and use an Alarm clock app.  I will probably need another stand!The only problem I have is that $60 seems a bit much.  But that's just me.  I was going to give it 4 stars but since I got free shipping I bumped it back up to 5.A nice solid product.
