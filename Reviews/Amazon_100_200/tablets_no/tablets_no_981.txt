I am a yoga teacher. I use this to capture new student contact info, keep attendance records, refer to pose cheat sheet, and play music during meditation. I also read a lot on it. I love having an extensive library at my fingertips. An incredible number of classics are free on iBooks, Kindle and Gutenberg.org as are lesser known works by the authors of those classics. The camera is not so hot, but I have a good camera. This one will do in a pinch. The other capabilities more than make up for the camera's deficiencies. The Facebook app makes viewing all the photos that go by on Facebook a wonderful experience. National Geographic is gorgeous on this thing.
