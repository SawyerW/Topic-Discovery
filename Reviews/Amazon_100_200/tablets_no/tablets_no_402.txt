If your on the fence about purchasing this item, then you should get it. At first I was leery. I thought it was an oversized, overpriced iPod, but it is so much more. This item is one of the greatest a person can get over the holidays. It is a mini computer that works faster, and much more conveniently. It has wifi connections for easy access, as well as easy typing. I'm writing this review from it and my typing speed is almost par with usual.On top of this the iPad holds a bundle of useful items. Any app can be downloaded and used. Most teachers in high school are fine with students using it in class, such as to record lectures. The recording works excellently by the way. This item is easy access and takes moments unlike most computers. The music quality is excellent, and the gaming is wonderful.Purchase it and in the first night it will give you your moneys worth.
