I too had read quite a few negative reviews on the device but most were from people expecting too much out of it for what it claimed to do and for the money. Remember, you get what you pay for. The Cruz Reader is a super deal in that you can access the internet, it's in color and you can read on it. Only comes with a Borders reading app and the Nook app was a pain to install, but you can google anything and get advice on how to install it. My only minor complaits are the very slow startup, short battery life, and a pretty crappy operating manual. But I did get a pretty quick reply back from technical support when I asked them a question. Other than that, I've been very happy with it for $118.
