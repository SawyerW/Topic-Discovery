While the Nexus 7 (2012) is now over a year old, the tablet is very powerful. Being a Nexus device makes it all the more tantalizing. If you like HTC's Sense, or Samsung's Touchwiz, that's good and all for you, but I prefer the clean Android experience. The stock Android interface makes it a fantastic bit 'o hardware out of the box, and the battery is in good shape. My mom's had hers a year now.Now for the bit that I like. I'm an Android modder at heart. I value devices that are as open as possible, and the Nexus 7 is a perfect device in that regards. You can compile your own Android flavors easily for it, or download just about any ROM on the market. Furthermore, that makes it perfect for developing apps as well.The bad? Well, no rear-view camera, and that's about it. To be fair, I almost NEVER use the rear-facing camera on my Nexus 10, but being able to use it for photosphere would be nice.
