I bought this recently and I am completely satisfied with it. The HD screen is gorgeous and I was amazed at how slick it moves on your fingertips. I thought the design looked boring when looking at it online but I think it looks great in person. The price is reasonable and I found reading to be very easy wit the ability to edit pages in an eBook and zoom in on text while using Google chrome. Chrome is also fantastic; it works just as well as it does on PCs. The only thing that bugs me a little is the fact that there's only one camera. Taking pictures of anything but yourself is difficult because of this. I seriously don't think its a big deal though. I'm just happy to have a camera.Overall, this is a beautiful device and everything about it satisfying to me. The screen is amazing, as well as the experience of watching shows and movies. The reading is great, the sound quality is great too. The apps are nice too. Basically everything is as it should be. I recommend it if you have the cash.
