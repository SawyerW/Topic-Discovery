I tried two Nexus 7's and had to return both.  First one was extremely difficult to unlock and once it was unlocked the touchpad wouldn't work.  Nothing happened when you pressed the icons or tried to swipe and the screen just flipped out.  Second only just wouldn't turn on, despite charging it overnight.  When I returned it there was someone else there returning his Nexus 7 for the 3rd time for similar reasons!  He also said his wife had returned her's twice.  After doing further research I come to find out that apparently this is a common problem, so I'm not sure how this tablet gets such good reviews.
