It is perfect for what I wanted.  It does everything my laptop does but it is slow.  I wanted something I could put in my purse and take with me and this is great.  I can read books on it, play games and surf the net.  I could not use the directions because they were too small for me to read and the type written instructions did not cover basics.  It covered only problems with the computer.  I would highly recommend this to people who are just looking for something to use to pass the time away when waiting at the doctors or other places.
