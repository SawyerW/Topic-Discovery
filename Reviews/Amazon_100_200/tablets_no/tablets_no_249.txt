Except for my iPod - probably my favorite device of all time - I'd never had an Apple product before now, and I really like the 32GB, Wifi iPad2. It does exactly what's claimed for it and more. It's lightweight, easy to handle, and easy to use. As for the smart cover, it's probably the best product innovation in several years by any device maker. The access to the large and rapidly increasing # of apps, of course, puts it in a class far removed from everything else in its category. I like it so much, in fact, that when my Dell laptop died a couple of weeks ago, I bought a MacBook, that - so far at least - seems equally intuitive and pleasant to use.
