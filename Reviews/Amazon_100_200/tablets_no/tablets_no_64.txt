Excellent tablet, I love it! This is the older (pre-2013) model but it's plenty fast and has a beautiful clear display. I opted for the 32MB version thinking I would want the extra memory but after using it I think most people (including me) would be fine with 16MB. I have seen and tried several somewhat cheaper tablets but none come even close to this in screen display and performance, especially for the price. I've seen some negative reviews but I've never had any complaint with it. I keep a cover on it and have dropped it several times on hard floors (read that as concrete) but never a problem. Battery life is great also, even with WiFi on all the time. I am very pleased with this tablet.
