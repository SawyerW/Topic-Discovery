I purchased this about three weeks prior to Christmas and it was out of stock!  A week prior to Christmas I contacted the company and told them that I wanted to cancel the order because it was not going to be here on time for Christmas Day.  I then received a prompt response that they were going to get a shipment within a couple of days and they would express ship the item AT NO EXTRA COST TO ME!!!  Received the item in time for Christmas and was BETTER than expected.  Base is a heavy and metal.  Perfect for the iPad 2, which is what we are using it for.  FANTASTIC ITEM, FANTASTIC SELLER!
