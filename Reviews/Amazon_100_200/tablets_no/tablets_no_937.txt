Most people are aware that iPads don't run Flash based content.IPad has its own YouTube browser to compensate for this design flaw.However, no one mentions that you can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone!!!There are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.Java is still #1 or #2 language in the world for developing applications.Because Apple had an internal war with Adobe and Sun, the consumers suffer and received a product that has a limited feature set.Check with this url [...]Steve Jobs has been quoted as saying "Java's not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It's this big heavyweight ball and chain."What is interesting to know is that Android phones and tables are running mostly Java applications... so Java is really not dead, but Apple is pretending to ignore the competition like they did in the 90's and think that Microsoft Windows was only a passing fad...
