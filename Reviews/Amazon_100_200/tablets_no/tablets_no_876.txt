I have never purchased anything electronic, I am totally old school.  Anyway, after contemplating on buying this or not, I went for it.  I can't tell you how happy I have been.  It is so convenient, easy to use, easy to buy apps and my kids absolutely love it.  they are 3 and 5 and think it's the best thing ever!  They want one for each of them.  They have spent more time on it playing games than I have used it since purchasing it.  I already have 38 kid game aps on it as well as many TV and movies.  it's great for the car.
