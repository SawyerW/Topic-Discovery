I was looking forward to getting an inexpensive off-brand tablet that came rooted and appeared to be comparable(hardware wise -cpu/processor & ram)to the more expensive brand-name tablets. It worked fine for about a week then the touchscreen started becoming unresponsive occasionally, which was usually fixed with a reboot. The touchscreen became totally unresponsive after about 2 weeks. After trying to reset/reinstall the firmware unsuccessfully, I concluded that it is a hardware issue. It is a cheap off-brand implementation of a tablet, I don't recommend buying this one. Other reviewers have noted this same issue on similar tablets so it's probably a good idea to check them out before buying.
