Sure the iPad is the hit of the over-16 set, but if you have younger children, it's a fantastic educational and entertainment device.  The range of educational apps is extensive, at reasonable rates, and there are several free entertainment apps (Carl and the Talking Cat are two favorites).  We're going to invest in some physical protection for our Gen-1 iPad, to ensure that little hands don't drop it or scratch the case, but otherwise, it's easily used by kids as young as 4 years old.One other suggestion regarding accessories:  we purchased the docking station/keyboard for our Gen-1, but the number of kid-friendly apps that need a keyboard or need the screen to be propped-up are few.  This may be obvious, but the docking station only props up the iPad in portrain mode, not landscape;  this accessory is more for mom & dad than little ones.In terms of the additional features missing from our iPad, but present in the iPad 2, we don't miss any of them.Martin Ahlijanian
