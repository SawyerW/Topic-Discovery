I got mine today and been having fun playing with it.  the best thing for you to do when you get it is get online and read all the reviews.  the reviews helped me alot with ideas on what to download and where to find it so thanks!  it's slow i'm not going to lie but it costs give or take $100 so seriously what do you expect.  a little patients and it's a really fun toy.  i love it and it frees up my laptop for my husband when i want to read.  i had a hard time finding an ereader that i could import books from my computer but with a little digging i found wordplayer and calibre and they are great.  really is a nice fun toy.  not for anyone who needs to do serious work or anything but fun and the battery life is great.  i would buy another in a heartbeat.
