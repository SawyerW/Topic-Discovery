I just  love my ipad2 the only problems i found was it doesn't have an agreement with adobe flash so some videos would not play but I bought the iswifter browser in the app store for $5 and now i can view any video I want.  then to upload pics they have to either be taken with the ipad or use itunes so I bought a memory card adapter that fit on here for only $2.78 on ebay and now I can upload my pics no problem. also it was interactive with Twitter only and not Facebook bit with updating to the ios6 that corrected that. love the app store. my husband has a kindle fire so i can tell you this is much nicer than that and the app store is way better. i also bought the smart cover as it puts it to sleep while not using. the battery really does last 10 hours, it has never ran down on me and i use it every day
