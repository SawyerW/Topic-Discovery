I chose to get the Xoom over the iPad2 mostly to try something different. The iPad might have a better interface and more apps, but I really wanted something more than a bigger version of my iPhone. Plus its nice experimenting with a new OS every now and then. I really like browsing the web, which is what I will use it for 95% of the time. It feels really good to see web pages like you would on your computer with Flash. So far I've been using it for 24 hours and I feel I have gotten used to navigating it. I'm pretty impressed with Android and how far it has come. I would have gave 5 stars if there were better apps and less bugs. But of course future updates should take care of that. I mean my first iPhone didn't have everything perfect right off the bat.
