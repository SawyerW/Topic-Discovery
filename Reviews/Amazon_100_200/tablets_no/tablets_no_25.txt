I purchased two Kindle tablets as gifts and decided I'd like to try one.  I chose the Nexus 7 because of the Android OS.  As soon as I logged in to my Google account, all of the Google based info was transferred to the tablet.  I was thinking I would spend hours manually entering my info.  It's fun and flexible.  I decided to go with the WiFi only because I primarily use it at home.  I also switched to an Android based phone and now it's linked to my tablet as well as my computer.  Last, there are hundreds of apps to choose from and you can download them from your computer directly to my tablet and phone.
