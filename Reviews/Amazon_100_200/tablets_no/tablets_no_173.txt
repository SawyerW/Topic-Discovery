I was very disappointed when my grandaughter opened this christmas gift, and it was damaged. We could not tell it was damaged,until she opened it. Of course she could not play it.I returned it on Dec. 28, 2012, and was told they would send a replacement. I have tracking records that say they received it on Jan. 3, and signed for it.Now I got an email this morning, saying they do not have the unit.I have ordered a LOT of items from Amazon, and this is the very first problem I have had. The problem is with ANGEL SELLERS, who sent out the damaged I PAD.The product was bent on the side, and it could not be used . What a letdownfor our grandaughter, she was so happy when she opened it, then found out we had to return it. Never thought it would take this long to get resolved.
