The ipad2 I ordered from amazon came very quickly, a lot faster than they expected. It was a 32 gb. This was for my 68 year old sister-in-law who has not used a computer. After a few instructions, she was able to pick up and use it, using face time to talk to her son abroad, nephews and grand nephews across the state, skyping, emails etc. She wanted to store pictures in it so we bought a usb cable to attached an external portable hard drive, and lo and behold, it doesn't eve see it. Apparently, apple products are not expandable as I thought. (I used an android operating system from verizon). So she is stuck with pictures in her sd card. So I told her to just store the pictures in sd cards. SD cards are not that cheap though but I don't see an alternative. She does not have a laptop at all. This is my only gripe with the Ipad.
