I consider myself a gadget guy - I've always enjoyed tinkering around with settings on everything to make it "mine".  Having a closely controlled environment has never been satisfying for me.  Enter the Xoom...I bought an iPad 2 for my wife and was considering getting one for myself but now I'm very glad I didn't.  Only the Xoom allows me to make the tablet "mine".  Don't get me wrong...the iPad is a nice consumer tablet for the masses...but the Xoom is a power-user's tablet.  It can do anything the competition can and then some...with flash support and it's open source heritige.  While Honeycomb-optimized apps are lacking today given the explosive growth of Android this is surely going to change rapidly.  I've been very happy with my Xoom as I move into hour 25 of ownership.  If you've used Android on a phone before you'll be at home in the interface...and the longer you use it the more you learn.
