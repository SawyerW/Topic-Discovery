The best part about this tablet is how fast it is.  The Google Now feature alone is worth the price of admission.  I don't know how people can buy other tablets that are more expensive than this.  This is the best tablet ever made period.I give much credit to Amazon for introducing the Kindle Fire (which I also own) at such a low price point which has now spawned affordable tablets for the masses and without it we would not have the Nexus 7.If you are looking to see what Android is like this device will make you a believer.  Only thing to complete my Android arsenal is getting my hands on a Nexus 4.  Currently using a T-Mobile G2 (HTC Vision).
