I recently picked up the 16 gig wifi version at the local Verizon store for $299. I've been following the iPad and iPad 2 for quite a while and finally decided to pick one up because it hit the right price point.I already have an iPhone and a nice laptop, so the iPad is more of a luxury item than anything. It's nice to use on the couch to mindlessly use the Internet and read news articles. It's also been great to take on a trip, as it's much lighter and smaller than a laptop.But there is no way I would pay $500 or more for what is essentially a device that I don't need (which is why I got this instead of the iPad 2). It's a cool toy, and if you've got money to spend, go for it. Otherwise, don't fall for Apple's genius marketing; there's not a thing about this product that justifies its purchase at $500.
