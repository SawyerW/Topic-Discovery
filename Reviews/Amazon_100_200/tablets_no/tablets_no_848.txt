To start things off, I have both the iPad and iPad 2.  I agree with most of the reviews stating "If you own the first one, you can skip the 2nd".  The iPad 2 is faster but the iPad 1 is still pretty darn fast.  The only only reason why I bought the iPad 2 was for the front facing camera which is pretty cool.For the gamers I downloaded Deadspace, which is designed to take advantage of the iPad 2's enhanced graphics.  I have to say it's a good looking game and should start to scare Microsoft and Playstation since Apple is starting to further encroach on the gaming market.  I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.  The only thing really holding the iPad back gaming wise is the lack of a bluetooth controller, I hate using the screen as a controller!If you don't own an iPad I definitely recommend you buy one, it's pretty amazing :P.  Apple has been a game changer for computers and phones for a reason.
