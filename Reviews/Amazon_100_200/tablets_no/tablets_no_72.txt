This device has only a front camera.  It has no slot for memory expansion, unlike the 16GB version.  The speaker works when it feels like it.  The touchscreen works 85% of the time with about the same accuracy.The battery lasts for about 7 hours of use, so that's great.Had I known the improved Nexus 7 that fixes all of these issues was coming out, I would not have wasted the money on this one.As it is, it can not be returned.  (That may depend on the seller.  I will not do business with the company that fulfilled my order again.)I have no idea what is supposed to make the Nexus 7 so much better than the MemoPad which can be bought for 1/2 the price.
