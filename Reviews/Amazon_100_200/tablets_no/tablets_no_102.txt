Slow to load pages compared to all the other tablets in our household My main problem is B&N; told me we could use gift cards to buy ebooks without adding a credit card to the account and that was very important since it was going to my youngest daughter and I didn't want her accidently buying books on credit. YOU CAN NOT BUY BOOKS WITHOUT ADDING A CREDIT CARD TO YOUR ACCOUNT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE B&N; GIFT CARD CREDIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT. Online customer service told me the store would refund my gift card I went to the local store where I purchased the nook and gift card , they would not refund my gift card. So for $20 they get this negative review and lost a customer for life since they lied to me twice.
