At work we have been exploring making pod cast. I felt I couldn't understand the process without reviewing so I decided to purchase this ipad. I contacted Apple 3 days off and on to get set up and 80% of the time techs had patience and understanding as we problem solved and reached some understanding. I have taken it from DC to Orono Maine in the few weeks I have used it and I find it protable and useful for taking notes, checking email, surfing and I gotta admit playing doodle and manging photos. I am just begining to understand the 3 g wifi differences I have blown through my monthly $25 dollars worth of data time in 2 weeks and I am trying to decide if I need a bigger plan or to manage my access differently.
