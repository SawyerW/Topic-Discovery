Great product.  I ordered it as a second computer for a deployment; works great.  Especially good for Kindle for PC when used in tablet mode.  I was concerned about the hinge prior to purchase, but it has turned out to be very sturdy.  Great for use when you have work to do, but not alot of room.  I definitely reccommend purchasing the Windows Home Premium upgrade; tablet mode was useless without it.  Also, a RAM upgrade is nice, but not essential.  There is some bloatware on the machine, but it is easy to remove.  The Lenovo programs are, IMO, worthless.  Get rid of the "Natural Touch" ASAP.  It starts every time the machine is swiveled into tablet mode, and isn't helpful at all.  I definitely reccommend waiting until you have the machine before buying a carrying case or sleevve; standard netbook cases don't fit, so take it with you to the store before getting one.
