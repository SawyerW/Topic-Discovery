Firstly, the shipping was excellent from Amazon.  I thought this would be a good media player as well as a game player for my travels, however it has locked up several times just switching between screens.  There a very few apps for this device.  When I opened a movie after transferring to device it was jerky and the sound and the place in the scene were not in sync. I had to turn the device off and on several times to fix it.  I have purchased Archos products in the past and sadly I say this has been the by far worst purchase.  The touch screen is the worst of any devise I have used.  Save your money this product is not worth buying at any price.
