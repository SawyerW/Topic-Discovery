Very classy, very simple to use, very stable. I saw the other reviews saying the prior model was heavier and more stable, so I guess it depends on your lifestyle. I find this plenty heavy and plenty stable. I wouldn't really want it any heavier. I like that you just put the ipad on it, or pick it up, no clips or anything else to fuss with. And it looks like a piece of modern sculpture, so you can leave it out all the time and it doesn't detract. BTW, if you have the apple ipad cover (magnetic), when you flip the cover open it will attach to the stand, so if you want stable, that's stable like its glued to the stand. I looked at everything out there, choose this one, and was happy from the get-go.
