I have had this Archos 7 home tablet since B4 Christmas. 3 weeks later and the appslib site has been working for 12 hours out of the entire time I have had it. When you call, the company tells you they are working on the problem. First, the problem was too many people logging into the site after Christmas. OK, I'll believe that. Whats the problem Jan 3rd? Apps site is still down!!! I logged in a week ago, downloaded a few apps. I didn't like them so I deleted them and researched the ones I wanted. When I went back, the site was down, and it has been down ever since. Archos 7 Home tablet is useless without apps. I got it as a gift and would love to return it. Not worth $50 let alone $200!!! Sorry not happy.
