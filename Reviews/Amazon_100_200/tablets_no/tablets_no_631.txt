This thing is a piece of garbage... Especially if you are trying to surf the internet. it runs so slow and jerky that it is almost unbearable. I almost never use it. It does however play movies well if you turn off all the services that take any resources. Also the camera takes nice videos and pics.I would love to return it and get my money back. Hp doesn't do jack about its lack of performance either. Windows 8 upgrade would be nice but sadly hp doesn't support that and its not like there is a cd player for an upgrade on your own.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... YOU WILL BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED
