I bought this for my husband, as a wedding gift from me to him actually, he loved it and we have not stopped using it since it came into our lives. The reason I went to online purchase is because at the time it was really difficult to get your hands on one of these bad boys in stores. I would have had to camp out and hope that there were enough to go around. I couldnt do that at the time (planning a wedding) so I decided to purchase it online. The ipad is awesome. Fast, the battery lasts forever, and it picks up wifi quickly and efficiantly. We love it and use it all the time.
