I received the Ipad promptly and in excellent condition. No problems with the setup and everything worked out of the box. Added the leather cover, (ridiculously overpriced for what you get), also bought screen protectors, (impossible to install without at least a few specks of dust to frustrate you), and a protective rubber plastic case to go over the back. I did have a few instances where once you turned off the cellular modem you could not get reconnected without turning it back on and rebooting. However, that has not been an issue for the last several weeks and the modem gets turned on and off several times a day. Either i have been lucky or they fixed the glitch. There is no help manual to accompany the Ipad. I located one through Apple's support site and downloaded the .pdf to the Ipad. I would strongly recommend that anyone looking to purchase an Ipad read the manual while they are waiting for the unit to arrive. It is not as intuitive as I would have liked for someone who is not familiar with Apple products.
