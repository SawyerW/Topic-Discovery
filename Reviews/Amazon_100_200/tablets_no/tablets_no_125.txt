I was very excited to get a great deal on a 'new' IPad 2.  I called Amazon to make sure that the item was indeed new.  They assured me that yes, it was.  I received my 'new' iPad 2 today and surprise, surprise, it was filled with apps already, and still had someone's else photos and emails in it.  Had it been advertised as used, I would have expected this.  This seller needs to be clear about what he or she is actually selling.  The fact that they did not even remove the previous owners information made it worse.  Beware of this seller!!!!
