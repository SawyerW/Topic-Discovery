The Cruz Reader is just that, a e-book reader. It is not a I Pad clone. It operates on the android 2.0 operating system but is not really meant to be used as a tablet. On the plus side, it has Wi-fi and you can surf the web and download apps from the Cruz market. On the negative side, the touch-pad is resistive touch which demands a firm push on the screen. I Pad and the Samsung Android clone, use capacitive touch which only requires a light finger tap. Again, this is a E-book reader, and in this area you can't beat the price. It comes with Border books app and you can download the Barnes& Noble e-book app, as well as the Amazon Kindle app. There is also an app for e-pubs, so you can get e-books from your local library. the battery last about 10-12 hours for reading books, which is great for plane trips... but the battery doesn't last anywhere as long as a dedicated nook reader or like device.
