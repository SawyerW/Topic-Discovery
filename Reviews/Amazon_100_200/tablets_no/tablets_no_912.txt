When the IPAD first came out I wrote it off as just a big IPOD Touch.  But over a year later I was given a great deal on one and went for it and I'm glad I did.  Since October I can't recall a day where I haven't picked mine up.  My only regret is I wish I would've gotten the 32gb model instead of the 16gb because your space will be eaten up fast.  All I'm saying is if you're on the fence about one go ahead and take a dive.  I use mine for browsing, reading comics, watching Hulu, occasional games, listening to music and reading books.  Sometimes I have to put it down just to take in the world around me.  Originally I had a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and while I enjoyed it, I made the switch to the Ipad for the overwhelming amount of applications.  Tablets are the future IMO and with the Ipad you really can't go wrong.
