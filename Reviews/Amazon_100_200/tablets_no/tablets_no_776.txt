I purchased a "NEW" I pad 2, with verizon wifi. When we tried to connect to wifi, it would not work.we took it to an apple store, they informed us that it was a "refurbished" Ipad.  it even had a barcodesticker on the back with a date on it, the gentleman at the apple store punched in the barcode # and itshowed that the person who had it previously also had problems with the wifi.  He also told us that Ipadsdo not come with barcode stickers on the back.  needless to say we were not happy that we paid $590 for a"NEW" Ipad and recieved a refurbished one.  So check the back of your Ipad, if there is a barcode stickeron the back IT IS NOT a new Ipad, FYI. I will keep you updated when and if we get our refund.
