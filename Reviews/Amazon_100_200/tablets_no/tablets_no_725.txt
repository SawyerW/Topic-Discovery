I didn't purchase my Ipad from Amazon. I thought I add a review. I  am not too computer savvy,  the reason I purchased an IPad is for simple Internet use and watching shows and movies and going through my emails so far I can barely order on Amazon or open my emails. it does not support flash so not everything opens. also I have a hard time copying and pasting. It does not copy and if it does it's 50/50 chance of it working. My kid has a tablet kindle and it does a lot more than the IPad. I heard there's ways of fixing problem by purchasing Apps etc. I am still unhappy and I want my money back. My laptop is a better bargain.
