Loved the screen, but had problems from day 1 with loading from a European SD card. Apple shop spent over 2 1/2 hours trying to sort it out, but finally I transferred items to my Windows PC and then via the ITunes app onto the IPad. Stupid. The Apple store's Geniuses were worthless. Once working it lost the Economist magazine which I downloaded after two days!! Each time I hooked up the same pc it wanted to verify it was approved, but I needed to be on the internet to do this - and I was travelling.  Apple IPad is more of a sour apple to me. Wish I never bought it, and waited until they sorted out the kinks.
