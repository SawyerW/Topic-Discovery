Surfing the web is compromised by Apple in favor of their apps, sometimes free sometimes not.  The cost of apps may eventually minic the ATM move from a free to fee structure.Many sites require adobe flash which is not available for the ipad forcing the user to do without or to find an equilivent  app. This app represents the website and may not include all information.  In the end the user jumps between apps and websites, segmenting their web surfing experience, and wasting time.  I have experienced these issues on educational site, real estate and shopping sites and frequently use my laptop instead.Another limitation:  The only access to the iPad is through iTunes which is controlled by Apple.I would recommend an android or a macbook.
