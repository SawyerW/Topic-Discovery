We got this iPad because it can read my husbands text books out loud to him (which helps with the absorption of the massive amounts of material he has to read for grad school) but the rest of us have fallen in love with it too. I like it because its quick and easy to grab and read blogs or look up a recipe and its not nearly as hard to type on as I was afraid it might be. And it is my very best friend when it comes to road tripping with our 3 year old. Road trips went from being a terror to a very enjoyable experience with the iPad (We got an Otterbox Defender case to keep it safe when the kid has it).
