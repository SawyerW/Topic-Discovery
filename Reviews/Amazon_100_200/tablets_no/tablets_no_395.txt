I cant help but think the Ipad is a glorified Iphone but love its ability to play media and be used as a book reader.  The big negative for me is the inability to see any Flash product and all those web sites that run FLASH. I know Apple hates FLASH but really if you cant see thousands of web sites and the product is designed to browse the web I cant help but feel the customer has been placed into this fight and for $700 dollars I think it serves to only upset apple customers. I wish they would fix this and quick.  I don't want a $700 book reader or DVD player.
