I have never used or owned any apple product till my husband surprised me with my Ipad for Christmas.  Honestly I thought why do I need this I'll never use it.  However now I'm in love the touch screen is awesome adding a whole new level to games and the app store has enough to last me a lifetime.  I also love how fast it comes on unlike my notebook that takes forever and the ease of opening and closing programs is effort less.  Apple definitely did the right thing when creating this amazing product I only hope more people try it and realize the amazing product they are missing out on.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
