Absolutely awesome product and service. So new college school year I needed another Pc (software programming student). Bought a tablet gadget (basically a big cell phone) just for mobile surfing and also bought this. Out of all of the computers and web capable gadgets I have (8) this is by far my favorite of my arsenal. I purchased refurbished because I thought why not if it IS junk I will just use it for its parts. Very glad it turned out the way it did. Looked into this and its features and what the seller was offering as bonuses with it has been well worth it. When it arrived (fast I must say) I can say after using it I was truly amazed.  The seller was the best part of the transaction the young gentleman that I dealt with was very understanding, patient, and informative about what was to be expected throughout the whole thing.  So in the end I love PC and look forward to do more business with this particular Dell service provider.  Also yes i am a real person reviewing a real product.
