I bought this tablet for may daughter. The first one I bought was good. There was an accident and the company was great about replacing it. The second tablet arrived shortly but it didn't last long. The battery in the second unit would not charge. Eventually she couldn't use it even if it was plugged in. The camera, wi-fi, ect. worked great. I would recommend this tablet for minimal use or maybe as a back up kind of thing. Bubblestar was easy to deal with on returns. The only thing is you have to pay return shipping, which can be a little pricey. In the end I wound up buying another brand of tablet. So far, so good on that one.
