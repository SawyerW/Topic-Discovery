This is a wonderful device. I'm barely using my laptop anymore (only at the office.)I did an experiment and tried to spend the entire day with the ipad without resorting to my macbook pro.Things I did that day:1- checked my mail, replied to messages, forwarded messages2- Opened excel sheets, power point presentations3- opened video attachments, viewed pictures4- edited excel sheets, modified presentations5- browsed the internet (atomic is a great browser that has tabbed browsing and which is free.)6- chatted on skype, had voice calls and conf calls7- facebook8- had msn conversations and chatsThe only things I couldn't do with the ipad was power usage things such as convert video files, etc...Highly recommended, and brings unlimited freedom!
