I have been an owner of an Apple iPad 2 (64GB AT&T; 3G) since the date of it's first released in the US on March 11, 2011. After more than two years of heavy use both personally and professionally I can say the Apple iPad changed my life. It is without a doubt one of the most innovative, useful, and powerful products on the market. That was true in April of 2010 when Apple released the first iPad, and it remains true to this day. An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy. Why wait - BUY APPLE!
