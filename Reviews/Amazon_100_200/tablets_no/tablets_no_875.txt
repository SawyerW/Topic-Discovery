I must admit I have not tested any other tablets. Nonetheless, ever since I got the iPad, I have been using it for a range of tasks, focusing mainly on reading magazines and books. I travel often, and the iPad allows have everything I might want to read on a trip in one, which also happens to be lighter and more compact than most books out there. The only drawback is that typing on this machine is slow since you have to keep an eye on the keyboard at all times, but this holds true for all other tablets, and its easily fixed by purchasing an external keyboard if typing is essential to you. A must have accessory for this item is some sort of protective case. I have two, apple's sponsored screen protector (which conveniently locks the ipad when shut), and a sleeve for traveling, so that I can easily put it in my backpack when traveling.
