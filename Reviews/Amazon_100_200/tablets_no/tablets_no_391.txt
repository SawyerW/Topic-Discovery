Unless you really want to take pictures (without flash), make calls to other people with FaceTime, or want a bit slimmer model, get the iPad 1st Generation.  I just purchased mine yesterday (16g 3g version...which 16g is plenty for me unless you are downloading a lot of music and videos) and I couldn't be happier.  For one, it works the exact same way as the iPad 2 but is about $200 cheaper (depending where you look).  It sure did beat having to wait 5 weeks for an iPad 2 and provides the same level of satisfaction.  Be a smart consumer and don't buy into Apple's great product advertisement. You will not regret it!
