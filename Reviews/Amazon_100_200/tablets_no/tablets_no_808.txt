I am more than pleased with my new ipad2.  I struggled with the decision to buy it but it was a good decision.One unexpected plus was I found it was so easy to use the free Kindle app to move all my Kindle books over to the iPad.  Now I can read from either device and my husband and  I don't fight over the Kindle anymore.One negative is that I was  surprised and disappointed that there was no user's manual included.  At the price one pays I think it is pretty cheap of Apple to not include a manual . . . What other device or piece of equipment that costs $600+ doesn't come with instructions for use?
