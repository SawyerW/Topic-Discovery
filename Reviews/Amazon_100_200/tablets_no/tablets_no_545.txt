My order arrived very quickly and as always I am happy with Amazon's speed in getting my orders out.But the ease and speed of the Velocity Micro Cruz Reader (VMC) leaves something to be desired. I have downloaded books via Amazon, and then tried to download a game with no success (memory full -- seriously?  two books and the memory is full??)It is very heavy compared to the IPad, which seems weightless by comparison. (However, compared to the cost of the IPad, I would still choose the VMC or an equivalent).Apparently this is not the same Cruz Reader I previewed at Best Buy.  This one requires a stylus rather than having a true touch screen and I have a lot of difficulty connecting to FaceBook and I still can't get email to work.  Probably my own fault for not reviewing it enough before purchasing it.  I should have opted for a slightly higher priced model.  Since I have an Android phone, I just thought the VMC would be equally as good.
