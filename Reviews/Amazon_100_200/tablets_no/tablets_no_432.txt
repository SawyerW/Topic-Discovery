I bought this iPad back in June and I must say I was very excited.  I've watched to keynote with Steve, but was quite disappointed the lack of features like a camera & 512mb Ram like the iPhone 4, (iPad has only 256mb of Ram).  But that didn't stop me from wanting one as a travel companion.As soon as I opened it up, I was just amazed on its beauty, 9.7" display was oh so gorgeous, OS ran smooth like silk.  I couldn't wait to download many many apps. I use this thing every single day, take it everywhere I go, for email, internet, reading, Netflix/video, games, notes, music, GPS, the list goes on!!I am pleased with my purchase, and I hope you future iPad owners are as well. :):DP
