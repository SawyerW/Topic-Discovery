Apple iPad (First Generation) MC349LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi + 3G)I was very unhappy when I received my two iPads and they came  with no sim card.  All others that I know that bought an iPad with wyfy plus 3G, the sim card was in the iPad and ready for the cellular data to be set up.  I had to find out where I could buy the sim card and purchase it.  The 4-g computer should state in their description of product that no sim card is included with the purchase of this product.  They were given as gifts and when they tried to set up the cellular data, surprise - NO SIM CARD!!!
