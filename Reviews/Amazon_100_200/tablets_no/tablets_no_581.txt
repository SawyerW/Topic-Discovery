I don't like apple, but if you are looking at this item get the Ipod touch instead. It does have a large screen, a speaker and it can be used with out the arbitrary restrictions that apple places on their products; those are the only pro's. It is glitchy and crashes often, don't breathe while it's docked or it will disconnect and cause a file corruption. The camera is useless, HD? not in the way you're expecting, battery drains while your not using it even while it's asleep. You will be happier with the Ipod touch, apple delivers on product quality even if they are corporate nannies.
