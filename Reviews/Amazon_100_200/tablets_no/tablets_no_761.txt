I found no where on Apple site to place a comment, so here it is.I have had the greatest experience in support I have ever had, I had a problem with my Ipad 2 because the screen was giving bad colors, after taking it to an apple store make an apppoinment and wait to be helped they replaced my ipad with a new one in less than 10 min.I would say that other companies still have a lot to learn from apple, so far the ipad has been a replacement from my laptop at home, I can answer mails, browse the internet, see movies and all I even move pictures to the ipad to be modified ( applications are cheaper and good at making basic modifications in pictures), it is all I ever wanted.. So if it is expensive , yes!!! is it worth it?? Yes!!! every penny .. Support is amazing!!! I would buy another one for my kids??? already !!!
