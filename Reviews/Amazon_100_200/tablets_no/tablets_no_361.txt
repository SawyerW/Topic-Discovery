We had to return it since it did not have a camera (it was a gift and she wanted the camera) also was only up to 5 ios so I could not do any of the apps i wanted to download. The seller returned to us only $166, after we paid $233, he charged us for returning, for the charger even though I sent him the one he sent us and the rest was just greed! I will never purchase anything that valuable from Amazon, since the only reason I purchased here was because I though that you would protect me from such a stealing!Gianna Mayo
