Have owned my Ipad 2 less than two years; total cost @ $500. A few months ago, I started having trouble getting online with any available WiFi. Now, it will not access any WiFi signal. Same for Bluetooth. Nothing. I have been to the Genius Bar and spoke with techs online via my PC. We've tried several different things to fix it; no help. The last thing I was told was to send it in for a total 're-fit': cost @ $250. Are you kidding me? Obviously, I am done with the iPad line all together and am currently researching my next tablet purchase. It will not be an Apple product.
