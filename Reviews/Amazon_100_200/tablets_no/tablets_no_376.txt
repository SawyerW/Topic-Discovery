I am in sales, in home sales with home improvement products. Originally, I purchased the iPad to use for this purpose.I have multiple power point presentations,that also have videos linked to several slides, the iPad handles all of this very well. The biggest benefit for me is not carrying a laptop around,and not having to carry cords and all the delays from booting up and then waiting on p point to load.it has been absolutely a wonderful tool.As a bonus the games and navigation apps are incredible on this.After having mine for 2 weeks, my wife decided she needed one for herself. She uses hers for educational apps for our grandchildren. She has been amazing, helping them learn and they are really enjoying it.The iPad is a wonderful tool , no telling what the future of these will lead to.For e mail and online activity, you can not beat the speed and the ability to use it anywhere.The only downside is....you have to buy one, no one offered to give me one. That's the only way it could be any better.
