I just received a new IPAD2 delivered for $510.90.I looked at Amazon no luck.  I tried Ebay, no luck. I tried Apple.com, Apple Store, and Best Buy.On Google I found J&R.com.;  Jaques at ext.1015 sold me a new iPad2 in black.  I paid $498.88 plus $12.02 for two-day UPS.  The iPad2 arrived in two weeks.  I paid no sales tax and no CA recycle fee.  They sell all models.This was a great experience.  Since then, I bought an easy set-up Medialink wireless router, a bargain Casecrown protective case, and a couple capacitive pens, all from Amazon. Everything a great deal.  Also, check out Amazon's price on the AppleCare Protection Plan.
