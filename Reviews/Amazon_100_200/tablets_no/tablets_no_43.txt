i love my Nexus 7 so far. i have been using it since Christmas. i have had no problems except the headset jack. many people are sending theirs back over this simple issue so i wanted everyone to know how to resolve it. I had read that the key to getting the jack port to work was to push the headset jack in until you hear it click. This never happened and I got minimal or no sound. i was about to send it back. Today I read that since the bottom of the Nexus 7 is angled, you need to insert the jack into the port at the same angle. Duh, it worked perfectly, clicked into place and voila, full sound and the jack will not pull out accidently. Yay! Happy customer.
