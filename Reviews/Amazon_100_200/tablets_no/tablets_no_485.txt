I bought this mainly to research on Android and was vastly disappointed with it. Right out of box, I noticed the back plastic cover makes a squeaking noise and you can see it is poorly installed with a lot of air gap between the cover and the back panel. I am so annoyed by the noise I even want to peel the cover off! Other disappointments:1. Display is not sharp enough.2. Touch screen is terrible. I have to hit more than a couple of times to get the letter I want. If you used any iPhone, you would be hugely disappointed by the slow response and lack of sensibity of the touch screen. What makes it worse is there is no physcial scroll buttons to compliment that. So good luck reading any multi-page website and trying to page up or down!I will definitely return this junk if Amazon still allows a full refund and I strongly advice you not to waste $200 on this crap.best regards,kevin
