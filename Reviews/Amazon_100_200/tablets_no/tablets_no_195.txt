What can I say - it's an iPad2 and it works beautifully, although it is disappointing they don't include a simple headphone and that the iPad won't charge off a PC's USB but I'll get over it.  Only complaint was the packaging from Amazon.  They put the product box in a shipping box designed for maybe 6-8 of these (size wise) with three "air pillows" - come on Amazon, it's an $850 product, could you maybe wrap it in bubble wrap?  or use 8-10 air pillows to encapsulate and protect it?  Apple box arrived with a crushed corner,(but no apparent damage to the contents) which indicates some degree of rough handling in transit, but hey, it's UPS.  They fall off conveyor belts and get tossed around in trucks.  Amazon has become much more challenged when it comes to protection of the merchandise with some simple and cheap bubble wrap.  To UPS's credit, they did put it in a plastic bag since it was pouring down cats and dogs.  I was a bit concerned I didn't have to sign for it, but fortunately I live in a good community.  Odd though...
