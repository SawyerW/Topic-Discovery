We recently ordered the iPad 2 from Amazon for our Daughter-in-Law's graduation from San Diego State University's graduate program in Nursing. We were very happy with the ordering and delivery experience. The iPad 2 is a viable alternative to the iPad 3 if pricing is an issue. The only sacrifices are in not having the Retina display and a lesser megapixel camera - the iOS software and apps are all the same. iPad 2 dimensions are the same as iPad 3 so all iPad accessories are transferable. We opted for the Verizon 3G version even though our daughter uses AT&T; cell phone service. You can do this because iPad 3G service can be activated without a long term contract and in general Verizon's data coverage is better than AT&T; in our daughter's service area.
