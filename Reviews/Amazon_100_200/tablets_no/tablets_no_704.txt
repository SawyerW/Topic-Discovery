I have had an iPad2 for roughly a year.  In that time, I have had to take it in for repairs twice.  The first time was when it was upgrading the OS software and simply stopped halfway through the process.  I plugged it in since I did not want it to die from lack of battery power.  Three days later, it was still at the same place in the download.  That was the first trip to the repair shop.  A week or two later, it is back and working great.  Now, about a month ago, it was at about 60% power so I plugged it in for the night.  That was the last I saw any life in the thing.  Since I do not have the receipt (it was a gift) and too much time has passed (even though much of the time was not necessarily in my possession), repairs are going to cost a bucket load.  The while that I had the iPad2 was pretty fun, but Heaven knows when I will see it again, and I believe that the information recorded on it will be gone.  So, short story, my experience is a two-star experience with Apple.
