Pros: It's an Apple, you know it will work, you know it has great support and customer service, what is not to love.Cons: It is a bit pricy but you pay for what you get. The only real con, and reason it is not 5 stars, is that we received a European power plug so I had to pay $4 to order a cheap replacement for it. No where in the description does it say non-U.S. or European plug.Another thing that was not as advertised is that it keeps asking for a SIM card as if we bought one that could be put on a cellular network when the description clearly says Wifi and does not list a carrier.
