I am a hardcore gadget geek. I love my Android phones over the iPhones. However, for the tablet (I have both the Nexus 7 and the iPad Mini), I still feel that the iPad Mini is a far better product.One of the first gripes I have with this device is the much poorer battery life compared to the iPad Mini. The battery is always 0 when I pick it up. And it's a pain to charge a tablet daily. That never happens with the iPads. Even if you don't use them for a few days the battery goes down much more slowly.Overall, though the Android tablets are closing the gap, the iPads still are still the best, unlike in the mobile phones.
