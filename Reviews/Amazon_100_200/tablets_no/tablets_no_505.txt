Reading some of the latest reviews, it appears that the company has changed the build on this stand, which is extremely disappointing. As noted in many of the other reviews, the version I received is a strong steel stand, able to stand up to full navigation on the ipad without moving around, and at the perfect angle for display. Upon receiving the stand, I was surprised by the weight, but the weight actually provides excellent stability for those not wanting to remove the ipad from the stand while navigating. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase, but if you are planning to make the purchase, you may want to contact the company to ask which version you are going to get. With the heavy gauge steel version, it is well worth the money.
