I purchased a 64 Gb Ipad with ATT #G specifically to help with a trip which I am making to my parents' ancestral town. Yandex maps (similar to Google Earth maps) are wonderful to help navigate in cities such as the one I am going to visit---Chernevitsi (AKA - Chernowitz). Only after I bought the system, I learned that I cannot use these 3D maps because Ipad does not support Adobe Flash. I pleaded with store representatives to give me a contact at Apple to see if there was any way aorund this. The staff say that there is no one else that I can speak to and that technical support will not be able to help. I even asked if there was someone perhaps in Russia who deals with Ipads who I could speak to. Apple reps essentially say "sorry Charlie" with a smile..."we are great and everything else is inferior". Well be ware...I really think Apple is a big overpriced marketing gimmick.
