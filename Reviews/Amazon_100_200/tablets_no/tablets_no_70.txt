I was looking for a tablet for multiple purposes. It came down to the Samsung tab 2 and the HP7. Then I saw the google nexus 7 on sale and looked at it again. The one I got had 32gb and the newer jellybean 3.2 (Tab 2 had an older OS.). Mine has since been upgraded to the newest 3.2. It does everything well.  I would give it 4&1/2 * if I could instead of 5* because of 2 deficits.  1. It has only a front camera and no rear camera. If you want a tablet that you can carry about and take pictures with, this is not for you. 2. I read some journals that have Ipad apps but no Android Apps. I can still read them with the Nexus (off the internet), but it would be better if they had Android Apps, or presently on an Ipad.
