I have previously used a 7' Samsung Tab which after two years of heavy use was ready to be consigned to a peaceful rest. After reading numerous reviews on available small pad options I purchased the Asus Nexus 7. It has now been in use for about 2 months and so far so good. It is easy to use, fast enough and seems very reliable. The calender function is excellent are the email and internet functions. For my purposes which are essentially limited to internet, reading and sending brief emails, reading books and maintaining my calender it is proving a worthy sucessor to the Samsung.
