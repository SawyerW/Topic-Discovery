I love the item but three weeks in I am already having problems with it. It is doing crazy things. Not letting me return by using the home button, when I am in e-mail and deleting it kicks me out! I have already been on the phone with Apple and believe I will have to return the item for repair or replacement. When I contacted manjatech thru amazon where it was purchased. they did not want anything to do with me after 15 days. And of course it took more than 15 days for me to get the product and really start using it!
