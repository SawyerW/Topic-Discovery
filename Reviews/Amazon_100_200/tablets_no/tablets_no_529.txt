First let me say if u have never had droid or evo galaxy s or ipod/iphone u might like this but if u have ever used ne of these don't even think of buying this u will want to throw it at the wall it does not have real multi touch it lags and goes to the wrong place win u try it also there are like no games it gives u a app store but almost none of the games work and if they do they look horrible adobe flash however works great better than my droid 2 but besides that the product sucks its slow and and really just sucks
