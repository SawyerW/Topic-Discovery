Full disclosure: I returned this item but not because of any deficiency. The circumstances for which I bought it changed, and instead of keeping I returned it.I have used a wide array of touch-screen technologies and tend to favor the Apple environment. I think the samsung tablets are excellent, however, and have considered shifting to them in the past. I think this 7" Nexus tablet was simply fantastic, and with the seamless google integration, was a breeze to set up.Particularly, I found the sim card functionality, minimal-lag scrolling and google apps to be very useful. I had no problems at all. We had a novice adult touch screen user using it within an hour of opening the box.I used a pre-paid sim w/ 3g service and that service was up and running without a hitch.This product is highly recommended. The only downside that I can see is that has a little glare on the screen. A matte screen protector could help with that, but it's not necessary.
