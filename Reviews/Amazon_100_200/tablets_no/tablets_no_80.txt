By. Far worst android tablet ever they put android 4.0  and up without the hardware to support it far below minimum specs needed major problems with external SD card there is a internal storage 1gig and a built in SD card that prevents Downloads to the actual external SD card the 1 gig  built in SD card is not large enough  storage to hold  downloaded apps and  most things  to transfer to actual external SD card making the external SD slot useless and due to the internal SD card that's built in 80% of apps only recognize the built in SD card and dose not let you change the default download location tablet is extremely slow and is a waste of money there is for example there is a  $70 tablet made by Rca sold at Walmart amazon etc... That is a 1000 times better none of this is an exaggeration and I do not give bad reviews for no good reason for a little  more you can get a tablet that is A thothousand  times better
