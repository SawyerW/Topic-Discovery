I am primarily an Android and PC user, so I was a bit hesitant picking up a tablet made by Apple. The reason I am giving this product 4 stars over 5 is because of the lack of usb/SD support. There is absolutely no excuse not to have these ports available. For those of you who don't care, take this review as 5 stars. I found myself needing those ports, but the applications are fantastic. Being a college student, I use Pages, voice recorder, and goodnotes the most, which, by themselves, are amazing applications that help me get through classes with little stress. This thing helps me manage my life, so consider me polytheistic in terms of technology. I love my PC, Galaxy III, and iPad 2 all very much for what they offer.
