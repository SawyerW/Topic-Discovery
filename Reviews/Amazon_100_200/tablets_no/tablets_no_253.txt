I've always been a bit eclectic in terms of the hardware and software of my various electronic devices. I have a laptop running Ubuntu, a 2008 iMac desktop (I got it as a birthday present mere weeks before the '09 model debuted), I've used many Android devices (two phones and a tablet), and the only e-book reader I've ever used is a Kindle.That having been said, after using the iPad, I'm completely won over to Apple. The build quality is superior to other products, the interface is smooth and responsive, and the software library (as is well known at this point) is incomparably large.
