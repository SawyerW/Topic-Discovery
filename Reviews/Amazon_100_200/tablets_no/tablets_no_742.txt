Responsive and very light. I recommend, however, if you've never used an iPad, or for that matter, any Apple hardware device, you go to Apple.com and download the user manual. Apple's intellectual property security fetish is problematic if you have info on more than one laptop(s) or desktop(s) that you'd like to load on the iPad (music libraries especially). If you're a PC user, then the upload process for images is absolutely not straight forward. Copying photos takes some trial and a lot of error going from PC to iPad. Also, the version of Safari on the iPad isn't similar to the laptop/desktop screen. There's no tools header. Over all, if you want a book reader or an expensive PDA, this is the device for you.
