I never got the IPad 1. Actually at first I thought it was nothing special. I saw it as an ITouch but a whole lot bigger and no cameras. But when my sister showed me her IPad 2 (and 1). I was convinced this was a great product. So first chance I got, I got one.Its everything I expected to be..the good stuff I mean...unlike the original IPad this has 2 cameras (vs 0) is thinner and faster. I was able to watch videos in near picture pefect quality. Its so easy to carry or just sit and hold.There are some problems. Even though it does have cameras...most of the time they feel like a cheap camera you buy at a dollar store. Also no Flash on it, so some sites wont work.Overall its a great Tablet, yeah there are cheaper tablets out there but only apple has a program where getting viruses and impossible.Pros:-Size-Can never get a virus-Video quality-Speed-Can easily be held and carriedCons:-Cameras could be better-No Flash
