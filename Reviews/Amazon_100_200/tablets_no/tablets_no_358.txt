I won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned.  I would've given the iPad a 4 or 5 star except for the crippled Bluetooth.  The iPad CAN'T connect to a Bluetooth GPS nor your cellphone using dialup networking.  Why?  So you would buy a 3G version and pay monthly fees to AT&T; instead.  Big BOO to Apple for putting AT&T; ahead of it's customers.  Of course, if you have a cellphone that can act as a wifi router (like Win mobile, symbian with joikuspot, android 2.2) you can have the iPad use it, but this drains the battery significantly, unlike Bluetooth that can last the entire day.
