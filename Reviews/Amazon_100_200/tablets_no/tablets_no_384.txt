I bought my iPad a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it.  I do not have an iPhone, but I do have an iPod touch.  The iPad is almost like a large-scale iPod Touch or a small netbook computer that has really inexpensive, fun, and practical apps - the apps are the game changer for me.  Yes, there are other options out there that have apps, but not killer apps like those created for the Apple products.  The ebook viewer is exceptional, and movies are beautiful on the iPad.I hardly ever use my personal laptop anymore - instead I use my iPad to access all of the sites that I used to view with my laptop.  I travel a lot for work, and the iPad is like carrying my own laptop with me, but without all of the weight and bother (I already have a laptop for work).  If you like your iPod touch or iPhone, but want a bigger screen and a product with functionality that is between your iPhone and a laptop, then the iPad may be a good option for you.
