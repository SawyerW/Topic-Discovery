Nice display, very bright however touch screen needs way way to much pressure.Lacking Blue-tooth. I can not stress enough how much of a problem the lack of Blue-tooth is. Does anyone use corded headphones anymore?? Even the most basic of MP3 players has bluetooth and yet this does not. It's sold as a multi-media player yet doesn't have this most basic of features??It's WiFi will not even recognize my rooted G1 phone yet I can connect to the phone with my desktop PC, my notebook etc. and they all can use the phone to connect to the internet. The Archos tablet doesn't even see it.Another odd thing that the tablet does. It will randomly turn itself on and stay on. Weather you just put it in standby or turn it off totally it will boot up, turn the screen on at full brightness and stay on until the battery is dead. Other times you cant turn it on at all unless you use a toothpick on the reset button on the back and that doesn't even work all the time. Very unreliable.
