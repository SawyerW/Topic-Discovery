For someone who is technically challenged, it would be helpful to have a couple of pages of basic "how-to" instructions. Despite all the hoopla about it being intuitive, I doubt that my wife could have gotten to first base if I had not set up some basic icon shortcuts to sites that I knew she would use. And how does a novice get past their first encounter with a gray screen? That said, it's a pretty slick machine. NOTE: It does not support Flash, so a lot of stuff will pass you by. (Third-party developers claim to have an app that solves this...the verdict appears to still be out on its effectiveness)
