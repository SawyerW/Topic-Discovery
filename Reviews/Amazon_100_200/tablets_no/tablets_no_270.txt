I just got my new iPad 2.now i'M going to try to type on the iPad screen. first u can't look away because u can't rest your fingers on the screen-- and even if u could  u couldn't feel the keys. it is much like texting on the iPhone. U have to go to the numbers screen to find the " ' " or the numbers. There are no forward or back arrows, so u have to touch the screen where u want the cursor to go.The good part is that the letter is registered immediately when u hit the key-- u don't have to hit it twice to get it to enter the letter.All in all, I think an external keypad is needed so I'm going shopping.
