Apple iPad 2 MC770LL/A Tablet (32GB, Wifi, Black) NEWEST MODELI'm so happy that I have an ipad 2. The ipad 2 makes all the good stuff in iPad, very very good. Extremely thin, a lot thinner than the first iPad. iPad 2 is unbelievably thin when compared to other Android and WebOS tablets. Apple has done a nice job maximizing the use of internal space to create this extremely slim device. The addition of the cameras and the new speaker design are among the visible signs of change but overall the iPad 2 feels very much like the first generation ipad.Performance: Top notch thanks to its new A5 chipCameras: Not so good. Seemed to be added in as an afterthought. This was probably the only ding against it.Accessories: Plenty of options!This is a really useful tool for everyday uses.
