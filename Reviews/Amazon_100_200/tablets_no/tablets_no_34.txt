After much research, I decided that the Asus Nexus was the best choice for a tablet. Since this was my first tablet I looked forward to the day it would arrive. My excitement turned quickly to disappointment as I learned I had a faulty unit. From the first moment I turned it on, it wouldn't work right. I would have to tap the screen over and over and over again to activate it, and then I would end up somewhere other than where I had wanted to go. The more I tried to maneuver my way through its programs, the worse it got. I'm glad I purchased it through Amazon though, because the seller had a good return policy, and all I had to do was print out a return label and drop it off at UPS, postage paid. After reading what others went through trying to deal with Asus directly, I would never buy another product from Asus unless the seller had a fair return policy.
