I can't say enough good things about this!I received this as a birthday gift, and really didn't think I would have much use for it. I was so wrong. It has been wonderful, even if you just consider the entertainment value.  The apps available have been wonderful, and have provided hours of entertainment for everybody in the family.Last week I was using it in the kitchen.  I had a recipe up on the screen, and when I wasn't sure exactly how to chop up the fennel, I put on a youtube video.For work, I am able to access and read documents, and make changes/highlights on them. Very useful for lugging around files to meetings. If there is wireless available, I can check email, do web research, all fairly unobtrusively (esp. great for meetings that have gone off track!).I like the ease of use for travel--very good size for using on a plane. I will admit that I don't really like to edit documents with this, it is more of a reading tool for me, although the productivity apps seem to be getting better over time.
