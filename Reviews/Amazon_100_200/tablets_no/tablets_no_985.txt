I bought this iPad 2 right when the new ones came out because I thought this was the best price.  My excuse to buying such an expensive product was that I was studying for the CPA exam and thought the apps would be helpful.  For me this is the perfect amount of space (I havent run out yet and I have tons of games and other social apps and email)  I use mostly for personal and it is my favorite toy in the world.  I would recommend going this route instead of investing in a brand new iPad or other tablet.  You wont find as good apps as you will with apple.  I live in SC and bought it from someone in GA used.  It was like brand new plus i got a free case and screen protector which I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who purchases one of these.
