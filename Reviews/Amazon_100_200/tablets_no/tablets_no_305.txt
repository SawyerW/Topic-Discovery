I am not a PC user, but was researching possible touch screen PCs for assistive technologies for Autism. This little unit has quickly become a favorite of my son's (he has Autism) and has helped to organize him in all areas of life.The downside is that the touch screen is not multitouch. If you can get past that though, the monitor is bright, the unit is not heavy at all and the solid slate drive is helpful for drops and possible misuse. To say that this is PC, I have been very satisfied with it and would consider purchasing the multitouch from Asus.
