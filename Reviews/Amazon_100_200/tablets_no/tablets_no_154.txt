Holy Moly am I going to buy another one of these! One isn't enough for our family of five.I haven't compared or looked at any other options. Mostly because this one was a gift to us from a grandmother who wanted to do face time with her grand kids.I have never been a big apple fan because you have to deal with Itunes which is a bother. But it's been worth it to have an ipad. We love it.Here is what I know about it- It is incredibly thin, extremely light, super fast, and it does amazing things.You can use a Kindle to read but you can download the kindle software onto the ipad. You can buy a Nook or another pad and they may meet your minimum standards. However the Ipad does everything those will do and more.Sure it's expensive but if I could afford it and I was wondering if I wanted to spend 'that kind of money' on an ipad because really a whatever/fill in the blank would do fine; I'd go ahead and get the ipad.Well worth the money.Enjoy.
