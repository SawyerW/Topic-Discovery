I wanted something to read on as well as something to snyc to hotspots when I did not have my laptop. I find this device to be serviceable but it has a lot of issues that can make it a bit of a pain. The biggest issue I have is that my iPhone produces wifi hotspot, but this reader will not work with 3g or 4g technology. Also, you will have to use a stylist in order to use this device. Last of all it is slow and not very responsive. It is not a tablet it is a reader that you can do facebook on.
