I can not say enough good things about this tablet. I love it and more so the ease at which I can carry it around vs a laptop. Battery life is superb compared to my laptop and the picture is as well.But what really makes this so useful are all the applications you have for it and how easily you can call them up. Want to send an email or check the ones you have waiting. Easy. Want to play a video game Easy. Do you subscribe to a magazine and have a few minutes and you want to read it. Easy. Listen to music. The same. Take a beautiful and I mean beautiful picture and send it to someone quickly. Easy. Children around and you want to make a little video of them. Easy. I could go on and on and on. But the bottom line is EASY. And for what $300 or so. You can't miss.
