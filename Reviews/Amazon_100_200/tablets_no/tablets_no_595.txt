I ordered one of these three weeks ago, but it was lost by the "parcel pool" in transit.  I never got to see how bad the screen response actually is.  Also the price dropped $30.00 between the time I ordered it and the time it didn't arrive.  I suggest not wasting your time, and waiting for an Android device with hopefully a much better responding screen.  In a sense it was good for me that it never arrived as now I can get a refund.  When I ordered it, I hadn't seen all the reviews on other sites that complain about the screen.  Archos has always been sort of a false hope.
