I was given an older version IPAD from my brother last year and really liked it but it only worked on Wi-Fi. I don't live in an area where Wi-Fi is always available so I was limited to using it at home. so a few months later when my 50th birthday was coming up, my husband asked what I would like. I told him the only thing I wanted was the IPad with wireless AND 3G. Of course he thought I was nuts since I had a perfectly good, working IPAd already. So naturally, I got my wish!  We ordered a refurbished one to save money. I have not been disappointed yet! I take it everywhere with me. I am impressed with the speed even when using 3G. I am able to use it at our cabin and streamed our High School basketball State Championship game with zero problems.  The only problem I have now is I own a 5 month old Laptop that I rarely use!
