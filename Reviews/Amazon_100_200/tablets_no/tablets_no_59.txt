I bought this because I wanted to try something different from my iPad 2, which I still love. The Nexus can do things the iPad can't like native floating video, floating browsers, emulators, some better apps like trackers (music making software). The only thing I don't like is the storage space. I rooted my Nexus just to be able to transfer freely between my external hard drive and the tablet, and somehow that messed up its ability to read the hard drive at all. One thing I really liked was that the model I bought let me plug in my Wacom Bamboo Fun Pen & Touch to draw in Sketchbook Pro.
