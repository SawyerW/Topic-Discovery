Highly recommend this item. Forget buying a Kindle when you can download book onto the iPad...free even; local library digital downloads or purchase them! the ease and convenience of using this product is a seller in and of itself. As an educator I now take one item with me to class...the iPad II and students LOVE it! The apps that can be downloaded such as study sets app is great for reinforcing material to be learned (as are many other apps!). I also have netflix app and with the AV cables, I can plug it into any television and watch it on the big screen or take it with me while waiting at the doctors office and watch a movie...it's awesome. Again, apple has won me over!
