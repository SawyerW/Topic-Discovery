Initially bought the Impression Tablet from HSN and all I can say is that that product is garbage. After coordinating to send it back and get refunded, I ordered my wife the IPAD2. This was right after Christmas by the way, and we have yet to have a single issue with the IPAD2. I have a rather cheap in cost wireless router, and the IPAD can reach it from anywhwhere (2k sf) in my house. Has never froze and had to reboot! Highly recommend this product to anyone. Wife mainly uses it for apps for the kids! They love it also and I find the apps very educational. Only downside.... the price. Hence the 4 stars.
