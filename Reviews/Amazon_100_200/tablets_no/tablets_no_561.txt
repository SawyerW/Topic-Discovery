To get an ereader with extra feature for under $100, this product is a no brainer.  I can check email, listen to music, even add movies onto it so my 6 year old son can watch them when we are in the car.  The apps are OK, nothing spectacular, but still enough to keep you from being bored.  If you're looking for a tablet, or something with access to the andriod app store, this is not for you.  If you want a nice entry level tablet/ereader for reading and light web use, this is a great machine.  I would definately recommend this to others.  Now that I have it, I wouldn't mind getting another one for me, and letting my son use this one.  I'd probably go with a new model so I could use the andriod app store.  All in all a great purchase for the money.
