I bought this, charged it according to the manual and finally it was ready.. but no dice. I booted it up and within minutes it crashed. I didn't have time to do anything but browse pictures and watch a few seconds of sample video. I am just flipping through menus and bamm it dies. boot back up? sure. Sometimes. when it does it may stay on for a second (literally immediately crashing)or a minute. I got it to stay on long enough to update the firmware to the latest from the archos site - no dice. Same problem. I got this as a gift for my wife, so I am double pissed. I see that some have had luck with it out of the box, but mine is a complete brick of a thing. cant even use it. And its not like I am going to get a replacement in time for her birthday, so I am probably just going to return this POS.
