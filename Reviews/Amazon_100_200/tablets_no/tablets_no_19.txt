For the price, this tablet really does the trick.  I don't get what is so much better about the ipad mini that it would cost several times what this costs (since I primarily use it with wireless anyhow, and can use my iphone for gps and the like). I originally bought it to use on a vacation with the idea of giving it to one of the kids once the new ipad mini comes out, but I'm now thinking I'll just keep this because it's everything I need. I haven't tried reading books on it yet (kept my e-ink kindle just in case), but love having it in bed at night to catch up on email and watch movies. I've stopped using my TV!  The only issue I'm having, hence the 4 star, is that the charging cord doesn't seem to sit well in the device. It's a little hard to get in, and it doesn't seem to fit in tightly.  PS - I understand the ipad has longer battery life, but this isn't bad.
