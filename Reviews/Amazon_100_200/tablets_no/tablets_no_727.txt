Worst purchase ever! I wish I could give it no stars but I won't be able to write a review. The ipad2 was a FAKE! Every time I order a electronic from Amazon there's a problem!  I will not order any more electronic from Amazon again this was my second time , it won't be a third!  I know it's a fake because my daughter got a Ipad2 for her birthday two years ago.  It's such a big difference. The Ipad2 doesn't show on and off it shows green for on with no words. I didn't order it for my self and I told the person who I purchased it for he said it's ok. I called customer service all I got was smart remarks. I was told "we have other sellers so we don't know about the products that are being sold". So I asked how you sell something on your site that you don't know about?  Her response was do you want a refund?  Never Again with Amazon! I just feel everyone should know be aware of your purchases with Amazon because you might not get what you asked for or you think you payed for!
