I'm writing to express how satified I am with my iPad.  I think it was one of the best investments I have ever made, I pratically use it for everything writing papers  for college, music, photos, videos, surfing the wed, games and email. My iPad has practically replaced my two laptops.  I'm not recommending to get rid of your laptop and get an iPad because there are certain things I can not  do on my iPad that only my laptop can do the job, but you should definately get one for its portability, accessibility and great battery life.  I was so impressed with my Ipad I went out and purchased an ipad mini this was in a 3 month period. Also plan to upgrade my regular ipad for the new edision with 120gs and my laptop with an Mac Air. I really like Apple products and wish I would have taken advantage of their products sooner.
