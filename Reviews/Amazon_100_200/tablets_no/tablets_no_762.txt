I admit when I first heard about Apple making an iPad I was skeptical about how practical the device would be.  Fast forward to the present, and having used the iPad 2 for 2 months, I can honestly say it has transformed my digital life in our increasingly digital world.  My desktop and laptop have been gathering dust since acquiring the iPad 2.It is the ultimate way to interact with just about all things digital.  With the right apps, you can do just about anything you can on a laptop, television, and gaming system, all in one sleek, stylish, and utterly portable device!  On a regular basis I use my iPad 2 to surf the web, compose and read e-mails, open and edit Microsoft Office documents, watch movies, listen to my MP3 collection, take and browse photos, make financial transactions, and play games that are just as good as what I can play on a computer or dedicated video game system.I'm hard pressed to come up with a single thing I dislike about the iPad 2.
