Great unit, but be aware, the cameras, even the better, forward-facing one--really bite. Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs.
