Actually I got this as a gift from my lovely wife. I love it.Kids:Warning, your kids will try and steel your iPad. My son is addicted to YouTube and my daughter loved the Dora Coloring app. We also play games together. I have to remind the kids that the iPad is actually dad's.Books:I wasn't so into reading books on a Kindle because of the cost. I didn't think I would like reading on the iPad as much as I have. I got the Kindle app, which has all the Kindle books that you can get for your iPad. I'm reading a lot more because of it. This is mostly becasue I have these books with me all the time and sometimes I wouldn't thing to bring a book and them would be in the mood to read.Games:There as some really fun games on the iPad. Some of these I played a lot on the iPone but are so much better on the larger screen. Civilization is one of them. It is great. I also like the Plant vs Zobbies.Music/Movies:Just like the iPhone, it is great having all your music/movies at your disposal. The iPad is great on a plane.
