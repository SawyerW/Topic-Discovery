Bought the zeepad for my 10 year old daughter (who's a bit careless) in January 2013 because I didn't trust her with my tablet.  Overall, tablet works fine.  I like how it has a microcard for more memory.  However, overnight about 2 weeks ago, she turned it on and everything was wiped clean ... it's like it was formatted.  It also went back to the default language of Chinese.  So frustrating.  I've been searching the internet looking how to set the language back to English .. with no success.  Today I finally went back to my Amazon account, contacted the company Bubble Star (where I purchased it from through Amazon Store) and they contacted me within 1/2 an hour after my email.  After a whole 20 seconds on the phone the problem was solved.  Amazing!  They were just wonderful, and my daughter is back on her tablet looking up her fav apps again ... just in time for vacation!  Thank you so much, Bubble Star for all of your help!  If only I had thought of that earlier ...
