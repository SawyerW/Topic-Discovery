Owning both the iPad 2 and iPad 3, there really isn't much of a difference unless you use 4G/LTE or want to play the very very select few games that run better on the iPad 3.  The iPad 2 doesn't heat up.  The iPad 3 does.  The iPad 2 is a bit thinner and lighter (not much but notable).  Contrary to what I'd expected, the 2540x1480 screen is almost useless.  You still browse the web at only 720x1280, and most other commonly-used tasks.  Only a handful of games are made for 2540 resolution; therefore, it's practically useless given the iPad 2 is nearly half the price of the 3rd and 4th generation (which are both too similar to distinguish). While the A4/A5/A6 processors differ, it doesn't translate into real life differences in overall performance for watching videos, mail, web browsing, etc.  IMO the iPad 2 is s till the best tablet to come out in the past 3 years given that it's about half the price as those of its successors.
