I got this computer as a gift approximately three years ago. I use this daily, essentially 7 days a week, and while it is not in the best condition any more it is still the workhorse for my job. It's light and very easy to carry. I get approximately 6 hours on the battery each day, and I'm still on the original battery.This is my 6th or 7th laptop in the last 15 years, so trust me when I tell you this is the toughest of all of them, and I've had one of about all the manufactors.  Because this was originally a program computer given to me I have not been sparing with the abuse I've given it, and it's taken it.  The laptop has lost its latch so it won't stay closed and the battery latch is partially broken so I have to watch to make sure I don't dislodge the battery. But despite this it still does its job three years later, and that's something none of the others could claim.Bottom line:  I never thought I'd get hooked on a tablet, but I have and I wouldn't nesitate to buy another thinkpad.
