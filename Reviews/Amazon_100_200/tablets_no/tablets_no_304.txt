I first owned an Acer netbook without the touch screen. After 3 years' of good performance, the Acer sometimes just won't start until multiple reboots , so I bought this one in case Acer dies permanently. Compared to Acer, this one has three weakness: it is noticeably slower, its keyboard is less comfortable (for example, I use Shift a lot on the right, but this one's Shift key is especially tiny on the right.); and the screen is not as sharp. The battery life also seems shorter, but this might be because of the touch screen. But, I still use this quite often so far, on conference trips where I need a fair amount of typing but do not want to carry anything heavy.
