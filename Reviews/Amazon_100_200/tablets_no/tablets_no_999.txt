I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He searches the internet with it, reads, watches tutorials on his various tools when he is out in his shop. The size is perfect, he can read on it easier then on the Kindle Fire because the screen is larger. We both have one now and are very happy with our IPads, we are in our late 60"s and it was easy to learn how to use. When the grandkids are over they like to play games on them too, inexpensive entertainment. One more thing, we downloaded a GPS app which is very helpful when we travel, skype for the kids that are out of state, and Words With Friends, helps keep us sharp :)
