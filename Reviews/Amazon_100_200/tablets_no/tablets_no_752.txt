I purchaced the ipad2 for my sister so that we could facetime between UK and US as I already have one.  She said it is in very good condition and has no problems with it.The only thing we have found so far is that when we are chatting via facetime hers does not charge or hold charge while plugged in, so as my battery life is going up, hers is going down.  It's not a major problem as if she calls when her battery is fully charged we have plenty of time to chat.When her ipad is not in use it charges fine.Overall I am very happy with the purchace.
