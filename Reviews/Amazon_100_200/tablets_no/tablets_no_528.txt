this item is probably a good tablet,but i have owned it for about a week now and it is very hard to use!!!nothing will down load,you are very limited on things you can do.If you don't have the app.you can't do it! I'm sending it back and wait for a tablet that has windows 7 for reasonable price the ones they have out there now are way over priced.android os is good checking mail that is about it.I bought a 300 dollar + e-mail reader!!! You better know something about android OS before you buy one of these things!!!  UP DATE-,Now that i have own this tablet for about two weeks and figuring somethings out on it I've come to like it more and will like alot the more i use it.I do wish it had the app store installed in it and better battery life,But for the money spent i'm happy with it
