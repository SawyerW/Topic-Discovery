I feel the ipad 2 is a great investment. It can do everything you would need a normal computer to do but a ton more. Its extremely fast and lightweight along with a long lasting battery life which I enjoy. Works perfect for students like myself and in the business field for my job and can finish normally huge assignments and projects in minutes. For $499 you get everything you pay for. The only con is I wish it had a flash player since it wont play certain videos. The ipad 2 is a must buy for any skeptics out there!!!
