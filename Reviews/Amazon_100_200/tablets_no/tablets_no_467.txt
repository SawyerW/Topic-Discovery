Title says it all.The Good:Video ViewingMusic PlayingStandard Android Email AppWIFIThe Archos 7 works great as a "MEDIA PLAYER" it plays my mp4 and wmv files very well, there is no lag in viewing. The video viewer has an enlarging button to go into "full screen" mode, so even though my files were encoded for a much smaller screen i can still view them full size on the 7" tablet.The Not So Good:You will see this from most reviewers.The touch screen is a bit more difficult to use than the standard smart phones of today.android 1.6 browser is lacking (i downloaded the skyfire browser from their website).Archos Apps LIB is severely limited in selection.Applications launch slowly.Bottom Line: If you want an inexpensive video viewer, get yourself a DVD encoder and BUY THIS! However, if you want to do much more than view videos and check email, then i suggest you pony up a little more money and get something more high end.
