I use my Xoom for grad school everyday and I love it!  Let me say that my wife has an iPad, and I like it too.  However, iOS feels like training wheels and Honeycomb feels like the real deal.  Android is more like an actual computer while iOS feels like (and is) a giant phone.  I can do things like download Power Points directly to my device and open them using Docs To Go.  What good are 10,000 apps if they are all games?!  I have not discovered anything yet that my iPad colleagues in school can do that I cannot with the Xoom, but only Android has widgets, multiple desktops, Google integration, the list goes on and on...  Honeycomb is getting new apps everyday and you are free of Apple's restrictive environment.  Plus, Ice Cream Sandwich is going to polish off Android and take it to the next level.  Take it from me, if you want open accessibility, maximum customization, and the slickest OS, you want Android.  MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (10.1-Inch, 32GB, Wi-Fi)
