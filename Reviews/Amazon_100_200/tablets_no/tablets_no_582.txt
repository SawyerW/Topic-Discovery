i really wanted to like this product.  Looking at the specs, it seemed to have all that I wanted and needed.  But it just isn't very good.  Screen wasn't very responsive and the build quality could've been much better.I ended up buying an iPod touch, even though I dislike Apple's way of steering users to their proprietary products.  Compared to iPod touch, Archos feels like something that would've been made 10 years ago.  iPod touch's screen is so much better, more responsive.  Also, the build quality of iPod touch just can't be compared to Archos.  It would  simply be unfair to compare Archos 43 with iPod in terms of responsiveness and build quality.  It would be rather like comparing a Porsche to a Honda.
