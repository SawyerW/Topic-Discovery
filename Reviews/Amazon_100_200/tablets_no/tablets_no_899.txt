I purchased an Ipad 2 because I wanted a way to get my textbooks for class and not have to carry them all around in a heavy backpack.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered, not only can I do this, but at half the cost!  No heavy backpack, and over the last to semesters my Ipad has payed for itself in what it has saved me in textbook costs.  But that isn't even all of it!  I created a Dropbox and now I can look at documents for class, or review notes I have created while I am waiting for class.  I have also downloaded study help apps and homework apps that keep me up to date on what assignments I have coming up.I also love the plethora of games and other activities available for when I have downtime.  If is a lot of fun!My other favorite thing about this ipad is that I can watch movies, tv shows and everything else under the sun.  It is crisp and clear and the big screen is wonderful!Love love love this device!
