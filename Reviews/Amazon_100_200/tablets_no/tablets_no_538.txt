I purchased this thing after reading the reviews and because I came across it for 100.00.  I figured even if it wasn't great it would surely be worth 100.00.  What were you other people using.  It certainly wasn't a Velocity Micro Cruz reader.  This thing is pathetically slow, it's not responsive at all, it hangs, it's extremely limited on what you can install on it, and I haven't figured out yet (after a week and a half) how to get the Nook app on it (I have it on my phone for Pete's sake).It has the "Cruz Market" app on it which doesn't have any good apps.  The "Free" apps that come with it are completely worthless.  I thought "Cruz Sync" might be useful.  It's apparently a way to lure you into a monthly subscription.I finally decided maybe it would be fun to try to root the device and see if that offers any additional functionality.  I haven't found a way to do this yet. I'm going to continue to try this.  Other than that it will just sit on a shelf and be a reminder to me to do a bit more research before shelling out money.
