I was looking for a tablet computer that I could use to display my instrument approach plate (IAPs) when flying IFR.  This device fit the bill!  It is easy to use and does almost all the things I wanted it too with only a few exceptions.  I can download my IAPs from the internet site I use ([...] - Thanks DOUG RANZ - If you use him, donate to him, Great Service).  I can use FOXIT Reader to view these, finding the plate I need and then going Full Screen in tablet mode and BAM!  I have it.  Battery life is good and the 12 volt adapter is compatible with aircraft using a 12 volt system.  I will use a 24V to 12V adapter for mine.
