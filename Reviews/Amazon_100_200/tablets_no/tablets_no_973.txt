I wish I would have gotten a newer model. I pretty much have given up on this thing, so many apps that I would like to have don't work because it's outdated. I love the iPad in general and still plan to keep it for a while, but it's functionality leaves a lot to be desired. The NPR app works perfectly which is really great, and I mostly just use it for portfolio purposes and if I don't feel like carrying around a bulky laptop. Please listen to folks who tell you that this is not a replacement for a laptop, they are not lying. Seriously. Don't get rid of your damn laptop.
