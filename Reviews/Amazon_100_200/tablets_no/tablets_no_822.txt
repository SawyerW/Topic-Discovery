After using the iPad 2 for about six months I can definitely say that I can't wait for the Windows 8 tablet to be released. The iPad 2 is a neat toy but it is too limitd to use for any productive purposes. Number one on the list is no Flash. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to put the iPad 2 aside and grab a Windows laptop to look at a Web page. At this point, if I want to be productive I grab a Windows laptop. If I want to play games I grab the iPad 2.
