No only is this am AMAZING product.  But Apple is the best company I have ever bought anything from.  We now have a saying in our house if you want a product and apple sells one, don't think just buy the apple.This has so many uses the 64G is well worth it.You definitely want the 3G version because it has GPS.My first version died because I dropped it in water.  Apple felt sorry for me and gave me a new one!  wow!  My mothers phone broke they handed her a new one.  My friend dropped his on the ground and broke the screen.  They gave him a new one.I LOVE APPLE!!!!
