Pros:- Touchscreen- Screen swivel (cool for showing someone across from you what's on the screen)Cons:- Runs hot. Reviews have said before and I'll second it - I've suspected for a while that these laptops run way hotter than should be allowed.- Horrible repair service - I bought the three year warranty and it's spent almost an entire year in the shop - over 4 repair trips. Sometimes the repair place would check off that they replaced something they didn't touch - which I found out after marking some parts with permanent marker. The marks were still there when returned. Also you can almost never talk to someone who is not from India, which is normally not a problem, except when they can't even understand what you're saying the problem is.- Blue screens. About 3 months in they started, eventually getting so frequent the computer was unusable. HP has replaced (supposedly) everything in it, from the motherboard to hard drive to memory. Still blue screens.Overall, I would NEVER buy this computer again.
