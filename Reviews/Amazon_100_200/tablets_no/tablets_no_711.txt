I own a Nook Tablet, Kindle Fire and an ipad2.I would have to guess that most of the people that rate the ipad2 5 stars have not tried other tablets,Maybe you will like the ipad -- it has more apps in its store, but it also is slow compared to my Kindle Fireand lacks the customization options of Android,Apple products I have owned have malfunctioned after a few years (2 if my 4 itouchs')Not having Flash Video is a major shortcoming -- most videos online are flash -- so you will be disappointed when videosdon't play.Ipad does have a nice big screen, but no USB port, no memory card slot, average cameras and a VERY HIGH price.I bought mine because of the hype and I was curious.My advice is to check them all out before you buy - I would not have bought mine -- it is OK but over-rated with many shortcomings
