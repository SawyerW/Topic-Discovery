We chose to buy the IPad because at the time I thought it was important to get my son familiar with technology and I knew that there were a lot of educational apps that we could download for the iPad. So far our whole family absolutely loves using the iPad. We are always looking for a new application to download. This is a great piece of technology because the whole family can use it. My daughter who is 2.5 and my son who is 4 have absolutely no problem using it. My husband and I also use it for many different things. The best thing is that we can take it in the car and the kids can watch videos off of Netflix. We have a screen protector and a case on our iPad and it has been very durable. The kids have dropped it, stepped on it and carry it around with them and it doesn't have one scratch on it.
