I really wanted to like this tablet. I purchased thinking I could do basic functions, but I can't. The first tablet went back after 2 days because it got too hot and I could not hold it. It also developed a red dot on the screen. I received a replacement in 2 days (thank you Amazon), but the second is worst than the 1st one. I am trying to install skyfire and the tablet keeps telling me that does not have any space to download this application... its only 1.5 mb at this thing is supposed to be 8gb... I tried to update the firmware and the computer did not restarted after the upgrade, if was forced to press the reset button. Without skyfire I am unable to watch any youtube videos etc.I am very upset with this electronic. I can't download anything, it is going back. Others could probably have better luck than me with this.
