I just bought one of those for my wife to watch her downloaded soaps during her workout. I have read some negative reviews but honestly, I don't know how you could not be thrilled with it.The touch screen is definitely sensitive enough, I connected to my (encrypted) WIFI network in 20 seconds, web browser is nice and fast. But best of all: it so far plays EVERY kind of video file I have, and I have a lot. It even plays back a 720p HD video!The microSDHC slot holds your memory card (I guess up to 32Gb, mine is 8 Gb), which is already more than the iPad can do, and all that for ... 169.00 USD!The widescreen display looks great and with the included USB chord you can drag and drop your media files from your computer to the tablet.I couldn't be happier with it - anyone who's whining about it, please go ahead and spend 600.00 on an iPad (which will NOT play back all your video files)
