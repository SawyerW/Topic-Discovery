We were looking for a small video player for our daughter to use while traveling, as well as a tablet for my wife to use for light email and web surfing around the house, etc. I was intrigued by the ipad but thought it was too heavy and too expensive. This has turned out to be perfect -- I can convert DVDs to video files to play on here. And my wife finds the small size perfect for checking email or reading news and recipes around the house. Great little product.My only complaints are around the touch screen - I find that I calibrate it every few weeks. Also, I wish there was a way to have an extended battery of some sort for use when flying...
