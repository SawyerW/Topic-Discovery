The Motorola Xoom is a top competitor to Apple's iPad and is what I elected to purchase in lieu of other popular tablets. Google's Android operating systems has been proven to be faster and more stable than Apple's products, and Motorola has a long history of being a respected phone/electronics manufacturer. The Xoom gives the user more control over their settings and programs, where as Apple keeps all apps and software Apple proprietary. The Xoom gives developers the freedom to develop apps that are not proprietary one manufacturer, allowing more apps and more expansion in the marketplace. Overall, I've heard very good things about the Xoom and am very satisfied with my purchase decision. I expect nothing but great things to come of this.
