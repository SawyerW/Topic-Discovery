At first I was a bit hesitant about purchasing the ipad. When the first generation came out I had no interest what-so-ever. It wasn't untill a cople of weeks ago I did some heavy research on tablet pc'. Comparing different models ect. What made me ultimately get the ipad was all the reviews I read on it vs the play book, and the samsung galaxey tablet. I really find that I use it every day, and that was one of my biggest concerns. I play games on it, have a bunch of books I love on there,  as well as music, besides web surfing, I use it as a personal journal. I don't regret my purchase and it was worth every cent. However I don't recommend.buying the smart cover. It doesn't give enough coverage, instead I purchased a product from hear called roo case and I love it! I also got a anti-glear screen protector. I highley recommended this product.
