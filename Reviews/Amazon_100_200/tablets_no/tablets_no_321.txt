I was in total shock when I opened my used ipad I ordered for my 10 year old son for Christmas!!!! It was like I went to the store and bought it brand new... I was so happy and over joyed when I saw the condition it was in....I will never buy a new electronic device again... I will only order it from this Amazon seller and thank you so much for keeping this product in the condition it is... I appreciate people that take good care of their products. I can't explain how happy my son is going to be when he receives this on Christmas morning... I have tears of joy right now just expressing to you of how thankful I am.....We would of never been able to afford a brand new one for our son....It's just like brand new. Thanks again, Cassie
