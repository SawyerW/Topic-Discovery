The first one I received had a cracked screen. The second one was ok but when you press on the back slightly (near right side) the lcd would flutter. This tablet was clearly rushed to market hoping to make a quick profit before the avalanche of tablets of higher quality hit the market. Pretty soon the tablets will replace laptops and we'll have more of choices from better quality vendors. I will not buy the ipad because it doesnt have a user replaceable battery like this one. Wait for the other tablets to come out and then wait for them to go down in price. The touch screen on this thing will drive you mad!!!
