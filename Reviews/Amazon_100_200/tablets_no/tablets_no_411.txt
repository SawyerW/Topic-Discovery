I bought this Ipad for my wife and she is absolutely in love with it, if your considering another notebook you should consider what you will be doing with it, if your like us and only need it for home use and like to play games and go on facebook and check your mail, then you will definately want to consider this Ipad. The screen quality is perfect and it's so easy to navigate around on the Ipad. We are still trying to figure out how to upload photos from our camera, but I'm confident we'll figure it out. The battery life is great, my wife charges it at night with her cell phone and it lasts all evening with constant use. One more worth while points is that our grand daughter is only 7 and she has no problem getting around on the apple ipad.
