OK, so I'm not exactly thrilled with the Apple hardware philosophy. You can't swap the battery, there's no way to expand the memory (it doesn't have a CF slot or accept a USB stick), and there's no resident filing system included in the OS. Still, the iPad has become the industry standard in aviation, the only platform approved by the FAA as an electronic flight bag.  And, replacing 30 pounds of paper charts (which have to be updated every 56 days) with a 1 1/2 pound tablet saves money, trees, and fuel. So, it's a no-brainer.  (I still wish I could swap batteries and plug in memory.)
