I received my Archos and set about getting it configured.  The screen calibration was very difficult until I used a stylus from a gps unit.  Once calibrated the screen remained a little unstable but usable. The unit seemed to lock up from time to time but it was actually sorting or downloading a large list of items.  The newer firmware I installed from the Archos website seemed to help overall.  I installed a few extra applications and connected to my WiFi effortlessly. Video playback was nice and most everything seemed to work as expected. All seemed good....I eventually had to return the unit because when unit was lying on desk untouched it would begin to select icons and controls by itself.  If you pressed reset it would work ok for a while then start back selecting itmes by itself.Others have noted trouble with display and I suspect the touchscreen portion of this unit is its weak point.  I decided to wait and replace after product matures a bit more.
