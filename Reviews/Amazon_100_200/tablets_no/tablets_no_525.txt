If you  buy this tablet, don't even think of starting it up  unless you first download dexter's rom 1.42. It will take about 15 minutes of your time and transform a decent tablet into a great one. I like to listen to my music using audiogalaxy(a streaming program) and the sound once you enable dexter's 7 band equalizer is nothing short of amazing. The amplifier in the elocity is far more robust than the ipad giving you a fuller, richer sound. I strongly suggest the denon ad 1100 headphone with this device for the best sound you ever heard in a portable!Once you install dexter's roms, prepare to be amazed when an xbox 360 controller will work in the usb port useable in all the nintendo emulators. So many people in the airport asked me how i was able to play mario with an xbox controller on an android system!!And playing the tegra 2 game riptide will remind you how fast this system is!!
