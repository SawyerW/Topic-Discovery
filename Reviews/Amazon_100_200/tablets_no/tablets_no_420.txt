I got this as a gift and I am very grateful and happy for the thoughtfullness of my boss.Video and photo displays are great. But, flash videos, I.e. Adobe, etc. will not work, it is very frustrating because I love watching news and documentaries via Internet such as the National Geographic, Hulu, my friends' website with flash, etc. Hulu and Youtube needs their apps to be downloaded to watch their videos but I wouldn't download every website's apps just to watch their flash videos. And, btw, snagfilms.com the documentary website does not have an app for Ipad. Their is an app called Frash but I need to Jailbreak my Ipad but that would void the warranty. I'm switching back and forth with my laptop because I love to read using my Ipad because of it's great graphic quality, but I have to use my pc to watch videos and to download documents from my emails.As of now I do not recommend Ipad for productivity. I consider it as pc accessory.The reason why I gave 3 stars is because it is great for gaming and reading books. Browsing the Webpages is also great.
