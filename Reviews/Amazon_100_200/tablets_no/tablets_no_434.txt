Do not listen to the people who suggest that this is a large iPod touch.  It does have the potential to be a laptop replacement for the majority of people.  I would say it is a glimpse into the future of laptops.  Laptops have been outselling desktops for awhile now. This should change that.  Ideally I would like a home desktop, iPad and smartphone, with no need of a laptop.  Anyone who reads, this is a must have.  I would even say if i have to do without... i would do with out the smartphone and have a simpler phone. Think about it, i use my iphone more for the apps than its phone by far.  It does surf the web, email, manage photos better than laptops.  Laptops had been desktop replacements, which should change because of this device. Current features that it lacks are complainants from the small minded.  Especially when we know exactly when we would receive the features.  It is a game changer,  with iPhone software worked out for a few years this does not have risks of most early adopter situations. Get use to it.
