Anyone that is thinking of buying an iPad, should be aware of a very recent change in Apple Policy as it relates to the Kindle Store on their mobile devices--iPhone and iPod also.What those idiots did over at Apple was to FORCE Amazon to REMOVE the Kindle Store BUTTON from their mobile devices.  This is certainly due to the fact that the KINDLE is FAR superior to their crappy iBooks selctions, and Apple is trying--illegally in my opinion to restrain E-Book Commerce, and should be met with swift Legal Action.  This change will make it much harder to buy Kindle Books directly from the mobile device itself.  They have also done this to the Barnes & Noble Nook Application also, but as you might guess--they haven't done it to their own iBooks.  If you would like any proof of this, just go to your iTunes Software, OR to iTunes on Apples web site, if its not installed on your computer, and read---say---the last 100 reviews of the Kindle App in the last few days.  You will be SHOCKED at what you are reading.  Then do the same with the Barnes & Noble App.Don't let this stand.
