The item has arrived promptly, taking into account that we were not able to buy it from apple web site. I bought it for my 8 years old son for his birthday, as I thought it can be a lot of fun for him, playing games, listening favourite music and e.t. But browsing internet he realized that he can not open his favorite site friv.com. I can not open Moscow radio  station - too much restrictions for this pretty expensive "toy". Apple doesn't mean fun for free, they  would like you to buy it -games, songs...from them.Before you spend your money on this new ipad2 - think do you really need it, would it deliver for you?
