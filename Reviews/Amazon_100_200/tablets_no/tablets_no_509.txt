I asked for an ipad stand for xmas.  My husband bought this one and I think it was a very good choice.  I wanted it for use in the kitchen, something to prop up my ipad so I could use it for recipes and other apps I use in the kitchen.  It's great.  I'm very pleased.  It is solid and does not take up very much space.  It keeps my ipad out of the way from getting icky from everything while cooking.  It is adjustable so I can change it as I need to.  It's perfect for what I wanted to use it for.  Bonus, it is great for reading magazines or holding cook books too!
