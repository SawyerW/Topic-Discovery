It's kind of like having your own casino: there's always that chance that it will do what you want sometime. It hardly ever does, but I keep going back for more because of that chance. Also everyone else seems to love them. I suppose I will learn to like it too. So far it is a device that devours loads of time, and all for the purpose of making it work. If you want a new hobby of playing with a new device, this one is a doozy. If you want it to actually accomplish something useful, I'm skeptical after having it for a month. You can always call Apple for tech support, but my experience was that they were more interested in selling me more stuff. I don't see that that is my solution.
