While this device may seem like a great buy, it is decieving.  First of all, the user interface is very clunky, even after it is calibrated.  Second, it does not perform at the acceptable level of a computer.  Programs crash (force close) and it seems to drag when going from one activity to another.  Third, there is NO FLASH and no flash in the apps market.  That cancels out ALL VIDEOS on the internet.  The app market does not have native apps for must have apps like Facebook and Evernote.  I also felt that the Android version that it has is very outdated.  I recommend that you do not purchase this device.  Buy and ipad or save your money for the new droid tablets.
