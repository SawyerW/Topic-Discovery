I love my new Lenovo tablet. It does more than an iPad, weighs about the same, and does nearly as much as a more powerful (and more expensive, and heavier) laptop. The swivel screen works like a charm and even allows you to surf the web without booting into Windows. You can use the touchscreen, trackpad, and keyboard seamlessly. Too seamlessly perhaps: I keep finding myself trying to use my desktop monitor as a touchpad.One caveat: Many reviewers complain about battery life with the standard battery. Amazon shipped me the extended battery by default, and it lasts 8-10 hours on a charge.
