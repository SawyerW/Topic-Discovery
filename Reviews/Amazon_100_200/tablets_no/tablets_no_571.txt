I bought this tablet for my daughter thinking it would be so much better than a iPod touch.  Well it is but I can't seem to load any music which is the main reason for getting this device. Once I plug in the USB (came with tablet) into my PC, laptop, and new laptop I get the same error message, "USB Device Not Recognized".  I called the company and they told me to press Power button and Volume up button at the same time - go to USB Connect function.  That didn't work.  Then he said I have to have Windows Media Player 11 on my personal computer(s) in order for the USB to be recognized.  I have WMP 11 and still nothing.  I did a search on this error and it seems others have had the same problem.  No easy fixes either.  Let's see how the replacement works.
