Every few weeks I have to update the software. iTunes fires up. Decides it needs an update. it also tries to get me to install quicktime and safari - which i decline to download - for the 10th time. it downloads and installs its update. it wants to restart my computer. it restarted. now i download the ipad update. now it wants to sync. it takes 10 minutes just to sync my ipad. now its updating. and when it's done, iTunes, for the 10th time, wants to know why its not the default player for my music. the entire process seems to take 45 minutes. i really expect better from Apple.
