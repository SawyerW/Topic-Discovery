I first spotted the Thought Out Stabile 2.0 I Pad stand in an American publication, it looked just right to me , the product information gave the impression that this was a very well made item.The only place I could locate this  was from Amazon, and then I understand it had to be imported from U S A. With postage and import duty it did end up being rather pricey. However I must say its a fantastic stand, very sturdy and stylish, the I Pad can be used in vertical or horizontal position. I also purchased from Amazon a Griffin stylus, both these items make my Pad even more user friendly.Treat yourself, you won't regret itRobert Clive
