This is not an iPad. An iPad will cost you at least $300 more. All the negative things people are saying about the Velocity have merit. I wouldn't call it trash. However it's a decent buy for an Android reader a $118. I can read both Kindle and Borders books on the Velocity. Changing the screen to white text on a black background makes reading much easier. The screen can be fuzzy at times. The touch screen is highly resistive, frustratingly so. However, using a stylus makes it easier to use and read books.If you want a reader the Kindle or Nook are much better as "pure readers." IPad is in a totally different league than the Velocity, it has the price tag to show it. If you're looking for an inexpensive introduction into the tablet world, then the Velocity is not a bad choice at $118.
