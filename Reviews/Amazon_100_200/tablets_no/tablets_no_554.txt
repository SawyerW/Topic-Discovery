If you can get by without tech support this is the type of ereader  to purchase. A lot of it is trial and error or know someone who has one. Even if you get it to work it seems that something else will stop working. For some reason the videos that played before would no longer play. I took it to Borders since they sold them at one time. They told me that they stopped selling them because of the lack of tech support from the Cruz company and about only 20% of them actually worked.If you just want to use it as an ereader only it works good.
