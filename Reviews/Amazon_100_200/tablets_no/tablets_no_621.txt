My friend recommended this tablet to me when I said I was considering getting one for school instead of paying the high prices for school books. This is probably the best decision I ever made, and that was over six months ago. Now, I buy my books for a fraction of the cost through the school and I don't have to carry around all those heavy texts.The tablet is for the most part really great. It's a little heavy at times and a bit bulky, but you get over it soon enough. I'm always using it to check my emails, read ebooks, and download power points for class.The only downside is it came with a series of little tiny scratches on one corner, but it's easily overlooked and I did buy it used.
