I recieved my tablet early afternoon from Amazon and I have to say it's everything i've come to expect from motorola. Granted it's brand new, but Honeycomb is a solid OS and features items you've come to expect from a browser. There are the typical things that do come with new items, like app manufacturers need to catch up, but i'm not worried about that. The majority of the apps I've used with v.2.2 on my Incredible work just fine and the Documents to GO v3 works beautifully as well.Movies, Music show and sound excellent and the tablet itself is a bit on the heavy side, but it's SOLID! Personally, I don't have an issue with that and appreciate what this thing can do now... and WILL DO later. The next firmware update will enable the Micro-SD slot, but it does have 32GB of space on-board which is plenty for now. Afterall... it's not designed to carry everything on a power-user PC, but carries enough to keep me busy while out and about.All in all... I am one happy camper I waited for this to come out.
