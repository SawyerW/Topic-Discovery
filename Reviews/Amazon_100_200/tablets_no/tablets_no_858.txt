I feel like all the hype around the iPad before its launch made it seem like it was going to be the greatest and most revolutionary thing since the first PC, and then it came out and there was a little disappointment because it wasn't, but now there seems to be this comfortable feeling that the iPad has nestled into our lives. It doesn't change everything, but it's great for playing games, surfing the web, and reading books while you're on the couch, or a plane, or a bus. It also has great battery life, the camera's are a great feature, and even though they aren't the quality, you won't use it as much as you might think. It's not the greatest thing ever, and you can do without it, but it is really fun to use, and I read all my books on it now. Plus, you feel this sense of harmony when you get it synced up with your computer of phone over iCloud.
