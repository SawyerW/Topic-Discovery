I owned iPad 1 but, I was surprised when iPad 2 comes out. I was in need for more speed, camera, more battery life (10 hours) and more monitor resolution. Now, I have more satisfaction but still we are in need for Flash module and more development to let us use it instead of our laptop. I am using it for my project management work, some photo / movie editing, emails, presentation, Internet browsing, to do list calendar, friends caring, Facebook, and more. I compared it with motorols Xoom tablet but, I choosed the iPad 2. I love iPad 2 and I have a lot of ideas for it's required development and I hope to get a Chanel to communicate with Apple the greatest company around the world. Also, I have the Mac mini iPod and iPhone. I recommend the iPad 2 as the best tablet in the market.
