First, let me tell you about what you can do on a Kindle Fire...I just told you what you can do on a Kindle Fire. The only advantage the Kindle Fire has over the iPad is the Directory (built-in) and the Android side-loading. The apps are not well built, and after a while, the UI (or user interface) gets old!-Now, let me tell you what you can do on a iPad that is BETTER than the Kindle Fire:Video, Camera, Skype, Kindle APP, (which I find WAY better than that of the Kindle its self), Agmented realiy apps (Such as Flow, junaio, Microsoft Photosynh), apps that require audio input and iPhone apps.-There are MORE things you can do, too though I just named a couple. If, in the case that there are no apps that suit your needs on the iPad, it works with iPhone apps VERY well, too.-75% of my LIFE is on this thing (iPad), and on my old Kindle, less than 5%. Saddly, the iPad killer just got killed by the iPad.
