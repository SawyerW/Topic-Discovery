I bought it for web surfing from my easy chair and because it had a larger screen.It had poorer WiFi reception than any laptop in the family or my son's IPod. Browser was fading in and out in a location I have used many times beforeDocumentation/ op procedures are limited to an 8 page guide. According to their Help desk that is all that is available, so you are limited to trial and error.You Tube and most other streaming did not work. According to their help desk their app for that was not working properly and they were working on it.The 8XX- number for the help desk was discontinued causing use of a toll number. I was put on wait for ten minutes while they checked to see if they had a more complete manual.I returned it to Amazon. Very disappointing.
