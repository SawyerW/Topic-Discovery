If you are waiting to buy one because your friends told you to wait for gen 2..DON'T...Your friends don't even own an Ipad or they are jealous and bitter...This is technogology at its finest..and it's tons of fun....but keep your laptop...******UPDATE*****.***have been very happy with Ipad 1st gen...but had to have 2nd gen.......Battery life is the same...thinner,  whatever....Camera....whatever.....Faster  YES!  The gen. 2 has double the memory and a faster processor ..I am using a samsung 4G wireless hotspot thru Verizon and ipad 2 is very fast......BUT I could have lived with ipad 1... For those of you that are finding good deals on generation 1 pads...Get them!!!  I sold mine in one day for $300.00 to a friend...Buy them  without 3g...Instead try Verizon with  4g personal wifi device (mine is By samsung)  It makes both ipads FLY!!!
