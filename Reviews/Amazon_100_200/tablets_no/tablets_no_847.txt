Nothing I can say bad about the Ipad 2.  I have pretty much quit using my pc since getting the Ipad2.  I know a lot of people have said the Ipad2 wasnt meant to take the place of a laptop or pc but thats relative to what you use a pc for.  For me its easily taken the place of my laptop.  If what you do is surf the web and use Itunes then the Ipad will be what you need and its so much more convienent than having to go to my computer everytime I want to look up a score of a game or see a movie review.  I would recommend the Ipad2 to anyone.I also read lots of books and I must say reading books on the Ipad vs. The Kindle is no comparison either.  The Ipad's ibooks look so much better and I like the feel a lot better than the Kindle.  Kindle also makes a big deal about being able to locate a book and be reading it within 60 seconds.....so can I on the Ipad.  So I dont know why they are trying to use that as a great feature.
