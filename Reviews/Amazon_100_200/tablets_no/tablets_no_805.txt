I purchased the IPad2 after reading several reviews about the new Ipad's internet connection issue. IPad2's setup was very easy. I already have an ITunes account so it took minutes to get started. It took less then 5 minutes to get my secured internet connection working. I was disappointed that I can not play any games through my steam account. The application only lets me chat with other users so hopefully steam will provide an application that allows you to play your purchased games using IPad. I really like being able to use Kindle's and Overdrive's readers in order to read ebooks. I plan to install VMWare on the machine so I can use it to work with .net applications.
