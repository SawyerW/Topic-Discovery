As a PhD student, I spend a lot of time in the library and I need a light computer like this to carry with me while I look through books.  This is perfect--since it's barely two pounds, you often forget that it's there.  With the LitePad, my (now) hand-written notes, papers, and articles are easily within reach whenever I need them; there's no more wishing I had brought more papers with me from home and the like.  My Palm used to fulfill a similar function, but I've stopped carrying it now that I have this.  I was especially surprised by how accurate the note-to-text feature is: even though it's not perfect, it's still many times better than what we had before.  With my handwriting at least, it has about a 90% accuracy rate (usually the words it misses are words in other languages, etc).  This machine has changed my life for the better, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone else in academia.
