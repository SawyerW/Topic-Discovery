My wife had been dropping hints about wanting an iPad after seeing her sister with one. I thought this would make a good Valentine's day present and the price tag was palatable.Wow! She's crazy about this thing. She doesn't even use her laptop anymore. She's on this thing all the time. And it's constantly playing music -- good music even. And the sound is great, considering it's just a tablet. She uses it to skype with her family overseas, browse the web, do email, shopping, everything. She even brings it to bed and I have to say, "Honey, can you please turn down the music? I'm trying to sleep."
