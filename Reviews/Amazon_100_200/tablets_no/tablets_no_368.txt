I won a 64G 3G iPad from Rush Limbaugh several weeks ago, and since receiving it I have been absolutely satisfied with handy devise.  I now have a reason to put digital copies of movies on an Apple product, surfing the internet while mobile much easier, it's easier to carry around than a laptop... The list goes on and on.My only complaints so far has been the need for Leopard software on your Mac computers.  I only have Tiger so I am forced to use my PC's iTunes.  The other is the price.  This thing is friggin expensive! Yes I got mine for free, but I wouldn't have paid basically 900 dollars for this tablet.All in all this things is awesome! I would advise waiting a year or two when they become more common place and cheaper.  anyway I give it a 5 out of 5!
