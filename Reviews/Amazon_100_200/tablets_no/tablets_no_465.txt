I got a great deal on this tablet, only had to pay around $100 when it was on sale, including shipping.  It still wasn't worth it.  The tough screen is very unresponsive - we have found the only to way be able to use it without too many issues is to use a stylus.  It can not even load apps such as the Kindle E-reader.  The AppsLib (android Market for the Archos 7) is horrible.What I ended up with was an expensive MP3/MP4 player that has the bonus of being able to access the internet.  The iPod Touch is better than this thing!I have an Android phone, love the Android platform and The Android Market that comes with my phone.  I expected a lot more from an Android tablet.  Seriously, even on sale - it's not worth it!
