now there is 2013 model of nexus 7, hence 2012 model was cheaper. we were between 2013 and 2012 models, but then just bought the 2012 model. it is totally awesome & satisfactory  after our smartphones. these tablet are optimized by google chrome provides you a smooth surfing & facebook experience. Moreover, screen quality is really good. images, videos, etc...sound qualtiy is good, too.only thing is there is one front cam, but there isn't any back cam.but of course, tablets are not for photo shooting purpose. since we carry our camera and smartphones with as, this is totally not an issue to mention.the cpu performance is reallly cool. you can open pdf, excel, etc... you can watch HD videos, play games.I am really happy and glad for buying this nexus 7. especially 2012 model is way cheaper than 2013 version.
