This is actually the second Nexus 7 we own.  We received the first one as a gift last Christmas and my wife uses it everyday.  Since receiving it, it accompanies her everywhere.  In the past year, I've grown accustomed to having it around also and decided to purchase my wife a new one and I took over the old one.  I must admit it is quite handy to check emails and Internet without the burden of a heavy laptop but just big enough to be able to read without trying to strain your eyes to look at a cell phone screen.  I like the Android system and plenty of apps available.  I also like the glass screen to prevent damage and not having any need for protectors.  It's got a 32GB hard drive which is plenty for our use.  If you want all the bells and whistles as some have, you going to have to pay for it!  For the price, this a winner!
