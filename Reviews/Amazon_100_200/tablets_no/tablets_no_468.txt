I've used the Archos for about two weeks now.  My biggest complaint is the touchscreen.  I've learned how to fingertype really quickly on my iphone, so the Archos touchscreen is a real pain... you have to use a lot more pressure, which slows you down.  Another complaint is that the Android operating system is quite different from the iphone operating system.  The Archos scroll menus just didnt work like I expected them to, coming from an iphone environment.  I've also had trouble typing in text boxes on websites..the browser will pop in and out of the box.  I also found the Android application store to be confusing to navigate.  As others have mentioned, the power jack is far too easily confused with the headphone jack.  I've also have some trouble getting the device to turn on, even when plugged in with a full battery - the on switch doesnt seem to respond every time.  The screen is very pretty, very big, so I'm sure it would be nice to watch movies on.  But I was hoping for something that was a little more like a tablet computer, not a large ipod.
