I purchased a Nexus 7 tablet. It was absolutely wonderful for 4 months. Since that time I have had to return it for repair twice within 30 days for the same problem. Their customer service is terrible & they would not tell me the parts they replaced even though I had their part numbers. The extended warranty company I purchased through Square Trade was the best & only people who do what they advertise. They have even offered to refund the full purchase price of the extended warranty I purchased due to the defective product that I was sold. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TO PURCHASE ANY ASUS PRODUCTS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! I received my Nexus tablet back ONE week ago today and I am still having the same problems! They want me to contact my internet service provider and take it back to where I purchased it to see if they will give me a refund! THIS IS THE 3RD TIME & NOBODY AT ASUS IS THE LEAST BIT HELPFUL! I HAVE SPENT $462.03 IN PRODUCT & SHIPPING COSTS ALONE. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!
