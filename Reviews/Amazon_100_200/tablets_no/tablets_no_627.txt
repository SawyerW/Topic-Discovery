When I originally started to look for a tablet pc my main concern was that it could run windows.  The software I use at work will only work with windows 7 professional. after receiving this tablet i am sure i made the right decision.After having this tablet for about a month now i have determined what i have come to want/need in addition.-portable keyboard, typing on the screen gets old especially when typing in a password when the letters dont highlight after touching them.-A different case, the case that comes with it is nice but fitment around the device leaves something to be desired.other than those the only problem with the device is when you turn the screen (90 degrees) it is slow to react sometimes or reacts without you wanting it to.This is a great product i am glad i made the purchase.
