I know the IPAD 2 is not the newest but this unit has always done what I need.  I needed more memory so I bought a second one and my last one is being used by someone else.  Great deal on IPAD 2 as well, now that the others are available.  I have never had a problem with the screen on the IPAD 2 so really don't see the need for the high res on the IPAD 3 especially when you give up the battery life in exchange.  I know people with the IPAD 3 that would go back to the IPAD 2 if they had it to do over again.  - My opinion
