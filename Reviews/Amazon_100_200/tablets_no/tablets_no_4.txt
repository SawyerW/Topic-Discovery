You can't love a tablet if it wont turn on. This product has issues with not taking a charge when the battery gets run down. The first time it happened we followed all this tricks, holding buttons while unplugging and plugging in the charger ect...and got it to work...tech support warned us never let it lose power completely it may NEVER charge again.  Well as life goes the wireless was left on while we were gone for a week end and yep, it lost all its charge and no tricks will work.  Tech answer, hope your warranty is still good.  Don't buy this tablet, I loved using it I really did, but it has a major flaw unfortunately.
