This item meets my expectations and fills the need to provide a stable stand for my iPad. I had looked at numerous stands in stores and online and kept coming back to this one. It is heavy enough to support the iPad without being top heavy. It does not slide. The iPad does not slide when placed on it. The iPad fits with or without the case. The iPad can be placed in portrait or landscape position. The height and angle are great for viewing as well as keyboarding. It looks great. The Stabile stand has everything I want -- I bought it -- good decision!
