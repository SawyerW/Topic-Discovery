I ordered an iPad with wifi and 3G advertized as "new in the box".  It arrived on time but the box was not sealed and the label indicated that it was wifi but not 3G.  The seller offered to take it back or reduce the price.  I accepted the price reduction and tried to set up the iPad without success.  The seller said Apple would fix it under warranty.  Apple tested the iPad and informed me that it was 3G, the serial number did not match the box and that it was first sold and registered in Texas on October 22, 2010.  The warranty would expire in 86 days. Apple confirmed that I was sold a used iPad.  I am now in the process of trying to get my $ back.  I must return the item before and can receive a refund.  I would rate this as no stars if I could.  No excuse for selling used as new.
