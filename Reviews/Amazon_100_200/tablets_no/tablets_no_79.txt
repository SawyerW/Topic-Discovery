I ordered this product for my daughter for Christmas. She was able to get about a good month or two of use out of it. Now something is going on with charger port. It won't even stay charging long enough to get a full charge. In order to get a full charge on this device you would literally have to sit and hold the charger in the device with pressure applied for it to charge. I'm not sure if its even worth having device repaired or to just purchase a better device all together. Other than that my daughter really enjoyed this tablet. Just a waste of money for me. It's now collecting dust !!!
