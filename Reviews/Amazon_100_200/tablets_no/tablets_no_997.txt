I purchased this "used like new" from Amazon Warehouse and was pleasantly surprised to receive an item that looked brand new.  It easily found my Wi Fi and I was able to set up my email accounts.  It is a little heavy for reading, but I mostly use my Kindle Fire for that.  The iPad quickly connects to the Internet and I find myself picking it up instead of my laptop when I need to check something on the net.  It is my go to device for casual browsing and viewing my recipes.  Love it more than I thought I would.
