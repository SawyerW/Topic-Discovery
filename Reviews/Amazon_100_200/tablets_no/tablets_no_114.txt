For under two hundred bucks this thing is a pretty nice piece of hardware.  Using OneNote with this thing is awesome.  I also use it for DJing (Traktor) and it never has any trouble.  I can just flip the screen around and use it in tablet mode on a stand with only the pen to hit stuff I don't have buttons for on my controller.  Recently put an extended battery and SSD in it and installed Windows 7 x64, now it's dead quiet and gets over six hours of regular use on a charge.  Personally I love the 1024x768 display on mine (and the anti-glare film), it's a good aspect ratio/screen size for writing/drawing and it's sharp enough that it gets the job done.Replacement batteries, chargers, docking stations, replacement parts, etc. are dirt cheap for this thing, too.  Go for it if you need a note taking machine that's fairly capable in its own right.
