Well first off this is a nook that is not compatable with a nook app. Can't read any nook books or download any ....I have to use kindle only app which i hate. What about the 200 nook books I have purchased through the years. A huge disappointment. I believe the person who first purchased this knew its problem and resold it not caring that someone would have their issue. I kept it only because even though its a non nook ....nook book  I can use it with other book apps. But that not why I purchased a nook. Really bad!
