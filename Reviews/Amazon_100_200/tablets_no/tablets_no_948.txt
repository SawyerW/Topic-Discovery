When I do a search for the Ipad 2 in Amazon, there are quite a few vendors who are selling their Ipad 2 asking for a huge premium. I could just feel and smell the greed from these vendors. My suggestion is if you could wait for another month or so, the supply issue will stabilize and bring the Ipad 2 prices back to its normal price without the price gouging. You could also order from Apple online which I did and I got mine in 8 days. So the choice is yours if you want to support these greedy vendors or get it in 8 days from Apple online.
