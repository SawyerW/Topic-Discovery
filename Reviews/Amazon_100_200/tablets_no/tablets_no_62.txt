The life of the tablet did not reach one year.  Now is dead after 8 month of use.The touch screen does not have good sensitity and the plug to connect the tablet and charge the battery is weak, so after 5 month of use started the problems to keep the conection and charge the battery.Too slow to start up.The updates of the operative system did not work well. After every update, the operation became more slow and the settings were changed without notice.The technical support is not good (at least out of USA). Some European countries do not have any service centerDid not have frontal camera
