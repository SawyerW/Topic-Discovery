I have had this HP Slate for four months. I love having a tablet running windows. I also have an android tablet. And it has its place for playing games, web browsing, listening to music, etc. But you cannot beat a windows tablet for serious office work. Granted windows 7 isn't optimized for a tablet, but it still performs more than adequately. It is a little more sluggish than an android tablet, but I am sure windows 8 will address these minor issues. This is a great tablet and does what you have come to expect from a windows platform. It does not disappoint. Wifi is excellent, setup is a breeze. I am very happy with my slate.
