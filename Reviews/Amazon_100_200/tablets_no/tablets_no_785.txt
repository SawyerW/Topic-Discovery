Wow I debated on an iPad for so long! I had a really small laptop but I always dreamed of an iPad. I finally took the plunge and would never give it back. Yes, it is pricy but is so worth it!! I mainly use mine for Facebook, shopping, Internet banking, and playing candy crush. It is a great convenience to just turn it on and start using. No worrying about loading or starting up. The picture is hd and crystal clear. If you need a keyboard they make Bluetooth ones. I would buy a newer one but mine is still going great !
