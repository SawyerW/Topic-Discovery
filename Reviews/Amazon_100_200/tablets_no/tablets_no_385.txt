Not only is this much cheaper in todays day with so many iPad Successors but the first Gen iPad is still very useful and fast so if you never had the chance to dive into Apple's iPad because it was expensive, you have no excuse now. I would recommend anyone to give it a shot. It's as useful as any android tablet on todays market but probably slightly slower due to iOS7. The winning difference? The much bigger screen and as far as tablets go. This should suffice with its comparable prices..you could even take a look at the iPad 2 for a camera now and save money. Beware of hardware incompatibilities though, not all iPads are built the same.
