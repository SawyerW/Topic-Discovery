Lenove Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook is great tablet and combine netbook too . I purchased it 2 weeks ago and I enjoy it from the first time it was turned  on. I did upgrade to windows 7 home primum and 2GB of memory so I can get everything from this little netbook/tablet.I have no issue with using microsoft office and other programs and WiFi works great whenever it recognized to be around.I gave 4 stars due to weak speakers ,lack of bluetooth ( I added bluetooth dongle ) and having stops while watching movies.I recommand this tablet for its price , functionality , connectivity and battery life.
