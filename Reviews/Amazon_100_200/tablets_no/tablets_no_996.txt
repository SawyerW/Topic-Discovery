didnt get the ipad 3 because  it is heavier, and dont care if the battery its going to last 5 instead of 10 hours. Just wanted a light tablet!!.the main problem which is not a secret to anyone at this moment is that it is very restricted to the use of the famous(infamous) itunes.the only way  to copy my tons of bookmarks was on safari and with the help of an expert. the only movie format that reads is mp4,and nothing ,pictures,files,videos,nothing can be organized on the tablet itself. It has to be done in the computer,and then moved to the ipad. In my humble opinion apple has never been friendly,or easy to use,and its full of restrictions but WHO CARES,its an apple, its magnificent!
