I'm a long time Archos user and have used almost every model from the 604 on up (I'm now using a 101 g9 turbo tablet, which I'm very happy with).  This model (and the 48) was to replace the Archos 5 line but except for the updated Android it performs as well or poorly as the Archos 5.  The screen in this model actually seem to be less responsive, especially without a pointed stylus or pen. Furthermore it is significantly less screen size and that makes a HUGE difference.  Unless you MUST have all the Google Market apps only available for Android 2.1 and up (I really don't miss any of it - there's more than enough available for the 5 model), my advice is save some money and buy the Archos 5 instead.  Realize though both models have a "passive screen" that can't come close to responsiveness as "capacitive" screen" of pricier models.  If you're looking for a classy 4 to 5 inch screen Android unit that runs rings around the Archos - take a look at Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0.
