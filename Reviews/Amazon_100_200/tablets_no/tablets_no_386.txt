Got this first generation i-pad used. It had a couple scratches and the back was worn out but there were no dent's or imperfections. The ipad booted right up and setting it up was easy. After almost 3 years this device was in very good usable condition. The touchscreen made me feel spoiled, it was brisk in loading pages, and the WiFi setup was nice and easy. I liked almost everything about it except...-Batteries were a little worn out, so it only has about 5 hours of battery life instead of 10 but it still works fine-The price...holy crap this thing exceeded 1 G when it came out. You definitely get what you paid for. It's like getting a Lexus instead of a Kia, it's worth it because this is the ordinary to extrodinary!I recommend this product to my Grandma and her dog.Best bang for the buck, and the buck is even leather interior! Rated a whopping 5 stars...good job Apple, you guy's are the best at today's technology!
