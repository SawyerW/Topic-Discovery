I can't believe they're still trying to sell this model in 2013. They must have made a million of them, and have an overstocked warehouse.This was rushed to market in 2010, with an old version of Android that couldn't even access the Android Market (now called Google Play Store).They updated the operating system to 2.1, which is just ok, kindof a barebones. Still waaaay outdated by 2013 standards.Processor is really slow (600mHz ... when the slowest smartphone on the market today is about 1GHz). Small memory. Frequent crashes.The touchscreen is also an outdated technology - *not* like a smartphone, iPad, or most other tablets. You have to push really hard, drag really hard. Using a stylus is best. We tried to plug in a keyboard, then to pair a wireless keyboard - neither worked for us.To make this usable, you'd have to "root" it & install your own Android. But it's still got all the other limitations.I *might* consider using this as a toy for $30 or $40, for music, small videos, and facebook updates. But the current price ($150) is a joke. Look elsewhere if shopping for a tablet.
