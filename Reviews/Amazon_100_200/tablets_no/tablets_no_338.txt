Unrealistic,futuristic, and fantastic gadget. Amazing experience of touch screen.I have not tried Mototorola xoom or Blackberry tablet but this is fine of its own.The apps are amazing that you can do a lot of different things so easily which can almost replace your netbbok, desktop. More and more I use my Ipad and lesser and lesserI use my netbook. Kids love the games using touch screen,apps are so dirt cheap yet so high quality. This so much portable than netbook that it can be great tool for doctors to show their patients x-rays, or educate them with photos and video clips. All this is possible with affordable apps.
