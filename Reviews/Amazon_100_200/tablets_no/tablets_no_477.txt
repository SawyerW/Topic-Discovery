This was the product I wanted, it did all that I required, (ereader, net, notes etc.) but it kept turning on by itself.  This would occur a couple times a day when I would leave it in suspend.  I killed all apps that could turn it on and it still would do it.  I called support and they said return it.  I did and it took 11 days for the replacement to get here.  It sat in Federal Way WA for days but that is usps's review :-)  The new unit arrived and did the same thing as the first one so since I leave my units in sleep/suspend and can't have them turning on at the wrong time I returned it as well.Liked the unit very much but....
