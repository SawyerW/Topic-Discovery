This tablet is awesome and comes packed with features for the price.Access to the great Android Google Play market.  You can enjoy almost all the apps you enjoy on your Android phone.  From Nest's mobile thermostats, to Minecraft, to Facebook.The device is super fast with it's qaud-core processor.  It's also great with battery life.The only problem is the brightness is slightly dull compared to other tablets.  It's harder to see outside.  It also does not have expandible memory so you'll be stuck at 32GB but I haven't ran into any storage problems.  I paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard that also acts as a case.
