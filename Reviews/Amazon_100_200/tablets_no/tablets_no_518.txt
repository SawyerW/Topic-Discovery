Have had this device for 3 days now and I am more than impressed. This thing is blazing fast and very responsive. Sure there are issues  but developer is releasing  patch to address these by 12-24-12 according to their web site. Hopefully this fix will address the problems with wi-fi waking ,Nvidia drivers (not able to play angry birds.. etc). True the multi-touch and lack of market are a bummer, but what do you want for 300 bucks? So glad I did not spend double this price on a Galaxy tab that will be outdated in 6 months.pros-Fast, fast, fast-Screen res is great for the specs-Very responsive-HDMI out is awesome-USB and SD card media (Bite me Apple)-rooted out of the box-300 bucks!- Jetflicks streaming on 7 inch screen!-Flash player rocks (Bite me Apple)-Great readerCons-No Market (hopefully XDA developers will help with this)-Wi-fi fails to wake from sleep (workaround available and patch coming 12-24-10)-Nvidia drivers not up to date (patch coming 12-24-10)-Not true multi-touch ( not an issue for me, I have no plans on making this into a gaming rig)-Proprietary connector for dock (not a big issue since there is USB/SD card support)-Menu buttons have no back lighting
