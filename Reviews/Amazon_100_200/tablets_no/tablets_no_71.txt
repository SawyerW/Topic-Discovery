I am not a tech guru, just an average person so take my review for what its worth.  This is a very good tablet!  We have an I-pad which is awesome.  Bought this one because of the price and wanted a second tablet..  The Asus was recommended to me by a friend who fanatically researches everything before she buys.  I read several reviews (CNet to be specific) and it was highly rated even rated higher than the I-pad mini).  The size is perfect, the screen is responsive and it is as fast as the wi-fi being used.  You can buy a newer model but for the average joe, this is perfect for surfing the web, streaming video and checking e-mail.  Has a good battery life.  My 5 year old watches video and is constantly changing apps.  The battery usually lasts approximately 6-7 hours with battery draining use (streaming video/games).  It appears solid and sturdy (same 5 year old has butterfingers).  For the money, I recommend this as a "best buy"!
