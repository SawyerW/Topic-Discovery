after reading all the negative reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this product. I was initially looking at it to replace my mp3 player, but wanted something with more functions. The negative reviews were right about most things but they have not turned out to be nearly as problematic as suggested.1. Finicky touch screen  This part is true the touch screen is finicky, but it's nothing you can't learn to adapt to by using your finger nail.(i have large fingers and have problems with most touch screens this size.2. Disappearing Icons  Sometimes the icons on the home screen do take a few seconds to come back after running an application. However they always return. It's reminiscent of an older computer with this same amount of processing power and nothing that's worried me.Overall I love this product, maybe I'm just more tolerant than others. It never leaves my side. (also I didn't expect it to be a tiny Ipad)
