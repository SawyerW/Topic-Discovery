It's a terrific toy when I am connected, but unfortunately I purchased the wrong ipad.  I deeply regret that I did not purchase the one with G3 capability.  It would make a great GPS; maps on the ipad are much easier to see than those on my iphone.At home where I have wifi, it is very convenient to use it for reading email, surfing the web and watching utube in my "reading chair."  However, for text only books, the Kindle is much easier to hold. It is slower than my desktop which is on the same wifi, but I tire of setting at my desktop all the time when I use a computer.  Sometimes I read on my Kindle and look up places and characters on my ipad.Frederica Shockley
