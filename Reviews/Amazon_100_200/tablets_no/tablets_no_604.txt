I have used many different brands of tablets (my computer experience is greater than average - I also analyze computers for productivity in my workplace). The Xoom beats all the other tablets I have used. It is fast (amazingly fast), the screen is beautiful, and the WiFi works perfect. I have yet to have a freeze of any kind or an Ap that does not work. I was thinking of purchasing an iPad2, so glad that was just a thought. Needless to say, this unit has exceeded my expectations. I would not hesitate to purchase again or recommend this to my friends. Great job Motorola and Google!
