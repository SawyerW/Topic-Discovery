I was excited when I opened the box! And when it powered up I the android screens looked like my Android phone screens. But once I started trying to browse the apps library my excitement turned to frustration.First, the touch screen is way worse than my LG Ally Android screen. And that screen already sucks compared to an iPhone or iPod touch. Not even close. Every time (95%) I tried to scroll through the app titles, I accidentally opened the install screen for an app. In addition, I got this for my kids.. and I downloaded a ton of games, and all but one was a complete waste of time. Most do not even use more than a third of the screen. I went to third party sites mentioned in reviews as well and those apps are just as bad. This should not even be on the market.Nice looking and a nice screen but it would well worth your time to save up for an iPad.
