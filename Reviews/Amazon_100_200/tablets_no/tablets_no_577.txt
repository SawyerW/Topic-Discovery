I bought this after owning a Archos 7 home tablet. The reason I chose this is to see if it had good volume and battery life like my 7 inch tablet. If you select for the display to go off it has great battery life and volume louder than Ipod. It will put music in a room for hours. The touchscreen I favor for typing letters over Ipod 3rd generation. Scrolling without entering an app is OK. The camera is poor, with grainy and blurry results in a room with fair lighting.Have had lockups from some poor apps but that is probably not the machines fault. Stopped doing it when uninstalled apps. Wireless works good. I'm satisfied with my purchase because I mainly bought it for a mp3 player without headphones that is smaller than my 7 inch and it has decent volume.
