I purchased a toshiba tablet for school.  It was the worst computer purchase I have ever made.  If I could I would give less than 1 star.  My computer was less than a month old and the hard drive died.  I purchased an extended warranty so I called to have it repaired.  Toshiba then proceded to tell me that they could replace the hard drive at a repair location but I would have to purchase an OS through them to have reinstalled on my new hard drive. I thought this was ridiculous.  Shortly after the hard drive was replace my motherboard died.  I again called Toshiba and they were unwilling to help.  I spoke to multiple supervisers before I finally filed a claim with the BBB.  Toshiba finally agreed to replace my motherboard but my computer is still basically non-functional (freezes, blue screens, wont turn on) and has a very loud high pitched whine whenever I do try to use it. I would not purchase another toshiba product ever.  I would also not recommend spending money on an extended warranty because toshiba customer service is unwilling to do anything to fix defective products.
