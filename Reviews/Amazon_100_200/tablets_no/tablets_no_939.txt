I received an iPad but it was not the 64 GB AT&T; WiFi 3G white iPad I paid for. I received a 16GB WiFi ONLY black iPad instead of what I paid $524.99 for. Speedy Mobile never responded to this incorrect item that was shipped. Do not purchase from this seller. They are dishonest and do not respond to customers. Still fighting for a full refund of $524.99 due to incorrect item. Amazon.com denied my original A-Z claim due to their representative incorrectly filing the claim. The Amazon.com representative entered incorrect information and to this day I have not received a refund. Purchase date: 6-17-12. Appeal claim  filed 7-2-12. Today's date: 7-19-12. I purchased this item for a buisness trip, educational and mainly  purposes. Enormous loss. Do the mathematics. Losses per day due to insufficient storage and other specifications. In spite of this extremely disappointing outcome, I'm ooking forward to a happier resolution. Fortunately, still have faith in Amazon.com. Stay tuned for the final update.
