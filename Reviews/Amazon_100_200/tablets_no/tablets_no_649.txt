I've been using a Galaxy Tab with Android OS for the past 7 months and decided to jump on the iPad 2 bandwagon.After a couple months of using it, here are my comments:If you not an Android user, then I guess you may think the iPad 2 is great.I can't say that I'm impressed with the fact that I have to reboot my iPad to resolve an intermittent issue of Safari hanging up, nor am I happy about having to give my credit card details to downloads "free" apps, I could go on, but maybe another time.I like the fact that its much lighter and cheaper than a Galaxy tab; you have the option of not choosing the 3G feature which I seldom use.Overall, its a nice tablet if you don't now what you're missing with Android. My advice would be to test other products before making a decision. I've now given my iPad 2 to my 5 year old and will continue to use my Galaxy tab.
