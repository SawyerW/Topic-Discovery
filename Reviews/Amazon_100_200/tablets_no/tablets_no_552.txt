Received Cruz eReader today. Initial setup was easy; wifi and email setup easy; over all quality was classy and sturdy. Then problems started: Got email quickly but opening email hung unit up; when I tried access to regular website frequently visited it hung up again; then the whole OS froze. Everything I tried, pushing on/off button, touching every icon at top of the screen did nothing. So I contacted [...] for support, 51 minutes later I got the tech. Had to remove back of unit to unplug battery; did this three time but the unit never did turn on again. I was really looking forward to having a reader with wifi capability. Problem with online hang ups was Droid's OS problem with Flash ....this conclusion by service tech. Only workaround was to get a "beta" app that helped to resolve the problem with Flash. Purchased from HSN, but TV Ad said nothing about Flash incompatibility. Returning it tomorrow!
