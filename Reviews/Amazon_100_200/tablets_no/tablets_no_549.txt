After accidentally breaking my beloved Aluratek Libre Pro I decided to try something new. Cruz Reader was on sale at that time and I got it for my husband and me. We played with it for about 4 hours, and after that our decision was unanimous - this piece of trash needs to go back. Here is what I totally hated:- touch screen is awful - in order to get some kind of response you have to press it so hard that you see a darker spot on the screen, no matter how many times I calibrated it- even though you can use SD cards with this device, if you try installing apps they get installed to the internal memory only, which is 256 MB; and after installing one (!!!) app, I got a message that the memory was full- the app for DRM free books was horrible- it was pretty much impossible to read books in txt format.- does not support cyrillic at all (neither books nor web browsing) -- not sure about other languages, but have a feeling it would have problems with anything but English.I would not suggest this device to anybody.
