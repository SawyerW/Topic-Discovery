I wanted to like this tablet, but it's buggy.  The android software archos bundled with the home tablet just doesn't work well at all.  When I first opened the tablet, it crashed constantly.  After rebooting the tablet, it worked fine for awhile, but then it started crashing again.Why you should stay away from this product or the company:1) No software updates.  They expect you to buy their newer products.2) Buggy product that doesn't work out of the box.3) There tablet just doesn't work.  Expect to use custom firmware to make the tablet useable.  But realize this, if you do that then you void your warranty.4) Customer support doesn't offer any real help.  I work in software and they just plain suck.STAY AWAY!!
