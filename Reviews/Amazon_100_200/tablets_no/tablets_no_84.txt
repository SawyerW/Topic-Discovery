had it for about 4 months. Was slow and unresponsive at times and especially when it was nearing its end. Now it won't turn on no matter how long I wait for the screen to load, which on average took about 5 seconds after you hit the button to show the slide to unlock screen (not from startup.) In my opinion, not worth the money. Would rather have bought a 2nd generation ipod (and I hate apple products) that I know would hold up for a while. If u need something temporary to hold you and you have a lot of patience with technology, then this tablet will work for you. I had the patience but I was expecting something to last me for at least a year not 4 months.
