Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with this product.  About a week after I got it, it began to glitch--zooming in, clicking links, and typing without touching the screen.  It would type extremely fast so it was unusable.  The first few times, I "erased all content and settings" and it would work again for another week, and then become unusable again.  Given Apple's strong track record, I kept thinking, "I must be doing something wrong."  I tried adjusting my safety settings and turning off WiFi thinking maybe I had a hacker.....  Fast forward a few months of basic non-use due to the problems, and I decided it was time to have Apple look at it.  Naturally, they sent it back immediately after a hard reset and said, "the problem could not be duplicated."  Of course it worked for about a week again, and now it is once more useless due to the intense glitching.  I can't think of any other high-end electronic device I've ever purchased with this many problems.  Unquestionably the worst $600 I've ever spent.
