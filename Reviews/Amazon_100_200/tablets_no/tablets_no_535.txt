Since I have an Android phone, I was familiar with the OS to begin with.  I was a little disappointed to learn that you actually had to have a wifi connection to read books on the Borders app. I was, however, pleased as punch when I discovered that this is not the case with the Kindle app(of course you need the connection to DL books).  So, now, I see it as having a very nice Kindle with a backlight that I can do a little internet surfing on. Although there is no access to Android Market at this time (I do hope this changes) I have noticed that even since yesterday apps are being added to the Cruz market. For $120, I'm VERY pleased with this purchase. And no, it's NOT an iPad.
