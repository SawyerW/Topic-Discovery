The iPad 2 is a nice step up from the first generation iPad.  The new thin design only is a reason to select the 2nd generation model over the first.  Much more like a tablet than the first one, the new sleek design is lighter and feels much better in your hands.  Of course the camera is a big difference and it allows you to do things like Skype.  There are some other changes like a doubling of the RAM size, but those first two features are the ones that will immediately jump out at you.  After that, it operates the same as the first generation iPad and is truly one of the cooler tech devices out on the market.
