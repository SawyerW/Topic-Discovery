I'd wanted a PDA-sized tablet so that I could read e-books, check emails, browse the web, etc., while traveling or during downtime. I purchased this because it was on sale for about $145. The resistive touchscreen takes some getting used to as I had only ever used capacitive prior. I usually use my fingernail on it to make it easier, but this does mean it isn't easy to type quickly (the bluetooth support makes it possible to use a bluetooth keyboard, though not necessarily the best solution.) The device is usually responsive, though obviously it helps to kill apps not in use; sometimes it is a bit sluggish coming out of sleep or bringing up the unlock screen. Using the Arctools app it is quite easy to put Android Market onto the device.For its niche, it is quite nice, since it is extremely thin and lightweight (much lighter than smartphones) and easily fits into a pocket. In retrospect I wish I had spent a bit more to get a newer larger tablet, but that fills a different niche.
