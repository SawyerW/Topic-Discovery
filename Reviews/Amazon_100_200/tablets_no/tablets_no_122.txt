This machine is the biggest waste money, It was always overheating, and even before the first year the computer completely locked up, and wouldn't turn on. I was thankfully under warranty at that time and got it fixed, after a while the wireless card stopped working, and I had to connect the laptop directly to router. In my second year my computer failed again and I wasn't so lucky with the warranty. I will never buy HP ever again, and in fact I have a beautiful Asus UL30Vt now... I might as well have burned the money I used to buy this piece of garbage from HP.
