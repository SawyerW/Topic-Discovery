When I decided to buy the Ipad, there was no news of the Ipad2. So I thought Apple would launch a new product by august/2011 or if a new one was to be launched, they would announce it, so customers like me would wait some days to buy the Ipad2 or if they give a generous discount the decision would be easier. But they did not give any clue whatsoever of the new product, neither did the retailers like Amazon, that surely knew what was happenning. I rated 3 stars because Ipad is a good product, but for the same price, 20 days later I would have bought the Ipad2 or should have had a discount in the Ipad.
