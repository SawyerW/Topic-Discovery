Amazon provided the best price and prompt delivery for this new (not refurbished) Xoom. I waited until Motorola got the Micro SD card and Skype video working correctly before purchasing the Xoom.  Both features work great and the product was worth the wait! The Micro SD was a big factor for me, along with the bluetooth ability to share personal files without Itunes' prior approval. Also, not having to connect to a computer with Itunes just to get the unit to operate was a big plus! The Xoom worked right out of the box, and immediately let me know when the latest Honeycomb OS was available, OVER THE AIR, and not having to connect to another computer to get the up date. (Something Apple just recently figured out. By the way, I also own an Ipad 2, but gave it to my wife as the Xoom is much easier to customize and I'm more tech oriented.)I hope Mototrola and Google continue to support this unit.The only downside for me is the oem charging port, rather than using the micro-usb port to charge. The proprietary plug is also fragile looking.
