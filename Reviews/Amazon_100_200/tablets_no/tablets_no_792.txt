The Apple IPad Second Generation is awesome! When my dad got it, all he had to do to be able to use it was activate it on the computer. It has really cool features. It has a camera and it can play videos and movies. It can also play games, surf the web, and more! Sometimes my dad lets me use it. Most of the time, I enjoy using it. Also, it's pretty much a big IPod Touch. This product can be your all in one device!  I really like Apple products, and this product is a pretty good Apple product. You probably would like it if you're one of those people who like Apple products. You might not like it if you like Samsung tablets better. I think the Apple IPad Second Generation is a great product!
