This was an early Christmas present for my family and we all love it already.  My wife and kids are already asking when the one with the camera will come out, but it is as easy to use as the iPhone for a luddite like myself.  I thought I would find the popup keyboard annoying but it really does give you such a Star Trek sensation that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.  You know how to use it because you've seen Spock use one a hundred times himself.  I have only downloaded a couple of free apps so far (including the Kindle app as, just like the commercial, it means I can read books I downloaded on my Kindle to it) and bought a book from the iBookstore to test the reading.  I know the Kindle is supposed to be better on my eyes but I really liked the full-color display and the page-turning function as it was a real novelty.  Twenty pages in, I found it a little annoying and missed my "Next Page" button on my Kindle, but I'm sure I'll grow accustomed to it.
