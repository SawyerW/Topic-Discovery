I received this a few weeks ago, actually I received a bad one and then got one that worked well.  For my usage, I have never had to worry about battery life- I can do small tasks while I have breakfast or watch tv- like read the news, do my banking, check out my email, craig's list- videos from vimeo come in really good-- the touch screen isn't all that- maybe it's my massive fingers. What I really like about it is that I can switch out micro sd cards with movies and books or music whenever or wherever I like.
