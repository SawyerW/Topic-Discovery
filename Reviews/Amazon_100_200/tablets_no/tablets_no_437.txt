See my review on the Folio Case Cover.  I had much difficulty as it turned out the iPad took over two weeks to return.  I called you, and you set the return up for me. (I talked to Nick V.)  You promised to check back with me the following week, and you did not follow through with the call.  So, I had to start the return process all over again.  The problem was one of your Secondary sellers in Georgia, I was told.  He was the one that did not follow through.  This time I talked to a gentleman in Capetown So. Africa, and my money was returned to me on the 27th or 28th.  The iPad was my wife's main Christmas Gift, so I missed my date.  However, I do realize that the main problem was mine, so no harm, no foul.  And I promise you that after my research, I will buy from you..
