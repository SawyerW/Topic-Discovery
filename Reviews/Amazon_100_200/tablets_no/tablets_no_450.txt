I purchased a wifi nook when the price dropped to $150.  While I waited for it, I found the Archos 7 home tablet.  I returned the nook after playing with it for 15 minutes and ordered the Archos 7.  It makes an awesome ebook reader  and - unlike nook and kindle - it has a backlight so you can read in the dark.  The touchscreen is fine:  After the reviews I expected it to be terrible.  I found video playback to be a little choppy, but only watched a little of the two videos that come with it.  Web browsing with it works great as well.  Most popular web pages have mobile versions that look great on the 7 inch screen.  I'd recommend this to anyone considering an ebook reader or a netbook.
