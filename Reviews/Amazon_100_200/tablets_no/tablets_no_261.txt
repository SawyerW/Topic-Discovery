As far as tablets go the iPad is alright, works just fine. There were a few things about it that I didn't like but they really didn't matter to me (ex: camera, keyboard, etc). But the main problem I had was the limitations. For instance say someone wants to play a facebook game or something similar, cannot play it. You can play games found on the AppStore, but not your favorite online game. All in all it is a decent table, I don't recommend this for people wanting something as their main computer, this computer has too many limitations. For what it is Apple needs to lower pricing, it's not worth the price.
