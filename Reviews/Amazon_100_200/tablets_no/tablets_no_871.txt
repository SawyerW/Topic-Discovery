I got my iPad 2 a few months ago and have been using it more than I thought I would.  I haven't used any other tablets, really, so I'm not sure how it compares against others.Good:- Graphics- Battery life (about 10 hours)- Relatively light- StylishBad:- The camera- Wi-fi only or you need a model that uses a wireless plan- Touch-screen keyboard is accurate but physical ones are preferable to me.- Fragile? Mine's fine but I haven't dropped it yet.  Many cracked ones on eBay thoughI bought a 3rd party smart case and a dock with a physical keyboard and both are useful.  I have a laptop and I don't think an iPad is a good replacement for a tablet or a computer but it's good for a quick browse on the internet or to play games or music.
