I'm going to try and not gush but after using it for a while now, the xoom will pretty much replace my laptop, excluding the hardcore processing and data entry. It's just an awesome and FLEXIBLE tablet. I've of course ran into some bugs with it and have been like "why did that happen?"  But those are minor and simply things I get over. Because the overall user experience is great.  Flash works very well and it makes the Xoom all the better. The apps for will be conducted and the experience will only get better with time. But Google has given a great start already.
