I bought a used, crashed Motorola Xoom about 19 months ago that would not boot up properly. I ended up flashing the system with the latest Google / Motorola ROM and bang! The Xoom came to life with a clean copy of Icecream Sandwich. Been using it ever since mainly watch streaming content, play music and stuff the web. Here is my quick rundown:Pros:** It is affordable in comparison to the same hardware.** It has a full 12volt battery system... great battery life.** Motorola made excellent accessories for this tablet that are now cheap (HD Dock is wonderful).** Motorola is owned by Google so there is no "add-on" software... true Android experience.** Ports for everything - USB, HDMI, MicroSD... makes it flexible.Cons:** Compared to the latest Android tablets, the Xoom is heavy and a little laggy at times.** Because of the 12volt battery, it can not be charged on USB.** Screen is not as good as modern tablets, especially iPad3.So, essentially this is an old tablet but is easily good enough to do the following things:** Watch 720p movies** Read books, websites** Play games** Flash support with Dolphin Browser (something that Apple devices do not do!)
