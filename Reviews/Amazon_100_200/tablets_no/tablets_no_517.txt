I was looking for a sturdy stand for my iPad, one that I could use without taking off its protective cover.  I'm here to tell you, this is one sturdy stand!  Great for using with my apple keyboard, or to display a recipe at the perfect angle while cooking.  However, if you are looking for something portable... this is not it.  This puppy is heavy!  Not that you can't easily move it around in the home... you can.  But in my opinion it's best left at home or the office but impractical to take back and forth or to travel with.  The angle of viewing is not adjustable and that would be my only suggested improvement.
