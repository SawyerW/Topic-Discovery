When I purchased this product, I was looking for basically a wireless tablet that could fit in my pocket. I didn't want to spend all of the money for an Apple product so I did my research and found this little guy. This Archos allows me to browse the internet with ease, play music and video through my personal headphones or through it's own stereo, and take decent photographs. There is a space for a Micro SD card as well for increased storage space. It's also really easy to transfer files from the computer to the device by a USB cable. The tablet comes with the Archos Applications Market, but I wanted the Google Android Market. Fortunately, with some research on the internet, I was able to get the Google Android Market on the device by reading and doing some tutorials. This Archos is a great product in all respects. Did I mention how convenient the kickstand on the back is?
