I got one of these for my birthday!It was not working correctly and after calling the customer service we were told it may or may not work as advertised, there is nothing they can do. (we installed everything exactly the way the instructions prompted, it would not play videos and the audio books didn't work either, not to mention the nook and kindle app one supposedly can install.) We told them we had problems with other apps being unresponsive and were told not their problem.Most of the apps one can get fro free won't install, or if they do they lock up or give you a "stopped working" error.I am most bummed out that the customer service really did not seem to care. They had a snippy attitude and basically told us we were SOL. I felt like I got left out to dry.I am going to send it back tomorrow! I am out the shipping costs, not to mention what I paid for the apps in an attempt to make it work! Money down the drain! Hard earned money!If you ask me... not worth the hassle!
