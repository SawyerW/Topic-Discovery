It was great for the first month... sort of. It dropped the WiFi connection all the time, and now I can't get any signal at all. Even if it's right next to the router, it wont pick it up. I know there is nothing wrong with the WiFi because the Wii, PS3, TV, computer, laptop, and blueray player can all access the internet with no problem. It also deleated all of the books I had on the reader, and now I can't get into the account to find out if they are in a folder there. I tried to buy a book and upload it from the computer to the reader and I only got a few of the first pages. I wouldn't recomend this product to anybody, it's a POS.
