I purchased this used through amazon at significant savings. Everything works perfectly. Like the camera on the second generation iPad. Great for using the FaceTime feature. The kids like it for the photo booth option (like the old photo booth you use to see in the malls, etc). Besides the millions of apps and games available for all ages, this is great for your e-mail, web browsing, showing your photos, watching movies through amazon instant video, netflix, or iTunes. Tons of possibilities. In our family, everyone uses it, from age 5 to 83! Terrific product. Don't be afraid to check out the used ones. I have purchased several used devices, and have never had a problem.
