I purchased the Apple iPad 2 from this seller, and come to find out that it was locked, so I was unable to gain access, and use this item. After taking it to the Apple store, I found out that the serial numbers on the item, and on the box did not match, and they were VERY hesitant to touch it.. considering that it may have been stolen. The seller was contacted and refused to do anything to reimburse me for the upwards of $400 + that I have spent.I caution anyone who is considering purchasing an electronic item, to first, consider buying it new, and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER..! whatsoever..
