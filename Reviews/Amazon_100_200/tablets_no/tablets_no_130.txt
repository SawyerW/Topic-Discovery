The new iPad 2 has become an invaluable extension of my office.  It's fast, has a great screen, and is easy to use.  With apps, I can rmeotely access my work desktop; access my company's entire lan, have all my files avialble to me onthe road via dropgox, have all my important Word, PDF, Excel, and Powerpoint files with me, call others using Yahoo, email on the fly, watch movies, listen to Spotify/iTunes, create a MindMap, create a presentation, take a picture and annotate it, annotate PDFs, edit Word, Excel files, find my way on a map, keep up with my blog, keep up and trade stocks, do unit conversions, request AAA roadside assistance, scan prices making drawings, and play games.  What is not to like!  IF you don't have one or you are skeptical, you have no idea what you're missing.  And more memory is better.  Also, having 3G is great for when you decide to turn it on while travelling.  Don't wait, just buy it now!
