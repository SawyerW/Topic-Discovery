This model came out in March 2011, and me and 3 other family members have had one since June 2011.Despite the age of the model it has not become obsolescent like many other gadgets. It runs the latest IOS 7 and apps perfectly. The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).I use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.This model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.Sure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.Still, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models. The device is very well built and reliable so I wouldn't worry about getting a used one in good condition.
