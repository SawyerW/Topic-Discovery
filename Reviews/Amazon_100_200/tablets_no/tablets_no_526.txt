For the money this initially seemed like a good deal.  I was aware of the limited apps etc. and was OK with having to work with the eLocity to get it to be functional.  Then one of my speakers went out and I cannot get eLocity customer service to reply beyond automated emails.  I have been trying for over a week and they just keep saying someone will contact you.  Still waiting and getting more irritated by the day...  Due to the poor service from eLocity I just bought my daughters Samsung Galaxy Wifi tablets.  That has been the only good thing to come out of this.  The Galaxy is WAY better and is basically the same price.  The eLocity is so primitive compared to the Galaxy even my kids noticed it immediately.  Many of the free apps from Amazon will not work on the eLocity.  There is just no comparison not to mention how many great accessories there are for the Galaxy.  Just gettng a nice case for the eLocity was impossible.  I would stay away from the eLocity and highly recommend the Galaxy.  Anyone want to buy a slighlty used eLocity?
