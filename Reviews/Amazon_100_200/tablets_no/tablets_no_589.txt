I purchased the archos 43 to replace my sad, aging Nokia N800, and for this purpose, i'm very delighted to say that this is an excellent little tablet. From games to bathroom e-book reading, it's portable, very light, versatile and easy to use. My only complaint is the old timey touchscreen that, while one of the best of this last generation style screen that i've used, is a bit overly sensitive, and not quite as intuitive as a droid phone or iphone. Still, if you're looking for a small media/internet tablet, with a clear, bright screen, long battery life and is super easy to use? Consider the archos line of droid tablets. There's quite a few now, so there is bound to be one that will fit the bill for you.
