I've always wanted an e-reader that just wasn't for reading books only. I knew that there was a cruz tablet but didn't want something that big. I saw the cruz and asked the person who helped me about it and if it can go on the web, facebook just like the tablet. It does but its a wireless connection which is fine as I use that at my boyfriends house. The only thing I can't figure out is how to read my borders e-books offline. I have yet to try amazons or barnes and nobles books yet as I mostly buy at Borders. The screen is a good size but sometimes can be hard to get your choices that you want from the menu or even to type on the virtual keyboard. I do love that it is an Android OS. If anyone knows how to get the books read offline I am all ears. That was one of the reasons why I did buy it to read books offline but have the option to go on the net, etc.
