This product has such great potential but yet again Apple has been too cheap to properly test it before release. I don't know what's causing it but the ipad goes crazy every now and again where the screen "thinks" you are resizing it and trying to copy and paste even though you aren't even touching it. It gets so stuck that I have to reset it and prey the problem does not come back...which it always does. I think Apple has become too smug in their sleek products and advertising that they have forgotten about actually testing these products before release.The iphone 4 is another example of Apple's poor attention to detail. Try to get one fixed and you will find out about their PISS POOR customer service.
