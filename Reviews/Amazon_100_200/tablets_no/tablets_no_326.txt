My first entry into tablet market so I wanted something less expensive to try to see if we would use it. Well I should have bought a new gen pad cause we have used it a lot!!!. Not that this is bad. Worked perfectly out of box and still does. Just using it wayyyyy more than I thought possible. Had some issues with iTunes and apps until I went on apple support and found out how to get apps for older ios. Apple wants everyone to get their latest and greatest so to get older apps they have created a rather convoluted way to get app support for  the 5.1 ios. But now that I got it figured out, no problem. Was shipped on time and well packed. Haven't needed vendor or Amazon support so can't comment there.
