I ordered multiple stands in order to see what would work the best and, although this was the most expensive, this one is definitely the best.  We got it to use along with the apple keyboard that is also a brushed chrome so it looks nice sitting on a desk.  It is also sturdy.  With the others I tried the iPad moved when I touched the screen and this one stays completely stable.....true to it's name.  It's worth the price if you use your iPad on a regular basis.  It wouldn't be appropriate for traveling but for day to day home use I highly recommend this
