Being a computer geek and loving all things electronic, I just had to get a tablet.  After looking over several of them, I settled on the Xoom and am totally happy with it!  Having used Linux before I didn't have any problem learning how to use the Xoom.  I love all the free apps you can get for it.  The fact that you can expand the memory by another 32GB was a huge selling point.  Also the fact that Flash worked on it, something that was missing from the iPad.  The 2 cameras are great and the HD video recorder makes really clear, professional looking videos.I rooted the Xoom, and yes I know that voids the warranty, but who cares, electronics these days rarely fail within the warranty period anyway.  Now I can do anything I want with it.  It works with thumb drives and external hard drives, as well.  Plus I can install new Kernals and ROMs and edit the UI to my heart's content. :All in all, the Xoom is a very sturdy and well made product and I have no regrets buying it!
