I've had my Lenovo S10-3 for around 7 months now.  The device has held up like a champ through daily backpack abuse.  The keyboard, which was the biggest seller for me, is absolutely amazing.  The newer N455 processor with the 1GB DDR3 ram made for a no brainer at the time of my purchase.  That said, on to the terrible things:  Windows 7 Starter Edition is terrible.  It is not only slow on this device but extremely crippled in usability.  I would recommend Linux, which I myself run on this device, however Lenovo is extremely Linux unfriendly.  First off you are not able to update the BIOS without Windows 7 and a pile of Lenovo garbage installed all over your machine.  Secondly, if you turn off your wireless via the hardware switch on the side of your computer, you need to half disassemble your computer to remove the BIOS battery to be able to re-enable your wireless card again.  If you don't believe me, feel free to check out the Ubuntu bug report for "Bug #577114" -- Post 31 details the 30 step process of dis-assembly and reassembly.  Overall, Lenovo has lost me as a customer.
