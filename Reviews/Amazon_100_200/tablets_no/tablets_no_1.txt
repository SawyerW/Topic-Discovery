The Nexus 7 is a beautiful tablet - fast, light, with great screen resolution.However, it has a tragic flaw.This product suffers from "screen separation" issues. Search that term and you will see that many people have received a Nexus 7 with a defective screen which eventually will crack. The glass separates from the device, resulting in a streak running lengthwise on the tablet. Eventually, when subjected to everyday use - not severe stress by any means - the glass will give way. I received two bad Nexus 7s - the original and the exchange item. If you want to take a chance on this product, buy it from the ever-reliable Amazon, and not from Google Play Store which tried to charge me a restocking fee on a defective product. I'm still arguing with them over a refund.Asus needs to address this very serious problem on an otherwise superb product.
