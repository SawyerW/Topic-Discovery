I bought this for travel and business. The lightness and portability is cool, and it seems rather seamless until I went to use on my work websites...then oh no, they wouldnt work. Well, I went looking for apps....and guess what, there arent any for those websites. UGH! No updates, apps, or workarounds. Im stuck using it for emails and some websites, and a few apps. My mistake as I should have known they used Flash. Im just glad I didnt buy a 3G model or I really would have tossed more cash in the fire. I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now. I would have been much better off with another of the competitors that used flash.Also there is very limited expandability. This is more of a gadget and not a computer or even a netbook. At least I can get on websites and use it with a netbook.It will allow me to stay connected through emails and some do some slow surfing, but thats really the extent of it.This is a very sad disappointment for business use....
