Great reviews have been posted already showing advantages and disadvantages over a Xoom Tablet to Ipad2...Conclusion is simple. Both are great devices and you will likely be happy with whatever your choice will be.If you are a more of a Geeky Person and like to customize, change, modify your tablet the Xoom is the way to go. Yes, I know, you can jailbreak your Ipad2 and do the same thing. Yes, agree but still you will never have the options to change roms, kernels, as you do with an Android Device.If you are reading this reviews it is because you are considering buying the xoom... Just do it... You will not regret it. And for all those that tell you that iPad2 is better... Yes They will also say that the iphone is better than the Motorola Atrix or Better than the Evo 3d
