I had been very excited to receive my google nexus 7 android tablet.  Almost everything about it was great.  Android jellybean turned out to be very nice and the tablet's performance was very fast.  But, while reading epub books, I noticed a problem with screen flicker.  I didn't know anything about this flicker problem when I first made the purchase.  But, as soon as I noticed it, I found a lot of info on varoius websites from other customers who had experienced the same thing.  The flicker problem is most noticable when reading epub books.  After every page turn, there is a slight strobe-like flicker that repeats 3 or 4 times.  After that the screen seems OK until I turn to the next page and the same flicker occurs again.  Turning off the auto-brightness feature, as some had suggested, did not resolve the problem.  Maybe it doesn't sound like a major deal to you, but it soon becamse very annoying, since I bought the table mostly for reading.  I ended up returning the tablet and am now considering other options.
