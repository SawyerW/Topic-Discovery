My issue is not with the product but with how Amazon posted it. It came up as a 2013, its actually a 2012. Disappointing. I was going to send it back for the 2013 but this would be the 3rd time canceling an order and repurchasing because the first time I got it, it did not have a MicroSim port, and that was not mentioned in the item description. As if that was not frustrating enough, I talk to a representative who could not help me because she did not completely understand what I was looking for. I'm done. Don't take descriptions for face value, that's what I'm learning here. Another thing, the box says its a 2013 Nexus, even though the tablet info says it's a 2012!!
