Considering the $200 price tag, this machine is loaded with features.  This is great for people like me who like their desktop, hate laptops but still want something to use on the go.If the description is not clear you must know;  Screen is single touch  No camera  No video outputThe app store is better them some reviews let on.  This product is great for people who want to use it to consume media and have a cell phone.  You can get an app to read books on the droid and i-phone but who wants to read a book on a 3-4 inch screen.
