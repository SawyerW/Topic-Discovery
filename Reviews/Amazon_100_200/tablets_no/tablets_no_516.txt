Not only are these quite expensive, for what they are, I've had the rubber pads become unglued and slide off on both of the units I purchased.  Despite very careful use (my iPads tend to stay put on their stands), I've had 6 of 8 rubber pads (on two separate stands) slide down out of position or fall off completely, leaving sticky glue residue where the pads should be.Customer service mailed me replacement pads(along with rather exacting instructions on how to install them), and despite following directions to a 'T' the replacements soon began sliding off as well.So I've spent $150 + shipping, on stands that have a fundamental design flaw.  I certainly would've looked elsewhere if I'd known. These 5 star reviews are coming from people who haven't used the product for a meaningful length of time.
