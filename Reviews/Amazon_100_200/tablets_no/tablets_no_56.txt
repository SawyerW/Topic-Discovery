this is actually a replacement tablet, purchased to replace the refurbished model that was purchased in August and died in December.i chose to get another 2012 model because a) i have 3 cases for it and the 2013 requires a different case, and b) i don't use the tablet for photos so a front-facing camera isn't a requirement... nor is the lighter weight. it surprised me how quickly i became addicted to having the Nexus 7, and how miserable I was for the 2 months I was without. the amount ASUS wanted to charge to repair was more than buying this unit (with higher storage capacity, even).this is a good, solid device that i highly recommend if you're just getting into the world of tablets or looking for a good quality tablet for a child.
