I originally owned a 7 inch reader/tablet that I maxed out on memory and operating system (Android). After reading about the different types of 10 inch tablets out there, I decided to buy the Motorola Xoom. I was lucky to find a used one which came with a leather case and screen protector. I bought an external memory card and a stylus and have been using it every day since I received it in the mail. The screen is very crisp and clear and tapping and dragging action very good. Finding free apps online is very easy. The tablet came with Honeycomb 3.2.1 and recently upgraded itself to Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3. It plays music and games, stores pictures and movies, plays movies and can run Flash Player for You Tube videos. I've loaded both Nook and Kindle reader software, plus Google free reader. There are thousands of free books online and also free music downloads from Google. The Wi-Fi is very fast and it picks up Guest and Visitor hot spots very easily.
