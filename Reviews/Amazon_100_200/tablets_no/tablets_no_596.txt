GOOD:9 hour battery life, Small, Lightweight, Scratch Proof, Mostly Drop Proof, Spill Proof, dog proof, an excellent box to put Linux on,BAD:Screen resolution is terrible, pre installed software is terrible, pre installed ram is a joke 1 GB,What I did:Bought new ram for it up it to 2GB (the max it can support), and put Ubuntu and Fedora on itNOTE: if your a windows user, 7 will work and is installed on this thing, but its very slow...,you can boot xp on it but I would not buy it for that reason,Why I bought It, Im very rough with electronics they take a beating with me from time to time,this is a device you can throw in your bag and forget about.I use it for everything from typing email to running some small server projects,basically tasks that you cannot do with a tablet currently.
