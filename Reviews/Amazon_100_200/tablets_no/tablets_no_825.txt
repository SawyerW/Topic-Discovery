I recently purchased an iPad2.  On first install, it worked fine.  However, there was an OS update to version 5 available, so I decided to update it.  A BIG mistake.  Version 5 of the operating system has major bugs in it.  At the moment, every time I try to sync it with iTunes, it isn't recognized so it resets.  With over 40 Gigs of music, video, and data this ends up being a 2 to 3 hour process.  I'm sure it will be fixed eventually, but to have major problems with this product less than 24 hours after I've purchased it is a big problem.  Apple should have tested the new OS better before releasing it to the public.I recommend not buying this product now, but if you do, be sure not to update the operating system to version 5.  You will regret it.
