This was an unexpected gift. In truth I'm buying Fires for my own kids (love them) and intended one day to get one myself. So when I was given the ipad it was a serious shock. That said I use it at my school where things are mostly blocked. It's so vivid and I can hold it up close and see it so well. The screen is vibrant.I prefer the Fire for my kids actually and wish I had a set of these to teach with. Too bad my school in a poverty area can't wrangle that.All I can say is the thought of not having this for kids seems luddite.
