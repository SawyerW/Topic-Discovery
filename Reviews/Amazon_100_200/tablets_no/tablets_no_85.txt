Brought this tablet for my two girls (13) and (9) and they love it. They played with my IPad for weeks and wanted one. I thought it might be to much for them to handle at that age. I got them the Zeepad to see how they would handle it and they loved it more because it fit in there hands better. They use it everyday and anyone with kids know how hard it is to find something your kids will play with longer then a week. They are satisfied with it and that's good enough for me. Great buy for the money. #happydad.
