I know that I need to put a more detailed review of my iPad into this forum. I am just a little angry about how bad and good this product is. Before deciding to buy, Google iPad sync problems. There are many problems and they are real. I have had to restore my iPad at least 6 times to get it to work and right now it is a paper weight. It does not synch with my latest edition Dell laptop. No music. No apps. I will update this review at a later point and hopefully it gets better at some point in the future.Beware. Their are issues that are major with syncing with iTunes. When it does work it's great. Right now it is not working.
