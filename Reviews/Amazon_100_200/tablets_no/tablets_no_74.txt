It seems maybe this person is somehow removing reviews from their page....so I hope they sees this one.  I will personally see to it that this person won't be able to sell anything online again.  I ordered this product on the 12th, and it never showed up!  Tracking was never updated.  My wife did not receive her gift.  Times have been hard on our family this past year, and I was hoping to use this gift as my wife's surprise.  I guess the seller didn't care that their products got to the locations on time.  I'm not the only one with this issue!  Merry Christmas with my money.  This will be the last time you take anyone for their money.  I PROMISE!
