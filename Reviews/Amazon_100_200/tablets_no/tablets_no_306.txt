We ordered the netbook T91 on October 13, 2009, and it has been in their repair center since.  When we first received it, the stylus scratched the screen the first time it was used.  We shipped it to the repair center and got it back a couple of days later to find that the power switch would not work.  It would not even turn on!  We sent it back to the repair center and haven't seen it since.  They are already having to change out parts to a brand new netbook that was used once.  We paid nearly $500.00 for it, and it is already needing new parts.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Could it possibly be a lemon?  They will not send us a new one.  If we ever get it back, and something goes wrong again, we are contacting the BBB and a lawyer.  I would not recommend ever purchasing anything from them.
