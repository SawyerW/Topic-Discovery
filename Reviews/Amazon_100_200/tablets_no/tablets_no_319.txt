Horrible wifi brought 16gb non-3g and 32g with 3g and both have horrible wifi. I know that apple has a history of not working well with non apple wifi routers, but this is ridiculous. It prompts me every other hour for a wifi password. If you experience the same problem the quickest work-around is to NOT re-enter your password, but to cancel and then go to settings and switch the wifi off and then back on. I would not recommend purchasing the ipad until they put out a service pack to fix this issue. I am beginning to sound like I am taking about microsoft.Had to reduce to 1 star. The wifi is bad same thing happening to friends. Obvious software problem when ipad repeatedly prompts for wifi password when it already has the password stored in settings.
