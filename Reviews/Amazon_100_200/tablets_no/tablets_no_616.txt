I can't put my Xoom down.  Literally.  I adore this thing.  It's taken the place of my laptop in all but one way....and I can't believe this little thing is magic.  But, it is.  Even though the SD card has to be operated from a PC, I still gave 5 stars.  Don't be pulled into the I pad hype when you can have a Xoom.  I have the wifi only one and love it.  I was actually thinking of buying another one just because there is a tiny scratch I accidentally got from a minor "accident!"  Well worth it, especially at amazon price.
