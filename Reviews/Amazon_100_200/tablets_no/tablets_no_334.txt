I, for the longest time couldn't justify purchasing an I-PAD. I wanted one from the beginning but couldn't warrant spending $500-600 for a glorified I-Phone. Aaaaaaah. Finally I could buy one when I saw a refurbished 1st generation through amazon for less than $200. Yes. In a way it is a glorified I-Phone. But the experience is just that. Glorified. Especially for books, tv, and movies. It is totally worth it because on the I-phone the experience with all three of these is ok but now it is a great experience. It's like I'm reading a hard cover book as far as the page size, and the experience is awesome with the quick flick of the finger across the screen to turn the page. It just looks and feels great. Then there's tv and movies. Now it's a great experience. The picture looks great and the options through amazon prime, I-tunes, etc are great. I really love this device.
