I ordered my xoom from masterdeals and received a gray market xoom.  If you get a xoom in a red box it's not an American xoom.  If you don't mind updating the rom yourself, likely having issues with the warranty, and having some cheap power adapter be my guest.  If you don't know how to manually update the rom you're stuck without some apps from the US and can't get the same updates.  Luckily for me it was fulfilled by amazon, so with in hours of my complaint they had emailed me that they had requested a refund and gave a print out return label for UPS shipping.  Within a couple days I received another email that I my money had been refunded.  I'm happy with how quick amazon handled everything, just a bit disappointed that this is allowed to go on.  I write this as a warning to anyone else out there, make sure you know the seller isn't selling gray market xooms.  Now thanks to the trouble from that experience I'm trying to find a retail shop which still sells them.
