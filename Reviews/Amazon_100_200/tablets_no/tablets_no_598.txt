I have had my Xoom for two days now and I am absolutely thrilled with it. I'm very impressed with the design of Honeycomb. Having an OS that is designed specifically for a tablet, rather than a phone, makes for a wonderful experience. It feels more like I'm using a desktop than a phone. I can't wait for more tablet optimized apps to be released.The Chrome browser on the device is great. It offers true tabbed browsing and syncs your bookmarks with your Google account. Some sites detect it as a mobile browser, but it's pretty easy to change the user agent so that it appears to be a desktop browser.The Xoom is very fast and multitasks like a champ. Video, music, browsing, games.., it all works perfectly.I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Xoom to anyone looking for a tablet.
