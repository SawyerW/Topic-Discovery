I love my new iPad2! But I was very disappointed with the included accessories. The USB cable is frustratingly short. The iPad seems to need more power than my USB ports provide, so it won't charge that way. Therefore I have to plug it into the wall, and the ~3ft cord isn't long enough to have the iPad on my desk or in hand while it's charging. I currently have my iPad sitting on the floor in my office so it can charge. Not a very useful location!The USB outlet connector is also frustratingly designed. It has so much mass above and below the prongs that, when plugged into a power strip, it covers outlets on both sides of the one it's plugged into. It's nice that the prong set comes off (to make it interchangeable for sale in other countries or for travel, I assume), but a rotating prong would have been helpful. Other products I've bought have had that basic usability.Overall I gave this review 4 stars. I love the iPad itself, but I can't easily use it the way I want to without purchasing additional accessories, such as a longer USB cable.
