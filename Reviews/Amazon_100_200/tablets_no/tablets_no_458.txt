I don't know if it can run every modern whiz-bang Android app but this tablet has a wonderful bright LCD screen perfect for showing off pictures and browsing the net. That's about all I wanted the device for, although I do plan on doing some Android development later on. The quality of construction is first-rate and the unit is smaller than an iPad and much less expensive. It doesn't rotate but who needs that. And, you can use an external keyboard and mouse! Not bad for a sub-$170 tablet. I have 30 years experience in computers with everything from PCs to mainframes to the C64 and VIC20... I like it.
