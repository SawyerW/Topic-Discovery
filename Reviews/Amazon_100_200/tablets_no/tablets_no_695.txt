My six year old is addicted to it.  I don't know whether that's good or bad.  Most of the time she watches netflix but other times she reads childrens books and plays casual games.  I hardly use it other than while I lie down on my bed (with laptop, you can't do that facing up).  It was a gift from her grandmom.  If I had to buy a tablet for her, I wouldn't buy ipad because other android tablets do them fine with lesser price.  She hardly plays her Nintendo DS anymore.  Maybe Nintendo should make a tablet.  It's fast and has no lag, rarely has problems (one time I had to do factory restore because it wouldn't download/update apps anymore, very strange).  I hope it last 10 years.  I know apple wouldn't do it for minimalist reasons but I wished they would include usb ports, microsd slot, and HDMI.  These and being able to view Flash are the reasons why I'd opt for Toshiba Thrive if I had to buy a tablet.
