This is the best option you have if you want a tablet. Everything works great, and it has so many more features than the iPad will. It is faster and with a built-in keyboard, it makes an awesome little netbook.Basically, no one else will be releasing anything quite like this. If you're on the fence because of that, just go ahead and take the plunge. A "netvertable" has taken the backseat to pure tablets. Which is too bad, because the hybrid concept is much more practical. I can take notes on this thing, or even write a quick review for Amazon.With the right codecs, you can push out 720p/1080p on this thing. I have successfully pulled that off with CoreAVC. It is no substitute for Tegra/ION, but in this form factor, no one will be releasing an ION based device this year anyways.Great device, highly recommended. Just be smart with it, upgrade the RAM and get Home Premium. Then you'll be golden. Enjoy!
