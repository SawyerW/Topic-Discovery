For $230, I get a quad core, 32GB tablet, with a super crisp screen and gorilla glass displayPros+Quad core tegra 3 processor+Light Weight+Latest and greatest android version+Ultra durable cornering Gorilla Glass 2+High resolution display, great for games and movies+Pure android, no cluttered or cumbersome appsCons-No expandable memory port-No mobile data (mobile data version is available)-No Rear Camera-Speakers aren't the best (but what built-in speakers are?)Don't get the 8gb version, if you're going to use it for movies and lots and lots of apps, don't get the 16gb version either.  Over all this is a damn good tablet considering how cheap it is. There's only a few things about it that juuust keep it from being perfect
