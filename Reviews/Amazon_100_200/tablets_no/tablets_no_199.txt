First I bought an Iphone, and was a little worried, as it seemed too slick.  I fell in love with my Iphone and just purchased an Ipad2 and it's amazing. It's crazy thin, it does everything I need it to.  I can answer email, listen to music, watch a video, surf the net, take notes (I love that function), as well a whole lotta other things.  I have even dropped it and it didn't shatter and it was fine.  It's pretty darn sturdy.  I love the fact the learning curve is so easy, and it's customizable.Okay this is an update - I have had my Ipad 2 now for six months and I still love it!  I order pretty much all my books for the Kindle application that's on the Ipad2, the games are amazing, I just ordered Bard's Tale and it's amazing!Will I buy an Ipad3, oh you bet I will, I can't wait to see what other products Apple comes out with.
