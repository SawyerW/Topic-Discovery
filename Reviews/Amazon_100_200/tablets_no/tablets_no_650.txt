Okay so I ordered two iPad 2's, both refurbished one white one black. They came quickly, was very happy about that. As for the iPad's condition... The black one was great maybe a few scratches but factory rest complete and was very happy with this one. The white one on the other hand was covered in scratches and also no factory rest done. So when I got it there were someone's pics and other stuff. Both said they would come with a charger but neither did:( that was a big disappointment. That being said I called the company to complain about the condition oh the white iPad, they were very accommodating. They had no problem giving me back some of my money. And they did that in a timely matter. There was a credit to my credit card of 95.00 with in a few days. So over all happy with the company and yes would buy from them again:)
