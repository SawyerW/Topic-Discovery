This device does just about everything you could want it to do. True you should probably know a thing or two about software, but that goes for any device you own. A couple tricky little things though that I noticed: one being that when connecting to another network I have to disable the wireless then re-enable it in order to make the connection, the other is an array of little things you should do to make it more functional like going to archos and downloading the new firmware (which is easy to install) then installing flash 10 beta and skyfire so you can watch youtube videos.
