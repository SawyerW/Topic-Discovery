OK, so I'm EXTREMELY picky about my tech accessories - to a fault.  That's why it took me a year to write this review - because I have simply not found a better iPad stand solution.  Call me a couch potato, but now a very happy one, because I can rest this stand on my lap, next to my pillow, or anywhere else without it falling over and NO JUGGLING REQUIRED!  No more muscle cramps in my hands trying to hold up my iPad (amazing how heavy it can get after a couple of hours, isn't it?).  And it's handsome, to boot!  I haven't curled up in bed with anything this good-looking for a while (except for the hubby, of course!).  This is an amazing product, and I have put it through some serious testing.  For all you lounge-lizards out there, this thing rocks!
