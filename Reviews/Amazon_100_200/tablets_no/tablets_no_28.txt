I had the iPad 2 but it was just little too big for me. So after doing a ton of research I decided to buy the nexus 7. This devise is fast responsive and works just as well as the ipad2. The display is very good and the program choices are on par for the most part with the ap store.I use google drive to back up important files but an expansion slot would be the one item I wish this had along with a rear camera.I am still happy with the product as this is much more portable then the iPad and the functionality is the same as the iPad but heck of a lot cheaper.
