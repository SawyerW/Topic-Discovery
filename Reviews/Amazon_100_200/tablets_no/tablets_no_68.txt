I debated between this tablet, another nook tablet, a kindle or an iPad mini for about a month before I decided to jump onto the Nexus 7.  I LOVE it.  I can have all my reading apps and libraries from amazon and barnes and noble on it as well as save from the huge price jump to go to the iPad mini.  I use it constantly for school with a Zagg blue tooth keyboard and wrote an entire 8 page research paper on it last semester.  Much lighter to lug around than a laptop is so my back also thanks me.
