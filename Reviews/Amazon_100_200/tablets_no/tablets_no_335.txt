I was given the iPad as a gift.  Because I travel a lot, and had so far refused to purchase a laptop.  So far it has been wonderful.  I wish it had an answer to the no flash drive issue.  That has been the only draw back it has handed me.  I have found it quite entertaining, and the multitude of apps to choose from adds so much fun to it.  I also think it should have a USB port to download pics, but have now gotten around that by using my Eye-Fi and their free download of software to use it with the iPad.  It is well worth the money, so much to explore.  I by no means have used it to the full potential yet, but am thoroughly enjoying the trek!!
