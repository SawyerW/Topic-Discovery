This is an awesome portable device. I got this during the thanksgiving sale and its going strong even now after continuous use as a GPS for my car [with Copilot offline maps]. The screen isn't as bright and clear as an iPad but it serves the purpose. The speakers are optimal with no high performance features. The graphics is a bit laggy when you scroll fast through web pages or when you start playing Asphalt 8. But when i'm driving with GPS on or listening to music or when i'm streaming HD content through Netflix this tablet performs flawlessly. Its a bit battery hungry when you use GPS but this can be avoided by having an in-car charger for the nexus. Overall for a hundred bucks this is a very worthwhile tablet for outdoor carefree use!
