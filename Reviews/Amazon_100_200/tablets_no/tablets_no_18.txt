I purchased this device because my sister has have one for couple years and loves hers so I decided I want to get one. I have not been disappointed one bit. From all the apps I can Install to all my bluetooth devices I have connected to it. I can connect a printer to an imprint anything I want from the device. it is simply incredible. I have no complaints whatsoever in any manner with this and I would recommend this item to anyone who would like a good 7 inch tablet by their side. And are all kinds of new games out like deer hunter 2014, Iron Man 3, Real Racing 3 and a classic plants vs zombies 2. But is on one way you'll know if you like It. Try It out!!
