We bought this about a year ago as a second tablet. Despite being two year old technology the xoom is surprisingly still relevant. I have been able to do everything I hope to do with a portable media device. Watching Netflix has been a snap. Using the internet for various and sundry things like shopping or light to moderate research has been satisfactory. With the use of a Bluetooth keyboard the xoom is a capable productivity device.  Xoom has been fortunate to update to jelly bean (4.1.2), which has really shown its capacity to the fullest. A surprising nugget has been the xoom's ability to use the 5 ghz wireless band; a first I think for tablets of its era and even for many tablets today. My device was reconditioned and inexpensive. We were lucky to get it directly from Motorola. I can recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to pay the overhead of a current tablet, yet still want to enjoy the benefits of portable media.
