I wrote "Absolute Beginner's Guide to Tablet PCs". I reviewed lots of different Tablet PCs, and this is the one I use. It has the highest-resolution screen, good disk space, zippy performance, and lots of extra features.If you want the fastest Tablet PC with lots of screen real estate and portability, the M200 is the one for you. I had a Toshiba Portege 3500 before this one, and the M200 is definitely a step up.I have purchased ten Toshiba Tablet PCs for my company, and none of them have broken. The M200 is a more stable machine than the Portege 3500,though.Great job, Toshiba!
