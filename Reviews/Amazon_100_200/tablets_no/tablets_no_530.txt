I tried holding out for the longest when I ordered this product. To many stories of vaporware, change in design, screen resolution size, and version of android. But Amazon started selling the Galaxy Tab and I ended up buying that and have a tablet that's gonna have better support. Really I think right now Tegra 2 processors are ahead of their time for Android and would probably better if they did wait till ginhetbread came out.  But it sucks to have an order in and see it keep getting pushed back when more known brand names products are about to hit. I hope the Elocity don't get lost in the Android rush that will  be hitting next year. Had a lot of potential. Marketing, however, sucks.
