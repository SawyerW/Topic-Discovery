When I found this tablet, for the price i found it ...i was shocked and happy.Then it came in the mail., and boy was I shocked and not so happy.Its small, apps are little and far between - cant play youtube - can access anything really.and because it has Android so doesnt mean you can download from the Android Market - that in itself is mainly the point to getting a tablets -So i sent this thingamabob back and opted to spend the extra layers of cash and get me one of those darn Ipads - which is hard for me to do seeing i think they have enough of the worlds money.peace out...
