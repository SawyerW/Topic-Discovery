At first, I thought the idea of having an iPad was silly, until my friend was telling me of the benefits of having one. I debated and after some time I got the iPad 2. Now I love it. I take it with me everywhere I go. To school, work, etc.. I use it to write, watch movies, check email, music, and the occasional games. The main thing I use it for is to read e-books. I like that I can have a Kindle app, a Kobo app, and a Nook app all in one place without having to have several different e-readers. I like to get certain books on certain apps, especially if the price for a book is more affordable than another. Having an iPad just makes things a little more convenient. I love it.
