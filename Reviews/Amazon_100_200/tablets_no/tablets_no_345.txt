Because it is first generation apple no longer supports. It will not link to Mac nor will download apps from iTunes. It cannot support ions 5.0 that is required to download apps. It's only usage is to connect to the Internet which any device will do. The first generatio iPads should therefore only be sold with these restriction clearly stated.  Since the iPad does not come with a manual or any instructions it is impossible to know these constraints until after purchase and trial and error.After reviewing the used ads on the amazon site, none of the description indicate the operating system. So again if I wanted to upgrade I would have no way of knowing whether the operating system was ions 5.0 and of any use for downloading apps.
