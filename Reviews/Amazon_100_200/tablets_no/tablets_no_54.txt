My wife wanted to get a tablet for her sister for Xmas and I was given the tapsk of finding one.  To get a 10 inch one name brand you will spend $299-399++ so we quickly decided on the 7 inch variety.  Having owned inexpensive 7 inch tablets, I knew we needed a name brand even though I search through all the knock-offs on amazon.  For the money ($160-185) it is hard to beat the Nexus as compared to Asus, Samsung, Dell, Apple, & Toshiba. Plus the Nexus was highly reviewed & highly recommended by techie friends of mine.  The nexus is easy to use and my sister-in-law loves it.
