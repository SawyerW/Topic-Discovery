If used as directed, this emits a very loud distinct squealing alarm that will definitely alert or awaken you if the door is opened upon it.  However, I very much doubt the plastic that it's made of would keep a determined intruder from being able to force the door open.  I think I'd ultimately prefer the latter, but I think you could make this device of materials that would create both an alarm and an insurmountable obstacle at the same time.  The only reason I haven't returned it is because the time it would take me isn't worth the cost of the device.
