Bought this product for the office. Works really well, has plenty of "BING". Transmits 50+ feet through one wall. Only problem I had was with the sticky backing of the transmiter. After 4 months it fell off (only reason it got 4 stars). No big deal, used a 3M command strip and it's working fine. Set up is easy and actually had to put it at a 90 deg angle to each other (transmiter set up) and still works fine. Now nobody sneeks up on us. If you're looking for a simple, easy product that works well for the price you can't beat it.
