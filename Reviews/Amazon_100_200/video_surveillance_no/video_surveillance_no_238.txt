I am going through the Midland inventory trying to find an affordable communications setup for my race car team. I purchased these to replace the useless motorcycle helmet version. Initial testing showed these to work great. The ear piece is very good. The real problem is the microphone. When set to VOX all you hear is the race car at speed. It works great when set to Push to Talk. Only problem is that the button to push is also the microphone. The driver has to hold it up to their mouth, which is encased in a racing helmet. I am told there is an external push to talk button I can install between the unit and the radio. Once I find this it should fix my issues.Bill StrongRacing Strong Motorsports
