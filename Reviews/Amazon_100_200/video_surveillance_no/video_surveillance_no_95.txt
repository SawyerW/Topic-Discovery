As the other reviewers stated, this is a great security device for travel.  It is small, loud, and in most cases will keep the door from being opened.  I found that it did not work on smooth hardwood/laminate floors, as the rubber pad on the bottom did not create enough friction.  This was easily remedied by putting duct tape on the bottom (looks ugly but works).  I also use this device all the time to keep the front door open when I need to bring in a lot of groceries or other items into the house and don't have a free hand to keep opening and closing the door.
