I have now purchased a total of 4 Primos Truth Cam 35 Cameras, Security Boxes,  3 12' Python lock and cables, and one 6' Python lock and cable.  GREAT for seeing what goes on around the house when we are away, and asleep.  The videos have been very GOOD for seeing what animals have come thru day or night.  But for perfect pictures that were not grainy, we had to set the cameras to photo-Multi Shot with the quick retakes.  GREAT for catching the 2 legged game and their car with GREAT photos of their License Plate while it was moving.  GREAT for the LAW enforcement to be able to enlarge the photos and catch the prey!!!!!!!!!!!! We even had photos of them trying to use a crow bar on one camera in the box and on the Python!!!!!!!!
