Nice product, but the documentation could be a little better for a Mac.  Once I found that the default IP address was 192.168.0.253 I was able to get into the unit and configure all the options I wanted.  So you can basically toss the diskette they send since is PC only.  In general the documentation is useless but who reads that stuff mostly anyway.  Got it configured to do wireless communications with my Apple Airport nicely.  Haven't set up a DDNS yet, but that will be next.  The triggers are a little odd, not sure I understand them but I'm sure I'll figure them out.  The main thing is it works with Safari over the Internet.  I'm a happy camper.
