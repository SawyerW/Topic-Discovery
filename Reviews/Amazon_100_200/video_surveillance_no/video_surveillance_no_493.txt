I had an identical camera that died after about 8 months.  It took good pictures day and night and I was satisfied enough to purchase a second one when the first started doing funny things to the SD memory card.  The second works well enough, but the pictures are not near as clear as the first Primos 35, nor are the night shots as bright.  If/when this one fails, I will likely look at another brand.Amendment to the original as written.  I now find that the camera takes fairly good photos and the batteries last longer than the first (same) unit I purchased.  I probably would buy another one if needed.
