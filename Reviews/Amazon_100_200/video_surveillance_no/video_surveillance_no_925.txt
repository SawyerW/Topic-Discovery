I purchased this and was excited to see what it can do... and apparently it's nothing at all. The camera displays the white light on the bottom which means it's upgrading the firmware. How long can this last? Well after a day I called Logitech support. They had me run through trying to reset the camera to no avail. Logitech support had me copy and paste my invoice email from Amazon. 4 days later they said that wasn't enough and I had to send in more proof that I purchased the unit. I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement which they did. The second camera does nothing at all. No lights... nothing. I even went through the same resetting process. This one is also going back and I'm going to look for another system.
