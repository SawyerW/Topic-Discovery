I have two of these cameras used on our property to watch who may come in when we're gone.  They have been VERY UNRELIABLE!  The sensitivity is hit or miss.  I''ve tried all the settings and sometimes it will trigger and sometimes it won't.  Both cams do this.  The worst part is the SD cards will be automatically reformatted when the batteries die.  This means ALL your stored photos on the disc to that point are erased.  The battery life is horrible... they each take 4 D cells.  When you swap out the batteries you must reprogram the date and time settings.  It's a hassle to work with these.  One stopped working early on and the company did eventually replace it at no charge to me.  I think they're used to this as these are pure imported junk.  Counting the replacement, I've had three and they all were the same... so I doubt I "lucked out" and got 3 lemons.  I can't believe they've sold these things for as long as they have.
