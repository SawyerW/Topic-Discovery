I am not a hunter but wanted to track down those pesky animals around the house.  I have attached it to a fence, a tree and my deck.  I've taken pictures and movies.  It works great.  Battery life seems pretty good with the 4 D batteries - I've had it on over 9 full days and it still shows over 50%.  Quality of the images are ok.  Not fantastic but it's not designed to be a high quality camera.  Sensitivity works fine.  With it set to normal most animal activity sets the camera working.  Sometimes high winds can activate the camera.  Overall I'm very happy with the device as it does exactly what I need it to do and it meets my expectations.
