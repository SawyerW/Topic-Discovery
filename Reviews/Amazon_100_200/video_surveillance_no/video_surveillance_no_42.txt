Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit. This item was shipped sooner than promised and I am very happy in its performance. It is mounted on a 5 foot post and because it is very sensitive I enclosed it into a homemade wren hose.This did create a livable problem for us. Every time a bird tries to enter the birdhouse it creates an alarm in the house. Sooner or later the birds wiil be conditioned that they cannot enter. A small price to pay. The equipment is every word that was written about in the writeup. This was purchased through Amazon like many other items I purchased through Amazon in the past.
