The door alarm is pretty loud, but the screws to mount the sensors, which are mentioned in the instructions, aren't included. (double-sided tape is included.)Also, it would have been nice if there was a way to set the chime/alarm mode from the keypad (with the code) instead of having to open it (with a screwdriver).A 10-second warning beep before the alarm goes off would be nice too.The window alarms aren't very loud, and also, they turn off as soon as the window is closed.I put one on a sliding-glass door, and then discovered that... so, a burglar could open the door, come inside, and close the door, and the (not very loud) alarm would only go off for a few seconds.They really aren't loud enough to be heard by a neighbor, even in attached condos.I haven't checked to see how loud the door alarm is with the doors closed yet, but it is louder than the window alarms.Can't really complain for the price, but still, I was hoping it would have been a little better.
