I bought this camera to replace one that I broke. It is so much better than the old one. Easy setup. I put four D copper top batteries in it 14 days ago and it still shows 98% battery. It took 19 pictures, 2 of them at night during that time. I expected to see shorter battery life due to the freezing temps. Doesn't seem to have happened. I placed it into a container with cutouts for the flash, camera and sensor with very good results. The 40' range for the IR flash seems right. I can bring out things beyond that using the contrast settings on my computer software. The trigger time is good too. My old one took many seconds to trigger and often game had time to get out of the picture.
