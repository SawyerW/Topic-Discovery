First the negative.  You must have the talk piece close to your mouth (some more expensive sets you can place away) or you will not hear much of anything.  That is it for the negatives.  They fit great in the ear, push to talk/voice activated option works great.  They have clips to clip the talk and push to talk piece on your clothing/gear. There is plenty of slack in the lines for placing the set where you want to on your gear/body. I have used them while being quite active in the woods and they hold in place and do what they are supposed to do.  I have mine hooked up to the Midland GXT950VP4 and they are a good accessory to have.
