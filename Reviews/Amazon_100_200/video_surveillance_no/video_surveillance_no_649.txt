The simplicity of setup and use for the Lorex video baby monitor made it a five-star pick for me. How simple was it to set up and use? Read on:Setup was ridiculously easy, which earned it the first star in this review.Figuring out how to operate it, also took just minutes, and earned it another star.Sound quality was clear (the volume can be raised/ lowered, one more star.Display was VERY bright in the night-vision mode, star number four.You can also take snapshots with it (from the display), also very easy to do, and you can also add up to 4 additional cameras, star number five.Overall, a simple, fun, and well-made product.Note: The quick-start setup guide and user's guide that come with the monitor are written in clear, simple language.
