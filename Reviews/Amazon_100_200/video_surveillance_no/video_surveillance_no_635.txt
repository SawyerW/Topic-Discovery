I would love to give this product a five. I can't because it has lost signal to many times to make it feel reliable. I suppose it depends on what your house walls are made of. When its working it is very nice. You can monitor up to four cameras at once but it only comes with one. Comes with camera, monitor , charge base, memory card with adapter, (for anyone that has had to go buy one of these before this is a nice feature), and a battery. Takes pictures night or day. The best feature about this camera is in goes into night mode and returns without you having to switch any buttons. It works even on the base so you can use it 24 hours a day if you want. The sound it picks up is very clear and adjustable. You can press a button and talk to who ever is in the room your monitoring I even used this outside for a few weeks in a protected from the elements area. I really like it. The menu is simple to use including brightness, pairing, power save, vox(voice activated alert), memory.
