Works great. Had some issues connecting to a Macintosh but with the assistance from their technical support it was nailed down very quickly and I can now access from outside my home network. All features can be configured via. the Mac from the administration interface the only things you can't access w/out Boot Camp and/or Parallels is the zoom/audio features. If you have a newer Mac that can run Windows then your golden.For configuration, I followed the steps provided in an earlier post and confirmed that they would work with the BL-C131A by emailing Panasonic. Panasonic's tech. support was great and very responsive to my needs.With the motion detection feature I was able to obtain photos of a visiting black bear in our yard while also triggering email when FedEx/UPS delivers packages.
