Beware, you can not shut these cameras off.  They run 24/7 or not all.  Unlike the previous software (Wilife) you can not scheudle "on" times so the cameras are active all of the time.  I bought these as an upgrade to the previous system assuming they could be used in a similar fashion, to monitor our facility just at night, they can not.  So, you will be dealing with hundreds of files.  I contacted support, their advice, unplug cameras during the day!  Really.  I would avoid these until they upgrade software to at least what it was previously, not sure if they plan to do that however.
