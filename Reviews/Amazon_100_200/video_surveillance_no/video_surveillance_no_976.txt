This system worked fine right out of the box as expected. Again Logitech support was no help. I knew how to debug for the bad device more then them. The return policy was a 6 week process of email after email so I gave up and went to Amazon where they had UPS pickup the bad 700E and returned a new one. Amazon was awesome to work with. DO NOT BUY DIRECTLY FROM LOGITECH. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IT TAKES 6 WEEKS OF PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS TO GET YOUR UNIT REPLACED. AMAZON DID IT IN LESS THAN A WEEK. THANKS AMAZON !
