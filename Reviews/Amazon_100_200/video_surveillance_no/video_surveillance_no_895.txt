The hype on the logitech cameras was extremely high when I researched the product and the company.  I just purchased a camera that was refurbished.  I should have chosen the new, but the reviews listed showed serious promise.  When I received the product it was in a box that was ripped open and torn.  There was scotch tape putting the box back together.  I was still optimistic about my purchase until I noticed the installation cd was missing.  I went on the website and downloaded the installation so I could use the cameras.  Once the camera was plugged in connected the led lights would not turn on.  I called the troubleshoot department at logitech where I found out this meant the camera was defective.  He suggested resetting the camera and trying it.  I reset the camera and the led lights still did not activate.  I was told the camera doesn't work and needs to be returned.  I am hoping now to get my money back for the broken camera system.
