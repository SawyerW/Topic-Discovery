I own and operate a retail sporting goods store.  I recently put 6 of these cameras into stock.  I sold all six of these cameras to my son and nephew for of course my cost.  When batteries were put into one it immediately started smoking.  We put up the remaining 5 last satureday.  We checked them and all 5 were taking pictures.  After putting out some deer attractant we left the area.  We returned today anxiously looking forward to seeing the pictures.  We have some very large deer on our property and were anxious to how much they had grown since last year.  Imagine our supprise and disappointment when none of the cameras had a picture.  All deer attractant was gone.  We know we have abundant wilflife on our property.  I can't wait to see what Primo has to say Monday morning.  I have more of these cameras ordered, they will be returned to my suppliers soon.  Do not buy this camera.
