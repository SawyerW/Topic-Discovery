Bought four (4) of them. The heads are weak... possibly defective. When I attempt to tighten the heads, the heads often refuse to stay put. Weak, weak, weak product. Very dissatisfied with the heads, in particular, not the entire mount. These are supposed to support up to a 10 pound camera. Mine weigh less than three (3) pounds and the Videosecu heads seem very untrustworthy... even with only that little weight. The fact that the mount is metal is good. The fact that the mount features modular pieces that are all connected with standard 1/4" threads is also good. But I had to buy stronger Manfrotto heads to replace the heads that came with my Videosecu mounts.
