This small unit does put out a lot of light and does a good job of mimicking a color tv.Dark window treatments cover this but would do the same with a regular tv.Placement around light color shades or blinds works well but make sure you cant see the unit from outside.I plan to place this near the tv and aim towards windows  that have blinds and opaque window film on them so it looks like the tv is on in living room.Using prime we received it in two days .Update--After several trips friends that keep an eye on house agree that there appears to be a tv on.I use a timer to run during what would be my normal viewing times.
