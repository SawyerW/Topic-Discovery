I installed the HDD, initialized it under Win 7/64bit and ran Western Digital's Data LifeGuard (from their website as a free download).  Drive passed SMART test and short test.  I then ran the extended test twice.  Both times, the test aborted due to an excessive number of bad sectors.  I returned drive and asked amazon to send a replacement.The replacement drive was sent with NO protective packaging and their shipping method did NOT meet Western Digital's requirements for shipping hard drives. I posted picture of how drive was shipped.  The drive is on its way back.  A third drive has been ordered.I'll update review when I receive and test third drive.EDIT 27Nov2012:  The third drive passed all WD LifeGuard tests, was installed into the new desktop, and has been operating perfectly.  This third drive has a "5 star rating".
