We love this monitor.  Unpack, plug in, turn on and you are all set.  The cameras link up instantly (we bought an extra).  The night vision is excellent.  The day view is crisp.  We love that there are not a lot of eye candy features like night lights or songs.  We really don't expect to use the camera and would have preferred a zoom feature rather than that capability.  However, the microSD card adapter that came with the unit is useful for our cell phone cards.  The micro usb chargers will also charge other items we have in the house.  The range is excellent.  We have a clear signal on all 3 floors of our home.  There are no annoying status lights on the parent unit and you can dim the monitor or turn it off in favor of sound only. We highly recommend this product.
