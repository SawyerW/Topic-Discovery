OK yes this is suppose to be used to monitor the woods for hunters, but I mount it on my camera tripod and use it to monitor my apartment when I'm not at home.  I use to put a piece of paper in the door jam, and after finding the piece of paper gone when I had come home from work...I knew someone had been in my apartment but I didn't know who.  Now it will be recorded.  I also purchased and 8 GB SD card and a padlock.  I tried using my web-cam set on motion detection (web-cam doesn't work after computer goes to sleep or after dark).  I work 2:00 pm until 10:30 pm and this Primos Truth Camera takes pictures after dark and I don't have to waste money keeping the lights on in my apartment while I'm at work.  I love it!
