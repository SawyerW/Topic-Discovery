This is my first such camera and I am very happy with it.  I wanted to know what kind of critters are visiting the front of my home next to the windows.  No mice, just squirrels, birds and a neighbor's cat.  Day pictures are sharp and in color.  Nighttime pics more grainy, black and white, but they give me enough info.  The cat seems to stare at the camera for the three picture sequence I use, so the lights must be noticeable.There are lots of options that are easily set with sliding switches.  Select Photo/Video, number of shots in sequence, length of video, duration between shots, sensitivity of motion detector. I plan to move it a bit as it seems to sense my motion walking to my car(about 20 feet away from the camera). The SD cards have so much room that I am going to give the video a try.This is a good value.
