This camera is excellent. I can log onto it from my iPhone and see what's going on at the house while I'm away. It has a long electrical cord, which makes it easy to place wherever it is needed. To move it, just unplug it and plug it into the new location.The software can also be set to automatically upload pictures to a web site at a periodic interval.The only downside about this camera is that it takes a bit of figuring out. The manual is not very useful, particularly with regards to the software, but once you get it set up there's no maintenance to be done.
