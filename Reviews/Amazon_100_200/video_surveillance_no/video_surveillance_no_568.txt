I haven't had any other baby monitors. So I'm not sure how this could compare to others, but I found it easy to figure out and use, and pretty handy. The screen is a little small on the viewing device, and I wish the camera came with more mounting options (maybe a clamp to attach it to the side of a crib or playpen, or on a mobile up above the baby somewhere). I found it hard to find perfect places to put it. But it worked. Battery life seems okay. I appreciate the infrared mode where it can illuminate the kid on video without actually shining a visible light out.Anyway, it's handy. It's now a couple years old and not still being sold on Amazon (at the moment), so better options likely exist.
