We have three of these on each level of our home and turned them on when we went out of town.  We had our mom pick up any UPS packages left on our porch to make sure no one knew we were out of town.  We didn't tell her about the Fake TV's and wanted to see if she said anything.  Matter of fact, she said she stopped by our house with a friend at 9:00pm and said she stared at the house and couldn't understand why someone was inside our home watching TV.  She said she thought maybe we came home early but that didn't make sense since she just talked to us.  She said she stared at the house and waited for someone to walk by. It really gives off a motion and energy that someone is inside the home.This even tricks the person who is watching your home while you are out of town.  Brilliant. :)
