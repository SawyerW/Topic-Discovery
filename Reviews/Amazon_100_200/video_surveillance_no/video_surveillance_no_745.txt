I spent over an hour trying to sync this stupid thing to the base, and it was a whopping 25 feet away! No steel walls, no major interference issues that they didn't identify before I bought it. All I know is, I could get it to work if it was sitting NEXT to the base, but mounting it 25 feet away, outside, was impossible. Junk...Now, onto the mounting. That wonderful mounting bracket they provide with this thing is GARBAGE! I tightened the cheap wingnut down as hard as I could, and STILL the thing wouldn't hold it. Finally, I tightened it so hard the wingnut (made out of cheap junk, like most everything else on this thing is) got locked inside the threading-wouldn't tighten, wouldn't loosen. All in all, if this thing would have cost 25 bucks it would have been of dubious value. For 200 it's silly!
