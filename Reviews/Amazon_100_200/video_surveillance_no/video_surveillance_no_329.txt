I just need something that was BASIC, to do the job I needed and this worked for me. Considering the price I didn't expect much, but it was better than I expected. I am using it to mount a small security box camera in a house window and I just needed to set it up once, forget it and it was easy due to the various parts included in this kit. If you need something that you will be changing often, then I think you better forget this and spend more bucks and get something better. Bottom line is I'm happy with this kit!
