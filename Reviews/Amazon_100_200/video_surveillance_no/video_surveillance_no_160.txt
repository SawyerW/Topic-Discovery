I bought this because my six year old son is an escape artist. It was getting to the point where I could not leave him alone, he would wander out the front or side door. This alarm is really simple to set up. I am a single mother and did not want to deal with some crazy system that I would have to drill into walls or wire up. It took less than half an hour and you can not beat the price! It's really simple to use. I chose the door that leads outside (i have three) that was farthest away from the living and bedroom to put the real door alarm on(the others are actually window alarms but work on doors great). the window alarms will shut off once the door (or window)is shut again but the door alarm will not, you have to put the code in to shut it down. the alarm is loud and will get your attention for sure! Great buy it works perfect for what i needed.
