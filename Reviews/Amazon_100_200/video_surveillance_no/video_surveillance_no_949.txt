I already have the indoor camera master system to watch over my house while I'm away and bought this outdoor camera so at night I can just reach over and grab my iphone/ipad to see what's going on when there is a noise outside. There's been a few incidents of people lurking around our neighborhood late at night.You should know that these cameras have a built-in infrared LED that is visible at night. At first I did not like that idea but now I think this would be a good deterrent. Just make sure you mount it where the bad guys can't steal or vandalize it as it has a built-in recorder using a micro SD card. It will automatically download the recording when you turn your computer on.
