Before going hunting this year we upgraded from the original headsets that came with the Midland radios and these headsets worked great. These headsets were way more comfortable to wear in your ear all day and when needing to whisper to a hunting partner it worked perfect. When using them in windy conditions all you had to do was turn your back to the wind or cup your hand around the microphone, I never tried the VOX mode so I can't tell you if that works or not i am going to buy two more so everyone can have one next hunting season.
