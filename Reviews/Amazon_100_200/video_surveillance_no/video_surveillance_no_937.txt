I ordered 2 of these from Amazon, both were broken. Power adapters wouldn't light up when plugged in. The 2nd one I received from Amazon had been opened and was even missing a few things, so I guess someone else had already sent it back to them, and they just decided to send it over to me anyway.Then I ordered one directly from Logitech, this one had to work right? Wrong. This one had a problem with the camera. A white light on the bottom wouldn't change color. According to their horrible tech support they needed to replace it. Of course they wouldn't do overnight shipping. But they would do 2 day shipping, just as soon as I sent back the old one.I've wasted too much of my time on this poorly made product. I'll just send my last one back for a refund.
