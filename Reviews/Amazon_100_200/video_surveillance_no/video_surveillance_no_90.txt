I bought this door stop alarm to provide an element of security on a recent trip through Eastern Europe, where we were renting privately owned apartments in almost all the cities we visited. Not having the notional security of established hotels, this seemed like a good way to scare off any "casual" intruders. What I didn't count on was that the exterior doors on nearly half of the places we stayed opened to the outside, making the doorstop irrelevant. Fortunately, my concern about security turned out to be a non-issue.The doorstop itself works great though. Really easy to set to "on" and place at the door. The alarm is really loud and piercing, so I have no doubt that all but the most determined intruders would be scared off immediately upon setting it off.One thing I recommend: if you pack this in checked luggage, disconnect the battery first. I can only imagine the excitement that would be caused if jostling of your bag were to set it off!
