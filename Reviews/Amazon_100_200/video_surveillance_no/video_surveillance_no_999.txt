We put our home up for sale and moved 70 miles away so our home was vacant. People were stealing our real estate signs from the front yard and our neighbor was throwing dog poop on the front steps entering our home after a falling out we had(long story). Anyway i purchased 2 of these cameras and had both put in the house one aimed at the front door and one at the back. The signs didnt get thieved anymore and we had no more dog poop on our front porch so the camera did it's job. I had the cameras up for almost 4 months and never changed the batteries. Finally sold the home thank god.
