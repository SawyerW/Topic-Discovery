As I wrote in my review of the master system, I really like these cameras.  Very clear picture, daylight better than night, but come on, what do you expect?  Frankly, very gratified that I can see the exterior of my home at night as clearly as this camera allows.  And, though I haven't had a wide experience of other cameras, these certainly blow away the Vue, Foscam, and Dropcams that I have tried (no offense to those companies whose products I also admire!) as to picture quality.  I, too, had a problem with the SD card of this add-on, receiving an error message, which neither resetting from the app, or the camera resolved, but was resolved by removing the card and putting it back in.
