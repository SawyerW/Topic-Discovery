For this price, who can complain.  It's simple to use and quite effective.  Worked great on both my wood floors and laminate wood floors with no problem - both as a door stopper and as an alarm.  The alarm is piercing, which hopefully combined with the resistance from the door stop feature is enough to deter a break-in.  Just don't expect your neighbor in the next house to come running it's not loud enough to draw much attention 100 feet away.  Still, this is one of the best products I've ever bought and I would recommend it to anyone who cannot afford a professional or more sophisticated system.
