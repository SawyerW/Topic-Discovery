I agree w/ what someone said earlier.  They look somewhat fake on close inspection.  Made of very cheap plastic.  But if you're a thief, I don't think you're going to go all touchy feely on the cameras.  I also took the advice of one of the other reviews, and labelled my cameras 1, 4, 7 and 9. hehehe.... the light isn't a steady blink, it -seems- to be motion activated, but I'm not sure.  It sometimes just seems to have a mind of its own.Here is my biggest complaint: the stickersThe blasted stickers, which have at the bottom a link to videosecu.com, where you can go and find this camera, CLEARLY LABELLED as a dummy camera!  I mean, really??!  Why would you put up a security sticker w/ a website you can go to and see that your camera IS A FAKE?!?  Luckily for me, I obtained some REAL security stickers from a local security business and used them instead.If you're looking for simulated security, these cameras will do the job.  But you can find better.
