I purchased this headset for use with the Midland radio.  I perfer this product over the standard headset that came with the radio. These tuck in nice and tight in the ear and tranmissions are clear and crisp.  The only drawback is the cord is a little short if you intend to run the microphone up your sleeve, opposite of your radio. Sounds crazy but I carry the radio on the left hip and the mic on the right side, so its short.  I'm sure if they are both on the same side of the body, they will fit fine.  I like the headset!
