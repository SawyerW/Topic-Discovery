I travel a lot and worry about securing my empty house. I heard about this and decided to give it a try. First, it's smaller than I thought--about the size of one or two bars of soap. Second, it's bright! I debated between getting this one and the more expensive one that is brighter and am glad now that I chose the cheaper one. I positioned it to face blinds and, even when they are completely closed, the Fake TV looks like a Real TV from outside. This is true even though I have a street light right outside my house. Could a criminal study the light long and hard and conclude that it's not a real TV? Maybe. But most break-ins are crimes of opportunity when a burglar sees easy pickings in an empty house. If a television MIGHT be playing in a dark room with one or more people in there watching that TV, I'm hoping the criminal will decide to move on down the line. I will update if it doesn't work over the long haul but everything worked out of the box exactly as it was advertised to do.
