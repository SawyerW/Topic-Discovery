This is a really good camera I have had it for about 3 months. It shows well in the day and night. during installation I sealed the point of entry for the wire with some clear silicone and alittle around the edges of the glass, wiping of the smudge. this makes it perfectly sealed even during torrential downpours.For those people reporting the camera flickering on and of during use, be sure to tape the rca joinings with a good quality tape probably 3m. and harness the wire well so it does not get damaged because it is not so good in quality.
