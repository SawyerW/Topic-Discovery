I should have paid heed to another warning that this product is NOT a doorbell, and now I am stuck with a entry alert that is worthless to me. I read the comment but for some reason I believed another commenter who claimed it WAS a doorbell; he must have made the same mistake I did: After looking at about a dozen products and having several in my cart at one point, it was hard to keep track of what was a doorbell vs. an entry chime. It is probably a great product if you actually are shopping for a entry-alert sensor (good for those backdoors where you have a pool).  I liked the wireless feature and the fact that you can move the chime around by just plugging into another wall outlet.  I thought about using it anyway, but my husband doesn't want to screw the sensor and transmitter into the door and doorjam.  We will probably donate it to goodwill.
