Nice, sturdy built; simple to use and install.At first this product seemed too simplistic and I wondered what good would an LED flashlight be as a burglar deterrent. But then I sat outside my vacant building and watched it work - I felt satisfied and my buyer's remorse (from spending $30.00 on and led flashlight) disappeared. The effect of a working TV was spot on. However, bear in mind that burglars are not morons (for the most part) and you would need some source of noise too (radio perhaps) to complete the illusion of a TV working. Hence the 4 star rating - this product needs to be coupled with some timed source of noise... then it would be PERFECT.Still I would recommend it as a BUY.
