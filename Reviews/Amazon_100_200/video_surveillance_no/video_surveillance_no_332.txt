I am really interested in seeing how anyone who rated this positively used it.  I purchased two, and will be able to use both of them only after some "adjustments."  The adjustable head piece is beyond useless.  Both of the ones I purchased have a slightly smaller thread size on the adjustable stem then a normal tripod mount.  Its funny, because the adjustment ring (to tighten up the camera when mounting)  DOES fit a standard tripod thread.  It doesn't fit the mount though.  I wound up using the straight pieces only and created an angle so I could hang the camera where I wanted it.They are dirt cheap, in cost and in quality, and you will wind up paying more than you would have for a decent bracket by the time you are done.  Buyer beware!As I said at the beginning of this review, I have to chuckle at all of the positive reviews and wonder if they are fake reviews by the company or by Amazon.  I am not a camera guru by any means, but I have yet to see a camera that the thread on the adjustable piece will fit!!  Good luck.
