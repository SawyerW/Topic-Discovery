This camera has terrible remote viewing.  Anybody that has security cameras is going to view them remotely, so they really need to design the networking of this camera better.  First problem is the port that they route the video through is blocked by most work places.  Second is if you try to view it on your phone, there is no audio AND it keeps on disconnecting every 30 seconds, only to may let you in again.  Basically everytime I want to see if my nanny is doing the next step right, it keeps on dying.  Customer service says there's nothing they can do about these issues and is allowing me to return with full-refund.And I pay so much money for a security camera without night-vision? DO NOT BUY.
