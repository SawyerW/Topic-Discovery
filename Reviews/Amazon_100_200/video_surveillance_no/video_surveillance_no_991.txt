This Swan leak alarm was a great purchase! Easy to set up, has 2 different sound levels for the alarm! Also has a battery check button to let you know the battery is working without having to wet the probes! Comes with square double stick sided foam to place on the back of the receiver, then you stick it on the wall! Holds very firmly! Has a 6 inch cord for the probes, stick it on the wall and tape down the cord so the probes barely sit above the floor so when the water does back up this alarm will let you know before you end up with a full blown flood! Excellent product! Received quickly, another great buy with Amazon!
