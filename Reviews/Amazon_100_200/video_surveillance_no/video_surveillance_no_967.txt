I installed this in my garage area of a town house development and it is excellent. Way more feature than standard security setups. You can see it on Android or Iphone at any time. It records to view back on the computer. Note that it doesn't work for Mac. You can borrow a PC to set it up and see it through the website but you wouldn't see playbacks without removing the SD card.Note that you don't need a computer to use it with the online feature since it hook right up to the router. I researched all over for this info and didn't find it. I have a laptop that is not on all day so this was important.
