The camera is fine for daylight but frankly not worth a hoot at night --- range is fair --Camera lasted 3 months --- returned couldn't figure out the problem kept saying chip full (empty chip) --- took a bit of correspondence -- we returned it and in about 3 weeks total had a new one -- we will see how long it last --I wouldn't recommend if you have it in a remote area -- ours is used relative close to monitor our local black bear and dear population --You get what you pay for and for this price level acceptable performance that's about it  --
