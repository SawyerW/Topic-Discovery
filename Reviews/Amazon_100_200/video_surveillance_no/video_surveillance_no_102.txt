I noticed my unit did not include the extension arm shown in some of the product photos, as others have mentioned.  I called Panavise customer support, asking if the extension arm was available.  They shipped me the extension arm free of charge.  It took ~2 days to receive the extension from them in the mail.Call customer service to get an extension arm if you need it.  They are quite friendly and will get you taken care of.I am using the mount to hold a camcorder to the windshield.  I can be a little difficult to try and contort the device to fit as pictured in some of the images.  I have found using the extension bar, that it is easiest to have the suction cup pointing downward, and the camera on the top side.  It takes up a little bit more windshield space, but I'm using my camera in my truck when I go off-roading, so it isn't really that big of a deal to me. :)For the money, can't beat this camera mount (at least in my opinion).
