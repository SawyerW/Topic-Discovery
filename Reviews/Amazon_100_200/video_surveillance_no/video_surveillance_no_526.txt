I found this monitor to be well made and easy to use. The instructions are very clear and complete and the units were easy to charge up. While the video image is not great, it is adequate for monitoring, as is the sound. It also works well in low light since it has its own infra-red light source and the camera is sensitive to infra-red. It is useful for monitoring anything, not just infants. It can be used to monitor anyone in need. I intend to use it to keep an eye on my house the evenings of October 30 and 31. No tricks for me!
