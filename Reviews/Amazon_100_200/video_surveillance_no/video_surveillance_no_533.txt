This camera performs as expected, except for the power saving mode where it turns on when noise is detected.  This has never worked for me!  Once enabled, it constantly hears noises that aren't present and then resets, so it always stays on.Video and audio quality are great.Battery life is great.Wireless connection is trouble free (between monitor and camera) and easily works in a larger house (camera upstairs, monitor in finsihed basement).The other significant problem for my household was WiFi router interference on a single band, Cisco router.  When the monitor was turned on and receiving a singal from the camera, my wifi would drop out on my laptop that uses 802.11n.  I ended up wanting to upgrade my router anyway, so I got a dual-band Cisco E4200 and connect to my laptop at 5gHz and no longer have interference issues.I love this little monitor: great day or night image, audio is loud, charging base station is compact and works well, good quality (dropped both pieces several times without an issue).  Looking to buy another one as my wife is pregnant again!
