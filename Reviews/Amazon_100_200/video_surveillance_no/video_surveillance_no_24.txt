I HAD PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS MY LAST STRAW AT HAVING YOUTHS IN THE AREA GRAFFITI OR GARAGE DOOR AND PRIVACY FENCE.WELL I DID NOT WANT IT GOING OFF EACH TIME A CAR DROVE BY, JUST TO ALERT ME WHEN SOMEONE WAS AT THE GARAGE DOOR, SO I MOUNTED IT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A LIGHT, RIGHT OVER THE GARAGE DOOR.BRILLIANT!!!WE HAVE TAKEN PICTURE OF THE YOUTHS WITHOUT THEY'RE KNOWLWDGE, FOLLOWED THEM TO WHERE THEY LIVED AND CONTACTED THE POLICE AND GOT THEM TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSED NOW OND ALL PAST DAMAGES AND THEY ARE ON PROBATION.IT REALLY DOES HELP TO TAKE PICTURES AND WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT I WOULD OF KEPT SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN TRYING TO PROTECT MY HOME AND FAMILY.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, IT IS INEXPENSIVE AND WILL PAY FOR ITSELF MANY TIMES OVER.
