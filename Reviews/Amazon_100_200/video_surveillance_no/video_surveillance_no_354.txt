I've had this camera for over a year now and although I'm happy with the video monitoring performance I have a lot problems with it when I set up wireless security on my wireless router.If I set any type of wireless encryption on the router and set the camera to the same security it will not establish a connection.If I set up MAC address filtering on the router the camera will still not establish a connection.The only way I can use the router in wireless mode is to have a completely unsecured wireless network.I've updated the camera BIOS to no avail. I have other devices that connect flawlessly (laptops & Wii), but this camera is a no go.Not recommended if wireless security is important to you.
