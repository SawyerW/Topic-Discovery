The camera mount is alright in what is included.  it does have great suction to glass - but there is one problem.The mount will have issues holding a camera if your windshield has a very sloped contour, (which 99% of windshields have).Meaning, don't expect to get more than a small/pocket camera on it.  There is no expanding adjustment on the arm to remedy this.You could side mount this to your driver/passenger window - or place it at the back windshield facing toward the windshield.Generally speaking, you will have to hang a standard sized camera upside down, and then flip the video in post edit.Be warned, the mount has no basic shock dampener what-so-ever.  Any vibration your vehicle gets will be transferred to the camera.This goes for home window mounts as well.If your camera has an extended mount, or you can buy one, this would allow expansion for a full sized HD video camera.This is somewhat ridiculous though, as the extension is dirt cheap to make - but is not provided. (see china molding)Front mounting a Cannon HFS200 was only possible with the camera on the passenger window, or upside down windshield.3 Stars due to expensive extension order.
