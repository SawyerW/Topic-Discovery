I also bought 3 of these to cover my carport/porch and driveway.  They look very realistic.  My only suggestion for improvement is something that draws attention to the camera, such as motion activated sound, movement or light. This would require changing batteries, so it's really a trade-off. But, without drawing attention to itself, the camera relies on an intruder seeing it. So, I also bought some signs and stickers.The other reviewer's comments about hanging it from the ceiling are unfounded. The "camera" housing has mounting holes on top and bottom, so you can choose to mount it standing up or hanging down.
