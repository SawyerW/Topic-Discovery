This product was great until it broke. I read another review that said they had the same problem.  The charging dock/plug thingy popped out from the hand held portion that plugs into the charger and obviously couldn't be used after that. I bought the one with 2 camera's. I did like the product a lot before it broke, but it broke after one week and there was no rough play or anything of the sort. All I was doing was putting it on the charger. I called as well and it's useless. I guess that's 150 or so down the drain.... I have another baby on the way so now it really grinds my gears that I have to spend extra cash on another product when this one should still be working especially for what I paid on it!
