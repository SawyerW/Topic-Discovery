My landlord removed the ADT system and installed this GE system after I signed the lease. While I understand wanting to save money, the 120DB sound can cause potential hearing loss and after having the thing go off twice, my left ear is hurting and one of my pets is traumatized. Whether hearing has been affected remains to be seen. I can't imagine anyone with children or pets wanting this device in their home. If it goes off while you're not there, it seems to me that it could kill your pet with their sensitive hearing.  If an intruder comes into your home, he/she will certainly regret it, and so will you. The warning about hearing loss is in very small print and not even noticeable unless you read the entire little booklet. I would never recommend this product since no one knows for certain how the "alarm" setting would affect his/her health until it's too late. I uninstalled it for fear of it accidentially going off again and will hope for the best.
