I needed a chime for my office to let us know when someone entered when we were in the warehouse. This little unit fit the bill perfectly. The door part consists of a small transmitter and a separate magnetic reed switch. Mounting the two was easy and quick. However because of the finish on my door, the double-sided tape wasn't strong enough to hold the reed switch so it has fallen off. I will have to devise a better mounting solution. The receiver unit plugs into a standard AC plug and is ready to go. Provides a nice doorbell sound every time the door is opened. Since this is a wireless unit, the setup is fast and the flexibility of this system is great! Just needs better mounting options.
