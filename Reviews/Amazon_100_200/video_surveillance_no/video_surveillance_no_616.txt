I've had them ALL! and this one is by far the worst! it froze! here I thought my son was in bed sleeping and then all of a sudden he's standing right in front of me talking!! I would not recommend this monitor, especially not to a new mom.The feature with talk back and the fact that move the camera sounded great...but never got a chance to try them out b/c then when I tried to reset the unit, it unpaired! so I called the company and they said it was defective, send it back to them.So, I returned it to amazon the same day.If you can find one, the summer infant day and night handheld is by far the best....old school....but works and the battery at least will last all night and then some.
