1. This thing is not bright enough.  As many other reviewers have said, it is relatively dim.2. Very cheaply made.  For the price of $35, I would be expecting MUCH MORE quality.  This honestly feels like a $3 toy at one of those gag stores at the mall.3.  The 4-way switch is super cheap.  It is very difficult to set into one of its 4 positions.  You have to slide it ever so slightly or else you will easily over shoot the setting you intended.  If you slide it too hard, it feels like it could very easily break.4.  The 4 way switch is for 4 modes:  A. Off  B. Light sensor on + 4hr runtime  C. Light sensor on + 7hr runtime  D. OnThe light sensor is crap.  I tried covering it with my hand and also going into our pitch dark walk-in closet and neither would activate it.  So, that feature is pretty much useless.Overall, don't waste your money.  Normally, we just use the timer on our flat screen TV's but we recently cut off our cable TV to limit viewing and it's expensive.
