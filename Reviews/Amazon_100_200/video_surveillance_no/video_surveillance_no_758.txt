Disappointed and frustrated in this Logitech item - even though we've had success with many of their other products. I set this camera/software up in 15 minutes in a temporary test location before installing permanently. It worked fairly well, except for the night vision, but I was willing to live with this short-coming. After installing "by the book" permanently, this system could not locate the camera. Even though all components in this very simple configuration were installed correctly, and LED's indicated that all was well, tech support was not able to provide a solution outside of trying a longer Ethernet cable (???!!!) and resetting, plugging, unplugging and re-plugging all connections. After investing my Saturday morning drilling, installing, and fruitless troubleshooting - I'm packing it up to return to good old reliable Amazon.
