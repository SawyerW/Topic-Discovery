The cameras were easy to set up. I tried using the house wiring but the cameras kept dropping out. The house is a little old and they were long runs. I had better luck running the Cat 6 ethernet cables and using a PoE switch to connect the cameras to the computer. The soft ware is easy to use and install.  The picture quality is good for a still picture but if someone is walking or moving at any type of speed it is blur. The night vision also works well so long as there is no movement but try and capture a image of someone moving or a car, forget it, It looks like the Flash going bye. The camera works OK for what I use it for. I did not want to spend a lot of money on cameras so I guess I get what i paid for, but if your expecting to capture motion or see a license plate look for another camera, but you'll be spending more money
