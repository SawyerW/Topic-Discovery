Every time the camera takes a picture it makes a noticeable "CLUNCK". The noise does not scare the wildlife away, but they can't keep their eyes off the camera.The photos are also a little fuzzy.The good things are I also use it as a security camera, and it goes unnoticeable. The cameras battery life (over 1500 pics) and one month in service still have 70% battery life left. Also this camera is taking photos of cars passing by on the Road which is over 150 feet from the camera where it is mounted and is set on normal (medium) sensitivity.I believe the good things out perform  the unfavorable ones.I would purchase it again.This camera has taken over 24,000 pics with FIVE SETS OF ENGIZER (TWENTY BATTERIES)= 1200 Pics per Battery,4800 pics per set of ENGIZER batteries.TWENTY MOUNTHS AND 24,000 PICS LATER IT IS DEAD.TIME TO PURCHASE A NEW NEW "PRIMOS 35".
