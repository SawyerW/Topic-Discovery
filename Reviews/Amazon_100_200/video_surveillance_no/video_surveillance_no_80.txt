I bought this for a friend who lives alone and her back door is at the far end of her house. She said when tested this is loud enough that she could hear it in the other end of the house. It has brought her piece of mind knowing at night if someone tries to enter her home she will be alerted. She has it on laminate flooring and I suggested she place a carpet sample or mat under it but she said she does not have a problem with it on the floor as is. She also uses it in her hotel room when she travels. Will be purchasing more for other doors.
