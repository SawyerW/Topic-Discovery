I have to admit I was a bit skeptical but I figured I would give it a try. Although my intended use for this is not specifically what it was designed for.  I am using it as a prop for television and independent film.  It will be shone on the actors faces to simulate them watching television.  I had my girlfriend go up to my sons room and do a test to see how authentic it looked through the closed curtains.  She set it on top of his TV.  Then to test it she turned on one of the items. I had to guess which it was, the TV or the Fake TV.  I couldn't tell the difference.  When we compared it to the larger TV in the living room it did not shine bright enough to fool me. It works well in smaller rooms to represent a smaller TV. All in all I rate it at a 4star.  If it was a bit brighter I would have given it a 5.
