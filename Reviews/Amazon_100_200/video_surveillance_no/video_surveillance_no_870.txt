We have several offices with 1-3 people and were looking for some kind of solution that would allow us to monitor what is going on, for productivity and security purposes.  The Logitech Alert system is the perfect answer:  simple setup and a reasonable price.The alerts are great and fortunately, we haven't had a security breach that caused any yet!  I would like the ability to select times that the security alert would NOT occur, such as 7-8pm (when the cleaning crew comes in).We plan on purchasing additional units as we open more locations, including overseas.  Look forward to enhancements that would allow us to have more control over things like alerts, and to manage multiple locations a bit more easily.For the price and ease of installation and use, this is a break-through product.  Had it been introduced, I doubt that we would have considered a competing (and far more costly) solution.
