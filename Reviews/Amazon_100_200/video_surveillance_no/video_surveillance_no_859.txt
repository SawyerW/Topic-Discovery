I searched the web extensively to look for a replacement for my AT&T; Remote Monitor cameras.  This system is what I was looking for:Easy to use software with night vision capability.After installing the software, the software wouldn't recognize the camera.  After some troubleshooting, I found out that it was trying to 'find' the camera on my other wireless network.So, note to all: If you have trouble with the system 'finding' your camera and you have multiple wireless/wired networks - changes are it's the OTHER network!!I would have given this system 5 Stars if it had remote monitoring capability for my Blackberry Torch phone.
