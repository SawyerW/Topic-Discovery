This video monitor is a great idea.  We have a two camera system so we're able to switch between the baby and the toddler.  The only thing that I don't like is the feedback noise if the sound is up.  There is a constant beeping noise that drives me crazy, so obviously, this isn't a great monitor for night time.Update 4/24/12I had return it cause it broke again. I'll try it one more time> if it brakes again I'll be asking for my money back. The peace that is in side the hand held that hocks to the charger has now broke two times.
