I bought this monitor because I wanted something wireless so that my child doesn't grab it and strangle himself with it, butsince I have had it the battery always dies after three hours.First I thought I wasn't charging it enough so I let it charge all day during the day and by night it went off after three hours.Also I don't like how it stands. When I tried to place it on the dress and tilted it down to get a better view of my chilod the base of the camera didn't hold it and it kept tilting over.Not worth the money.
