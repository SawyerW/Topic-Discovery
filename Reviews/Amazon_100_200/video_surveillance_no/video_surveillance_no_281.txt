I had a different brand of remote lock in the past and it was not as well constructed or as nice looking as this Morning Industry model.  The lock installed easily and quickly (just remember if installing on a steel door to put duct tape on the back of the metal bracket on the inside of the door to keep it from touching the door, otherwise there will be interference with the signal).  It has a solid feel and works well thus far.  The bronze is lighter than my Kwikset knob and I wish this company sold a knob with it in matching finish.  Otherwise, it's great!
