Even though I keep a gun next to my bed, it really bothered me that if someone managed to get into my house, I probably wouldn't wake up in time to get to it. (I'm a VERY deep sleeper and my bedroom's on the 2nd floor)I'm so glad I decided to order this!It's VERY loud and the 4 I ordered work on all my doors leading outside.I even found a way to use this on my sliding glass door.  By propping it gently against the sliding part of the door, and then putting something heavy behind it, to hold it in place, the alarm will go off if the door's opened.Like the other reviewer said, I love that it's portable, so I can bring it with me to hotels and stuff.Anyways, between how well it works, the simplicity of using it and the very reasonable price.  I very highly recommend this!
