After reading all the reviews which talked about the door chime working 75% of the time and only working within 20ft of the door... I still decided to risk it and make the purchase. My experience was exactly the same results. Installed ok on our garage-entry door and it worked perfect using outlet 20ft away in hallway... but when I tried moving it to 3 different outlets at 40ft to 60ft away from the door, I got intermittent results and then next day it stopped working completely. I don't know why the signal was so weak, since we had no "interference" problem. We have Wood frame house and no other radio ways in the house or surrounding us. Finally, I moved back to outlet 20ft way and now it works 90% of the time. I'm probably going to send it back to manufacturer with warranty claim?? but it is time for Amazon to "drop" this product, since 50% of reviews are 2-star or less.
