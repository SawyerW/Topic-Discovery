I'm pretty impressed with this little camera thus far, it's better than I expected it to be.  The hole saw included in the packaging worked like a dream, and the camera itself was a quick and painless install.  I've only had it for a week so I can't comment on the longevity, but I can say the picture quality and the night vision quality are great for the price.****EDIT -03/31/11Not waterproof. When it rains this thing fogs up for days, only to become clear and crisp after it dries out. It's like that emotionally unstable ex that you want to love, but just can't.
