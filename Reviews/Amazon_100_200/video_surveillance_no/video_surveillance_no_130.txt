http : // www . youtube . com/watch?v=3pLbDcRWqOcAs you can see, this speaks for itself !Excellent suction cup.Product feels Very Sturdy.I'd hang my HD cam anytime on this thing !My only criticism is for my particular use, i dont have too many flat surfaces i can put it on other then the windows and door in the cockpit... which isn't the problem.For my use,.. when its on the door as seen on the video above, the Panavise 809's arms are so short that  I cant really see on my Sony Bloggie Touch's Screen how its aligned. But thats certainly not a problem of the product, but of my use.I'm thinking of getting an extension arm to accomodate my particular use.As soon as i'm using it on the cockpits side windows, im not having this problem!
