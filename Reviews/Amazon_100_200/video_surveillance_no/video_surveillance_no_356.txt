I have looked at several wireless camera and found most of them had similar features, However, the reviews on the other cameras made me think twice. The reviews on this camera was positive and so I purchased the camera. The camera does a good job with Pan and Scan (only wish it was 180 degree) Hook-up and local viewing was simple. I did have a problem with setting it up for Internet access and found that my Vonage adapter would not let me have internet access but the tech and panasonic was excellent. He walked me thru the system and now I have Internet access. Here are some key things you need to know. The name of your wireless router must be the same on your camera setup. Don't use the default port of 80. If you have an VOIP call the tech at panasonic.This is a great product. The motion sensor works great.
