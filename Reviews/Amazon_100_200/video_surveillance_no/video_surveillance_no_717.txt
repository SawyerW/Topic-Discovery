I was planning to clone my system before upgrading from Vista Ultimate to Windows 8 and this drive worked great, after some fairly minor issues.  It has performed well for almost a month, so I will use this drive again or perhaps with a larger capacity.WD recommends Acronis/True Image to clone your drive, but I found that it would not correctly create a boot drive.CNET recommended EaseUS Todo Backup and it did the job for me.  I started with the trial version, but decided to purchase it for another couple of computers that need upgrades.Thanks for the fast delivery from Databug.com too!
