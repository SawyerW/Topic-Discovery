This is a waaaaay cool product!  There are two negative aspects I should deal with first.  The wedge works well on hard wood or tile flooring, but it slips on carpet, secondly; if there isn't enough space between the floor and the bottom of the door, the wedge can't function properly, so an entry way that opens onto plush carpet may or may not function for you.  I have short carpet, so they work for me.  Having said that, I amin love with these simple alarm gadgets.  Simply stated, the door opens and they scream in protest as well as acting as a door stop for an intruder.  Will the wedge prevent entry altogether?  I don't think so, if the invader is seriously committed to gain entrance, but it will let you know you have an intruder and it will slow the intruder down and probably spook the non pro burglar into leaving without your interaction.  This simple, easily affordable product could save you and your loved ones, buy you time to dial 911 and leave the phone to hang while you use remaining minutes to further secure family safety.  I happily bought several for my home.
