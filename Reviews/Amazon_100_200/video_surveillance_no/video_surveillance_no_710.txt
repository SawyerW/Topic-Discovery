I have no idea what is up with the Amazon version of this product but the quality is terrible. Sit down and I'll tell you a story about how many versions of this disk I have tried for use in my RAID 5 array.First, I bought a refurbished version of this disk off another site. It eventually failed making me never buy refurb drive again.To replace it, I figured I'd buy this one off of Amazon. The first disk they shipped me was DOA and had a very loud rattling sound when it spun up.I returned that disk and got the current one I have. I spent two days rebuilding my array and then it failed a few days later. It occasionally boots with the other two disks in my RAID 5 array but usually is just dead weight. I haven't decided whether I'm going to try one last time on Amazon or buy it off another site where I got my other two drives.
