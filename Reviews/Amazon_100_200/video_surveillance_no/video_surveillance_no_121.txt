I have a Canon S1 IS that I mount in my dashboard.  My old system -- tripod mounted on dashboard with Velcro -- finally drove me crazy, so I purchased the Panavise 809 with the extension.  I have the suction cup on the lower part of the windshield with the arm coming across the dashboard, with the extension going up.  The camera then faces out the front of the car, right-side up.  It works great.  The only vibration I see is what I would see while driving the car and is not really noticeable on my PC monitor unless I'm looking for it.  The suction cup has been on the windshield without falling off for at least three or four months.  It was a little difficult to set up, but I think that's just because of the awkwardness of trying to get into the place where I wanted to mount it.  I'm very happy with it.  Well worth the price.
