We bought this monitor after having an audio only monitor and quickly became addicted.  Setting up and pairing are easy.  Interface is intuitive.We had read that the monitor seemed cheaply made, and that the VOX setting didn't work well.  Completely agree with both of these.  The VOX is a great idea, but the implementation makes it not work at all.  Regardless of the noise level, it comes on every 15-30 seconds.  Luckily, the PowerSave feature works as expected, so the video at least turns off.The parent unit is cheap.  We've had the monitor for 9 months, and the video no longer works correctly.  The parent unit has been dropped and the video occasionally will start working again, but we now have an audio monitor.This is a good monitor if you don't care about VOX, you don't drop things a lot, and you get a good deal.  Probably one of the better video monitors out there, but not the best.
