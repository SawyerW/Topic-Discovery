A reasonable "Crittercam."  Takes a while to "awake" when triggered, so it can miss the beginning of activity.  Infrared video is of marginal quality, but it does provide what we needed:  A time-stamped photo or video of nocturnal doings around the place.  Uses "D" cell batteries, which seem to last quite a few nights.  There's no port to download images, so you have to swap out the SD card to retrieve the shots.  (The LCD display DOES tell you if pictures were taken or not, though, so you won't waste time on a blank card.  Daytime full-color video is much better.
