The monitor works well, but after 6 months we had issues with the USB. One night I went to set the monitor into the base to charge and the USB in the monitor pushed up. It became loose and I wasn't able to connect it to the base to charge.I called Lorex and it seemed like this was a known issue. The customer service rep was really nice and replaced the monitor with a refurbished one for $30.00 Only down side was, I had to mail out my broken monitor and once they recieved & processed it, they send out the refurbished one. So we were without a baby monitor for about 2 1/2 weeks. But overall great customer service, even without my reciept.
