I bought this specifically to be used inside my car. My apartment has an open-air garage where cars are parked underneath the apartments. The cars are out of site from above and there have been several break-ins and thefts over the years.I position the sensor unit in my car so that it only activates when someone opens the car door and not just walk by. The unit works great and transmits the alarm anywhere in my third story apartment!The one thing on my wish list would be that the unit would have come with an AC adapter...I would have paid the extra to have it with the unit!
