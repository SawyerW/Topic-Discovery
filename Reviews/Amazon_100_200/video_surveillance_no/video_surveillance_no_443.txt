I bought a game camera a few years ago that never really got good pics.  This camera works!!  After the success with my first one I bought two more and, now, I just ordered another three.  It is super easy to set up and maintain.  I go out on our ranch every morning to collect the memory cards and my wife and I enjoy watching all the activity that happened last night - foxes, pigs, deer, coyote.  I can't believe the high quality for the low price.  I've found the video to be the most satisfying and with an 8GB card you have plenty for room for it.  Also, the batteries last and last.  Congrats for making a great game camera!
