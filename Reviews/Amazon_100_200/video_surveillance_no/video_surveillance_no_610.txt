The range is good.  It came with 2 cameras.  It did it's job.The main problem is that the build quality is poor.  At around 3 months we could hear that there was a rattling inside the monitor itself (turned out to be a loose screw that only needed some tightening).  At around 6 months the input port for charging the monitor broke, so that it is no longer usable (cannot be charged).  I'm somewhat handy and opened up the monitor to see if I could somehow re-attach the charging input.  After examining the insides, I realize that this monitor is pretty cheap and not build to last.  I'm sure that more people will have problems due to poor build quality.
