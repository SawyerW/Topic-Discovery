These are a cool idea.  However, there are 2 flaws in the design.  One, the ramp device does not meet the floor flush.  There is basically a gap.  My front door is very close to the floor so it would hit this unit too low and wouldn't press the ramp down (which is what initiates the alarm).  Also, the device has rubber on the bottom to hold it in place via friction but it isn't grippy enough for my hardwoods so after the doors makes contact with the ramp too low, the unit just gets pushed back out of the way for a total fail.  I think it would work great if you had a door with sufficient clearance so that it hits the unit high enough to depress the ramp AND if you have carpet so that the rubber can grip better.  I have neither so this did not work for me.
