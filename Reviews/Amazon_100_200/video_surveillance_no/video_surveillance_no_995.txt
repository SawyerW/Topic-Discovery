Wonderful product.  We have on demand hot water heaters, one of them flooded about a 1200 sq. ft. area in the middle of the night before we knew what was going on.  This is the second type of water alarm we have tried because my washer over flowed, we used this water alarm and it is the BEST!  I promise you will wake up out of a sound sleep when this goes off.  We have placed it on all water heaters and the washing machine.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want their house flooded and wants to take precautions.  We have tried several types yet this one does what the manufacture says it will do.  We  would give more than 5 stars if we could.
