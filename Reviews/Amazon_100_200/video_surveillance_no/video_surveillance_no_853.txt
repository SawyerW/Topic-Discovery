I've owned the Logitech Wilife camera system for a few years. I don't own the Alert system. However, anyone considering this system should be aware of how poorly Logitech maintains its servers for remote viewing. The servers go offline several times a year often for a week at a time. That means no online access to your cameras. In the last month they've been down 3 times and it takes days to fix the problem. I spent over $1000 on the system plus $80 a year for platinum online service and it's obvious that Logitech no longer cares about supporting the system. It seems that they want to push current Wilife customers to buy their newer Alert system. But after my experience of the past year I don't trust the company to continue to maintain the online system that allows remote viewing. Be advised.
