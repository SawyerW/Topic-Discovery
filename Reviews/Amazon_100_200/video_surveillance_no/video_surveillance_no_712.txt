If you count on your system like my company does don't buy this product!After a great review from or IT tech I decided to purchase these drives to replace our older Seagate hard drives before they started to go bad. Since IT has installed the new RE4 Enterprise drives I have experienced 4 bad or failed hard drives in less than a month. This failure rate is unacceptable in any capacity . The customer service was great though! Amazon was fast to respond and replace with very minimal questions . I have since Returned all WD RE4 Drives and opted for a more reliable Samsung 840 Pro SSD X2 in a Raid 1 format. The cost was a lot higher but compared to loosing critical  Design time from bad drives or worse loosing Customers Engineering data it was a small price to pay....
