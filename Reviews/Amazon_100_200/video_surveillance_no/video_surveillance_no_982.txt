I just purchased this product after looking at all the reviews and watching you videos etc.When you opened the product it seems nice and camera is pretty nice also. However, I had a tough time going through set up. Spent hours and tried numerous times.I have Imac with airport express with one port and went out and got ethernet switch from netgear with 5 ports.I hooked everything up but couldnt locate powerline network adapter and couldnt locate the camera. I did online search and several people had the same problem here is the link. I will return this to best buy tomorrow.I ll buy a different system. I have set up a lot of electronic devices over the years and this is the most difficulty I have had with a device.[...]
