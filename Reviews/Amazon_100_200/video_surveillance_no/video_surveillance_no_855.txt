I'd put off setting up this system for a long time, since I'm not much of a techie, but once I finally decided to get started I wished I'd have done it long ago. Setup was quite easy, putting the one camera in the kitchen, the room at the back of the house where burglars and other miscreants would probably enter. I also put the outdoor camera on the back porch, so it's quite easy now to know who's at the door when I'm in my office at the computer. We're not away from out house very often, but when we are we turn on the motion trigger alerts to the phone, but have hardly had any, since we don't get many visitors, but the few times we have, it's worked, and we can usually tell who it is. We probably don't need the system, truth be told, but it's nice to have and is kind of fun to play with. if I was in a situation where I'd really need tight security, I'd recommend this system, especially the outside camera.
