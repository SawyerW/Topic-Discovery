This item is much more suited to warmer climates.  I installed the Driveway Patrol last night here in Vermont.  Outside temp was in the teens. It worked great while it was still warm.  Later in the evening my son drove out, setting off the alarm... which failed to turn off!! After retrieving the transmitter unit, and warming it up inside, it worked again.  I am now using it inside, near our main entrance, and it works well there.  I just will have to wait until spring to use it out in the driveway where it was intended.  The price was too good to send it back. I will improvise for now.
