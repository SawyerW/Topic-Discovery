Purchased 2 of these to mount security cameras. Suction cup holds really well and mount itself is of above-average quality. Only objection is that which other purchasers noted was the shortness of the "extension arm" - it's too short for most use. Others commented that they contacted Panavise and recieved a free extension arm but that freebee is no more. Plan on laying out another $18-$20 bucks to include shipping, which is what Panavise is charging for the 3" extension arm (which you'll probably need). That said, I have to deduct 2 stars for value. By the time you're done, you're probably paying 2x that which Amazon sells the unit itself for. If you can get by without the extension arm, you'll be fine and very happy with this mount.
