The first few days I had the Cam facing a pine tree about 20 feet away. I got lots of photos of the tree blowing in the wind.Then I had it facing the entrance drive - no vegetation to trigger the Cam and got lots of  good photos of deer ...and of cars coming and going.It's fun to see what's going on at night - and great to be able to record who is coming up your driveway when you are not home. I'm looking forward to catching a few shots of whoever is throwing trash at the end of the driveway all the time!The Cam is easy to set up and operate. I've had only one thing I can't figure out. Each time I download the card to the computer it says there are some unreadable photos due to format, which doesn't make sense because either they should all load - or none at all.
