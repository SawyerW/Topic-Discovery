We got this monitor while pregnant with our second child.  Our first video monitor was black and white, grainy, and wouldn't work in certain parts of the house.  This monitor works great anywhere in the house and the picture quality is great!  Also, the portability is wonderful.  The video fits in  your hand and can be taken with you, unlike our first that had to be plugged in the wall and looked like a mini tv. We have two cameras, one for each child, and love the capability of being able to switch between cameras or watching both at the same time.  We have not used it as a camera to take pictures, and really don't plan on it because we have digital cameras already.  As a monitor, we highly recommend it!!
