I recently purchased two more of the driveway patrol sensors because they work fantastically. My first sensor was mounted near our front door to let us know when guests are approaching and since our doorbell is not the loudest one this takes care of that. If I was going to say there was any issue with this product is that the receiver makes the chime noise three times in a row.  That can get quite annoying at times but its not unbearable, we keep the receiver in a convenient location to change the volume and to shut it off if we need to.
