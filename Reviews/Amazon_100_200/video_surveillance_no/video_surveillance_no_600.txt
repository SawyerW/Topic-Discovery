The camera works fine and well in the dark and the monitor has a good range.  The battery life on the monitor is short but I don't know how long it really should be.  The only reason I have rated this 1 star is the mini usb part that provides power is not well attached and it has come loose on 3 different monitors now.This means a return and new unit sent but I don't understand why they are coming off.  Doesn't happen on cell phones or any other item I have owned. This is a serious design flaw that severely limits the longevity of the item.  I would buy another one at this point its just easier.
