I'm surprised this thing has gotten such good reviews. I admit that it is well constructed and sturdy, but if it doesn't work, how can it get 5 stars? I thought I could figure out how to make this work with a camera, but I have the same problem everyone else has; there is no room for the camera once it is stuck to the windshield. I thought that by turning it sideways I could make it work, but that doesn't do it. There still isn't room for the camera. I even tried mounting it on my side window, but it doesn't stick out far enough to see around the A-pillar. I just can't position this thing to make it work. I'm thinking I might just mount the camera upside down, and then if I ever need the video, I can run it through a program to flip the video over.
