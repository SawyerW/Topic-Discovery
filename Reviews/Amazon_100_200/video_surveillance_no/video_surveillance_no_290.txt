I replaced two 6128 keypads that had buttons that we're working poorly with two 6150 keypads. The keypad addresses on the old 6128 were set at the default address of 31. Since the new 6150 are also set at a default address of 31 the switch was easy. Turn off the system, cut, strip install the four wires as shown in the supplied instructions.  The 6150 screw mounting holes even matched the 6128 holes in the wall. Turn the system back on and clear any codes. OC code is an open circuit. Check the wiring. Make sure the green and yellow wires are hooked up and not reversed. Zone 9 indicates Tamper...just reset the system twice and it will clear. That was all I had to do. Great system.
