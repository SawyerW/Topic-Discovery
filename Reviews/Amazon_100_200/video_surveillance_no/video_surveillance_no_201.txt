This is my first product review on anything, ever. I woke up last night at 4:30 in the morning to the sound of the back door alarm going off and my girlfriend freaking out. Half asleep I reached for my shotgun. With the mix of complete drowsiness, anxiety and adrenaline, I made my way out the bedroom and down our stairs (shotgun in hand). Our stairs are L shaped with a wall about half the way to the top. So I could be walking into a gunshot before I even see anyone. I make it about halfway down and realize this could be the end of mine or another persons life. Once I have a visual of the kitchen to which I am walking in, I see no one. I then approach the back door, which has the alarm and get ready for what's next To my complete pleasure the alarm has just become loose and was at a 45* tilt which made the alarm go off. Thank god. I gave the review 3 stars because if this was an actual brake in, I would at lease have time to defend myself.
