I bought this monitor on 13 March, 6 days ago.  When it arrived, it came with a dead battery.  I called Lorex Customer Service only to get terrible, horrible, no good, very bad customer service.  They were not helpful, offered no way ahead.  It took me 3 phone calls and 3 emails to finally get my case referred to their replacements department.  Additionally, they are trying to tell me that it is going to take 7-10 business days to get my replacement battery.  Unacceptable.On a positive note, the monitor is of good quality, when it is plugged in (no battery).  If you get a working product, it will be a good choice of monitor.  If it is defective, beware of borderline worthless customer service!
