Sure, I bought this camera to merely prove a point. I feed birds in my yard and noticed a year ago that bird seed would mysteriously be empty by morning every night. I have come face-to-face with deer in my backyard and had observed them eating the bird seed and told my girlfriend about it and of course she didn't believe me. I bought this camera, pointed it toward the feeder and the very next day I was able to prove to her what was happening...there were 3 deer that night and we had beautiful night-time pictures of the creatures feasting. The camera is very easy to setup and use and even takes great videos. The camera is about 10 yards from the feeder and it took a very neat video of squirrels raiding the feeders as well.
