I was hesitant to get this camera because there were mixed reviews. I am glad I got it. Our neighborhood has a lot of issues with people stealing newly delivered packages off of front porches. Also, break-ins go up in the summer time. So, we wanted to get something to capture the activity around our front door and porch.Pros: Great picture, wireless, sends alerts with snapshots of images, the software has a nice interface, audio is good, can view live feed from your phoneCons: the online viewer leaves something to be desired (you can only view live - that's it - the only way to review and save footage is through the software/program), you need a dedicated outdoor plug, you also need a dedicated indoor plug and a spare port in your routerNote: A lot of things I read said the software was not compatible with Macs, but there is a free app you can download for your Mac that's comparable to the software (it's listed in the manual).
