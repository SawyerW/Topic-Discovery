Living in the big city, I've been burglarized several times in the past 20 years. I've since added a number of security improvements to the home but realized that they don't actually deter a thief from trying to break in. If a thief thinks the occupants are at home, he'll move on and try another house where the owners don't appear to be home. With that in mind, I purchased this Fake TV Burglar Deterrent and put it in an upstairs room we use for a library that faces the front driveway.Being just a little skeptical of this little device, I waited until dark then went outside to see what it looks like. With my real plasma television on down stairs and this little fake TV running upstairs, I was simply amazed at how realistically it compared to my real television. Several weeks ago I was talking to a neighbor and he commented that he noticed our upstairs television running late into the night. When I told him it was this little fake TV, he said he was convinced it was a real TV. Needless to say, he placed his order for one too.
