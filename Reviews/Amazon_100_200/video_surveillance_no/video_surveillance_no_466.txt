I got this for my parents last Christmas, and they have had so much fun with it. My dad moves it to different locations around the yard quite frequently and they have gotten pictures of skunk, deer, possum, raccoon, cat, squirrel, fox, the newspaper person, and trick or treaters. While some reviews have complained about the picture quality, the pictures I have seen have always surpassed my expectations. The camera continues to work well a year later. I think it's very neat that the night pictures are taken in the dark, so the animal doesn't even know its picture was taken. My family bought two more this Christmas for gifts for others. This is a great gift.
