This is a complete piece of junk. It reminds me of when I was a kid and ordered "X-Ray Glasses" from the back of a comic book, and when they arrived I didn't have x-ray vision.I followed the instructions, but the alerting broadcasting unit in the driveway, only alerts when I am holding it and playing with it. Mounted on a post at the driveway, it does not send an alert tone for cars. And when I get it to "work" by holding it, the range is only about 100 feet.Don't buy this piece of junk, unless you want to feel like a dumb kid again.
