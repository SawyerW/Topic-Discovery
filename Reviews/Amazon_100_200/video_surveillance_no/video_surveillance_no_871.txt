Like the product very much (Indoor master system + outdoor addon), would give 5 star if they are wireless. HATE the customer support! And here is the story.Bought this master system with indoor camera, and an add-on outdoor camera.Initial setup was easy until I ran into some problem when I moved after one week of the initial test.The master system could not detect the camera and tried reloading software, reset, different homeplug location, and such, everything I could find on the internet, including their own supporting forum. No luck.Instructions have very limited information, not very helpful either.Called customer support, had discussion with him for more than 30 minutes, still couldn't isolate the problems. Sometimes even rely on me to provide some ideas of identifying issues and possible ways to isolate them. More than 30 minutes later, told me had to escalate me to second level support, and promised response within 48 hours!!Two days later, no response. Send an email with all related information on Oct 1, and three days later, still no response!!LOGITECH, hire me as your customer support and I will humiliate all of you! Shame on you!To prove what I said is true, the reference# was #100930-001176.
