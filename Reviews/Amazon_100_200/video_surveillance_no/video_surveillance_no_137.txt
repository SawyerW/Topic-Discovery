I actually bought this Panavise mount elsewhere -- where it was called something different (G-Force or whatever) on their web site and cost about 2x as much!  Then I found the identical mount here. I know it's the same because it says Panavise and has the patent number and is well constructed etc.  Other's are apparently not even getting the real product, but cheap imitations.  So, buy the Panavise here and buy it from Amazon.  As far as I know it's the best deal and also the genuine product.Regarding the product, it really is very functional, well-constructed and sturdy.  I'd buy another Panavise product as my experience is that they are of good quality.  I can also attest to the excellent customer support provided by Julia -- thanks!
