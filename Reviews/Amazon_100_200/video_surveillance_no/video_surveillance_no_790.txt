My friend installs Surveilance systems & I asked him once I bought the Logitech, to install it. He laughed & told me that his expensive systems are what I need. Once he came to he house & saw how simple it was to install he thought something was wrong (to good to be true effect). Then as he went along he acted like a kid on Christmas realizing how Awesome this system was for my needs. I love this system and watch my cameras anywhere I am whenever I want. My friend wants the system now in his house he's so impressed. That made me feel good knowing I had his overwhelming approval. Thanks Logitech!
