You get what you pay.  Attempted to save $25 bucks by purchasing these cables through Amazon.  Perhaps for home use it might work. For commercial application the cables pick up too much noise and static compared to the cables I normally purchase.  This cable will not work well with the high quality cameras I installed.  This cable has both the video and power in just one cable compared to the one I normally use which has two cables side by side, one for video and one for power.  This cable is 1/3 the thickness of my other cables making it very fragile especially for long runs.  Had to replace them with the cables I normally purchased.  At least I was able to successfully use them to pull the good cable in to replace it so my efforts in pulling this cable above a dropped ceiling infested with itchy fiberglass was minimized.  I do not recommend this quality of product for professional installation.
