After the two glowing reviews I was expecting a very good Hi Def picture with good internet viewing capability. No and No! The picture provided by this system is mediocre at best. The resolution via the internet is just plain poor and in my opinion it could not be used for identifying anyone. You have a basic internet video connection that comes standard with the master system which provides a very poor picture. Of course you can subscribe to the Logitech service for a fee and have a slightly better poor picture and camera/audio controls. I did the 7 day trial subscription and it is not without bugs (like "cannot find camera", et).So what's the upside....it is easy to set-up and uses your home electrical system for the wiring (yes, all cameras have to be plugged into an outlet). I'm looking for a system that actually has a high quality picture and this is not it.Not recommended for internet viewing, actually not recommended at all.
