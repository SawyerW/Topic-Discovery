Solid.  Weatherproof.  Reliable.  The 4 D Batteries give it months of life, even in cold Idaho winters.  The photos are good.  I would love to see a stronger infrared light source and a larger diameter hole for the cable to slide through for locking.  Maybe the new models are better in that respect.  Also, head over to your local hardware store and make your own cable lock.  They have various diameters of coated cable.  All you need after that is a few stoppers to bind the cable back to itself and badabing! you have a custom length cable.  THIS IS VERY HANDY since it allows you to fit the camera around larger diameter trees...  Most cable locks are waaaay too short.
