I had been wanting to purchase a trail/scout cam for quite a few years, but could never justify spending the money that was required to get a quality camera. After doing some research, I decided on trying out the Primos TruthCam 35 because of the price, features, and success I've had with other Primos products. This camera is great, much better than some of the higher priced ones I've seen my buddies use. The only reason this cam doesn't get a 5 star rating is because the night pictures can be slightly fuzzy if the animal is very far from the camera. For the price, I would recommend this camera to everyone, and will probably end up purchasing one or two more of them.
