I bought this to take time-lapse photos with a Logitech web cam during long road trips. The suction cup sticks to the windshield amazingly well. It's even kind of hard to get it off. LOL.I'm giving it four stars due to the slight vibration I see when going over typical city bumps ([...] I've seen other videos where the camera's image stabilization seems to take care of most of it. Some of this might be due to my camera (Canon SX210 IS).I'm happy with the purchase since I think it will work well for static photos, and it works much better than duct taping my web cam to the mirror. :) The price can't be beat either.
