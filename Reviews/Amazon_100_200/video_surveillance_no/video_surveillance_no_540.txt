My first unit started to malfunction after a year so I purchased a second one.  I like that the product is light and easy to use and has served our needs well.However, the new unit did not pair up automatically out of the box as it's supposed to.  I called up their technical support for assistance.  After holding for over 30 minutes, I was told that someone will have to call me back later... it's now been 8 hours since and tech support never called.  I have tried to call again, but was holding forever.The first Lorex camera I purchased a year ago had a similar pairing problem.  Given that Lorex tech support is so difficult to access, think twice before buying this item.
