Bought this summer of 2012, it seemed to work great when i first set her up. the sensitivity was on high of medium would end up taking a ton of pictures no matter where i put it up at. I got some really good pics for the most part and was pretty satisified with it. then it seemed like my battery life would only last about half (2-4 weeks)of what my friends (2 months)was. This year i put it up early spring and after 2 days the batteries were dead. call primos and they said my SD card needed to be reformatted from my laptop and they gave me instructions on how to do that. but the camera isn't even taking pictures anymore and is disfunctional. So i'll be getting back ahold of them hoping for a replacement or something. dunno if mine is just a earlier model and a flake or what. my friends is still running strong and working worth the price- unfortunately mine is not. I'm wanting to pick up another 2 or 3 cameras but doubt i will go this route again.
