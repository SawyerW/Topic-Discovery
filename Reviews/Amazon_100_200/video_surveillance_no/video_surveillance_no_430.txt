This is the second one we bought from Amazon.com because we like the first one so much.  Night pics/videos are in greyscale, daylight shots are beautifully sharp and in color. Pretty amazing. It's bigger than you might think even though they give the dimensions, but we don't care for our particular purpose, and I certainly don't think wildlife would care either. If we used it for wildlife, which we don't. heh heh, unless  you count a "special" housemate climbing through our windows while wearing pantyhose, skirt and heels. LOLOLOLOLOL!  This camera provides perfectly viewable proof in court.FABU! We use this inside our home - issue with housemate/relative and IT WORKS PERFECTLY!
