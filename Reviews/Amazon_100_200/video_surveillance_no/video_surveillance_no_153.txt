Just got this in and my initial review isn't very good.  First of all, the sensors aren't connected with the keypad in any way.  Also, the instructions suggest mounting the keypad on the door itself which is difficult if the trim around your door is anything but flat. I was under the impression that this really was a wireless system and the sensors didn't have to be right next to the keypad.The window sensors/alarm are better.  They serve their intended purpose.  If a burglar breaks into your house, it will at least give you advance warning if you are home.  Yes, it can be easily disarmed but at least you have a head start.  I was actually hoping to use the additional sensors on my other doors but it doesn't look like that's going to happen unless I want to cut into my trim.I guess it's not bad for the price but all in all, it's not that great either.
