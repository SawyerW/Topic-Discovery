This camera was easy to install.  The wiring on my vehicle was already in place since I bought this camera to replace one that stopped working.  Something that I have not seen described any where is that this camera has a built in distance grid.  So, when you turn on the camera, a grid will be displayed on your video screen showing how far back an object is.  On my vehicle, the grid goes back to about 10 feet. The resolution is good, not great.  But this is a backup camera, so it is plenty good enough to see when backing up.
