I have tried several inexpensive game cameras, kept this one. I like the easy setup using dedicated switches instead of software function programing. Specs calls for trigger at 30 feet max range. The night photos are not well illuminated beyond 10 feet from camera. The daylight shots are fantastic. I was happy with this unit and needed another camera, so I upgraded to the Primos Truth cam 46. It cost more money and performance was not as good as Truth cam 35. Sent the Truth cam 46 back and ordered another Truth Cam 35. Happy with both Truth Cams 35. The video mode does eat up SD card space so I switched over to the 5 shot photo feature with 1 second delay between shots. uses a lot less card space and sharp photos. By the way the specs say 8 GB (SD HC MAX SIZE) My two Truth cams 35 accepted 16 GB SDHC and seems to work fine. I would have given the camera 5 stars, but the distance of the night photos beyond 10 feet were a little disapointing.
