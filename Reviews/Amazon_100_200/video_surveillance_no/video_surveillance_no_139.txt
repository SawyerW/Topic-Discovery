I really like the mount but felt that the description was a little inaccurate. It did not fit on both of my cars and I needed to contact the company to have them send me an extension.  Thankfully they were very responsive and sent the extension out right away free of charge. Even with the extension my Kodak zi8 is right against the window. It would be perfect if the arm was a little longer so that you can clear the angle of the windshield. It also does not work with my P&S; pocket camera. Otherwise I think it's solid and holds the video camera well.
