I purchase this mount adapter to use between my tripod and IPad mount/ case. This adapter requires 3/8" deep threaded holes and bolts.  The threaded hole for the tripod bolt is very recessed, allowing a only a couple of turns of the tripod bolt that is 3/16" long.  Also most cameras and mounts utilize the tripods pin the assist the 3/16" bolt by preventing the mount from twisting. The device only has the bolt connection on its narrow cylinder base. Also the bolt to the IPad holder is too long, since the back of the IPad mount is shallow.  These issues make the setup loose and floppy.  I plan to visit the hardware store and get rubber washers and non recessed extensions.  If they have a 90% fitting, I will return this device.If I use this device I will also make and use a safety strap of fishing line to the tripod.
