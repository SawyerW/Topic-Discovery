I am returning my camera because the picture of moving objects is fuzzy beyond recognition even with lights on, indoor or outdoor at night or indoors during the day. This is a real deal breaker for me. The video has very long lag since the motion detector kicks in. Subject can be out of the scene by then. Overall it has very limited applications if it takes good pictures of stationary objects only under sun light and not a clear one from moving objects. The software is also buggy and hangs while downloading from the camera even with my computer on! I liked the idea of not running the wires and using power outlet but this is not the solution. Not to mention the blinking lights or paid internet access. I'll keep looking.
