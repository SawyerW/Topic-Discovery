I have tried other kinds of these things and there was always 2 problems. 1 they hurt after a long shift. 2 they made it hard to hear it was as if you had an ear plug in one ear. These worked MUCH better both ways. Because of the acoustic tube you can still hear with the ear that has the piece in it. I found out right away that even after a 12 hour shift my ear was not sore from wearing this. If you want to use a two way with an ear piece this is the only way to go.
