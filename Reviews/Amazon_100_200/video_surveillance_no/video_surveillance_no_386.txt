I bought this camera in the fall of 2010. At first blush I was very impressed, especially for the money.  It took excellent daytime pics and nightime pics were good enough to see what quality of deer you were looking at  could easily count tines etc._ It started out getting about one and a half months on a set of fresh batteries. Not great but ok, this was set at 3 shot every minute mode.  This season after putting in  fresh batteries and setting up the camera again battery life is terrible.  I have tried 3 different brands of batteries, set picture taking to one pic every minute and can't get more than 2 1/2 weeks from a set of batteries. Quite dissapointing.  My Moutlrie 45 has been runing for almost a year on the same set of batteries, Guess I will be sticking with them from now on.  The primos is great at getting good pics but battery life is terrible.
