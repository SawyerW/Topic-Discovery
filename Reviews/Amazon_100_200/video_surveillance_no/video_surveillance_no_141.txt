I reviewed a lot of suction cup camera mounts before choosing this one, and I'm glad I did. I'm an amature filmmaker in college and I'm using this mount to get some AMAZING shots for car chases with my Flip Ultra HD pocket cam. This mount is fantastic for the price and sticks extremely well. I've used it inside and outside my Kia Rio as well as other vehicles and the shot is steady, smooth, and very professional looking. As explained in other reviews, I did try to mount my Flip cam on the inside of the windscreen and shoot straight ahead, with no luck. Because I'm a filmmaker and don't plan on using it for straight ahead shots anyway, I found this to be a fantastic buy.
