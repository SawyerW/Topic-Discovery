The term wirless implies that the three units are interconnected via transmission signals.  They are simply individual battery operated alarms. This is misleading in my opinion.  I should have paid extra for a true interconnected wireless system.  Meanwhile, I will stick them on my two windows and the door.Currently there are 19 one star reviews and 19 two star reviews.  I was one of the earliest reviewers, so I feel vindicated with my opinion of this product. I've found that anytime a person gives a negative review, there are a lot of people who vote that my reviews are not useful. I don't understand this mentality. I gave my opinion.  You don't have to agree with me, but you can just kindly move on and not blemish my review history with a negative vote.
