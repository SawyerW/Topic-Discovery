We got an amazing deal on this top notch baby monitor and it's amazing! Thankfully, I have my bedroom back and I don't have to worry about our son! We can see him, hear him, record him, take photos, and talk to him, all with a device small enough to go in one hand! It switches automatically from color to black and white depending on the amount of light in the room and it's easy to see him, day or night. We've taken the monitor all over the house to watch and it easily allows us to see him with no interference downstairs when he is upstairs and even out to our mailbox. The advertised distance is 400 feet and while we haven't tested that, it works for us everywhere we have gone! It's been about a month and he's sleeping through the night and my wife and I can sleep peacefully knowing we will be alerted anytime anything is wrong! This product is awesome!
