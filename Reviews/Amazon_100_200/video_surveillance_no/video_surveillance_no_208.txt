Let me start by acknowledging Amazon for providing such a deal on the sensor. The manufacturer sells this sensor at $90. I was able to add three additional sensors (radar, tilt, glass) to my system for the price of one.I added this to my Python 872 security system. After 20 minutes of testing the sensitivity levels, I set it up just as I wanted: I have it so it will warn when standing right next to the vehicle, and it will only arm if someone enters the car (I had the window rolled down while testing for the full alarm trigger). Adds a much welcomed ability to my Security/Remote Start System. Bam.
