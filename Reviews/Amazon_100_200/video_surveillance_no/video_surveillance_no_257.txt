The sound is good, but it's even better when you have an ear plug in the other ear. also back ground noise is picked up on these mics very easily... The PTT (push to talk buttons) wear out quickly and need replacing after about 15-30 hours of usage. I do event security and club security. These Mics and ear pieces help out, but this brand can't keep up with the rigor and frequency of use. I am constantly having to order replacements. Until, i found that there is a HEAVY DUTY off brand. I am excited to not  waste money any more!
