I am begrudgingly writing this review as I was at first a very enthusiastic customer. We were in need of a baby monitoring system that allowed for multiple viewings (we have three children) and could handle long ranges. The product fit the bill and initially performed great. Until...the charging piece in the monitor kept breaking off effectively making it useless since it could no longer charge on the docking station. We are now onto our fourth replacement monitor as we have invested a lot of money into the systems and cameras amongst our multiple residences.The latest interaction with Lorex has left me incredibly frustrated and disappointed. The customer service department is abysmal. Upon returning two broken monitors at our cost, they not only claimed never to receive them (two separate times - thank goodness for FedEx confirmation #) but they only mailed one replacement, not two. After calling and speaking to the apparent head of customer service (Joe Lee) he then accused us of lying and promised to investigate and call back which he never did.BOTTOM LINE - FAULTY PRODUCT, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT!!
