This camera has some very positive attributes, but is let down by it's performance somewhat.Pro's:Very sturdy caseeasy to mount with a quality strapEasy to get pointing to the right placeGreat battery lifeReally easy to useCon's:Takes to long to fireLow light picture quality is very poorTon's of false positives (pictures of nothing) on high sensitivity, but misses what it should capture on low.I bought it to get pictures of the deer that have been pillaging our garden, it was up in various (hot spot) locations for several weeks before taking good pictures.I don't have a plethora of different trail cams to compare it against, but I do feel it needs more technology in it. For example, it should pre-focus when setup (it's a static camera, so shouldn't need to focus for each shot). That would improve fire time.The sensitivity should be either adjustable on a dial (rather than just 3 settings), or automatic. Generally if the environment is monitored for a few minutes, it's not difficult to adjust sensitivity to a little over the environment (branches swaying in the wind etc).It's ok, but I'll try a different one next time.
