Video quality with this unit is quite nice in the daytime (the nighttime / nightvision mode isn't all it's cracked up to be, but somewhat cool nonetheless).Depending on what your needs are this system seems to offer something for everyone.You can view your content from your iphone (very cool) and if you set this up at home, even better, you can find out who's at the door prior to getting the door).If you have kids this is even more important, you can train them to look at the video monitor prior to opening the door (if your kids seem to like opening the door when expecting someone).It's also useful if you're in the kitchen with messy hands, and family is over, so you can just yell at em' to come in without having to wash up prior to going to the door.The main con is you have to pay for the software, it's 79$ a year, and that's somewhat disappointing, but for the piece of mind, ease of use and installation (thought it'd take much longer to setup!) this package is well worth it.
