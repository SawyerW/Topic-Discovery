VOX (sound turns on video and speaker on receiver) was not working on the first one. Got another one and now VOX is working with one of my two cameras but not the other.I really like this thing and so I'll just buy yet another camera.Love that the cameras are portable so that I can put one wherever I need it regardless of a power outlet being there. Cameras are small, have infinite adjustability for quick placement and work great even in total darkness.Receiver too is completely portable and only the size of a small cell phone. Picture quality is superb. If Lorex had better quality control this would be a solid 5 stars for me.
