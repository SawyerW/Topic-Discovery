This is my first bad review for anything.  This works well as long as you do not rely on battery power much.  That was not the issue for us.  I am about to get my 4th handheld monitor in less than 2 years.  The charging port on every single one breaks off inside the unit.  Customer Service is awful.  If I had not already become invested in several cameras I wouldn't even bother and would start over with another system. This fourth unit on its way I am considering opening up and adding some superglue.  If you do get one, at least have an audio monitor on hand if needed.  This thing inevitably breaks in the evening forcing you through a night of no method of monitoring your baby.
