I live in an apartment and have a crazy neighbor that keeps keying my car. I bought this to deter her and to catch her if she does it again. I will say it works great and was easy to set up. I don't use the night vision since the camera is on the inside looking over the parking lot but it records very well and still catches the movement. I just had to up the movement senseitivity but it catches movement very well. The higher the sensitivity the more it records. I am very satisfied with this camera and it helps protect my property.
