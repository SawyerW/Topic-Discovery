Overall easy to setup;Good range, the camera is on the second floor and we get good signal, even downstairs;Decent picture quality;Good night-vision;Lots of audio interference, likely because of our wireless internet network, cordless phones, etc... If you have those at home, beware... You may want to find a system that operates at a different frequency (DECT for example) than this system (2.4Ghz).VOX does NOT work: the manufacturer advertises that with VOX set on the highest settings, the system should remain in standby and turn on only when a loud noise is detected in the room. This is not the case: even in a completely quiet room, with all doors and windows closed, the system goes into standby, but immediately comes back on. This happens even when the POWER SAVE mode is OFF. Customer service has no remedy for this, so don't even bother calling, you'll just be wasting your time.In summary, this is not the perfect video baby monitor (frankly I don't think there is any out there); it has some good features, so if you can deal with the audio interferences and don't need the VOX function, go ahead and purchase it.
