Exceptional video quality compared to the top of the line Q-See system I replaced.  The only real draw back is in the software.  Unlike other security systems, you cant control playback like a VCR.  So to find a particular event you cant simply scan backwards to the event.  You have to go one by one through the saved clips individually.  This is a huge pain in the butt!!!!  However the video quality, and overall camera quality is such that its still a great buy.  If only logitech would correct the software, so searching the recordings is more on par with other systems.
