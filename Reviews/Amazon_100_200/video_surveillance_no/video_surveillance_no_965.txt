This camera is super easy to set up and use! The motion detection is sensitive enough to turn on when there is a person in view, but not so sensitive you have recorded video of squirrels, which is good.  The picture is clear outside during the day, but a little less clear at night (even with lights on the area you're recording).  I also got the expansion camera and it works just as well and easily with both cameras-it didn't slow down my computer and the audio recording takes up minimal space on the hard drive.  Overall, a good product-the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it is on the higher end price wise (Especially b/c you only get one camera with the system purchase).
