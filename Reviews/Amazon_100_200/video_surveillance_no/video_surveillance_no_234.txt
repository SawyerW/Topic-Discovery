One of the best headsets I have used. I do sound for a lot of productions/shows and this product helps me stay in contact with the rest of the crew. And it looks awesome too. I love the fact that the ear piece allows me to actually hear through my ear because it is a hollow tube. Other headsets are really uncomfortable and hurt, not to mention they block out all the sound in one ear. The ear piece is very comfortable and stays in my ear. The sound quality is very clear when it comes to voices. The mic is also pretty good it does the job well.I would like to clarify some misconceptions. The mic is meant to be clipped on the collar or somewhere close to the mouth. It is not meant to be run down the sleeve.
