one thing that drives me crazy is this thing DESTROYS my wifi in the house, like barely usable on any of the 11 channels. On my laptop I can at least use 5.8ghz but 2.4ghz is slowed down to a crawl. I'd imagine this would affect 2.4ghz phones if I had any.I like that the handset battery is a fairly common cell phone battery available for < $10 on ebaynight vision works very well, camera is clear and sound is good. At first I was disappointed with the build quality, but I was comparing it to a blackberry or iphone that costs 5x as much. I've dropped the handset a number of times, it still works 100% so I have no complaints.The photo taking is of questionable value. I use the exif date on photos for keeping track of when it was taken, but this device does not write a date (it doesn't even have a date set in it)the photos are quite low quality.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product but I would make sure to mention the above concerns to anyone looking to purchase one
