This item was terrible. The window alarms are rather useless as they either make a very loud chiming sound or a mediocre volume alarm. Their main flaw is that the intruder can immediately silence the alarm by either breaking this small device or TURNING A SWITCH. There is no passcode for the window units. The door unit is even worse. The device doesn't want to accept the passcode sometimes. Sometimes it simply flashes a red light when the door is opened, even though the alarm is on "home" mode (which means the alarm should immediately sound when the door is opened). All of this basically means that I do not trust the alarm and I am so annoyed with it, I am sure I will not use it. I cannot even return the thing since it comes in one of those plastic molded containers that force you to mutilate the package to get to the product. Thanks amazon!
