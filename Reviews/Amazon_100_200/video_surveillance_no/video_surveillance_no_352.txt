Hi, I had been a long user of DLink 5300W Wireless network camera for about 4 years,it was a pain in installing and wirelessly setting up that one, that camera just gave up like a month ago. 500 bucks down the toilet.After reading a lots of reviews from many sites, finally decided to try this one, amazon had a great deal about 2 weeks ago, bougth itthen and voila, it was just great, a clearer image, easy setup and intuitive web interface, quickly connected to wireless, no signal losses or no interference. Wow.It's been 2 weeks I have been using it and to tell you the truth, I am loving it everyday, just placed an ortder for another one on ebay.The Pan & tilt is little shorter than my DLink, but I can live with that. Recording software comes with the Camera is just too good. Breeze to set up.I would say go for it. (I can tell after 4 years of experience with similar other cameras).
