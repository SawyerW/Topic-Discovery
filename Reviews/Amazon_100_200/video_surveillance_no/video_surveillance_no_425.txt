I purchased two of these camera's from Amazon and thought I'd get a good deal and two great camera's considering the deal.  Before I even got in the woods it stopped working on me.  The second one I put out on my club in Georgia and came back 30 days later and it took 40 photo's and just stopped working.  I tried new batteries and to no avail.  The return was quick on the first camera, but now I gotta send the other one back!!!  Primos should really be checking these items before ole WILLARD puts his name on it.  I am slowly not using Primos products anymore.  Do not buy this camera!!!
