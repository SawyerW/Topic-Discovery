I purchased this as a replacement to an old one that lasted a little over 5 years.  When I received this one the receiver is not working.  Luckily I was able to pair it with the old one that I had.  The old one I had wore out the sensor so when I matched up the old receiver and the new sensor it worked just fine.  Otherwise it would not have been worth the money to return it and get another set.  I really loved this Driveway patrol but not sure if I wanted to purchase it from the same place again.  I use this outdoors to signal me when someone is coming in to my property --- people, cats, dogs...etc. --- day or night.  Paired with my outdoor camera, it is the perfect security solution for people who is home a lot.  I can tell whether to come to my door or not before they even ring the bell  :-)
