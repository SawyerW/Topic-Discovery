I thought I just got a bad monitor but after the third time it happened the metal female adapter for the power plug in at the bottom of the monitor broke off Inside the monitor shortly after receiving the product. Result? The monitor is unable to be charged And the unit becomes a paperweight. I believe it has everything to do with the upright charger monitor holder that ships with the monitor and how it fits into the monitor. It is Engineered too tight. With that said if you just Use a separate mini USB cable you should be fine.  Although I like the unit when it works especially the four camera in one display, the frustration of buying new and sending back is leaving me with giving it only a two star. With that said the 2-3 times I've had to return I've had no problem with either Amazon or Lorax
