We have owned this for a little over a year now. I bought when we found out we were expecting our second child. Buying a system with 2 cameras was cheaper than buying a second camera, at the time. It seems rather cheaply made. The SD card/taking pictures feature is a joke, and I have yet to figure out to delete the pictures the camera manages to take on its own at random. It does not always turn on when the baby makes a noise, most generally I hear the baby before the monitor kicks on, therefore the VOX doesn't work. All parts seem to be pretty cheaply made, the camera, the monitor cradle, and at times the buttons on the monitor just don't work. It is nice from time to time to be able to just peek in on the kids, but its not really proved to be worth its money.
