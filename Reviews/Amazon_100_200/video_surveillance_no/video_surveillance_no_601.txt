Ok...so let me start out by saying that I NEVER write reviews for products that I purchase, but I couldn't let this one slide. We have had nothing but problems from this monitor. First, the screen goes completely white and we can't see our babies, which completely defeats the purpose of having a video monitor. Second, the monitor makes a horrible cricket-like sound, which makes it darn near impossible to sleep. Third and most recently, the internal USB on the monitor has broken, so the unit won't charge (not that it would ever hold a charge for very long anyway). I've contacted customer service, but like many others on here, have heard nothing back from them. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a video monitor.
