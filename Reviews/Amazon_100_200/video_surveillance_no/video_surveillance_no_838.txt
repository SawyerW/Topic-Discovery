After 26 months with this system, my experience is as follows:Pros:Good picture qualityEasy set upCompatible with IOS and AndroidCons:Incompatible with Windows PhoneSlow smartphone startup.  Improved somewhat from with a software update, but still too slow to use to check for who is at the door, even if the app is already running on the phone.Unreliable: This is the killer.  A few months ago, the camera bridge unit had to be replaced after a power outage.  Logitech replaced it, after about 2 hours of effort with tech support.  The same thing happened again, and now it is out of warranty, so no replacement.  No other electronics in the home were damaged, so it is NOT any kind of power surge.In summary, this is far too expensive for this kind of reliability issue.DO NOT BUY IT!!!!
