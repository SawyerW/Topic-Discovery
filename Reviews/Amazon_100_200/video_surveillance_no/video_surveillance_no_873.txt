Bought this a few days ago.  Might want to understand BEFORE you buy it that the website has problems streaming (gives comm errors) - still waiting on Logitech to respond.  Also, they say you can view it on Android/Blackberry and IPhone.  While I can't verify IPhone because I do not have one, I can tell you that Blackberry says "Coming soon" and the android app isn't available either.  It seems that they released this product before it was ready.  I also don't understand why they won't support Windows Mobile as the software is written in C# (so I may have to undertake this myself) as Windows Mobile is still very much alive (HD2)the camera itself works great - plug it in and it just worked.  Video quality is good but it definitely has a "fishbowl" affect.  Compared to the cisco network camera I had bought (and returned), it is much easier to set up and a much clearer picture.
