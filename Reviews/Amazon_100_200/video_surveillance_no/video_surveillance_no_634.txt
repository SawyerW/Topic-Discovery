We tried a variety of different baby video monitors over the last few years and finally ended up using one made by Sharx (it was actually a security camera but looked like the other baby video monitors). The video was pretty good, but the audio was always staticky so we had to use a separate audio monitor. We now have 2 kids so we wanted to buy another video monitor and I could no longer find the Sharx one. I read the reviews of this monitor so thought we'd try it out since I knew I could easily return it if it didn't work. To my surprise, it works very well! The video *and* the audio are very clear! The camera base does seem a little chinsy but considering the quality of the video and audio, I don't care. The only thing we miss is the ability to move the camera side-to-side and up-down from the parent remote, which we can do on our Sharx one. If you're looking for a reliable video/audio monitor, we highly recommend this one. Our house is 3400 sq ft and the reception is great no matter where we are in the house.
