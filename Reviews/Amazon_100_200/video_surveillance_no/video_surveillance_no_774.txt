Wanted to get a nice security camera system for our beach house covering inside and out. After a bit of research, I settled on these babies. Very easy to setup and the features are top notch. I love that I can see live video from any place in the world with my computer or phone and the SMS and email alerts are great for knowing when something is happening. My only complaint is i with the video was true HD, 1080, not 720, but otherwise, the quality if really great. Night vision is brilliant. This is a pricey option but I think it is worth it.
