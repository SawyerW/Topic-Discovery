This alarm system was perfect for our needs.  We decided to use the window alarms on our sliding door and door to our garage, as I felt I wanted the doors secured most.  They work perfectly there.  Also, our bedroom is downstairs but the kids are upstairs, so I always worried that I wouldn't hear an intruder come in and go up.  There is no missing the sound of this alarm!  If it doesn't instantly scare someone away (which I think it would), it will at least alert us that someone has broken in.  I also use the chime system during the day which is perfect w/ two toddlers so I'll always know if someone has opened a door.
