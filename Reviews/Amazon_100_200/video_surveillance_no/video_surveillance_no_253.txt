I bought these for hunting. They are much better then the ones that come with the radios, but you have to talk up in these mics in order to be heard. Not something you want to do on a hunting trip. My wife saw a heard of Elk about 100 yards form her and she tried to get my attention. I could hear her saying something, but I could not make out one word. I will keep them for when I am working around the property. They work great for that kind of project, but I will not be taking them hunting again.
