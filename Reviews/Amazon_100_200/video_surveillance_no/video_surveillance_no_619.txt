I had high hopes for this monitor.  I read all the reviews and this one seemed to be the best compromise of features, quality and price.I was very dissapointed for two reasons!The "VOX" or noise activated video feature did not work.  When "VOX" was turned on the video would just cycle on and off reguardless of the level of sound in the room or the other settings.However, my biggest issue was the interference from the hand held unit!! Unbelievable!! When the video was on it would make terrible noises and even in enery saving mode with the video off the high pitched squeal is sending this unit right back to Amazon!!!Others may have had sucess but sadly our search goes on.
