Very simple, its either on or off.  Some of these can be so complicated you risk not getting squat cuz it was off.  I like that you can check the memory card while mounted without having to take it down.  Again, my brother has a very expensive unit (about twice this) that must be taken down because the chip is accessed through the back, not the front like this one.Pictures are what I expected day or night, good value.  I haven't tried video yet.If there is a con, I wish it let you take pictures and video with a combo button.  This unit forces you to pick EITHER pictures or video.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5.For the price, great value and I'll probably buy another one.
