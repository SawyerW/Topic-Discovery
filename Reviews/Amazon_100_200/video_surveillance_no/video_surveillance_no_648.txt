This is a GREAT little gift item for the new moms out there - a wireless audio and video "system" to watch & monitor baby. Video camera is tiny & very light, easily mountable on a wall or simply set on a nearby shelf. System has a cool infrared feature so baby may be seen sleeping away in the dark without being disturbed (no bright light shining on their little faces). One can program the system to "wake up" from stand-by mode when baby moves or makes noises, to preserve battery life. Their is even an internal camera, with memory card, that can take pictures when baby does something remarkably "cute" when nobodys looking! Mom can now take that well deserved bubble bath in complete peace,knowing baby is safe and sound sawing logs in the crib next door....
