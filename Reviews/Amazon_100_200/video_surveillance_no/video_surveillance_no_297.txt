I've purchased this item for both home and office use, and it works great!  We use it at home for the back door leading out to the pool area, and it's a great extra line of defense to keep the kids safe.  I've also used it as an alert entry at a medical office to let us know when patients arrive.  Since you can plug the receiver in wherever is most convenient, we are able to keep it in a back area where we can back up the front desk staff in case they are away or busy.  Great instructions, only wish it would come with some double stick tape for mounting, but that's easy enough to find.
