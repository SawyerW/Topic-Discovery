We love to have a camcorder mounted in our truck to use on trips or when needed, I have made some homemade ones myself out of sponges, duct tape & so on but none of them were as strong & simple to mount as the  Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction-Cup Mount, I mounted ours on the back window of my single cab pickup..... I added a image of it if you would like to view it...... & it works out just fine. All I have to do now is to figure out a way to have the wife keep the windshield clean.
