TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK!!! GOOD THING I ONLY PAID 16 DOLLARS FOR IT. WAY WAY TOO MANY FALSE ALARMS!!! IT DROVE MY WIFE CRAZY, SHE WANTED TO SMASH IT. I WILL BE THROWING IT AWAY.  I EVEN PUT IT INSIDE THE GARAGE(NO MOVEMENT AT ALL) AND IT STILL SETS OFF FALSE ALARMS. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I UPGRADED TO A HEATH ZENETH MOTION SENSOR FOR 40 DOLLARS FROM HOME DEPOT AND IT IS AWESOME, WORTH EVERY PENNY. IT PLUGS INTO A LAMP AND HAS A VOLUME CONTROL AND A RANGE CONTROL.  SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS.
