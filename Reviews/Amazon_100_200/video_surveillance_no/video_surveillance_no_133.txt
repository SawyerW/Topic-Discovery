I use this mount for either a digital camera or a pocket camcorder to video my AutoX runs.  Works great, never had it fall off.  You just have to be picky where you place it, needs to be glossy and clean to make sure it holds tight when your doing 70-80mph's.  I am going to make a tether system tho so if it does come undone it wont get run over or get lost on the track somewhere.  It does shake some when its attached to bumpers and such, but thats to be expected.  Great product, lots of my friends use them as well.
