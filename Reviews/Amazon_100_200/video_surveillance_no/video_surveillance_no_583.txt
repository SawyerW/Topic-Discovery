This product I would NOT recommend if you are looking for a high quality monitor.  We purchased this item in December 2011 and its already broken and beyond repair.  The actual monitor, some of the screws and pieces inside came out, and completely broke.  The mechanism inside the actual monitor that charges the monitor broke loose and came completey out.  No idea how since we are always very careful with the monitor as they are not cheap.  The charging dock is very flimsy, and the picture quality could be a lot better for the price. We will NOT buy Lorex again, very disappointed and now get to spend more money on a new monitor after only 7 months.  Please be careful when purchasing this monitor!
