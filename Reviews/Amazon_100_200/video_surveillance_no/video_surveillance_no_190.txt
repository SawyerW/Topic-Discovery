i like the window units a lot. the keypad unit is not a motion sensor but rather a magnet contact type like the window alarms. i would have prefered the keypad to be a motion sensing alarm so that it can be placed in my hallway and not be limited to being installed on the door or door post.sound is not soft but not too loud either. its loud enough to work as a deterent and to alert home owners. over all this is a pretty good value and should be used as an additional layer of security to other security elements like locks etc.
