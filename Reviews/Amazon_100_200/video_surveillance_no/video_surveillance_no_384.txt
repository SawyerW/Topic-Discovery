I bought this camera and it worked great for 6-8 months until the warranty ran out after a year. The card reader quit working and it reads every card full. I called Primos and they won't fix or replace the camera but would gladly sell me another at a discount which was exactly what I paid for the camera on sale from Academy. I can only recommend that noone buy these products as they will not stand behind them when they malfunction. Like an idiot I purchased another one thinking I just got a bad one the first time. Well, I got a bad one the second time also. When you call they say its out of warranty and they'll sell you another one at a discounted rate. What a bunch of crap. Be smarter than me and invest in decent cameras from reputable makers.
