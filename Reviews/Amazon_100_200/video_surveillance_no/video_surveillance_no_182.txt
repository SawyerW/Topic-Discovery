As many people have mentioned they don't communicate with each other.  So, yes, punching the code in does not disable the window alarms, but what do you expect at this price point.The door alarm is loud, deafening loud.  The windows units are easily defeatable because there is a switch on the exterior of the unit to shut the alarm off.  But it will still sound itself off before someone can defeat it and that is if they know that it has an exterior switch.it is an absolute must for an apartment complex which doesn't allow the more expensive wiring for 24 hour monitoring.
