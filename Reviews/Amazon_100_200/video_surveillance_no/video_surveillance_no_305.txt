At the price I was not sure if this unit would work very well. Have never tried a wireless chime alert so I was not sure what to expect. Purchased the unit for some commercial rental property where the renters asked for a door chime to alert them when someone entered the lobby area. The base unit is located in the hallway behind a secondary door about 35 feet from the door sensors. It has settings for 2-3 different tones and they are quite loud (volume is adjustable). The unit has only been installed for a month now but have been quite pleased with it for my expectations and would recommend the unit. Did not give 5 stars because I have not been able to test the longevity of the unit but no real complaints so far.The only negative I can see so far is that the door sensor unit is a tad big so some folks might not like it on their front door. I think it was maybe 2"x 3" because it takes a camera type cylindrical battery while the far end unit plugs into an AC receptacle.
