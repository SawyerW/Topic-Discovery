I got these to replace the headset that came with the radio, so that we could better communicate while riding our motorcycles. We tried them out in the house and immediately put them back in the box. They were uncomfortable for me to wear (though my partner didn't seem to mind) and the clarity was terrible.The description doesn't tell you that the mic is actually on the same piece as the PTT button, and unless you are holding it in just the right place when you talk all you get on the other end is whisper on open air.I bought them on the strength of the reviewer who claimed to take them on ATV's but on our motorcycles we use full face helmets, no way could we use these.Probably these are ok if you are using them somewhere quiet, and don't want to look so much like a pop star, but otherwise these are worse than no headset.
