I use this on my backyard next to my designated parking space to catch whats going on [there's was a break-in on our neighbors car before]  but notice that there's a lot of misses [picture] even during the day you would see a car,a person or a cat just all of a sudden appear and  sometimes you'll see it every movement made on the same spot. I read the manual and checked online of any possible setup but still the same. I have not  use the video yet. The battery Duracell Coppertop D Batteries 8 Count i bought October 2012 here at amazon and i started using it May 29-2013 is 60% 2 months and 8 days of use and still works.
