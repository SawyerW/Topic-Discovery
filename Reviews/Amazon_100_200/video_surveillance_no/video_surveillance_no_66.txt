This stopper will only work on a door with no gap between the bottom of the door and a bare floor.  I have two outside doors, each with weatherstripping and sills which close this gap.  Why would I want cold air, bugs and dust coming in from under my doors?  I don't and therefore there is no gap and no room for this jammer to fit.  And, I don't remember being in a hotel room that doesn't have a pretty solid latch, which I think would do a better job of keeping out intruders when I'm in the room (obviously, it can't be put in place when you leave the room).  So, if you have a house with gaps under your doors, this might work--except on the door you use to leave the house.
