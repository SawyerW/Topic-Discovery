I've had this in the woods for several weeks now and it is currently recording on video. The videos are a good quality. I've tried the still pictures as well with good results. I have the sensitivity set on high so I am getting videos of fox and raccoons as well as deer and what ever else passes by. I have this setup watching a waterhole so it is well used on my property. I did camo paint the unit and it blends in with the surroundings better now. I camo all my cameras if they come in black. The "D" cell batteries are not my favorite because of the size of the unit to accommodate them, but it still is reading 70% power after constant use during this trial period. I recommend this unit as it is a great value for the price. I'll purchase more in the future as I always keep several cameras going year round.
