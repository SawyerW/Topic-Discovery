the actual alarm part of it is UNBELIEVABLY loud.  like so loud that your ears are ringing for minutes after you get it off.  originally bought as added protecting in our apartment - after realizing that maintenance wouldn't be able to get in without setting it off, took it off the door and took the batteries out fearing it would go off in the closet.  one day when we have a house it will work well (no maintenence guys) but until then it will be in storage.  the window ones we use on the doors when we're away for long periods of times.  still loud but not like the alarm one.
