This little door stop siren does go ON when pressed, but then it goes right off if you back the door off it.  I would prefer a 30 second delay so that it stays on if someone pushes the door open, to scare them away, even if they pull the door closed again.Note there is also an off switch, so that you can turn the unit off anytime...which also keeps it from making noise while you are carrying it in your suitcase.Another small improvement would be to make the screw that holds the battery door cover a captive screw.  It's actually not critical but is a simple improvement.For a few bucks, its worth the price.  Note it needs 1 9V battery...and says that should last a year.  I suggest you remove the battery if you are not going to use the door stopper for weeks or months, since that will prevent leakage and make it last for many many years.
