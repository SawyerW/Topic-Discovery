I really wanted to like this monitor. We had the summer infant one but i really wanted something wireless so that I could watch the baby whether he was in his crib, his bouncy, his swing etc. The Lorex was a disappointment though. First of all, the picture quality is extremely poor compared to other monitors. It is not even close. What's worse is that it is not easily positionable. It is very hard and often not possible to angle the thing to actually see your baby!Even if you manage to bend it to a good angle (rare) you can't maneuver it from the handheld piece like you can on other monitors. It really is very poorly designed. One almost wonders if the makers ever even tried the thing. I returned it. It's a pain to keep moving my plug in monitor around, but at least I can actually see the babY!
