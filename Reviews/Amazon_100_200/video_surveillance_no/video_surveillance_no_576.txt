We have owned this monitor for a year now.  Our Summer Infant video monitor mysteriously went missing at the hands of our 1YO and we needed to replace it.  For the price, this is an excellent deal.  We have a camera in our two boys' room and one in our baby daughter's.  I love that we can switch between both cameras.  I also love the "talk back" feature as well as the ability to unplug the camera and move it to a different room without plugging it back in for a while, features our old unit did not have.  While I can hear the sound well and can see the picture, it doesn't have the best picture quality.  Also, our one camera has more sound feedback than the other, you can tell just from the background noise which room it's currently on.  The handheld unit is also made of cheap plastic.  I dropped it once and it's rattled ever since.  But we have it a year and it's still going strong!
