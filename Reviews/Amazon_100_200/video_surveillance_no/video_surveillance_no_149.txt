These alarms are advertised to be 120 dB, which is in the range of a jet engine.  However, it was difficult to hear the alarm from two rooms over, and it would definitely not wake me out of bed.  I noticed that there was some controversy over the loudness of the alarm in previous reviews.  So I measured the loudness objectively with a SPL meter.  Three feet directly in front of the alarm, the sound level was 92 dB.  Three feet off to the side of the alarm, the sound level was 86 dB.  So optimistically, the alarm is 28 dB lower than advertised.  10^2.8 = 631, so the alarm is 631 times less loud (in terms of energy) than advertised.  92 dB is about the sound of a truck from 10 meters away, as opposed to the sound of a jet engine.
