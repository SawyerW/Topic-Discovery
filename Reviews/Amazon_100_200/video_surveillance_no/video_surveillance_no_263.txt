Bought these in hopes of using them for skiing.While significantly more comfortable than what came with our radios, the amount of wire is overwhelming.  Once you stuff all the extra wire in your pocket with the radio or inside your jacket you effectively have three wires protruding from your jacket.  (Two to the microphone and one to your headset.)The need to wire this to your jacket to make it usable and the want to take the jacket off and put it back on compounds the frustration level.The microphone pickup was much worse than what cam with our radios and required being directly in front of our mouth while speaking.  (Bending/straining neck to talk into it while attempting to push the button and not pull it off the jacket was not effective either.)I suspect there is a correct way to wire this up that doesn't include a ski jacket, and the mic pickup may function better indoors, but I am back to using the hard over ear piece with a fixed microphone and single wire with inline button.
