I use it for an older child.  Love it so far just hope it holds up under alot of use.  Works well picture is great and sound works well, there is sometimes a very low background noise but there is no major interference.  Highly recommend!  I researched for a long time and all the ones I found online had terrible reviews and were higher priced.  At $100 I am very pleased with my purchase!  I even bought and extra camera.  I love the fact I can talk through it because when she is acting up I can talk to her through it.
