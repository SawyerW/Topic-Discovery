For a reasonable (read cheap) price, this is just what I needed!We wanted to know if visitors, or more importantly the UPS or FedEx truck, was entering our driveway.Since our driveway is far from the house, it is nice to know in advance if someone is on their way up.This product really works and I recommend it to anyone on a budget.  Easy to use.Be sure to have extra batteries on hand all the time - just in case - extreme cold can and does zap the batteries - that is the only downside of ANY battery operated product that is outdoors.  Other than that, it is GREAT!
