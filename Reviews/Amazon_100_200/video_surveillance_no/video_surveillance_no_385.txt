Wish I would have known this prior to buying.While the LEDs are Infrared, they do glow visibly red briefly, as do another red and green LED near the lens that are used to determine movement.These are fine for game, I'm sure (though it's possible it may spook some), but not good as a dual purpose security camera.  For that, look at Primos Black Out trail cams, which claim they are completely dark (but roughly twice the price of this one).This camera is quiet, though.  But if you are placing the camera some place to monitor for people driving/walking onto your property, they could easily spot the camera and just take the memory card out of it.
