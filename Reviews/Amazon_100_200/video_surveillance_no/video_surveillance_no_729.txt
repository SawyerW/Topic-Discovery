This one doesn't have the IR led's and is pretty much good for any environment that has a good ambient light level. Not very good for super low light.Although I was able to mount it OK it, it is super difficult to mount this camera with the bracket attached as there isn't much room to fit a screwdriver. The pivot screws on the sides are super cheesy and easy to loose. If this was in an environment where there was vibration or wind I would be inclined to enhance the mounting bracket somehow. Also it doesn't adjust well without becoming loose.Those are minor complaints, so far so good and no buyers remorse. I would buy them again.
