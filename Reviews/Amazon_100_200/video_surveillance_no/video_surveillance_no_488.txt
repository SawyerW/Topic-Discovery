Have had my Primos Truth Cam 35 Camera since first week of Nov.  Watching the deer through photos both day and night.  Daytime videos turn out well but night time videos are black with just glowing eyes.  At first I wasn't pleased with the night photos either until I learned that (I use 'Shotwell' for loading pictures into pc) if I use the 'enhance' button and if need be adjust the lighting I get very nice night photos.  Unfortunately this does not work with the videos so due to the glowing eyes only and black background I only gave camera a 4 star rating.  Over all am pleased with it and would recommend one to anyone interested in field pictures.
