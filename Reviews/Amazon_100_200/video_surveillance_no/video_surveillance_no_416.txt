It says it's for outdoor use.  It also says (if you read the small print) that you are not supposed to open up the door when it is wet outside).  BUT you can't get the photo chip out unless you open up the door.  So, being very careful in the weather, we opened up the door to get the chip to check the pics but it didn't work after that.  I doubt it would have worked much more anyways.  I don't really believe it is water proof.  I was very disappointed.  I would look for a different camera if I were you, better than wasting your money on this one! :(
