I have a pretty robust home security system, but speaking as a person who also deals with home security systems for a living, there are drawbacks.  The fact that thieves will still break in knowing there's a window of time before authorities arrive being the main one.With that said, one important element in home security is giving the impression that you're home.Light timers are a great addition to the house, but the actual "feel" of someone being home comes from the impression that there is activity going on in the house.  What better activity than the most common at-home pastime?This device is incredible at giving the impression that a TV is on for a fraction of the cost of leaving your actual TV on.  It features a light sensor and timer so it's not always running and is a very compact and easy-to-store little unit.I can't recommend this device highly enough in terms of value and usefulness.  It's a must-buy for anyone who spends evenings away from home or just comes home after dark and would like a little peace of mind when they get in.
