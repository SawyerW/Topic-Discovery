Unit failed with a SD FUL error.  Appears to be a known issue with the unit based on investigation on the internet.  Formatted the SD Card and replaced it with another with the same SD FUL error..  Placed the SD card in another unit and the SD card worked without issue.  They indicated that they will replace under warranty, however I have to pay the shipping to send it to them and get it back +- $20.  And it appears that it could take months to get it back.  In my opinion I would be throwing the $20 away.  Last Primos product I will buy!
