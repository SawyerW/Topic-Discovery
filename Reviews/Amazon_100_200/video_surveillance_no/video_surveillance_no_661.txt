This is very effective, no one can go wrong in their purchase of this device. I went outside after dark to see the effects... it's exactly like someone is home viewing TV. It's especially effective if you plug FakeTV into a digital, timer like the Itermatic DT620CL where you can vary on's and off's of FakeTV activity. A winner! Make sure only the light of FakeTV or your actual TV set cannot be seen through any window. Don't choose to mimic a TV that people have normally been accustomed to seeing through a window, choose a TV that people have only been able to see the light from the TV set.
