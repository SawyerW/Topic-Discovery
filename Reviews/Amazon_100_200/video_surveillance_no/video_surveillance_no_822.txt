This is the second 700e that I have added to my home surveillance system.  Installation was simple and the camera was discovered immediately and the picture quality is great.  The package arrived on time and was factory sealed.  The only problem was that there was a missing part, the adapter plug that the camera power supply needs to plug into an AC outlet.  I called Logitech support and they promised to ship me the adapter.  It never arrived.  I went to Radio Shack and found a compatible adapter on a six foot extension cord for $10.  I'm disappointed in Logitech support.
