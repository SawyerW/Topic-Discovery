I bought this thing besides all the negative feedback.  For 20$ its much less than the 120$ driveway alarms.  the volume is a non issue;  If its too loud, put a piece of tape on it.  the false alarms can be 99% eliminated and fix the real issue--moisture!!  Put the sensor in a 10$ cedar bird house;  This keeps it from getting wet and keeps false alarms low.  And it hides it from people that would take and disable it.  Small animals and windy days can increase the false alarms.  okay for 20$, plus 10$ for the bird house (from Lowe's) and 2 cents in tape make a great buy.  The range is not 400ft more like 300ft and only one door.
