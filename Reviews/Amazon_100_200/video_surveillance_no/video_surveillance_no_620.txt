This product worked ok for 4 months. Then one day the battery wasn't charging. Called customer service , waited FOREVER for them to pick up then I get a dial tone. Called them a second time , spoked to a lady with a accent that I could barely understand. She made it seem after she asked multiple questions about the functionality of the unit that it would be replaced. Then she puts me on hold and comes back on a few minutes later and tells me it would take 7-10 business day to get the new monitor after fax them a copy of the bill . She also said I would have to return the old unit back, and then they would send me out another one. WHAT R THEY NUTS.  We buy baby monitors so we can watch our kids not so we can watch them 2 weeks from now. Do yourself a favor people , buy these products from Babies r us or Target where u can return them in a day if something goes wrong, I learned  the hard way.
