I'm a birder, photographer and my husband and I love scenery, travel and animals.We live in a condo.A lot of people said this is not for taking photos of birds.  Wrong!We have hummingbirds.  We set this device up.  As most photographers know, you have to take a lot of photos, and pick outyour best.  Yesterday after work, we took the memory card out, deleted the unwanted photos and a lot of photos of thehummingbirds showed up.Our condo is in the back which is the best.  You get to see more wildlife and have a great chance for photos.This camera does the work!
