Very thin jacket on cable.  Would NOT recommend using it outdoors or in area in contact with sunlight.  However on the plus side, it's a 100' run of cable for a low price.... ie... you get what you pay for.  It does successfully do it's job without any noticeable signal degradation.After 2.5 years, I have only had to repair the cable once and that was a section where the sleeve became brittle after being exposed to sunlight.  I give it maybe another 2 years before it become irreparable. When the time comes to replace this cable, I will pay more and get a higher quality cable in a thicker sleeve.
