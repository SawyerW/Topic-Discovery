I put this detector on a Viper 350Plus alarm. It is very simple to plug in the connector plug. I did install the alarm myself and that was not real simple. The detector works great but is a little weak back at the rear doors on my full size Ford cargo van. The unit is mounted on the ceiling 1 foot behind the front dome light. It functions great from the side doors forward when the van is empty, when van has lots of cargo the sensitivity is less. I have it set to max level on warning and full alarm adjustments when in my driveway and turn detector off with three presses of the alarm button when setting alarm in parking lots. It will sense anyone approaching any door with a window in it. It does not detect through the sheet metal body.
