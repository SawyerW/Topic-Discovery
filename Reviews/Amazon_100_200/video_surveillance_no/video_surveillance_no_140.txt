I am very impressed with the solid construction, design, and suction strength of the Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction Cup Mount.  The mount easily holds my Canon Elura 100 (13.1 oz), Canon SX20 IS (19.8 oz), and my Canon SD400 (4.59 oz).  When attached properly, the mount provides really stable video while driving and even more so if you use your devices optical/digital image stabilization if available. The mount is extremely solid and durable feeling.  The extension are can be obtained for free by calling the contact number on the Panavise website; customer service was extremely polite, and helpful.  I received the extension arm three days after calling, free of charge and shipping fees.Panavise 809 Camera Window Suction Cup Mount
