Nothing is more disapointing than a great idea that is poorley implemented.  In an erra of great digital cameras, marrying one to a moton detector and some storage seems like a wonderful idea. In this case there are a few good ideas outweighed by some severe limitations.ProsEasy setup and good battey life.ConsLow resolution in night mode (1.5 mb), slow response, limited depth of field and a shutter timer that seems to pick the worst possable time to activate the shutter.Video taken seems to be in some odball format that most Windows and Macs cannot deal with.I really wanted this to be a good solution for some security issues however that was not to be.
