Saw lots of good reviews on this camera, so I figured I would grab one and try it out. I also have a Moultrie I65R unit.  I currently have the Primos Truth Cam 35 set up in a site in South Texas. The field of view is in a narrow area, so I set the cam up close. When I set it back further, it senses cows, hogs, etc that are further in the background and are useless images for me.Image quality is set to high, and with an 8G SD card, that yields roughly 8,000 images. Usually in a week I'll get 600-1500, depending on traffic and there is an animal on every frame. It is important that there are no small branches or other moving obstacles that may "false trigger" the cam. Pictures are clear, clean and bright during the day, infrared images look great at night, no question as to what you are looking at. Battery life is great, This unit uses 4 D-cell batteries. With this camera taking pics 24/7, these 4 batteries yield about 4 weeks worth of life before the they need to be swapped.Definately worth every penny.
