This little unit is totally believable - bright light, dim, flickering, color.....everything you would "see" to tell you someone is home watching TV.  Plenty bright enough.  You just need to find the sweet spot.  It is perfect in my spare room since there is a moon window at the top that points towards the street, and another window with wooden blinds that you would walk by to the front door.  I dare anyone to second guess this.  Totally looks like someone is home and watching TV.  And having in the spare room, I never have to worry about it bothering me in my bedroom or any other room of the house.  Great for someone who works late, lives alone or has unpredictable hours....or just worries.
