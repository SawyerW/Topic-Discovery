Overall happy with this purchase, we'd had a summer video monitor prior but it had only one camera.  Our biggest complaint after converting from the summer system is that the monitor has no belt clip, or anything to keep it on you without putting it in your pocket, that wouldn't be a  problem except there's no lock button so if it's in your pocket the buttons tend to get pressed and best case waste the battery and worst case it hits the VOX button and then those outside sounds are being transmitted right into the baby's room.Also, we'd gotten used to the summer system of being able to physically move the monitor, but that's not possible with this system.  We weren't able to find any system that did all those things so this is probably still a good bet
