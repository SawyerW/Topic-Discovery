I rated Smart home Wireless Alarm System kit 4 stars because it is a good home alarm. This was easy to set up and use right away. We have the key pad alarm on the main door and the smaller window alarm one on the back door.Tip: make sure you switch to "away" before you leave the house because if you leave it on "home" it will set off the alarm as soon as you open the door. I've had that done a few times and my ears were seriously hurting. I have it on " home setting" at night.Overall, this is an inexpensive home alarm that works well and provides you with safer nights!
