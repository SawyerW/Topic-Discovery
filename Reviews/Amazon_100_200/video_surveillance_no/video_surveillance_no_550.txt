Ours worked great for the time span of 5 minutes when the video feed ceased unexpectedly. We didn't drop it or even touch it when it malfunctioned. My techno-smart husband attempted to see what was causing the issue but was unsuccessful. We called customer support and they walked us through easy set-up errors but they resolved that it was defective and to contact Amazon. So we sent it back to Amazon for refund. We are sad it didn't work, it was a good price, maybe too good? But to be safe we're going with another video baby monitor manufacturer. Thanks for the great customer support and customer service, Lorex & Amazon! I hope this product works for you, but since ours was 'defective' I can't recommend it.
