I bought a set of these last week after my elderly neighbor was broken into. After an afternoon of research, I decided on these since they were not permanently installed (apartment living), small, and relatively inexpensive. I wanted something that would make enough noise that it would alert me that there was a problem, but did not require a phone line for service since I only use a cell phone. They were very easy to install by myself and took about 15 minutes from start to finish, including testing and reading the instructions. I would suggest these to anyone that wanted an inexpensive alarm system for an apartment.
