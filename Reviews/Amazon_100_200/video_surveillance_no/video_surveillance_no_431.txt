I purchased this product for my driveway security. I went through great pains to protect it by encasing it in a marble structure that prevents tampering and impact from rain. It was  intended for limited, periodic attendance. At the beginning it worked very well for about 5 months. When I checked it though this winter, after 7 months, the camera was dead. Not because of the batteries (which had plenty of charge), but because moisture rusted the battery springs and other components. I tried to replace the springs, but it seems other components were affected as well and the circuits were impacted. The camera simply was not durable enough to withstand moist environments. It needs a dry, secure place... to operate. Having purchased it as an outdoors camera ... I was disappointed. For places, like Arizona it may be ideal. For places like Seattle, forget it.
