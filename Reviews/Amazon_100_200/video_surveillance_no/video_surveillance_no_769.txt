Extremely easy to hook up, and very pleased with that.  In addition, software worked well with Windows Vista and 7 Professional. I originally gave it three stars owing to horrible mobile apps, but these have since been updated, and are working great.We wanted the camera to tell us who is outside of the front gate. The concept was as follows: doorbell goes off, and then check the app on the phone to see if we need to get up or just let the postman drop the package off. Works great for that since the app updates.CONS:1) Lack of ability to store on a network drive - Why not?  We have an Apple time capsule, and the only way to get it on there is if I were to sync the otherwise retired Vista laptop that currently downloads the files to the TC. Lame.2) The website does not allow logging into the website with a mobile browser. So if you are thinking of just skipping the app and using a mobile browser (as you would have to with the Kindle Fire for which there is no app), you are out of luck!
