I purchased enough door and window alarms to arm my entire ranch house. Arranged to have my handyman come over to install the system. We opened everything, installed batteries, etc. When it was time to mount the units he discovered that with my type windows (old with aluminum frames), there is no way they will work. My house is not unique. In my area all the houses were built this way. No where on the packaging did it stipulate what type of windows you could use the product on. We brainstormed everything we could think of but they just don't work. I'm sure it's a nice product if you can use it. I just wish the company would tell you certain types of windows aren't able to accomodate the units.
