We bought this monitor because had everything we were looking for... color picture, night vision, secure, low wi-fi interference, expandable, voice recognition sound, etc.  Almost all of those features work correctly.  The voice recognition does not work on our unit.  It constantly turns on and off instead of only turning on when there is a sound.  We don't mind since we still use the Sony Baby Call monitor for this purpose... as a side note, we absolutely love the Sony monitor and have used it for over 2 years with no problem but wanted to upgrade to video the second time around.  Customer service told us that we simply have a faulty unit which seems to happen to quite a few people concerning one feature or another.  We decided to keep it, instead of having them send a new one, because we knew we could make due without this feature and didn't want to risk getting another one with something else wrong.  Even with this small problem, we have definitely been happy with it in every other way and would recommend it to others.
