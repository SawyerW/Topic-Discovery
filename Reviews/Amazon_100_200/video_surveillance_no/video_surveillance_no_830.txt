Excellent: All of the software, and the outdoor camera during the day. Great color display.Pretty good: The outdoor camera at night has good quality but short range.Poor: The fold out assembly directions assume you already know how to put everything together. There is one part shown in the display but never mentioned in the instructions.Awful: The outdoor camera at night with an added infrared floodlight. The range is excellent, but the camera can't adjust to the added brightness so all of the nearby images are blurred. Unless a burglar/vandal stands still for one second in front of the camera you will never be able to identify him (or her) at close range. All you will see is a moving blur.Request: Please, please Logitech, make the outdoor camera shutter speed adjustable.
