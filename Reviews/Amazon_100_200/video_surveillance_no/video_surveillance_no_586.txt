I purchase a live snap monitor.  It worked for a few months - then I had to send in the monitor because it broke.  It didn't break from any abuse - the part that plugged into the charger became loose.  I found out where to send it to and promptly sent it in (within a year) with a copy of the receipt.  It's been four months and I have hear NOTHING !  Not one word.  I've called and emailed and have not gotten any response.  I will never buy a Lorex product again knowing it will be such poor customer service.
