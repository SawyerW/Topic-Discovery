In order for this product to work well, you have to change the frequency using jumpers, and unless the chime and sensor are real close together, you have to relocate the red antenna that's located inside the chime to the outside of the enclosure, which requires some minor handiwork with a screwdriver. I now have it working on my detached garage entry door which is about 100 feet away from the chime, and the chime is inside a bedroom in the house. Without those 2 changes it would not work reliably but once you have it set up its a lot of ding-dong for very little bucks!
