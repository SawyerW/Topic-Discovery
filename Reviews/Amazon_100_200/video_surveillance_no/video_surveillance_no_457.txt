I bought this to see what kind of critter was digging a hole in our backyard.  The camera has a delay before it takes a picture, so quick moving stuff will trigger it, but not be caught on photo mode.  Video works better for stuff that moves in and out of the scene because once triggered (10 sec later, I believe), the critter may return.  Wouldn't leave in a place where it could get stolen, though.  You can buy big metal boxes with locks for these.  Needs SD card and 4 D batteries.  Night vision works pretty well.  It was a bird, by the way.
