I am truly glad I found this little mount.I have used it basically to attach a Canon SD750 (cigarette pack size camera) to the windshield, so that I can film my driving (the SD750 has a time lapse feature that I find very cool to record roads). I have used this on hot temperatures(above 37 C) and on non-paved roads and it has kept the camera on place. It's very simple to use, very sturdy and versatile -so you can use it in many different angles and situations-. I even used it on a boat window and it worked fantastically.I strongly recommend this mount to anyone interested in experimental filming. I have not tried a heavier camera so I can't comment on its weight capacity, but it is more than enough for my SD750.Enjoy!
