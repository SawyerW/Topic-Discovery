The 506T Audio sensor is an optional sensor i installed for added protection with my compustar alarm. It is used to detect the sound of breaking glass. It was installed in a Cadillac Escalade.The installation was straightforward but i did need to purchase a longer rca cable. I got one from radio shack. I mounted mine on the windshield behind the rear view mirror with the microphone facing the dashboard.The sensor is extremely accurate and can be adjusted to your liking. It can be tested by tapping keys on various windows outside of the car. When it can pick up the keys on the farthest window (usually the rear) you know it has been set properly.It has been working flawlessly for years and luckily no one has broken my windows (knock on wood).If you have an alarm that accepts optional sensors this is a no brainer.
