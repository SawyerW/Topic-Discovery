I've set up one window alarm and the front door alarm, but when I test by opening and closing the window and door, these alarms are not going off properly, most times they don't go off period, and it's quite frustrating. When I take them off the door and window, they chime or beep in my hand, but not at the place where they are suppose to chime and beep, the front door and the window! I've tried everything too, so that's not it. This thing is just not reliable, and I feel as though I've wasted my money. I was really hoping that this would work, and really like the keypad with code. Shame.
