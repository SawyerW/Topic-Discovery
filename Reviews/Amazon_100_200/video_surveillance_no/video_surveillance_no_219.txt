I bought this as an add on module to a Viper 3305V alarm that I installed in my sons convertible a Sebring.  We wanted protection from prying hands when the top was down and this unit fit for what we needed.  Installation instructions provided were pretty sparse on how to install and tune.  But there is enough info available on the web to fill the void.  Take your time tuning it and follow the correct sequence of setting the zones and it will wok perfectly for you.  We found it to work perfectly with our alarm system and had proper indications on the 2-way key fob.  The price is cheap when compared to what others are selling it for.  Buy it from Amazon and save $50.
