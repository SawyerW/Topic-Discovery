We bought this camera system and have used it for both of our kids. The picture isnt HD or anything, but its a good quality picture of your kids and the speaker system and communication system works great. We had one problem with the monitor in 2 years and sent it back to the company and they fixed it and after 3 years it finally died but it had been plugged in and on for 3 years. At that point we figured our kids did not need us to spy on them each night.We have recommended this to all our friends with kids. Many have bought other systems and been disappointed after looking at ours. Even the newer version of this product is not as good as this version.
