We had the same issue with the VOX setting that was mentioned by others but the really annoying thing was that after a year it stopped holding a charge.  Then a few weeks later it would no longer charge on the base without strapping a rubber band around it to keep in in place.  The last straw was last night when the metal socket inside the monitor simply broke off.  We have owned it for a little more than one year and of course the warranty is for one year.The monitor did work well while it worked.  I purchased it from Costco for about $180.  The night vision was great.  It also had great range.  I could do yard work around to house without ever losing signal.  We had the one with two cameras which turned out to be very useful.  I am tempted to go without a video monitor but I think we are hooked.  Hard to believe when we were kids our parents just did without these little gadgets we can't seem to live without.  I just wish it was built better.
