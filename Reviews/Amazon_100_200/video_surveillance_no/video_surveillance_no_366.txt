As many people have said, It is much difficult to make this camera to be seen from Internet when you don't know about the configuration of your Wireless router.If you're a normal person who know some about networks and computers, be sure that you will have to read the html manual which comes in the CD, and then, when your are working on setting up, to call to Panasonic support. Be patience, because finally you will reach the goal.When camera will be working you will realize that all efforts worth. I think this camera is the best network camera in the market (less than $300,00). I watch it from work, I can say that it have a very good image, a very few lags, a good pan and tilt, an outstanding microphone, and you have the chance to choose a free host other than Panasonic's. I've monitored with my camera from other computers (and networks), always I been able to make it work without any problem.If you have not even a moderate computing knowledge, then be sure to find someone who can help you on setting up internet conection.
