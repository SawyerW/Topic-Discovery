The set up of the Logitech 750e was very easy as long as you follow the basic steps and dont try to skip anything. It was pretty much plug and play setup and It included the inline Ethernet adapters so all you had to do was plug one into a wall socket near your router, plug it into the router, plug to other adapter into a wall socket someplace around where you would want surveillance, then plug the camera in.Put the setup disk in computer and install the desktop software. During this setup process it searches for your camera(s) on your network network, then you can see what your cameras see so you can adjust as needed.The camera itself is of very good quality and the field of view is wide. Each camera comes with a microSD card preinstalled so you don't have to save video to your computer. Yes you can save all video to your hard drive if you want.Everything was extremely easy to set up, (note) but as networks tend to be temperamental dont unplug anything while powered up unless you want to reboot everything to get the cameras back up.
