I own 7 or 8 trail cams and am over 75 minutes from my hunt club. Therefore I do not check my cameras every week and battery life is the single biggest concern I have. In this regard I have not had a better camera. I've had over 500 pics with more than 50% battery life left. It takes good 3mp quality pics. I'm not making 16x20 framed photos so I think it's silly to spend money to get the 8mp cameras. The first pic may take a couple of seconds to take so this is not the best for trail use, but I put my cameras over mineral licks here in middle Tennessee and this cam is fine for that. I love being able to leave a camera for 6 weeks. I set mine for 3 pics every 30 minutes so that helps conserve juice. The best $80 I've spent for a trail camera especially for an infrared flash.
