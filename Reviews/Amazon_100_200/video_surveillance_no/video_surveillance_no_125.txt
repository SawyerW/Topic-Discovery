This is actually the second one of these I have purchased and I can't be happier. The suction cup always has a nice solid hold on whatever surface you attach it to and the head is pretty configurable, especially with the extended arm. I could deduct a star for not including the extended arm but it's always just a phone call away.So far with these mounts I have managed to take several outside-of-the-car videos with the mount stuck to the roof and door of my car. The mount has never not stick to whatever surface I have applied it to and even with hard yanking it does not come off. It also has never left a mark on any glass or painted surface I have mounted it to.Edit: I just called Panavise and apparently they are no longer just sending the extension arm. Apparently that was a promo that ended in March of 2011. The arms are $9 from Panavise. If you call in and order they can offer to send it via USPS which will save you about $5 on shipping.
