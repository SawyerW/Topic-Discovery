Bought two of these for a D-Link NAS application in which they formated to 914GB each.  They are rated by WD for RAID use so, given their size, I took advantage of the D-Link RAID 1 option. In use it takes a moment for the discs to spin up from sleep mode but then are lightning fast overall in my gigabit network.They registered with WD without problems showing in warranty right out to 5 yrs and one month. I have had zero problems with WD when a warranty replacement is needed which I have had to use in another application.I had no problems with installation and so far have had trouble free service from these drives.  I highly recommend them.
