I bought this for mounting my Kodak Zi6 video camera, however it's pretty much useless as is.  The slope of the windshield prevents the camera from being mounted upright. I have to hang the camera upside down and then rotate the video in editing software, which causes it to look like I'm driving on the left side of the road (the wrong side here in the U.S.). I have a Ford Edge, which would have a pretty standard windshield slope I'd think.  Apparently there's an extension arm that is needed, but it's not included with the mount and there's no mention of this from Amazon.If you have a camera with a connector on the top, then this might be ok, but if you're planning on mounting a standard handheld camera, which normally would connect on the bottom, then you're out of luck.The product is well made, but the issue of needing an extension arm for many cameras is irritating (especially since I couldn't even find the extension on the Panavise website).
