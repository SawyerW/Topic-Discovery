My husband and I loved the monitor for the past month, and then yesterday (4/21/11) I tried to plug it into the charger and the piece that hooks to the charger broke off inside the monitor :( I am in the process of trying to contact the company and hope that they will fix the problem with no additional coast to me. This is the second video monitor that has broken on us. The first was a Summer hand held monitor that was double the price of this one.Is that any company out there that make a reliable video monitor? If you know of one PLEASE email me at <lyricalangel78@yahoo.com>Thanks,Maze
