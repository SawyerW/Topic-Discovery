My husband & I recently moved from a 2nd floor apt. to the ground floor to accomadate age & arthritis issues.As seniors we are happy to be on the ground floor but apprehensive about our vulnerability for breakins. We purchased the GE Doorstop Alarm for peace of mind and that is exactly what we got from this product. It was inexpensive & very easy to use.Once we are in for the evening we set 2 of them,1 at the front hallway door & the other at the door to our back porch, and we don`t give our safety another thought!Thank you for such a wonderful product.Safe in Pa.The Johnston`s
