I purchased two of these units.  One to put behind a fridge where I had had a leak problem. The other to put in the laundry room.  Based on other reviews I though these would work well for me.  I liked the fact that the probe was at the end of a length of a wire  so the alarm unit could be separated the water source.  When the units arrived, I placed the batteries in the units and found that neither of them worked. I double checked the batteries to make certain I had the correct polarity and checked the voltage.  They were at full voltage.  The led didn't light and I was unable activate the alarm.  I had to return the units.
