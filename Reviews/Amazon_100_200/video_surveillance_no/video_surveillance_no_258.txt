Bought several pairs for Church security team. Worked great for a month before some members said volume problems hampered their duties. I was skeptical until my set started having the same problems. I bought another set and sure enough, the same volume troubles started after a month or so of wearing the newer set. I contacted Midland and after several emails back and forth, they offered to check them if I sent the sets back to them. Not an option for security. We decided to go with another brand and everything seems to be going okay so far. ( 3 months )The AVPH3 did not really work for our situation. Sad because they worked great for a while. They just did not hold up to weekly use for more than a month or so.
