2 months ago I had my sewer back flowing in my basement, would've I had this device then it would've saved my wife and I a lot of time cleaning every thing after it was unclogged. This device can give you an early alert if this had to happen again thus saving a lot of time and energy. I like the volume setting on it, you can use very loud if it was in the basement, or loud like the ones we have in the main floor. I have bought 3 of them and they gave me peace of mind in catching any kind of leak that I might have.
