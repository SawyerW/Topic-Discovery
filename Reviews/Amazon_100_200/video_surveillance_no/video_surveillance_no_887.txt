I have had Wilife cameras for years. The new Logitech cameras are much improved in image quality and night vision.  I got a Logitech outdoor master camera that took two days to install.  Customer service focused on software problems and after totally removing the installed system and reinstalling it, I finally got it up and running and it has worked fine for about 4 months.  I got this new indoor master system.  The camera was defective from the start.  I sent it back and have not seen a refund on my account or received a replacement.  Will have to get on the phone to sort it out.  I am not sure I have the energy to try one more installation round.
