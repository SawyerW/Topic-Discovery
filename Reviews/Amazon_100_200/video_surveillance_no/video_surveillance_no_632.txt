I ordered this product hoping that all the reviews spoke the truth to me. Unfortunately, I did not agree with most of them. I personally wanted this monitor to work as it seemed very efficient and compact which were the things I was looking for. My mailbox is approximately 50 feet from my house and I wanted to see if the monitor would reach to our mailbox (assuming we would be playing in our backyard while the 2nd baby slept)...unfortunately the monitor beeped and turned off b/c the distance was too far. This is the ONLY reason I returned the monitor as everything else on the monitor worked fine and to my liking.
