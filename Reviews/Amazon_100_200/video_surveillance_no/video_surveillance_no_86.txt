I had a scare where my apartment window blinds just fell down at 3am, had the scare of my life thinking some one broke in! I haven't been able to sleep in weeks so I bought this and another item for my window. Anyway, this Door Stop Alarm is WOW. Its VERY VERY loud and stops the door. With those in mind I felt safer and I was able to get a good nights sleep. I love this! plus, I'm going on a vacation in a few months and love that I can easily pack it and bring it along. A must buy.
