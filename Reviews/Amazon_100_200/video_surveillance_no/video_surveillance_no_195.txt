alarm is so loud and was giving me too much anxiety!  I hated turning it on because I was so scared all the time that I wouldn't be fast enough to turn it off.  My dog is scared of loud beeps so I was so anxious all the time.  We ended up returning it because I didn't want to live like that!!!!  We ended up getting a foscam from amazon which has been so great.  Easy set up and sends you email of images when there is movement.  We turn it on when we leave and turn it off when we are home.  We also bought the kwikset smart key electronic deadbolt as well which has been fun and convenient not having to take the keys with us everywhere we go. I would skip out on this alarm.
