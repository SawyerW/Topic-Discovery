This mount is simple but very effective.  Strong holding power.  I mounted a large outdoor camera with it, and with the included length extension, which causes additional "prying" forces to be applied to the mount.  But the suction cup has held perfectly so far.  There are adjustments for every degree of freedom (if you include the rotation of the mount on the window).  Installation is just 1) mount the suction cup; 2) hold the camera in place while tightening all screws down.Caveat:  This is a great mount for installing to stationary glass in fixed structures.  That was my intent, so I gave it 5 stars.  However, if you want a vehicle mount, I think there are better (though pricier) options available.  I recommend using a small tripod with suction cups on all 3 legs.  It's a matter of mechanics--there is going to be more flex in the single-point mount of this item.  Tripods are much more sturdy for in-vehicle recordings.
