My mother forgets that she can be unstable when walking, so I wanted a way to know when she was getting up so I could make sure she was safe. This unit has worked well. I can put it anywhere so that when she gets up and moves forward, the alarm sounds.But, the alarm is much too loud. Even the low level is too loud. And, it would be better to sound only once when something crosses its path. If something moves very slowly or stops, the alarm sounds over and over and over until the path is clear. If these two things could be fixed, this would be an outstanding product.
