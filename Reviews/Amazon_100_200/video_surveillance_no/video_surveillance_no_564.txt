For the most part I was happy with this monitor and how it functioned.  It loses battery power fast, but I think most monitors do, so I can deal with it.Then my first one broke after 18 months, the port where you charge it came dislodged.  It was past the year warranty, so I was out of luck in getting it replaced, etc.  I was willing to give Lorex the benefit of the doubt that it was just one bad apple, so I purchased another one, and even bought a second camera when I had my second baby.  This one broke after 6 months of use, in the exact same way.  I am done with Lorex.  I have purchased a new monitor of another brand and am trying to get a refund.  I am getting the run around, and consistent with my previous customer service experience with Lorex, it is extremely hard to get a hold of somebody and get your problem addressed.
