This review is not for the drives.  I have 18 WD drives.  They are great.  But I recently purchased 5 drives here at AMAZON and upon registering them with WD find that they are not under warranty for various reasons.  These drives should come with a 5 year warranty.Just following up to add that WD informs me that the drives I purchased were manufactured in 2010.  They only accomodate 1 year of the 4 years of shelf.  More important they informed me one of the drives is an OEM drive that probably shipped with a computer system.  I do not think these should be advertised as new.  Buyer beware.  If you are buying a new drive and want the full five year warranty, make sure it is a year old and sold as a retail drive.  Better yet, buy it from through the Western Digital website and not AMAZON.  This is how I used to buy them and will in the future.
