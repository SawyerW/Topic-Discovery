I'm a low-tech kind of person, so I always get a slight case of the heebie-jeebies when faced with installing any high-tech electronic or computer devices.  I needn't have worried with the Logitech Alert 750i Indoor Master System.Setup was easy as 1-2-3, and I had it done in just about 30 minutes (about 10 of those minutes deciding where I wanted to put the cameras).Here's how installation works:1--load the software.2--plug in the network adapter and connect it to your router.3--put the cameras where you want themThere you go --"instant" home security!Besides the easy set-up, I also liked the wide-view of the camera lense, which allowed me to see the entire room where I'd placed it, with good, clear picture quality.  Come nightfall, the outdoor camera's night vision feature worked really well, clearly showing a "test intruder" (my partner) approaching the back door.All in all, I'm very happy with the performance of this system, and plan to add additional cameras in the future. (You can add up to 6 cameras).Another great feature is the free remote viewing, which works for your PC, BlackBerry, etc.Recommended for anyone who wants a reasonably priced system with easy setup and great performance.
