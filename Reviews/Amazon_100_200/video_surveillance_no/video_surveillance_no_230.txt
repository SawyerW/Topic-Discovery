The ear bud works well. It's comfortable to wear and projects the sound to a level that can be heard in a crowd. The ear bud does not allow for amibient noise in the ear with the speaker. The mic picks up your voice well, but it is just long enough to be attached to the shirt collar. I expected to be able to extend this down a shirt sleeve. The mic only works well when held close to the mouth, which means removing it from your collar. I can't bend my neck well enough to do otherwise. Wish the mic wire extended further. Other than that--good product.
