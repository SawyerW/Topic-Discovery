The camera works fantastic, however I have been having issues with the software / automatic upload.  The camera should get 5 starts, but the software provided brings it down considerably.  I have had the camera for less than a week now, and twice I have had "black out" periods where the camera has not uploaded video, up to 8 hours at a time.  My camera faces a busy street, so I know that it was not that there wasn't any motion.  Most of the time the video uploads just fine, weather or not my computer is on and running, or turned off.  But for some reason, sometimes it randomly just wont upload.  I have yet to figure out what the problem is with the software, I will be contacting Logitech soon, and I will update the review.
