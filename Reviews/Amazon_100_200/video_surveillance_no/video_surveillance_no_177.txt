This was an easy set-up. The little alarms come with batteries - but the big one requires that you open the back and put in 3 or 4 triple AAA batteries. I ended up breaking the back off of mine because I didn't have a small enough screw driver and I ended up threading the top of the screw trying to open it with a bigger screw driver (rookie mistake). HOWEVER - this is pretty elaborate for how small it is (and really simple to use). Two thumbs up. This shipped quickly and I have great peace of mind knowing my alarm will let me know when the batteries are low.
