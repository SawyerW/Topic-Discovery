If you're like me, you read reviews before buying.  Well, read this one!  BUYER BEWARE! If it was possible to rate it 0 stars, I would have.  I have had this monitor going on 2 years now for my twins.  However, it's not the original monitor because it's been replaced not once, not twice, not three times...but FOUR TIMES!!!  The Lorex customer service is horrible, the turn around time for replacement is awful and the handheld monitor is terrible.  The piece that connects it to the dock has broken off all 4 times.  It looks cheap and feels cheap.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one and spend a little more on another brand.
