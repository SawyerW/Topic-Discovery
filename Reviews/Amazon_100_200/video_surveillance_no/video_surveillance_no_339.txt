I bought a stereo that had option for a reverse camera. This little unit is hooked up to it and works nicely. Daytime use is great however it struggles at nighttime but if your reverse lights are good it should work fine for you. It came with a hole saw to drill a hole where it needs to mount. I mounted mine in the ceter of my rear license plate. It also helps when hooking up trailers to my hitch. My truck is extremely tall so it is comforting being able to see when backing up, especially in public parking areas. I have a winch front bumper that protrudes out about a foot or more which I plan on mounting another camera there also. As one reviewer mentioned it does better if mounted high if you are using it for 'close contact' prevention.The bottom line: I would buy another one if/when I needed one.UPDATE:I've had this camera for a little over 2 years now and it is still working fine.
