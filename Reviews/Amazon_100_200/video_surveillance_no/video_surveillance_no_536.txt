I wish our family would have known about this product and just how awesome it really is a long time ago! If for whatever reason it breaks we would buy another of the same brand no questions asked! This has been the best monitor that we have ever bought .. and we have been through quiet a few! I dont know which part is neater .. the split screen views, the fact you can take pictures, or that I dont even have to get up to check on the kids .. love the way we can talk back and forth just with a touch of a button! Awesome Product!!
