I bought this camera as a gift for my mother, as there had been some recent break-ins near her house.  On paper, it looks like a good system.  However, after several days of trying to set up the camera so that it's connected to my computer, I have finally given up.  There is simply no way I can view the images I'm supposed to see on my computer.  Good luck trying to reach customer service.  I've tried calling early, calling late, calling in the middle of the day and no one ever picks up, even after an hour on hold.  It's got way too many problems for me to ever recommend - if I could give it zero stars I would.
