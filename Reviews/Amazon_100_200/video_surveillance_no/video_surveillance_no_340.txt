The video quality is okay, but I'm pretty disappointed by the "Flush Mount" claim.  The housing is about an inch or so long on the other side of the fitting.  This means that once it's mounted, it still sticks out about 1 to 1.5 inches.  It looks pretty stupid mounted like its supposed to be, so it will take some pretty crafty modifications on my part to make it flush.  If I had it to do over again, I would have just went with the license plate camera.  It would have probably worked out better if I had a bumper that already had the pop out for a backup camera, but mounted to the bumper of an f150, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
