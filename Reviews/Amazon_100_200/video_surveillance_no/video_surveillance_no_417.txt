I bought this camera (my first 'game camera') to keep an eye on the porch and entry of our remote log cabin which is 90 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska. We'd had a gang of bears break in (now have an electric fence) and I was curious what other four and two legged critters came by. Bought a package of two SD cards, four 'D' batteries and set it up. Easy.So far it has photographed several moose, my neighbors checking on the place and my arrival before I turn it off. No bears. It ran all summer and so far this winter without any problems. Still on the same set of batteries (using the photo option not the video).I have no complaints whatsoever. For the price, it is a superb value.JB Thorsness
