I really wanted to like this monitor system, because when it worked, it worked well.  the problem I had was as I got not even 15 feet from the camera, the monitor would cut out and say "camera not detected".  With such a short range, I see it being of no use because you may as well be sitting in the room with the child, then you wouldn't need the camera to begin with.On the bright side, it was very easy to set-up and the picture quality was great, as long as I was within about 12 feet of the camera.I might have gotten a bad egg, but I am not one to keep messing around with swapping items out until I finally get a working one.
