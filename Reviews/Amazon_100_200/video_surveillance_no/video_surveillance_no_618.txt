This is a worthless product. After 3 months of use, the AC adapter that fits into the charger broke off. It's kind of hard to seat in the charger anyway without rocking the port back and forth, so it definitely wasn't excessive force. I called Lorex and they have terrible customer service. They asked me to fax in the receipt after which I heard nothing for 2 weeks. I had to then purchase a new one since all the accessories worked fine, thus paying over $260 for this useless product.There's also a lot of feedback when you turn the volume up. I used to have a Home Sentry monitor and like that a lot better due to zero feedback, a flip stand to hold the monitor up on a surface, and a charger that just plugged in.
