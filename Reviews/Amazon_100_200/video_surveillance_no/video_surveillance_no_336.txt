Overall this seems like a very good camera.  The quality seems good and so far has not had any issues due to weather like previous cameras.  I didn't want to drill a hole in the body of my truck to accommodate this camera so I installed it into a plastic housing under the bumper.  It gets a good view, but surprisingly it can't actually see to the corners of the vehicle.  The viewing angle of the camera almost makes it, but objects have to be 3-4 feet away (behind) the corners in order for the camera to pick them up.  In the worst case, if something were right at the bumper on either side but just out of view of the side mirrors, you wouldn't be able to see it and could hit it.  Other than this, if you're starting out somewhere that you know to be clear, then you're OK and can use your mirrors and camera to make it all work.  The image quality is quite good, and at night can see well too.
