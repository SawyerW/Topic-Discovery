I have tried now three of these monitors 1 used and 2 new thinking I was doing something wrong when charging the monitor. I have now come to the conclusion that this base and monitor is just poorly made. I am so annoyed because I love the video monitors in my boys rooms but because of the charging port constantly messing up I go a few days at a time with no monitor and with a 2yr old and a 5 month old thats trouble some! I guess I now get the privelegde of finding something better! Good luck to anyone that tries these monitors!
