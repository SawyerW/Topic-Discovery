As a new daddy I was looking for a good monitor that was compact so I could move my son from room to room and always have the monitor on him. This worked very well for the first two months. The video is a bit grainey but you can see well enough plus the nightvision was useful. The battery life is fair, maybe 3-4 hours.Then the bottom battery charge broke off as it is difficult to fit in the cradle and requires some jiggling. Being faiarly handy with electronics I bought some super glue, took apart the entire device piece by piece. I had it fixed and began using it as usual. Then a few days later it happened again. I fixed it again. a few days later it broke again. I bought the best glue possible and fixed it again. It's not breaking again, but now it doesn't charge! I am now shopping for a new monitor and will NOT be shopping for a Lorex!!!
