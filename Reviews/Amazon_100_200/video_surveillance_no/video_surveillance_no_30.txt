I originally bought one of these to use as it was intended, to notify me if someone pulled into my driveway.  However, I found that it was far too sensitive and no matter what I did (tape over sensor, etc) it would alarm every time a car drove by or a bird flew near it.Then I got the idea to use this to augment my home alarm system.  It's very reliable indoors, never a false alarm.  I liked it so much I bought two.  They both transmit on the same frequency so only one receiver is required.  I like the low/hi notification volume switch.  Very cool product and you can't beat the price.  Five thumbs up!
