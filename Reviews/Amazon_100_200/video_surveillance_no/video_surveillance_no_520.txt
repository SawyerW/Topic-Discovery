Do not do it!  It lasted a very short time.  The battery quit charging and the docking plug on the monitor came loose.  I tried to get Lorex to honor the warranty about 3 months ago and I am still waiting after filling out endless forms.  I guess the never expect anyone to jump through the numerous hoops to return an item.  I guess they do not know what to do now that I gave them all the info.  My baby will be driving by the time they decide to honor the warranty.  A very poor effort of customer service and standing behind a product.
