We have a salt block in our yard and my wife wanted to see the deer that came to enjoy it. After some research and a great price I decided to get this one. Setup was extremely easy, and positioning it was a breeze. I originally set it on its most sensitive setting and was capturing cars on the road 100 yards away. Normal setting works fine and I could probably stand to set it on its lowest setting. Timestamp and temperature shows up at the bottom of each photo along with moon phase. This is a rugged unit and will definitely please you for a long time.
