Installation:- The small alarms are super easy as they can be installed with a simple double sided sticky mounting tape. The larger ones however are supposed to be removable and are sent with screws for the back plate, but since my door is metal I had a little trouble mounting them.Use:- They are really quite easy to program and after a few times my wife got used to it. I found the "Away" setting (30 second delay) to be the most useful for our entry door as the other setting "home" (no delay) would often cause the alarm to go off to my wife's chagrin.Effectiveness:- The large alarms are piercing. The small alarms are quite loud and annoying. Likely prevented a burglary at my house 1 night ago (door kicked and bent which made the alarm sound - no entry).I did have some peace of mind after installing the alarms the only thing is you have to remember to turn them on for them to be effective at deterring burglaries.
