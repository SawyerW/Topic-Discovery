My daughter had a little problem with "friends" toilet-papering our house every weekend (yeah, pretty much every weekend), so I was looking for a reasonable quality, easy to install, low light capable video system.  I was partway through installing it on a Friday night (only one camera up, cable hanging down the house, camera not pointed correctly) and video-ed the TP'ers in the act.  Video was clear enough (even though it was dark) to identify the culprits.  After a couple of phone calls, they came back the next day and spent 3 hours cleaning the trees.  Since then, 4 weeks later, no TP events.  Amazing how word spreads in the high school.  System is very easy to install and configure, with a very good daylight picture.  Low light picture is blurry when there is movement, probably due to slow frame speed on the camera.  I'm buying a faster SD card to see if that helps.  The software is very intuitive and easy to use/configure.  Overall the system has been great and I'd recommend it to anyone.
