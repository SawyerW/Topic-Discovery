We purchased ours at Costco and love this unit.  We have not found the VOX feature to be very impressive but we did not really care about that.  The problem that we have is that the first monitor had the charging port break in the bottom of the monitor after about 6 months so we took it back to Costco and got a replacement.  I thought the first one broke because the monitor does not line up just right in the docking station so I removed the wire from the docking station and charged it without that thinking that would solve the problem.  Our second one just broke after about 8 months of use.  Customer service assured me that it is a very rare problem and that I could send it in for repair/replacement
