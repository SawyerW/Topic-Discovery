I must admit I feel rather ripped off after paying for this main outdoor unit and an indoor unit and then finding that even investing $500 in this system I still need to pay $79.99 in order to get full functionality.  Basically, when you are away from home it will send you a message when motion is detected, but even if you go to view the live videi on your mobile phone or other device, you cannot go back and look at stills or recorded video without upgrading to their "premium" service.  Obviously, whatever has triggered the alert by that point has usually moved on, so I am looking at a live video feed that doesn't help at all and in fact leaves me feeling *less* secure by wondering what tripped the alert.  When I first started receiving alerts there was a photo still in the email, but they seem to have downgraded the alerts to just a text message in an effort to compel people to upgrade to see what actually triggered the alert!  I will be researching further to find a better price / value / functionality solution as this falls short.
