I purchased the GX301 to view the blind spot on the property which is my driveway.  It is rainy and cold here in the Northwest winter so I did a quick temporary installation. The camera linked up with the monitor quickly.  It has a nice clear picture and sensitive audio pickup.  I have a large street light mounted on the garage so I can't say how well it does in total darkness but the picture is quite clear at night.  One drawback to this set is the range.  During the day it is fine but when the sun goes down and it gets cold it stats dropping the signal. This is very annoying, but moving the monitor closer (from 50ft to 20ft) to the camera solves the problem.  This spring I will do a more permanent installation and raise the camera up from 8 to 12 ft this should help the range. Like a lot of inexpensive camera units the color washes out somewhat in bright sunlight but all in all it does a nice job and worth what I paid for it.
