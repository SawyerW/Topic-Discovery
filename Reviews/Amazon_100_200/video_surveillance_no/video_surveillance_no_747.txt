I had the old system Wi-Life and was very happy had no problems.  Decided to upgrade to the new Logitech Alert.  Worst decision ever.  I have had the cameras for about 5 months now.  They worked fine for about two months and ever since I have had nothing but problems.  Cameras are no longer detected.  SD cards don't stay formatted.  Outdoor weatherproof camera got water in it and is now foggy (can't see anything)  When the cameras are detected the image is black.  I've contacted customer service for troubleshooting the suggestions don't work and so I ask to return them and get a refund.  All I get is a if it is within 30 days we will be happy to refund if not we need to try some troubleshooting (which doesn't work).  Not happy do not buy.
