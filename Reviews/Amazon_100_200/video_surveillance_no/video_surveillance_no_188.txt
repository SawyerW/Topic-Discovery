I love the big door alarm. The smaller window alarms arent that loud but if someone was trying to break in I feel it would deter them while you reach for your gun or phone to call the police.  I have a poodle so thats an alrm system in itself....so he usually hears things first.  The bigger alarm is great!! If someone was to break thru my doo it would go off and by the time they get up the stairs...Ill be gone!!! LOL..I am a single 48 year women and I am never easy at night. I had a real alarm system, but face it by the time the cops get there I could have called them myself.  I love this product. I think Im going to buy another Door alarm....very loud and shocking.
