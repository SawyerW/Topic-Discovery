I purchased these because I work at a camp full time. During the summer, all of our upper staff are on radio. These make talking and listening so easy! Also, parents I interact with aren't bothered by my radio going off during conversation. These are the perfect devices. If you need to transmit over a long distance (our camp is 100 acres), then these will not work on the very edges. After use, I noticed that on the far ends of our grounds, our radios transmit clearer without the headset attached. That being said, around our main grounds, these little guys are terrific!
