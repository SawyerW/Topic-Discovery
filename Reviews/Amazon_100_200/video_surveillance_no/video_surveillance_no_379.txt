I have no prior experience with a trail camera. This worked as advertised. Took lots of pictures of night critters the very first night I had it set up. Very low price ($77, shipping included) compared to many other online stores selling for over $100.UPDATE 2-20-2012: Worked well, then after 3 months it started to chew through batteries at an alarming rate. They made good on the warranty, but also charged $20.00.New camera arrived, it would NOT take night pictures.Now they want to charge me another $20 to replace the defective replacement.Very poor communication. They seem to be stonewalling me. Its either 1.)send it back with another $20 (to which they could send me another defective camera) or 2.) just go away.
