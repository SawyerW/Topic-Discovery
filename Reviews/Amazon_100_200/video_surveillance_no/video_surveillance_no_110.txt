This mount does not work with a Flip video on the windshield.  The angle of the windshield is such that the arm is too short and the top of the flip video hits the windshield so that it is angled up.It would work on the back window of a pickup. The image quality when mounted on a back window is good if the arm is vertical.  It is very poor with A LOT of vibration if it is mounted with the arm horizontal.Perhaps another type of camera would work, but do not get this if you are using a flip video on the windshield
