This is the 2nd one that I have bought in the past 2 years, and both were different!  The 1st one gave my video equip problems in trying to sync up (vertically) and acted more like 50 Hz than 60 Hz (?).  My 2nd and most recent purchase of this cam yielded a stable pic.Also the 1st one would sometimes turn on after power off with a 'psychodelic' pic in regards to the colors---re-setting power cleared up the problem. My 2nd cam had a very good color pic w/o any problems.My 1st cam had a more narrow field of view (FOV) as compared to my 2nd cam with a wider FOV.  Comparable to the typical monitoring cams that I have purchased of different brands.And, finally the spec sheet says 3 Lux CMOS chip (?) with my 2nd cam having much better sensitivity than my 1st,---I would say my 2nd cam was more like a higher-sensitivity 1 Lux or less and gave very good low light (non-IR equipped) performance.I am very happy with my 2nd cam and shud have sent the 1st one back to shipper when I first recvd it....
