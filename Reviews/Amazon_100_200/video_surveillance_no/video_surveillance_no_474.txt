This is the best trail cam out there for the money.  It's large, but with the D batteries, I have it working for months on end.  It's super simple and easy to use and all you have to do is throw a few switches to set it up.  The image quality is as good as any other trail cam out there and it's nighttime photos and range are completely adequate for trails and anything other than open fields.  It's been through two Alaskan winters and it's still going strong.I would recommend buying a mount so that the camera can be swiveled and mounted up high away from thieves and larger animals.
