With a spouse away in the military I sometimes get nervous at night home alone with the baby. With this, it is definitely VERY difficult to get the door open (actually I tried several times and was unable to open the door more than 1"). I haven't set the alarm yet but my door squeaks pretty loudly when you open it so I'm not too worried :) I highly recommend this.The opening under my door is VERY small - less than 1/4" and this works fine. I just kind of kick it a little but it doesn't fit under the door, just up against it. My entry way is tile and this has excellent traction and does not slip on the tile at all.
