This head set Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX (Pair)could be better if the coiled around the head section were longer to assist with keeping the ear bud in the ear canal. The mounting clip for the voice unit needs to be more user friendly for right or left side clip on (perhaps a larger clip as well would help).  The unit has good sound clarity. If your choice of a headset is this or a "hard shell over the ear holder type or a headphone style which closes off both ears, I would purchases the AVDP set again).  Amazon has the better price on this unit and timely shipping.
