This was my first experience with a fully featured baby monitor.  I was surprised at all the bells and whistles the unit contained.  You can capture up to ten photos, as well as watching/listening to a live feed.  The screen is somewhat small, maybe 2" x 3", but you can sync up to four cameras to one monitor and its very easy to switch feeds, or watch all four at once.The monitor itself is fairly simple and intuitive to use.  Its not the greatest video in the world, not HD by any means, but is fairly clear and easy to view.  The camera also has infrared settings to make viewing in the dark easy.  The monitor is about the size of a cell phone can be totally wireless or may rest in a charging dock.A huge step beyond the toaster-sized audio-only monitors of the past!
