I bought 2 of these, then ordered a 3rd. They are cheap cameras which work well in daylight. They have good low-light capability too. But forget about the night vision. You can barely see the outline of an object just a few feet from the camera.My main complaint about this camera is the mounting system. You must remove the mounting bracket. The bracket is attached to the camera with 2 very tiny screws. I ordered a 3rd camera because I dropped 2 of these mounting screws, 1 at a time, and couldn't find them. These small mounting screws will fit under my fingernail. The camera should have a different mounting bracket.Bottom line is that this is a nice general purpose daylight indoor camera which is cheap. Just keep a magnet close by when you mount it. The night I.F. lights should not be a consideration in your purchase.
