To the best of my knowledge, the RE4's are end of life in the sense that WD has stopped using the name RE4 for their enterprise drives.  I believe they just call them RE drives now.  Anyway, I've used these for various servers and system builds mainly for environments that require RAID.  They are peppy enough for what I need and their URE ratings are better in my opinion to other enterprise drives with regards to how much you pay.  I've used these mainly for RAID 1, 5, and 10 setups and have never had problems.  They do run a hot if you start stacking them in a chassis without a good amount of airflow so keep a look out for that.  Other than that, haven't had one fail yet!
