OK, First This Camera is a CHEAP Camera! That Being Said, Its Not Cheaply Made. I was really skeptical prior to buying this unit, figured the price was proof it was garbage, i was wrong and very glad i took the chance. got it in the mail last night, tossed in 4 new D's popped in a 4GB Card and it worked like a charm. haven't yet gotten it to take a color shot, the camera decided the lighting in my kitchen was best suited for IR 1.3 Mega Pixel Shots, MAN WERE THEY CLEAR ! dont have them to upload but WOW worth the money ! i have had CuddeBack IR and this is a comparable Camera. If you are looking for a camera and dont want to spend big bucks this is the ONE !I will be buying more of these and look forward to other Primos Products
