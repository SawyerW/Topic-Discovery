I originally bought a Chamberlain driveway alert for over $50, but the audio was so low that you had to be right beside it to even hear it. I returned it to the store.Then I found the Driveway Patrol at a local Rural King store for under $20. I wasn't expecting much, but it works great. I put it inside a bluebird box with the front of the box removed to give it some protection from the elements. This alarm will wake you up at night. I've had no problem with false alarms either. I recommend getting a universal a/c power supply from Walmart (15.00) so you don't have to buy the 3 C batteries for the base unit. Just set the power supply at 4.5 volts.
