I purchased this after reading some of the reviews. It was to be used indoors only, trying to see which dog was using the carped as their commode. The first 2 days it worked like a charm. I went into the Primos troubleshooting page and found this to be a very common problem. The Primos person was very helpful in telling folks that they would be replaced. Problem is, some people found the replacements defective. I understand that items can be defective, but this seems to be the norm.I don't know what I will purchase, but it won't be another Primos product.We absolutely love Amazon and the fact that we can return items with absolutely no hassles.
