I bought the logitech 750i to help identify which of my kitties was having an issue.  The technical support was phenomenal.  All you need to do is put in the dvd and it walks you through it.  However, I am used to a MAC and didn't know how to use the DVD on my sister's Dell.  The tech support guy was patient and did not tell me to return my item.  He walked me through it.  If I hadn't had such an issue getting the DVD started on my computer (my error, not theirs) it would have been a snap. Within an hour I knew 100% for sure which of my kitties was having issues.  Add on cameras are very expensive. Night vision inside is not good.  I just left a light on.  For what I needed, it was excellent.
