I have had this camera for several days now. It has been working great, battery life has been better than I expected. Battery and card life do have a lot to do with the setting choices you make. Night pics are good but a little grainy out at 30-40' Day pics are pretty good. I compared this one to several of my friends different models and we both thought for the money it was a good buy.In one of the posts on another site it was mentioned that one burnt up after plugging it into a 12 volt power supply. I must add that the correct voltage for this camera is 6 volt external power.Gets the job done for the money.
