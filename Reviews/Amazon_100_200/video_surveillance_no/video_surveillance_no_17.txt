I bought a few of these... and they work exactly as described.  The only thing I wish I could change is that regardless of which sensor is triggered, all the chimes go off.  Meaning that you do not know which 'zone' has activity.  They are sensitive and work great so far... but I do have false positives when critters come up and investigate them.  They are all protected from rain by some sort of cover and/or bird house to conceal them... so naturally roosting/nesting animals take a peek at them from time to time, therefore triggering the sensor.  But you start to get a feel for when birds are active, which generally is when the sun is still shining... and I can look outside and see a silly bluebird flitting around the sensor. So far I have only used them in the spring/summer and neither temperature nor moisture/humidity have affected their performance... and we have gotten in the upper 90'sF so far.All in all, they work well...and for the price, they are worth it!
