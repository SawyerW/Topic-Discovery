It does what it says - make it look as if a TV is on in the room when viewed from outside.  I had this concept in my head for many years, I was glad to see someone actually make it.A lot of light comes out of this little device - it is only about 3x4".  Although it has a photocell, I use it on a timer, as I don't think that most people start watching TV at sundown.My only complaint is that I feel that it is relatively expensive. It should be no more than $19.95 - they would sell a lot more.  Because of the price I probably won't recommend it to my friends.
