A truly ingenious idea and well-executed product.  It does exactly as described- from an outside window it makes it look like a large TV is on in a room.This little box is surprisingly bright and uses a rather complex algorithm to simulate a real television's light output.  As long as someone from the outside can't actually see the device (place it carefully) there is no way they could not tell it's a Fake TV.I really like the on-at-dusk feature and the 4-hr or 7-hr program times.All around, this is just a great idea and a perfect compliment to your home security.  For the price, seriously, it's worth it (even if you don't travel much but regularly get home after dark).  Let the bad guy think someone is home and he's going to go somewhere else.
