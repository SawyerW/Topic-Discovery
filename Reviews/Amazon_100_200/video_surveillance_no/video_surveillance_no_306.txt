Arrived and installed primary and remote unit (for second door in about 45 min--most of that was careful reading of the instructions).  It may not be clear to all that the senors and transmitters have to be set individually for unique tones.  Once set though, they work fine.  Used for elderly grandfather with chime in bedroom so he can detect if any entrance doors open at night.  Unit is well made with battery for sensors  (chime uses 110v)..  No complaints (do drill a pilot hole for any wood screws--screw heads easily strip otherwise.  I also split the double surface tape (down length) to better spread load when attached to metal door (no drilling).  Instructions do mention that a wireless doorbell will activate chime so maybe others might try that solution if they are unhappy with the door alarm feature.
