My truck was boken into 3 times.  The first time, I had no alarm, but the cops caught the guys!  The second time I had the alarm on, but was set too low and they got into my bed-mounted tool box (put a pad lock on it after that).  The third time I was in bed awake watching tv.  As soon as they poped the glass ( I heard it) the alarm sounded and they took off.  This sound sensor did its job!  After this third break in I added the Radar motion detector and had the dash security light changed from red to the much brighter blue.If you are thinking about putting an alarm on your truck / car, I recommend getting the addon sensors!  Like me, you may whish you did.
