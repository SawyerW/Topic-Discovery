I received this item in its own cardboard box. Inside the box was the FakeTV, its power supply, and the original packaging materials all torn up. It looks like this FakeTV had been returned, and the seller put it all in a cardboard box and shipped it to me. This would not have been a problem except that I discovered why it was returned -- the power supply was dead. The seller apparently did not test the unit when it was returned to them. Fortunately I have several old power supply units, and I found a compatible one. The FakeTV works fine with a functioning power supply that I provided.I would have given this item 5 stars except for the shoddy handling by the seller. If I had not had a compatible power supply, I would have had to ship the whole thing back.
