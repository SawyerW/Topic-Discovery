This is a good camera and monitor for the money. I wanted to watch who came to my door and it worked great. BUT... the monoitor only lasted 16 months and then died. You cannot buy only a monitor as a replacement. You must buy the entire set up again.As long as it did work, the picture was great and I liked the alarm sound when it picked up motion. Since I drilled holes into my face brick, I have to see if I can replace the camera without a lot of problems since the two go hand in hand for the signal.
