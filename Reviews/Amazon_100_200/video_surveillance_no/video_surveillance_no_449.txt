My husband LOVES this camera. We have 12 acres in the country that we visit on weekends, and he feeds the wildlife. We get beautiful daytime shots and nice night ones. Pictures are clear and crisp. The photo quality is amazing for the price. It is extremely simple to use as well. This is our second one....the first finally died after much use and abuse. Remember to purchase (4) D batteries and a 7 or 8 GB SD card so you'll be good to go when you receive it.The only negative that I can come up with is that they use the plastic packaging that is molded to the camera; SO hard to get open. I almost always cut myself trying. But that's the packaging, not the camera. The camera is fantastic....highly recommend!
