Item showed up brand-new in the package.  Opened it and the screw that holds the battery cover on (on the bottom of the door stop) fell out.  The screw was stripped, so I had to tape the battery cover door on, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the friction pad.The alarm is extremely loud and the price is right, but I'm really a bit skeptical at build quality that allows something so fundamentally integral to the device to fail upon delivery.PS - I did not attempt to exchange or return this item.  For the price, it's not worth my time or money to ship it back.
