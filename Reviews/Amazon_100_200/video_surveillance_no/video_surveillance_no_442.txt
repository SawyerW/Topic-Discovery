This camera works fine if you live in a dry part of the country.  I gave this review 3 stars because, the camera is suppose to be waterproof.  After just one night out in the cold low lying clouds it had accumulated enough moisture to make all the pictures come out blurry.  The other thing that I did  not like is that the camera's range at night was maybe 20 ft at best, this was with the highest sensitivity set too.  This was advertised at about 40 ft at night.  Other than these 2 issues the camera works fine, which is why if you live in a part of the country that's dry most of the time, this camera will work just fine.
