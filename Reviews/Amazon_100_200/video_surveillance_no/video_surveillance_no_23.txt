We just had our golf cart stolen so decided "lock" the barn door with a motion detector to protect our Prius which is now alone in the carport.  After struggling to find a Phillips screwdriver small enough to open the sensor's 9-volt compartment, we stuck the sensor into a vine on the wall about 15' from the car.The wind and vine shaking didn't bother the sensor so we managed to test it in full daylight, dusk and darkness so light status didn't phase it.  We put the receiver in our bedroom some 75' from the sensor.  The signal had to go through two masonary and two framed walls. It worked perfectly the very first time!  Let's hope it continues to do so.  Very affordable! Jim & Danae
