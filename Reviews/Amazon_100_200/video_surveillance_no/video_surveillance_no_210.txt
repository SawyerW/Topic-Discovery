it definitely works. dont get me wrong, but im still trying to find the medium where it just chirps when u walk by or up to the vehicle, & goes off if bumped. its set now to go off when bumped somewhat hard, & chirp if just pushed. its weird because its either too much or too little. the turning mechanisms are not that wide so you have to try again & again to find the sensitivity you want. or be blessed enough to find an alarm tech to install it & set the sensitivity perfect the first time... but it does the job!!
