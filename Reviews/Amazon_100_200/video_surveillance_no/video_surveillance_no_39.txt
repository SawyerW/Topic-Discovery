Great buy if you only need it for 3 weeks.  I live in temperate zone, bought this before last winter, housed it in a plastic planter with a hole cut out for sensor to shield it from the rain and snow.  It worked nicely for a few weeks, then for some reason it stopped working.  Checked the batteries and they were fine.  Repositioned sensor, and it worked fine for another week or two.  Kept repositioning, replaced batteries...long story short- This thing caused me a lot of frustration and it didn't survive the winter.  Guess I got my money's worth, but still disappointed.  Will be buying a real driveway alarm soon.
