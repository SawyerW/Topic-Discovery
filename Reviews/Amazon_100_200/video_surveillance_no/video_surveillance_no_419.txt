Has been some time since I made this purchase but I have to tell you it works like a charm. Night shots are not too good unless the subject being photographed is close. Day time stills and video are great...especially on a sunny day when the sun is high above. I used this cam for two types of scenarios. First we have some knuckleheads jumping the wall and are cutting through our complex...which seems to be about the time we go missing holiday decoraction and misc items in our front yards. Next was a visit to Yellowstone and hoped to capture some animal images but managed to catch more of our own activities in the area....which was quite comical considering the situation that I won't... uhhhh can't go into detail here. If you want a reasonably priced cam this is the item for you. Batteries do last a reasonable amout of time in this product but stay up with fressh batts it if you are getting a lot of images in a single day. Windy situations create a lot of movement and the cam will do exactly what is supposed to do and capture MOVEMENT.
