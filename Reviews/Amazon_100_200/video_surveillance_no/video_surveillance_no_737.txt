After three months of outdoor usage, my only criticism is with firmware. I was able to only peruse maybe 30% of the reportedly available software functionalities. (Example 1: Anti-tampering triggers for nothing, such as environmental conditions changing from dark to light! Example 2: With every different browser you will experience different behavior form the IP8332). Furthermore, as some commented here already, every new firmware release makes you regret the previous one; and user manuals and documentation are never up-to-date. In other words, software configuration management looks a bit amateurish; and I also suspect one should have Linux installed on his Pc to make this beast work smoothly.On the other hand, Support has proven good and effective so far.
