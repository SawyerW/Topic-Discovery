We wanted to communicate between riders in motion without spending 400.00 for wireless sets.  I give this a 4 star because they work well but they have definite limits when the bike is traveling at highway speeds due to wind noise.  Using them with the Midland 2-way radios.  They work well but I use an open face helmet and the voice is garbled when riding at highway speeds.  Just when I want to talk to other riders.  We will experiment with throat mikes to cut down on the wind issue.  I like these better than the boom mikes that came with the radios.  We know that you have to get used to the delay before speaking after keying the mike.  We also know that a good shouted few words at highway speed can mostly be heard and makes you pay attention to your fellow riders signals.  A good highway speed mike with the midland radios is the key....any suggestions?
