This camera is good for the money. I don't really need a high quality camera since I just need to know if there is a deer in the area. I will not be using the picture for video production. Yesterday was the first time I used it, and I was not really very hopeful that I will find a deer. Low and behold... I found a deer! The only comment I have is that it is being advertised to accept a 8 MB disk, while the instruction that came with the unit said it could use up to 32 MB. Also, there is a minimum delay of 10 seconds. At this setting, I am missing some of the pictures, although I would consider it acceptable since the captured deer is moving very slowly. That being said, I still wish that the minimum delay could be set at 1 second.
