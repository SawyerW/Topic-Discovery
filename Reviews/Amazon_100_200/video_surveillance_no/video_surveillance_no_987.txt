Without getting into a scientific testing process, it is firing false alarms.  I have it hanging in my sump pit well above the water line and it should not be getting splashed.  About every 2 months, it goes off at 2-3am.  I then rush down to my basement freaking out to the ear piercing sound to shut it off after finding no water (which is good for me, but bad for a device solely invented to detect water).  This thing isn't worth the false alarms.  It's probably just too sensitive and the humidity causes a false contact.  I'd love to see a unit that doesn't go off until 3 - 5 seconds of full submersion, but that would cost more.  I went cheap and got cheap.Positive note, this thing is very, very loud.  I can hear it through several solid wood doors closed through the floor (it's in the basement and I'm on the first floor).
