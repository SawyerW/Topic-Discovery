If you are looking for a basic no frill's camera, this is it! We us this for monitoring a supply room at my place of work and it works just fine!  The screen image is a bit grainy, but works well! For the price, it just cant be beat! If your looking high quality image and night vision, you will need to spend alot more money and look elsewhere! Pair this camera up with a VideoSecu 50 Feet Power Video Audio Security Camera Cable Wire with Free BNC RCA Adapter 1JC , and you got a nice basic cheap, Video system. A very good deal at a low cost!! Have fun!
