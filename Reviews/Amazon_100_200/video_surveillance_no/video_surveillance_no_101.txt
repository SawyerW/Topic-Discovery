I purchased the Panavise 809 from Amazon for Autocross use.  I did some research and the choice was between Ram Mount, GoPro and Panavise.  The reviews and price point led me to the 809.As with others providing feedback, the unit was a bit too short to properly mount the camera (small point and shoot) in an upright position on a C6 Corvette.  I called Panavise and they immediately offered to send the extension mount.  I used the unit for a race this weekend and it performed at/above expectations (great deal at $23 from Amazon).  Very solid mounting mechanism - even with a heavier camera, it was NOT going to come loose/off during the very aggressive turns during the race.Not only is this one great product, but the company is responsive and extremely polite on the phone.  Panavise is a great choice - plus, it's made in the USA!
