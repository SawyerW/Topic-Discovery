So far the camera is working fine.  Takes really good video clips.  Daytime color photos and videos are of good quality.  Nighttime IR photos look like negatives, but good enough to show up the game activity.  Have experienced some cases where we had lots of "empty" photos, apparently due to wind blowing tree limbs in the camera's view.  Remounted the camera to a different angle and that seems to have resolved the problem.  Camera is fairly big and bulky, but that's not an issue for me.  Battery life seems to be holding up quite well.  Havent had it in any hard rain yet, so can't comment on that.
