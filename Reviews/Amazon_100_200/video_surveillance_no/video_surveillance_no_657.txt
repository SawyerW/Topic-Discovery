I work night shifts, so I always worry that my house is dark and empty at night.  I have a couple of lamps on timers...and have actually set my TV to turn on and off, but that felt like a waste of energy.  This little guy does a great job at replicating the lights of a TV (although since it is in my living room, I wish it was a little brighter...maybe the next generation could have a brighter/dimmer option to adjust for the room size...minus half of a star).  The 4 hour/7 hour/on option is great, and it doesn't come on until the room is dark.  My only other wish was that the cord was a little longer so that I had a little more room to play with where I set it up (minus a half star).  Delivery was quick, and it is ready to use right out of the box.  Overall, a nice little "extra" security that makes my nights at work less stressful.
