I have had my camera for only one month.  If it works as well six months from now as it does today, I will change my rating from good to excellent.  I purchased the camera so that I can work outside in my garden and observe my 98 year old mom who sleeps most of the day, but needs assistance when she is awake.  The reception is good as long as I am in the area of the garden that is closest to the room where she is resting.  Otherwise, I have to move the camera to a location that will get monitor reception.
