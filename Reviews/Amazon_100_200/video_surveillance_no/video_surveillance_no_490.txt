I have never bought a trail cam and neither has my Dad. I did a bunch of research and settled on this one for him based on reviews and the price. I didn't want to shell out too much for our first trail cam.I have not used this item too much personally since it was a gift, but my Dad was able to figure out how to set it up and use it effectively. The images are sufficient, they are better than I expected. They are not the same as say a point and shoot camera, but definitely good for what we are trying to do.Having some patience with some of the settings, especially the sensitivity, will go a long way in your satisfaction with this product.I would definitely recommend this if this is your first entry into buying a trail cam. I would buy another for my own personal use.
