Have used 2 other older model trail cams that went through AA batteries by the ton- this camera takes nice, clear photos night or day- very sensitive & gets photos a long way out there- battery life is phenomenal - will buy this same item for my next trail cam- I like the time, date, and moon phasse on each photo as well- really lets you know when game are traveling.  Quiet and the infared photos for dark are much better than the old flash on my prior trail cams that would sometimes wash out the picture if game too close and spooked game as often on older trail cams I had pictures of the back end of the animals!Cant say enough about this great product & was good price and quick shipping as always thru Amazon.
