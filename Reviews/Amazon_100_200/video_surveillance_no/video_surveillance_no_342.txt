the website provides a manual that is really a one-size-fits-all four models of their Pyle cams.  so via the website I assumed this model had the jumper to reverse the image back to normal for front view.  the manual that came with the cam was different and did not depict this jumper.  So all of my cams have reversed images and their "support" staff (really just one overworked guy) was less than helpful.resolution is not nearly good enough to read a license plate unless the car is less than 3 feet away from the cam.  night vision works ok, no issues so far.  for the money its a decent deal, but know what you are buying and verify it.  this really is a backup cam and nothing more.
