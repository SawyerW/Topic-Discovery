This unit works great! It's installed at the end of my driveway (75' away) and my receiver is in the basement stairs with door shut and it still works!  On the low volume setting it was still too loud, so I put a piece of duck tape over the speaker and put in basement stairwell with door shut and I can still hear it fine.  Now the not so good news, it does go off when the neighbors cat goes by it (which is usually in the middle of the night) and I now know that the deer cross my front yard at 5 a.m. every morning!  Other than that, I would recommend this product!
