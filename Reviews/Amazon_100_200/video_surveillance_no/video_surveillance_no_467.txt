Catches squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, house-cats, birds, pickups, etc.  I used the default settings and had good results the first time.If you set it up aimed at bushes or grass, the sensor will pick up the grass moving in the breeze.  I found this out when I had 10,000 pictures to go through the third time I set it up.  However, after a week and all these pictures, The batteries were still showing mostly full, so I was pretty impressed with the battery life.  It also survived a couple rainy days.Cons: the infra-red led's are very visible at night.  The trail-cam may go unnoticed during the day, but becomes very obvious to anyone at night.
