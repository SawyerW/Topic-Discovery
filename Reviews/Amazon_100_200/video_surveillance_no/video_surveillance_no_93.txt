I bought two of these items. Two entrances to my home are not near immediate living areas, and I've always been a little concerned that I would not hear anything if anyone ever tried to break in. Installing the batteries was easy, and setup is simply placing these in a way that the sensor bar would be pushed down when a door is opened. It also keeps the door from being opened because of its wedge design.Well, these things work great! The door gets blocked, and the alarm is piercing! Just the thing to scare off a would be intruder. I like that there is an "off" button" on the unit, to prevent you from accidentally blowing out your own eardums if you depress the bar while moving it. But, that didn't stop me LOL...I did accidentally try to open my basement door recently, forgetting the wedge was there. The door wouldn't open, and the alarm scared the daylights out of me! Made me laugh because I was embarrassed that I forgot it was there, but made me even more pleased with the purchase. Such an easy and simple way to add a little more security to one's home.
