I received my remote control deadbolt and had it installed and working within an hour. Just follow the directions to the letter and you should have no problem...the instructions are a little sparse but the illustrations are good. Now for the remotes...if they were a little better I would have given 5 stars. They are very cheaply made...now don't get me wrong...they work...just you may have to push the button 2 or 3 times...mostly twice for me. Since I haven't had them too long I can't say how long they will last...but it wouldn't surprise me if they lasted only six months. They are however cheap to replace. Anyway lock performs great...remote has a decent range (30 - 40 feet) just hope the remote lasts longer than it looks.
