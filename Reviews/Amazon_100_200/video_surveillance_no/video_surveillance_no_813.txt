I bought the 750e system with one additional 700e camera. All were delivered on time and in great condition. I was able to quickly setup the system ( you have to open the power unit & camera to install the LAN cable). After installing the software on my computer - I installed the unit into my Linksys router. The software picked up the camera with no problem. I then powered up the second camera - the software picked it up too. This verified the system was working perfectly. I then installed each camera outside - by drilling into the mortar between bricks - and using the included hardware was able to set the camera up to the viewing that I wanted. I then ran the LAN cables to an outlet I put in my attic - it all came up and worked perfectly. I setup motion activation/email notifications - and they worked too.All I have to say is - this is a great system - it's worth the price. I have owned other logitech devices and had no problems with reliability - so I hope this is the same.
