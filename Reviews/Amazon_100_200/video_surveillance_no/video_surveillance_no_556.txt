There's no need to be an expert to use this video camera: just charge both camera and monitor, synchronize them and that's it!PROS: Very good image and easy to set up. Auto night vision feature works perfectlyCONS: There's a constant background noise, nothing that would really bother me except for the fact that it prevents VOX feature to work, as it is sufficient to keep turning the monitor on each time it goes off. Battery life could be better, specially using night vision (2,5h as stated by the manufacturer). Talk back function should have volume adjust, too.The camera's power adapter presented problems on the 4th day of use. Sometimes it charges the camera, sometimes not. Until now I was not able to figure out what the problem is. As I brought it to Brazil, I guess it would cost me a fortune to return it to the seller, but I will try to contact customer service anyway.
