I moved from Wisconsin to an apartment in Phoenix with my family. Let's just say I did not know what the neighborhood was like prior to moving. So for how much this cost me, I feel just a bit safer. For a two bedroom apt. it is just enough for the windows, patio and front door. For peace of mind, great buy. Very easy to install!The only reason it is rated at 4 stars is because one of the window alarms. The chime mode does not work and I placed it the same as in the other window and when I turn on the "alarm" sound it goes off, even though it's less than 1/2 inch placement. No one can get up to our windows anyway, so I am not too worried about it.
