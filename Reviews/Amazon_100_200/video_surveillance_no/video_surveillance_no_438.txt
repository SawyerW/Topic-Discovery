EXCELLENT value for the money! We've never had a trail cam before so I was kind of flying blind when we bought this one. Night time picture quality could be better but for under $100 it does exactly what we need it to do. Only thing I'd recommend is be sure to set the camera to only one picture per motion sensed. I had mine set to three as I was afraid I'd miss some action but in 24 hours it had taken 1,342 pictures I had to sort through. They were all good pictures, even caught a big coon, probably 50lbs or more and numerous bluejays, squirrels, and Turkeys. I would buy this again in a heartbeat and may buy a second to cover other spots. Buy a second SD card, that way you can just swap them out.
