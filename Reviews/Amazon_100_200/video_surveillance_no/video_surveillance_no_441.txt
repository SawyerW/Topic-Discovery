The camera has been set up only three days and nights so far. It has captured clear daytime images of rabbits and pretty good infrared-illuminated black-and-white images of a coyote in the yard at 2:30 am. Looks as if nighttime range is at least 20 feet, maybe a good deal more. I have taken photos off the camera twice now and onto a Linux-OS PC and used the PC to delete the images on the SD card. Worked fine. Most of the photos were deleted from the PC then because they were of me walking by or were otherwise uninteresting. Did get a photo of the back half of a coyote as he passed by so there may be a wake-up time issue in some instances. Will try other areas of the yard. Still have some deer and javalina pictures to take.
