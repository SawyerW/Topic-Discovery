When my TruthCam arrived, I was ready to try it out but it would not read the SD card that I bought with it.  I tried a different SD card that I use on my other camera and that wouldn't work either.  The screen just kept flashing  "-SD-" no matter what I did.  I tried formatting the cards on my computer, then formatting them in the camera they still would not workSo I went on Google and searched for solutions and discovered that this is a known issue with this model.  Primo does not offer any type of technical support for this product either unless you purchase it directly from them, in which case they will mail you a replacement camera.  Thankfully Amazon shipped me a new one but I am still very disappointed and concerned that you will not get any help from the manufacturer if your TruthCam happens to malfunction.That all said when it works it does just as advertised.  The night vision cabality is superior for the price.  But take great care with the SD card slot and be sure to avoid getting dirt inside of it or you will end up with a door stop.
