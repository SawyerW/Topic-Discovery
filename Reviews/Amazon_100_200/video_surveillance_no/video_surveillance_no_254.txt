I use these for hunting, they are very comfortable.  Clear hearing and transmission.  You do lose a some outdoor hearing in the ear that they are in as expected, however, the trade off is that they stay in all day even through tough thickets and extreme mobility.  Microphone clips to your shirt or jacket in an easy to use position even with gloves.  There are 2 things that you need to know about this style, one is that in extreme cold weather the flexable plastic may become stiff and less flexable, and two during snowing or freezing weather snow or the condensation from your breath can cause the microphone to ice up causing you to have to warm it or dry it to work properly again.  The quick fix for this was to keep it tucked inside the jacket for protection from the elements. This is my second set as I had to lend one to my hunting buddy and he won't give it back!
