I purchased this camera shortly after I interrupted thieves breaking into my house.  Luckily, they (a man and a woman) ran when I yelled as they were coming through the sliding glass door they had just broken out.I received the first camera one day after ordering.  The camera failed immediately.  I called Logitech they agreed the camera was faulty so I returned it to Amazon and received a replacement within two days.  I installed it under an eve and it works great.  I receive alerts and have videos when there is movement in the zones I created.I would like to replace this camera with the outside version, but it is not available.  With the two cameras, I will be able to cover most of my property.  Just the sight of the camera's blinking red light when someone enters the alert zone is a very good deterrence.I would rate this 5 stars if the first camera had not failed.
