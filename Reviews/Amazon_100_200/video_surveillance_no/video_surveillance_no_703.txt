I was skeptical at first.But I bought two, and put in a RAID1 mirror config, in a 8-drive raid box with 2 x multilane infiniband interfaces and a RocketRaid card.The 64MB cache is noticeable, totally.  It is not hype. On average, I get 100MB/sec copying across a gigabit network in the LAN from one machine to this RAID volume.  In a similar test (using the same source machine, to a volume of 750GB AAKS', I get ~82MB/sec across the wire.  Again, the cache is noticeable in my tests.I am amazed at the quality of this drive.I recommend these drives to anyone who needs to use a RAID config, and needs capacity, and reliability.I only use WD, period.I currently own 46 hard drives, all WD.The only WD hard drive I ever had fail, was a green 750GB one.The older AAKS series was phenomenal, and these are the new ones to get!(I have had drives fail a great deal using other manufacturers)appdevman
