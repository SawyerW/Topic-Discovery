It's the first game camera I ever purchased so I can't compare it with any others.  I noticed it does make a little noise when taking nightime pictures but doesn't seem to bother the game. I wasn't aware that the LED's light up red when taking night pictures which I think the deer notice, I just really didn't know how it worked but I do now.  Had to set the sensitivity to the highest setting for it to capture any pictures.  I think it takes great pictures, a few slightly blurry ones at night.  Takes color pics during the day and black and white at night.  For the price and reliability, I like it enough that I have two now.
