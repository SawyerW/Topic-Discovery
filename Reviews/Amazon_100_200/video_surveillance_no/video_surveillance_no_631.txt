My wife and I welcomed twin boys into our lives in September so I figured a decent baby monitor was in order. This monitor was easy to set up but I found two things disappointing:1. There is a constant hum through the audio of the camera to the monitor. Not enough to prevent you from hearing what's happening on the camera side, but enough to be a nuisance.2. The battery life on the camera is not great. I understand that having it connecting to a power cord creates a hazard, but the poor battery life and the annoying beeping sound that comes when it runs out stinks.Overall, its OK. We got it on sale, but I would tell you to look elsewhere until the product is improved.
