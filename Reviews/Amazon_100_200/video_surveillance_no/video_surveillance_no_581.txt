Overall:Very good, I really recommend this Baby Monitor, by far is the best choice in the range of prices, just be careful when you place the handheld on the charging station and  don't expect a good pic using the snapshot function.Pros:The Video quality is very goodThe Walkie-talkie function is great when you need to chat with MomThe USB port is compatible with old BB chargersVery Compact and easy to operateThe Night vision works very wellCons:Is hard to stand on the charging station, actually I break a connector trying to place the handheld on the base at midnight when the baby started to cry.The Battery doesn't last so much, in my case 1 hour Max.The range is acceptable, but is reduced if other Wireless device are on the areaThe Snapshot quality is extremely poor
