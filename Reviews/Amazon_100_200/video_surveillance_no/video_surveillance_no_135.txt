I am very impressed with the quality of design and construction -- especially given the price.  You can adjust to shoot from just about any angle and the suction cup system with the locking clamp is very secure.  I am not concerned about it breaking free with an expensive video camera attached.  As noted in other reviews, if you are using a larger camera you may need the optional extension arm that is visible in some of the customer pictures.  Panavise will ship you one for free if you contact their customer service number shown on the instruction sheet.  Their CS was very pleasant to deal with, but you will need to have the unit with you to read off the Patent number.
