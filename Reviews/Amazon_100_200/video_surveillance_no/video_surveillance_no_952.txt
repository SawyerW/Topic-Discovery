I actually bought two of these cameras from Logitech and they have very clear video with none of the lines and static you get with wireless cameras.  The commander software does a good job of controlling the cameras and it is very nice to be able to control and view remotely.  There are improvements that could be made to the software but it does what most people will want to do.  The premium service seems to be mostly sending you text alerts with a snapshot attached.  The exact benefits of the premium service are never explained in a clear manner so you might want to call and talk to one of the Logitech support people before you purchase it.  The one glaring problem I see is the much touted Android app to view and control the cameras does not appear to exist.  I have tried for two days to locate it and cannot.  I think it does not actually exist.I have found that you will need some third party software like BlueIris if want a lot of usable functions.
