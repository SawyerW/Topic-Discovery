i installed the 750e alert security system a few days ago and i loved it. setup was simple. day time picture quality is excellent. the email alert is awesome. found 2 flaws however; night vision and possibly the reliability. night vision was kind of disappointing. picture quality wasn't very good. system is not as reliable as i had hoped. system has been installed for 2 days and i wake up to a camera that can't be found. i had to reboot my computer for an upgrade to be installed. not good at 4am when i need you most. i am hoping its a fluke. i will keep the system for a little while longer and hope for the best.
