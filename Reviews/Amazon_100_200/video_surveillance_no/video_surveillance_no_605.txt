I bought this baby monitor after reading the Amazon reviews.  Other than problems with range, I'm happy with it.  The specs indicate a range of 450 ft line of sight, which might be accurate.  However, we have a two storey house (2000 sq ft per floor) and the range does not allow transmission from the baby's room upstairs (roughly in the front-middle) to rooms on the main floor at the ends of the house, let alone outside or in the basement.  After a few months of use, I decided to buy the Motorola 3.5" video monitor.  With that one, I can be over 400 ft away outside, past the neighbors house and still get a couple bars. Except for condos / small houses for indoor use, avoid the Lorex monitor.
