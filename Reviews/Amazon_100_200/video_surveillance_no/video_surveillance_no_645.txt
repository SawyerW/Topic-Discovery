The idea behind this product is great!!  I love the idea of the quad view!  I want to be able to see all my children at once if I want to.  the biggest problem with this product is the "beeping" that happens during the white noise.  It was very annoying when you were trying to sleep and listen to your children - and I will not turn the volume down, because isn't that the purpose of a monitor???Also this product would not work with what we were trying to accomplish (unfortunately we are having a VERY hard time trying to find a product that would be conducive to our needs).  I am looking for a monitor that I can see and hear all three of my children all night long (one child has asthma, one sleep apnea & the third a heart condition)- so to do that we had to purchase 3 whole monitor/camera sets.  When we tried to set two up - the beeping noise was more than we could bear and there was constant interferance between the two.  We are still looking for the perfect monitor set!!  This was not it - sorry.
