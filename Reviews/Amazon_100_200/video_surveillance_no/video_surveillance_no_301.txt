Let me clarify my title by saying that chime and sensors work fine.  If you're going to use this product, you MUST USE THE SCREWS, NOT THE DOUBLE SIDED TAPE.In the morning, I installed the sensor using the included double sided tape to the door and door frame of my business.  I plugged in the chime, and successfully tested the unit, up to 30 feet away from the sensor.  All would have been fine, except that the double sided tape failed.The poor rating comes from the poor customer service that soon followed afterwards.  In less than four hours, I noticed that the double sided tape failed, and one half of the sensor was on the floor.  The other half was gone forever, probably kicked out the door by a customer.  The adhesive on the double sided tape itself was plenty sticky, as evidenced by the residue left on the door frame.  The tape itself separated, causing the sensor to drop.I called customer service to report the problem.  They took my information and tole me a replacement sensor was on it's way.  Four weeks later and two follow-up phone calls, I still don't have a replacement sensor.
