This is a very well engineered product but I thought it would work with any camcorder or camera that has a tripod mount hole. Wrong. It will only work with cameras that have the threaded hole on the top of the camera.  Most cameras/camcorders I have seen have the hole on the bottom. In desparation, I mounted my camera upside down, and found software to rotate the captured videos to right side up. I noticed later that the feature description states that the mount is for CCTV cameras. All that said, I used the mount for my camera mounted in my car's windshield when I did laps at a racetrack and it worked perfectly. Except that I had to purchase QuickTime Pro software in order to view the video right side up.
