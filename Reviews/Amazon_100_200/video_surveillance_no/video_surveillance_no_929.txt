I own this system as well as the outdoor cam with night vision.  They have both failed in less than a year.  I was able to get a replacement for the outdoor cam as it failed within the first six months. The indoor cam failed close to a year and I didn't get the warranty information sent in time to get a replacement.Very expensive to replace each year!!!I'm not going to buy a new one.  I recommend that you find a less expensive product and a company that stands behind their product.  Not a happy logitech customer!  I'll support another company that will support their product and customers.
