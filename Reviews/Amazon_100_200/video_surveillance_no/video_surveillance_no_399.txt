I wish I could attach photos taken by this camera.  If I could, none of the words here would be necessary.  The camera is strapped to a tree about five feet from a water trough in a pretty isolated part of our property. It captures birds during the day, and deer, raccoons, skunks, and bobcats at night.  It's taken hundreds of photographs day and night without measurably reducing the battery charge.  With an 8 Gb SD card, it looks like I could leave it alone for at least a week and not miss anything.  It captures temperature, date and time with each photo, which turns out to be useful information. All in all, I can't think of anything I would change -- particularly the price.
