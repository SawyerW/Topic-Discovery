I bought these less than a year ago to put in our two children's' bedrooms.  Overall the technology is great.  The camera's have a clear picture and the audio is good too.  However, we have had to have the handset replaced because the plug connection came loose inside and the handset couldn't be recharged. One of the cameras started malfunctioning about a two months ago and they had me return the handset and sent me a new one.  This did not fix the problem.  I have to now return one of the cameras and it will have to be replaced.  The customer service has been slow to respond and difficult to get a live person.  I have been very frustrated by not getting timely responses and now have had a malfunctioning unit for about 4 months.  They have still not fixed the problem.  They keep sending me parts of the system and I am having to wait for replacements so I don't have a working system with two young children.  For the cost of these units I would expect a better product in the first place.Lorex LW2003 LIVE snap Video Baby Monitor (White)
