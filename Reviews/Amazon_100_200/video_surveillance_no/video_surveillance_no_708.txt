Purchased these drives for a RAID 1 array paired with a Synology 211 NAS.Synology DiskStation 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS211 (White)  These drives have the TLER function for running in a RAID array and are listed as compatible and recommended by Synology.  The failure rate of these drives are extremely low because they are < 1TB (larger drives tend to have higher failure rates at the time I am writing this review).  Also, since these are part of the Enterprise line of hard drives, the MTBF is considerably higher than the consumer class drives.  Perfect for a NAS with precious files!!!Consistency/Parity check and S.M.A.R.T. check passed no problem on two drives purchased.  Each drive arrived in a cardboard box (sealed with packaging tape).  Inside each box was a single drive inside of sealed anti-static packaging, with plastic risers encasing the drive so it wouldn't bang around during transit.  I wish every drive shipped this way!  No screws, cables, etc.. didn't need them.  If you do, be sure to order some!
