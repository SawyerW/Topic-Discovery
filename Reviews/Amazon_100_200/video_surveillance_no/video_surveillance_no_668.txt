I wish I had thought of this, but I'm not a techie. Works great and really simulates real TV lights. Lv the fact it takes little electricity and has different settings. I leave it on all the time with the on at dusk for four hours setting...Also purchased Rex Plus doggie alarm. What a great combo. Rex sounds like our dog that went cuckoo every time the door bell rang. Makes me homesick for her, but scares the delivery guys. I always apologize to them for my crazy dog that just I put in the garage (turned off Rex). I also bought beware of dog signs for the windows. With Fake TV, Rex and the signs, I feel that snatch and grab burglars will pick easier prey, and I also feel safe and rather proud of myself. Thanks to these inventive product producers.STI ED-50 Rex Plus Electronic Watchdog, Barking Dog Alarm
