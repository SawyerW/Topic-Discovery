I was sceptical at first, but after reading the reviews others had posted I decided to take a chance on this camera. Within minuts of opening the box I had the camera set up and ready to go to work. The following day I took it to our hunting land in centeral Georgia and mounted it on a small sweet gum tree. The following day I had 181 pix! I then changed the timing of the shots. The quality of the pix were as good as I expected.The battery life is excellent. I have recomended this camera to a couple friends and will be purchasing another for myself for next season.Pleasantly pleased,Scott
