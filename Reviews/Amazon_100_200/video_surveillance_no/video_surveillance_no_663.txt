I would have given this unit stars if it had the ability to be on from dusk to dawn etc. Statistically most break-ins happen between 3-4:30am, so thus ill have to put it on a seperate timer to reach those times. Overall i think its a great invention. It does look like the tv is ON which is the goal. It hardly cost nothing to run per year which is great. We use it when we are home as well and have it in one of the rooms. Which serves too as a great night light as well. Casting enough light to make it to the rest room. I laugh to myself on this because its a clever idea but like anything. If you can add a good watch dog, outdoor motion lighting, have a gun, install securty with cameras too with a few signs. With all these 99% of the bad guys will most certainly go down to the street.
