I set up the camera for the first time with  new batteries and a new SD card.  I went back 2 1/2 weeks later and it had taken over 19,000 photos of NOTHING in 3 days and wore those new batteries down to 10% and filled the SD card!  I called Primos and was told I had to return the camera at my own expense to have it looked at, but it sounded like a trigger problem!  I lost new batteries and 2 weeks of camera time! Thank God for Amazon's return policy so I was able to return it to them.  I have a replacement coming and will decide whether the one I received was a bad camera, or whether the Truth Cam 35 is a bad camera!
