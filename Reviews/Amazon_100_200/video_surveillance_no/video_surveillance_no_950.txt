This is a capable system when working; however, I have an Android based phone with the recent Jelly Bean update and have not had play back capability since this update several months ago.  I and others have input the issue into the Logitech support system and they say they're working on it... for the past 4 months.A similar problem occurred with the prior Android update but it didn't take this long to issue a fix.  As Android phones are more numerous than Apple's IOS you would think the market would get the attention it needs.  My suggestion, search the Logitech support site for operating system issues before spending your money.  I have a 5 camera system and have sunk enough capital into this.
