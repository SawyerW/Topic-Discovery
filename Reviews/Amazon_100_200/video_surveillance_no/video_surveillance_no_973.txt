I had the old wilife system and it was clunky and unreliable.  Ultimately I abandonned it.  After a couple years I had a need for a single camera system so I decided to give the latest logitech security camera system another try.  I haven't yet been able to test it out because when the software loads it defaults to writing its files in the all users account but then, because that is not an administrator account it won't load, displays an error message and closes.I'm sort of baffled that a company like logitech would build such an obvious flaw into its software.  I've (painfully) written to tech support (you have to create a user account and practically give them a dna sample to ask a question) and will update this review when/if I hear from them.Until there is a fix, however, I would not buy this product if you have more than one user account on your system.Updated 1/5/13 - Logitech Support has responded with further questions.  Will update the review as solutions are attempted.
