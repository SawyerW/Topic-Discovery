This is just a quick little review. We agonized over which video monitor to buy to keep an eye on our kid as we are now in a 2 story place. This thing has been perfect. Clarity is sharp, range is great and night vision is just phenomenal. The battery isn't an all day battery but it lasts a while. Wife dropped the receiver, not a problem. The camera isn't a very wide angle so you have to find the sweet spot to see your whole crib, but we were able to do just that. The talk to your kid function is great and a lot of fun.
