I have used two of the large door alarms for 2 months now and I am now sleeping much better knowing I will be alerted to any intrusion into my mobile home. I purchased a single door alarm separatly for my second door. The alarms are much louder than I expected and will instantly wake me from a heavy sleep. I would reccomend using the screws to install the alarms as the stick ons could come loose and the alarm falls off and alarm sounds when this happens. The window alarms are not as loud as the door alarms but still work well. Again, the alarms exceeded my expectation.
