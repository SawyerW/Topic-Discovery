When I first received this, it worked great!  I would have given it 5 stars.  After the first month of use, quality started degrading, at the 6 month point, I could not keep it connected for more than a few minutes at a time.  I did all of the standard stuff (when I could get it to connect)...checked network, powerline strength, camera bandwidth and everything was fine.  This past week, it finally gave out totally and camera is dead to the world.  This is the 10th month after I bought this brand new from Amazon.I have contacted Logitech support and not only nothing back from them, but after sitting on hold twice, for 20 minutes each time, they pick up and immediately disconnect...I tried creating an account on their site and submitting a support ticket and yet still no response.  There customer support feels like a startup that is out to make a quick buck and then go out of business...If I do get any resolution from Logitech, I will update here.  If I have not heard back in another couple of days, I will contact Amazon and see if I can get their assistance.
