The PYLE PLCM22IR Flush Mount Rear View Camera with 0.5 Lux Night Vision for the price this camera is OK. At day light the vision quality is good but at night with lights at the back the vision is acceptable and with no ligths at he back the vision is unacceptable. I also have a backup sensor installed and that's makes me feel more secure at the time of backup at night time. Some time ago I had been hit from the back (It was not a Big impact) and the impact was not over the camera, but after that, the Video comes with some distorsions or interferences. But the my daily issue is the dust and dirty that the camera gets on the crystal, so in the Night is a big deal beacuse view is blocked. Thank You...
