I was looking for a mount for the baby monitor video camera and this seemed to fit the bill.  It has a lot of mounting options, several extension tube lengths included, so it was easy to get the correct position for the monitor.  It's made with some heavy duty metal, so it feels solid......except for the ballhead it comes with.  It seems like it should work well, but it's the worst, most finicky ballhead I've ever used.  Granted, it was cheap, but getting it to stay in one spot was troublesome.  I should have gone with a GorillaPod or something and mounted the camera directly to the crib rail.  Once you have the ballhead tightened up enough to keep everything in place, do NOT touch it, as any slight bump seems to knock the ballhead loose again.
