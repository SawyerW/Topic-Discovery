I recieved this in the winter, by the time I had expected. I did not get around to installing it until summer, well out of my return window (that part is my fault). It installed easily.Sensor appears to work, light flashes indicating it "sees" me. Reciever and alarm do not work.At first, with just batteries I had no response from the unit at all. I then plugged it in, red lights appeared. Also a hot smell and faint smoke. I unplugged it immediatly. Did not feel hot. Plugged it back in some time later. No smoke, no lights, no response at all.Total waste of time and money.
