The plus on this camera is the quality of the photos it takes, the minus is it's size. It takes "D" cell batteries and the camera itself is really big and bulky so it can hold such big batteries. You can't hide something this big, so I would be reluctant to put it out where it might get seen and stolen. It works for us because we use it for a campground camera, and even at that it might make an attractive item to steal. The bigger the tree you strap it too the less obvious it is and it's hard to strap to anything else. For instance you can't strap it to the legs on a fifth wheel. We tried, it just slides down to the ground. It doesn't have a threaded hole for a tripod, but it does have recessed threads on the back for some kind of optional mount, sold separately, of course.  All in all it's a trade off, picture quality against size and bulk. The pictures do not prepare you for it's size.
