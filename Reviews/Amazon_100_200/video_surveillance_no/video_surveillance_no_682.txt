It's much smaller than it looks in the pix which would be fine if the light output was as bright as I expected. It doesn't fill the room with as much light as a TV would so the conditions have to be just so to get a convincing effect.I have achieved what I need but I think I got lucky. I happen to have semi opaque white paper shades that catch and diffuse the light perfectly. Anything other than that I'm not sure would work.All in all, it works well for me and have bought two more for my lake house and spare bedroom.
