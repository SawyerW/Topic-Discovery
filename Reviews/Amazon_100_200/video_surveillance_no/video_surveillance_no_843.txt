I have used this product for almost a month, and the camera was Easy to setup with my network. So far, so good. The product performed as I wanted it to. I was able to capture video of an intruder, a few days after I set it up. I have set up motion detector lights around the perimeter of house (front and back yard), as well as solar lighting (all through Amazon at a reasonable price). All in all, I am happy with my purchase and feel much safer, for myself and household members. This is my first purchase for a surveillance camera, so I do not have anything else to compare it to. Works well at night (night vision). I cannot see details of person face, however, I can see shape and form and movement well. Thank you!
