I purchased this suction mount to position a portable 7" LCD monitor at the helm of my boat. Drilling holes into the helm to permanently mount the monitor was not a strategy that interested me. This product was perfect for my application. The LCD monitor is being used as a repeater display for my portable PC based marine chartplotter/navigation system.  This suction mount is very stable, durable, and flexible as far as variable positioning is concerned.  With a flip of the suctioning lever I can quickly detach the monitor from the helm and put my portable navigation system away for safe storage or use the components for another purpose. I also use this mount to attach the same 7" monitor to my truck windshield to display my PC based GPS road navigation system.  Excellent product that I highly recommend.
