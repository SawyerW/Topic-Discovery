This motion detection system work great for the price. Batteries last a long time and the detector is fairly unnoticeable. It has both a light indicator and an audible alarm when motion is detected, even at a good distance. The only thing that annoys me is that it has two audible tones, loud and even louder, and it rings about 5 to 15 times, which can't be turned off. You also can by two systems and use both detectors with the same receiver. I am going to open one receiver and disable the speaker and then use that receiver to be notified of motion just with the light indicator, and use the other receiver with the loud horn only when needed.
