I bought these for airsofting and they ended up working perfectly. The earpiece never came out of my ear. Even with my goggle strap covering my ear, the earpiece was not uncomfortable. I wear a vest rig, and i clip the ptt to my vest and it stayed put during the whole day of playing. I can easily push to talk and not have to worry about taking my eyes off the field. The sound quality is clear and can actually be on the loud side. Be careful, with which midland radio you have. I had one older model and i bought the newer LXT114 from amazon. The headset worked in both, but it would only work clearly with the LXT114. The older model (LXT110) would chirp while trying to transmit. The Evox setting seemed to work in the older model, but it was too sensitive and people could hear whenever you were running and breathing hard.  We ended up buying another set of the LXT114 so we could use the headsets. I would recommend a vest rig if you are going to use these for airsoft, it keeps al the wires and radio nice and neat while playing.
