There are a lot of things I like about this monitor such as being able to watch the 4 rooms of my children as well as talk to them through the monitor. The picture quality is decent as well. However, this is the second monitor of this kind that I have had in the past 2 1/2 years and it now broken. Both have broken the same way. The hand held portion plugs into a base. When I put the hand held on the base the connector actually breaks off and goes up inside the monitor. It is then unusable because it can't be charged. I would consider this a defect in the product and wouldn't recommend buying it.
