Bought this for an upcoming road trip and tested it today.  While the suction mount is incredibly strong, the combination of this with the 812-03 extension, my car (Mazda Miata) and camera (Canon PowerShot SX230HS) produced abysmal results during at <30 m.p.h. test in my subdivision.  Camera shake was horrendous even with the lens zoomed to full wide-angle and the image stabilization set to continuous.  Granted, the Miata doesn't have a sofa-glide ride but the video I took looked like the camera was hand-held by someone who had overdosed on caffeine.  Works fine for stationary applications but that's not what I bought it for.  Unit returned.
