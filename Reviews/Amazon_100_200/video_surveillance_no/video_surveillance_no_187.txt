this item is great for apartment living and i highly recomend this product, front door alarm is ear pearcing and if you have it at ear level you will hear ringing for a couple of days, window alarms arent bad either there perfect for a one story apartment as i would hear them out of a dead sleep.wich is why i bought this product, my toddler can now open doors and the door chime feature is perfect and u can set all of the alarms to chime if thats what u need then easily flip a button to alarm great product
