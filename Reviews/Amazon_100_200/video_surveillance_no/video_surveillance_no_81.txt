Bought this to use in our hotel room while we were on vacation. Works no matter which way the door goes. Bought it because we were taking my dad with dementia with us and we wanted to be alerted in case he got confused and tried to wander away during the night. Fortunately we didn't have to hear it go off during our vacation but I did test it out at home beforehand and holy crap its LOUD! Would probably wake up everyone on your floor in a hotel. I'm a pretty hard sleeper (as a child, I once slept through an earthquake!) but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't ever sleep through this thing! It's also super light and portable, just toss it in your purse/luggage, no big deal.
