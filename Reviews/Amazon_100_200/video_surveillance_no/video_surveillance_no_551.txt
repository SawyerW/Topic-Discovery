The best baby monitor I have ever owned. Yes, the packaging is a little misleading because the picture quality isn't as good as the box and photo represents, but it's still quite good and does a very good job at providing crystal clear video at night and during the day. I have 2 cameras which allow me to choose between watching my baby in his crib or his playroom, and I use the intercom system to lull him back to sleep if he wakes up too early from a nap or in the middle of the night. After purchasing this monitor for myself, I bought 2 more for friends' baby showers and encouraged my mother to do the same (she did). Before this, I had the $179.00 Summer Infant brand I bought at Target -- what a ripoff! For almost 50.00 less, I get double the features and a much better picture out of the Lorex brand than the "cutesy" (read: flimsy, cheap, plastic) baby monitors they sell at Target & Babies R Us.
