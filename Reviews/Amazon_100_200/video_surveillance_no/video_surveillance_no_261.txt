Using this with the Midland GXT1000s.Was a little worried after reading some of the reviews about the lenght of the cord for the ptt clip.  I find the lenght easily long enough for putting nearly anywhere that makes sense. Plus the clip slides up and down the cord. Perhaps they changed the design? Anyway, it is exactly what I wanted.Ear piece is pretty small and extremely comfortable. I put it in for an extended period of time without pressure point issues and I typically hate all ear bud head phones because I'm so sensitive to ear fatigue. Another nice thing about the ear piece is you can still hear outside sound extremely well, but when someone talks to you through the two way radios it comes in loud and clear.The only big thing left for me to judge is durability. I'll likely edit this review after some serious use. For $21 this is a no brainer. Increadible value IMHO.
