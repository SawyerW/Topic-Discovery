LOVE this monitor. I have two boys ages 6 and 5 that share a room. They were misbehaving at night and had to be separated to different rooms. I told my husband I wished a baby monitor was made that I can see my boys, talk to my boys and they could talk back to me. This is an answer to my prayers! There is night vision on this unit as well. I am thinking about getting an add on camera for my baby. You can add on 3 additional cameras if you want. It is a must have for children of all ages that you need to keep a closer eye on. Amazon has this priced lower than ANYONE else so don't hesitate..buy today!Update-had a problem with the charger and the manufacturer replaced the whole unit right away! We still love this after several months and just bought the add on camera for another room! LOVE THIS!!
