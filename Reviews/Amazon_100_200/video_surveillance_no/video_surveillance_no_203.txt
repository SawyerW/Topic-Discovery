I did read all the reviews so I decided to try an inexpensive alarm system to be used in my apartment after a few days of activating on/off I noticed that it did to work at all seriously is a waste of money $30 dlls is not much but at least you can use this money to buy something better,. The windows alarm is laud enough to scare the thieves unless that is in the middle of the night it may be effective however the door alarm doesn't work as Described, also it shall be installed right on the door so is so easy to destroyed in no time for somebody break into your property.  Please try something else perhaps more expensive I don't understand why people write such of great reviews for this useless system.
