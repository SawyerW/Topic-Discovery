I have a Linear MegaCode Garage Door Opener 318 Mhz (confirmed "MegaCode" by going to Linear website - If you have lost your instruction booklet).  Received the remotes (2 ordered) in small plastic bags with folded instructions.  I read the instructions, but they really were not needed for the opener that I have.  All you do is push the "Learn" button on the garage door opener and after the light flashes, push the button on the remote.  This caused the opener to flash a couple more times and that was all I needed.  It took literally 5 seconds from start to finish, if you were to ignore the part about reading the unnecessary instructions.  Great item that works and feels well built.
