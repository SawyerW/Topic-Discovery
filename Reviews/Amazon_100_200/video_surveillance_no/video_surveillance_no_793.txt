I just got the product up and running this morning. So far it works great except for one minor problem. The video feed in the Commander software doesn't work for me. The cameras are working and recording video just fine, but it's not viewable in the software. I was hoping to remote in to my computer when I'm away to view live video (instead of using the mobile software) but without the video feed working that's not an option.Horrible customer service. I called Logitech support and his response was "Call Microsoft or your video card company. It's not a problem with our software otherwise we would have heard it from other users." No troubleshooting whatsoever. That's as far as their customer support got. Of course if I google the issue, there are others who have that problem. I'm running a high-end Nvidia video card with the latest drivers so it's hard to make the argument it's the video card's fault. Especially when everything else on my computer works fine. And even if it was the video card, doesn't Logitech want to solve the issue so I don't return their product???!
