I received one of the greatest customer services ever from logitech! The story as following:Purchased 1x 750 and 1x 700 and the power supply from the 750 died after about 2 months. Phoned in to find replacement but was out of stock? One day a VP of marketing? or CS emailed me and asked how are the units working for me. Wow a VP emailed? I told him the power supply died and I have not been able to use the unit for months. The answer I got was "It is in the mail" and I got the power supply the very next day! The wonderful thing was I did not have the warranty since I purchased the unit on eBay!!I also found the iphone/ipad app worked great and enabled me see what's going on while I was out of town. Initial setting was quite easy for me when i was running windows. There is a way to run it on mac with VMwear (NAT network). The recording is storing in my NAS drive with raid 5.
