The actual unit is cosmetically different from the image shown, but still white plastic with a shiny metal activator pad. It's about the size of the average doorstop, maybe a little larger. Should activate for doors with gaps up to about 1-3/4 in. above the floor without any modification. My gap is 1-1/2 in. and the door opens about 2-3 inches before it activates and jams. An intruder could defeat it pretty easily, but not after it had sounded for a few seconds, which is all I need it to do. It slipped on the painted concrete floor, so I cut a piece of old mousepad and put it on that, problem solved. Wear earplugs when testing it, as it is quite loud and shrill.
