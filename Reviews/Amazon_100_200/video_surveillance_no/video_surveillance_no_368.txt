I bought 3 of these almost two years ago.  They run flawlessly.Video image is great when viewing live through the Internet.  Sound is good, sensitive.I have the cameras set up to e-mail images to a Google e-mail account.  Still images of moving persons and dogs are usually blurred.The privacy mode can be turned on and off remotely.If for some reason you don't want to use the included service you can use a free dynamic DNS service that allows you access to the camera through the Internet.  The cameras are little web servers.  You aren't viewing a web site, you are tunneling to the camera itself.When co-workers see these in action they ask how much the service costs.  When I explain it is free they are surprised.I've never been able to get the multi-camera view to work through the Internet, but I suspect some configuration by my employer prevents it.
