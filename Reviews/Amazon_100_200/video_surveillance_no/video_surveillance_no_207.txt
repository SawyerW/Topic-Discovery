This is a must for any alarm system. Just the shock sensor alone won't give much protection. This way if someone is too nosy around your car it will do a few warning beeps and if they stay there the full alarm will go off.But it has to be adjusted correctly!Two things to remember when adjusting:1. It takes 20-30 seconds to fully arm and expand the radar circle. So don't just arm and step right up to the car, wait until it's fully armed and then test the sensitivity.2. After the warning has been triggered a few times, most DEI alarm systems lower the sensitivity to prevent false alarms. This makes adjusting nearly impossible. To "reset" the sensitivity, just turn the ignition on and off after every time you adjust the sensor.Just keep those two things in mind because they're not mentioned in the manual. Other than that just follow the manual and you'll be good.
