I like the 750e for the following reasons:  1) I can move it throughout my house; anywhere there is an AC outlet. I am not tied down to an Ethernet connection or wireless. 2) The camera is much better quality than the Swann 4 camera Costco system.  BUT there is only one camera vs. 4.  3) Setting the zones for recording desired areas vs.  eliminating certain areas is more precise.  I have the sensitivity set to maximum and can eliminate false alarms from trees blowing.  The camera will detect motion of a person 3oo ft. away.  It is very sensitive.  5) As far as remote monitoring,  I have an older laptop that I leave on  with Team Viewer software running.  I can log in and take control of the laptop to check the status and alarms.  Team Viewer is free for non-commercial use.  I avoid any fees.  And the laptop will survive a power outage and connect to the camera automatically.  6) The picture is very clear.  It does not zoom but allows the user to determine the field of view.  The wide angle lens works well for full field capture.  I would recommend it and buy another.
