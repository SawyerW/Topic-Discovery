The system does, essentially, what it purports to do. But at a very steep price.The problem is that you don't get anywhere near the number of cameras you need. Other systems recognize this and give you a reasonable number of cameras to start out with. In many situations, you may need nothing else. Logitech's approach is a la carte. You pay once, and then you pay again, and again, and again, and again, for each camera you need. Yes, the initial price is lower. But by the time you tack on a set of cameras, you're looking at a total far beyond what you would have paid for comparable systems from other manufacturers.
