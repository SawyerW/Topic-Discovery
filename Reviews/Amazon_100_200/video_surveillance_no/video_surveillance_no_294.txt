I ordered this unit to replace our broken Radio Shack door chime that served us in a commercial environment for about 10 years and is no longer made. This model was one of the few that had the features that we needed. We needed a door tripped sensor which wirelessly transferrs to the chime back in our offices so we could hear customers comming in to our store. The range is nowhere near the specified number. It works most of the time within about 15ft of the transmitter, but that won't work for our application. Even at 15ft it didn't work every time. We'd have customers standing in the showroom for awhile wondering if there was anybody there. It really sucks pretty bad. I don't recommend it. It's not reliable.
