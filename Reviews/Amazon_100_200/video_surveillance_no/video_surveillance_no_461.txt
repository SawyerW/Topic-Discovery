I bought two of these, one works the other did not.  It would not even turn on. The one that does work has been up for about a month. No complaints yet, but I don't know what the battery life is.  Could get expensive.  Also, these lower priced cameras DO NOT come with a memory card.  If you factor in the cost of buying a card after you get the camera, its probably best to spend a little extra.  Amazon return policy was very easy and the refund was prompt.  Manufacturer does not repair these cameras at any time, will only send a replacement so they must know they are crappy design.
