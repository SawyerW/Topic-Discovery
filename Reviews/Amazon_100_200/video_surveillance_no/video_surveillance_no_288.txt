This product works great. The reason I got it was because; tow trucks can easily take your car and escape with your car. But this product can notify as soon as they take of with the car, or even just jack your car off and take your rims. But anyways the only thing is not a plug in play with my alarm an auto page, but its simple to install it to any alarm. Since my alarm did not have a plug an play i just looked for the wires on the wiring diagram for my alarm luckily all my colors were the same from the tilt sensor red was to constant 12V, blue wire is for trigger, and orange is for ground when armed. But its simple to install all you going to need is wire taps.This is one great product to add, my next product to add is an audio sensor and a motion sensor. These little add on things well help your truck become the best anti theft vehicle out there.
