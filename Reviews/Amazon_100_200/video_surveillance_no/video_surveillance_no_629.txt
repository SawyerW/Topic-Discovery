Originally used an expensive Sharx wireless webcam as a baby monitor, using a laptop as the monitor.  Worked great, but then we decided to use a Droid phone as a monitor because it's smaller.  The phone would lose the video connection after an hour or so, in the middle of the night.  So decided to try this Lorex baby monitor out.  It works fine for our purpose, we set it to no video until the baby cries, then the video comes on for a minute to save battery power.  We've had the Lorex cam on for a month straight and it has never lost the video stream, so it's been reliable so far.  And it's portable for if we ever travel with the baby.  Recommended!
