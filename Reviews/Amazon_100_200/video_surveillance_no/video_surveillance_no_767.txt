This system is a great concept, and it seemed at first that the cameras were functioning properly. As time went by, however, problems either developed or just became apparent. My cameras do not function as advertized in the dark. They fail to send motion-activated pictures to my computer even when I have been moving about in plain view for a sufficient time to allow them to snap a picture. On other occasions they snap pictures when there is noting visible in the room. When they do work, the photos are often out of focus. As one review suggests, power outages may be a problem. Attempts to make adjustments using the control panel (Alert Commander) have failed to give me a better image so I have reset everything to their original conditions and hope that this makes them more useful.
