I own two of these units purchased new from 2 different sellers (retail store and Amazon)..The camera works well when it works. The image quality is good during the day (upto 640x480) and acceptable when it get darker (it has no night vision/infrared capabilities so is unusable at night).Motion detection also works well and the web interface allows you to view and manage the camera from any computer with a web browser.The main problem I have with this camera, however, is the wireless capability died on the first camera I got within 8 months (hard-line ethernet network still works but loss of Wifi capability severely limits placement locations). I thought this was just bad luck and continued operating the unit on the wired-ethernet.A few months later afterward however, the *2nd* camera's Wifi died.Hardware failure on one wifi chip in the camera may just be bad luck but failure in two different cameras indicates bad quality control. Googling this issue found many other users of this camera with the same problem so be aware of this issue if you plan on using the wireless capabiltities.
