I added sticky back Velcro to mine and use it for an alarm on my bedroom window.  I live on the 1st floor of an apartment building, and there are no security lights outside my windows.  I had one incident where someone cut my screen, raised my window, and then dashed off when they saw me sit up in bed.This inexpensive little gadget now is stuck to the inside of my top window, at a place where a body cannot fit through the opening.  Should anyone try to raise the bottom window I expect this nice instaneous LOUD ALARM will send them flying out of the area for good. I LOVE IT!
