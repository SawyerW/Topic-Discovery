When turned on, this works great.  I highly recommend it for travelers, to provide some extra security at night from unwanted visitors.  There are known vulnerabilities with a highly popular hotel electronic lock system, so the issue is not only someone able to obtain a master key.The only complaint I have is that the battery door requires a small screwdriver to open.  Most multitools will work, but I think it should be easier.The power switch is a small sliding switch, which means there is a risk it could get knocked in luggage and turned on.  You do not want this going off in your luggage.  So the only way to ensure this can't happen is to disconnect the 9V battery.  And that's why I would prefer it have a more accessible battery compartment (or a more robust/failsafe power switch).
