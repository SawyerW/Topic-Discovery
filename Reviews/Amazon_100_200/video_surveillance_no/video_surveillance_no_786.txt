This is a fun, easy to use system. I think it's perfect for parents who want to keep an eye on what's going on while they're away from home. I don't recommend it as highly for use as a security system in watching outside of your home.The pros:1. Easy to install and set up.2. Great picture quality.3. Captures motion instantly. You can set it up to alert you of motion on your computer and/or phone.4. If you don't want instant alerts, the camera will capture all motion in a snippet of video, which you can view at a later time.5. Great viewable range with the camera.6. You can zoom in and out remotely at any time with any of the cameras.The cons:1. Extremely sensitive to motion, which makes it difficult to use the alert function on the outdoor camera. If you have trees in the yard, the breeze blowing the leaves will set it off.2. The 'outdoor' camera is set up on the inside of a window. If you don't have a window pointing directly where you want to see, it's off no use.3. The night vision is dim, more shadowy figures than a clear picture.
