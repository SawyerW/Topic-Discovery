The picture is good, but there is NO audio out on the receiver and no 9v power supply.  Also the tuning knob is really a 4 button channel selector.  And why did they ship it with 3 nine-volt connectors and no AC adapter?  But hey, its amazing it works at all for this price.  And the receiver DOES work with a 9-v battery as does the camera.  I was able to get a decent picture more than 20 feet away behind a wall, more clear in the center than the edges, as long as it has adequate lighting.  I plan to use it for impromptu audience interviews and already have a wireless microphone I can tape this thing to, so it will do for now.  Pro-grade wireless cameras or bluetooth streamers sell for 10-x as much, so until prices drop, this is an OK product.
