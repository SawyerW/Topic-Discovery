For an IP camera it works very well, image quality is ok, very nice features (Infra Red night vision, Sound recording, email alerts) especially the remote viewing from my mobile phone.I am using 3 of them with a PoE switch which means you only need one cable to power and transfer data from the camera. Faced no issues with installation or running so far.There is also a good user forum provided by Logitech, which answered a lot of my technical questions before I decided to buy.The commander software is good, it allows easy reviewing of recorded video and management of the cameras.An improvement that could be added is faster FPS (Currently it is 15 frames per second - at least 30 fps would offer better viewing or motion). Hopefully this could be something that could be changed in the camera firmware, as when you install the camera the commander software checks the firmware and updates it if required.
