I installed this sensor's mic on the middle upside of the rear glass of my Corolla with the supplied 2 sided tape.  The receiver at the trunk so it could be visible when it's opened and therefore easier to calibrate.  The microphone picks sounds of highwave frequencies and triggers (-) into the blue wire (you can try hitting a glass bottle with some metal).  it's simple, all the work I've to do was running a blue cable from the dash to the trunk. I just installed at back because thieves tend to break the rear door little triangle glass, instead of the larger door glasses, this works for them in many cases without triggering the full alarm, because shock sensor don't always pick 'shocks' from the back of the car when pressed toward using force on the door.  Don't spec to see a big glass to be broken!! that will make a lot of noise and vibration to the car, so alarm with be on!!! only desperate theft fall in this category.  I recommend this item, it offers more security to your car and all your valued items inside.
