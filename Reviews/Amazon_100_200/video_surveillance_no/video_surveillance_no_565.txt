This monitor was great for approximately 24 hrs.  It came ready to use right out of the box. Just plug in the camera and set up it up. Quite a cinch. The next night it decided to 'unpair' and would not stayed paired after repeated trials. Customer Service was not at all helpful in advising to do the same thing over and over again, yet, no resolution was achieved. This product may have been a lemon but already owning a more superior product precluded exchanging it to try again.When it did work, the portability was great. Very crisp screen - day and night, crystal clear audio, easy to navigate menu options and the snapshot recording was pretty nifty. The product comes with a microSD card, which is pretty convenient to start recording your little one's shenanigans.  All in all, even if you are lucky enough to get a working version of this monitor, there are far better and reliable options available out there.
