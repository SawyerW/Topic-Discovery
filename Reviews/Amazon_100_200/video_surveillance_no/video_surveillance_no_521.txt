I thought this would be a fantastic idea- but that's exactly all it is.  Our home is 1,300sqft and still, the frequency isn't strong enough to make it from the hand-held in our room, to the camera in our baby's room.  If it's left on (which is the general idea!), the hand-held beeps all night long, and ends up being turned off,  leaving us with no monitor. I'm guessing this is an interruption in frequency?  I'm very annoyed, since I thought this was such a cool idea! Not to mention its not cheap to buy.  I think I'll pick up a simple one next time.
