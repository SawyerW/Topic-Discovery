I'd installed the camera in my Jeep Grand Cherokee with Pioneer 5600 DVD. The Installation was not simple, since I had to add extra video cable (the power cable is longer). As I noticed in other review, the hole saw that was supposed to come included in the kit was missing so I had to buy another one to be able to make the proper hole. The camera is water and dust resistant, and has a clear night vision, but since it has no angular lens (peep hole type) it doesn't cover both ends of the bumper and right there you miss the whole point of having a rear view camera. Just because of that, I would suggest further research of other similar products.
