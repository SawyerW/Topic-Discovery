I purchased this alarm system to use on basement windows that never get opened and on a sliding glass door. They are very simple to install and I find that the alarms are very loud for their size. I've had mine hooked up for several months now and couldn't be happier.I don't use the door alarm, though. It's not because I don't want to but I think the keypad setup is way too difficult to mess with. Not to mention that someone wanting to enter your house would merely have to peel off both the keypad and the magnet at the same time for it not to sound the alarm. Perhaps its designed to go inside your house on the door, but then there's no way to disarm it before entering.Nevertheless the little ones are great - and it's at a good price too.
