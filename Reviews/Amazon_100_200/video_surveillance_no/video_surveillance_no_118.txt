It's Quite sturdy. When the suction is set up in the very correct way, it latches to the glass very well. The suction mechanism works excellent on glass, tried it on my flat smooth faux wood desk and latched on very strong. Yes, I do believe it will latch on any surface as long as it's solid. I tried it on my drywall in my room, but didn't work there :P I dunno, don't ask I just tried :D The screw for the camera is metal, and so are the next two pieces attached below. At that curved elbow it's plastic, but looks and feels like it's the durable plastic.Mine very much looks authentic, it has the company's logo.
