I was looking for a security system to install at home, i found many, and this one grabbed my attention. After reading the reviews and downloading the quick start manual, i noticed that the product pictures are misleading in a way that make you think its wireless! in all the real pictures of the mounted camera, there's no wires!! even when mounted on the glass window! this mislead the customer in believing is a wireless system with hustle free wires. the real truth is: You need an network wire connected to each camera, and a nearby electric outlet to connect the -network over power line- adapter to it.
