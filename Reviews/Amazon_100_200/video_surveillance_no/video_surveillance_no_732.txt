I have 8 of these (two sets) installed in the awnings around my house. They look great! They have fooled everyone who has seen them, including law enforcement officers. Mine did not have a flashing light at all, but I wouldn't use that feature anyway.The little red stickers fade pretty quickly in direct sunlight. I live in Florida and the three in question face about 5 hours of direct sunlight per day. They lasted about 1 month. So, if stickers are important, I'd suggest purchasing them separately. However, the quality of the cameras is worth more than their price here on Amazon. These are a great deterrent!
