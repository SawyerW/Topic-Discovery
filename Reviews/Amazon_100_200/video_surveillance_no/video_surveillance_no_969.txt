I love it. It took me longer to find a  place to install the camera, than to hook up the camera. Camera system is great, but the additional cameras are rather expensive. Will purchase two additional cameras if the price drops. Fast shipping. Great product. I can view the camera from my patrol vehicle, my cellular phone, and my home computer. I even recieve alerts when motion is detected. The camera is beneficial to me by changing the response time for my local police. In the event is someone attempts to burglarize my home, my response time is about 3 minutes. If I didn't have a camera, my alarm response time for the police to come to my residence is almost 15 minutes.
