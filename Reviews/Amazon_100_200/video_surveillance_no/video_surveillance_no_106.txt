While the Panavise 809 mount is advertised as a window mount, it also works great in securing my Flip cam to the gas tank of my motorcycle.  The suction cup creates a rigid coupling that hasn't come loose yet, at least in the hour or so at a time I've had it attached to the tank.  The arm articulates nicely so that the cam can be set to level (or at whatever angle you'd like it to be), and extends enough so that the cam sits nicely behind the fairing and out of the wind.  The rigidity of this mount is a big improvement over another mount I tried in that the Flip doesn't flop around (pun not intended ;).  This is important as the Flip does not stabilize the captured video and tendency for the cam to move while operating seems exaggerated in the resulting video.  The Flip is small and light, and I haven't tried this mount with my larger cam.  The mount has a 3 lb. weight limit.
