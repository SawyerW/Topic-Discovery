I was shocked at how well it picks up voices. I bought 2 pairs of these and brought them paintballing with some friends. I was a little worried about how I was going to clip them under our masks when I found out you can hear the other person perfectly from several inches away. We didn't even have to tilt our heads down to talk into it, even when we were whispering while sneaking around (it was a 24 hour game). I had no problem with the earpiece, it fell out a few times because I was so sweaty but besides that it stayed in and I often forgot it was there.My only complaint was that the VOX didn't work on any of them so we had to press the button everytime we wanted to talk, which was perfect for the majority of the game but some parts I found myself wishing I could. There wasn't a manual that came with so I couldn't troubleshoot and figure out why VOX never worked. But overall these headsets are amazing and were invaluable during our game. I would highly recommend these.
