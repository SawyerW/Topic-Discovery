ok - I've owned several brands. I bought 3 initially, two for me and one for a friend who wanted one that was "easy to use".  This is both EXTREMELY easy to set up AND takes great pictures.  I bought a 4th one.  I also bought the Bushnell for $155 and it works ok too -  but for half the price I'll buy these from now on!  Make sure to turn it off and then back on when removing/replacing the SD cards.  Flash doesn't go out more than 10-15 yards but still good enough to clearly see what the critter is.  Batteries (duracell) went to 70% after about 6-700 pictures on 10 second delay between pics - and there were a lot of night (i.e. flash) pictures.  Very happy with these!!! Highly recommend !
