VERY LOUD!Ear shattering in a small apartment unit. I had to cover the main door unit with some tape and cotton to absorb the sound a bit to protect my hearing.  My dogs hate it. Maybe charge a little more and offer the product with sound settings.I have no doubt that it will startle an intruder.  (It gives you 30-45 seconds to input the code before it goes off unless you put it in Home/Alarm mode).Very effective despite the loudness. When set on the "Home/Chime" mode, it sounds like a dressing room chime. "Bing-Bong"You will need 3 AAA batteries for the door unit but everything else is included. (choice of using screws and/or back-to-back tape)Overall, for less than $25, I think I would buy it again and highly recommend it to family and friends. Peace of mind.
