I looked through a million reviews of a million different monitors. I had a cheaper video monitor when my son was born and it was decent, but my son dropped it and it broke. So finding a new one was difficult. Then I found this one.Pros: The video was pretty good, the sound was as well and we never had any problems with interference.Cons: The camera thing is ok but its not the best quality and kind of useless for me, the two way talk is also very useless but works good if you needed it I suppose, the battery died very easily. ALso, the charger inside the monitor fell completely inside, therefore it can't charge anymore and is also very useless.This monitor has taught me that the saying is true; "If it seems to good to be true, it probably is." I would have recommended this when I first got it but at this point, I would hope no one is like me and gets to caught up in the "good qualities" because they really aren't that wonderful.
