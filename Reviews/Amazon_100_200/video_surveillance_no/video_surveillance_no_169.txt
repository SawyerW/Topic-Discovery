This alarm system is a steal for 20 dollars. It works extremely well and is everything that I hoped it would be. It comes with one door alarm and 3 window alarms, but we used one of the window alarms on our sliding glass doors, which works too! I will say that the alarms are not linked (example: If the window alarm goes off, the door and other window alarms have no idea it is going off, and do not trigger. Thus, the system functions as 4 separate alarms). The set up is easy, with easy directions. If you don't want to pay high fees with alarm companies, this is the next best thing. A wonderful product on amazon! Oh and one last thing...the window alarms all come with batteries but the door alarm does not. The door alarm requires I believe 3 or 4 AAA batteries, so prepare for that.
