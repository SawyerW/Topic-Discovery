I spent several hours over three days getting two of these to work right. One, over the driveway, I had to use quite a bit of tape to restrict the IR sensor coverage. It appears that the one thing is that it still has a tendancy to kick it off if there is a rapid sunshine to cloudy conditions and this seems to be my only current problem. This cloud cover with the fairly high temperatures right now in late spring is making the IR sensor sensitive. The other sensor which is over a grassy area has no problems and required no tape. Both work excellent at night with no false alarms BUT they pick up the wildlife passing through the yard, which I want for possible night photography and to see if the deer are eating up our plants. We turn them off late at night when we go to bed. For the price they are hard to beat, but to get them working correctly, you need to spend some time with them and that is stated in the instructions.
