I've installed this camera about a week ago.  The set-up was real easy.  Initially I was concerned that it could possibly clash with my existing home-plug system.  It worked like a charm instead, without affecting the speed of my home network.The image and sound quality is amazing.  Video performance is awesome both: in day time and night.  I haven't seen such effective night vision camera before; I get a very clear, crisp image even in complete darkness.The software is quite comprehensive yet very easy to use.  I must say all details have been well thought out.  I can adjust image angle and zoom easily.  Also I like selecting area of the picture and adjusting it to a particular sensitivity for motion detection.  Recording, web-access and other features work real nice.  The cost of mobile commander is high though it's not an issue for me as I, personally don't need it.  Overall, I'm very happy to have this home friendly, easy set-up professional system.I'll soon buy the second set to secure the front of my house.  Well done Logitech!
