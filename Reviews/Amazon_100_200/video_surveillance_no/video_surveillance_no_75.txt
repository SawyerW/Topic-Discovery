I can't actually say I've used these... which is sort of why the rating is low.  They aren't particularly "substantial" in nature.  You have to use a tiny screwdriver to open the compartment for the batteries, and the point of the wedge is pretty "fat"; it's only going to fit under a door where there's enough of a gap.  That being said, the bottom of it has sort of a nonskid pad on it, so when a door is forced, the stop will slip back only a bit before it "locks" in place.  However, it is the "fatness" of the point of the wedge that makes these unusable for me.  I suppose if I had given that some more thought (ie, that the cracks under my doors aren't substantial) I would have reconsidered.  I'd also prefer not to have to install batteries with a screwdriver.  I'm sure if you don't mind the screwdriver part and the openings under your doors are fat enough, these will work fine (they're GE).
