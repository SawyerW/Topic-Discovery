I got this drive at a bargain price to install on a Mac Pro tower after I shifted the older existing drive for use as an onboard back-up drive. I waited a bit to post this review, to see how it performs. So far it's been awesome.NOTE TO MAC USERS: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON WD's WEBSITE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLINGNot having installed an internal drive in a few years and used to Mac's usually simple plug-n'play nature, I hastily (and idiotically) installed the drive without taking the time to read the simple but detailed instructions on WD's website. Consequently, although I formatted it for Mac with disk utility, I neglected to do the critical PARTITIONING required first. This is necessary to eliminate the tiny PC-formatted boot partition on this drive that will confuse your Mac upon start-up. Failure to do so resulted in a nightmare of hang-ups on restart until I figured out how to force a clean boot using an emergency disk, safe mode, etc--a very precise operation--at which point I was able to partition and format it properly. After that it ran perfectly.
