I bought this product hoping it will bump my security features up on my S10. Well it did! I love this product it helps me keep crooks and especially cats of my truck. I have an auto page alarm and all I had to do is bypass the shock wave sensor with a few wire taps. All the colors are the same and no problem at all. I also installed a toggle switch, which helps me turn it off when I am at car shows and other events like that but anyways this product is amazing. Well worth the money i highly recommended it to any person who has a lot invested in there vehicle.
