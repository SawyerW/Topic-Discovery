I don't consider myself to be very technically savy, so easy for me is easy for most. This couldn't have been easier to install. Simply place included cd in cd drive of home computer where you want to view image. It will load itself and walk you through the very few steps to get up and running. Just plug one device into power and router with included ethernet cable. Plug camera into power outlet and mount and aim camera. I tested it out of the box (without first actually mounting the camera to be sure it would work) and had it working in about 5 to 10 minutes. Amazingly simple. I also downloaded an app to my smart phone (android) and was able to see the camera view from my phone as well. Very cool!
