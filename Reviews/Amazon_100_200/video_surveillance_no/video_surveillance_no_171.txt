Main unit is very loud, window units not as loud.  All seem to work well.  Chime mode on main unit would be good for business or child safety.  Keep in mind what they are made for.  Intruder alert when you're home, or noise maker when you're gone.  They work well for that.  Loud, piercing, and annoying, which is what I wanted.  Mounting is for the most part easy but you might have to be creative depending on what type of surface you have.  Double sided tape is good, but only on a flat smooth surface.  I had to use the screw holes.  So far very pleased.
