I am half deaf (only able to hear in one ear due to childhood ear infections destroying the inner ear of my right ear) so sleeping at night with two small kids in the home gave me severe anxiety. If I was laying on my left ear I was worried I wouldn't hear if someone was in the house. I have been working to overcome the fear but I soon realized I needed some sense of security. Does this alarm call the cops? no. But will it kill your ears if you set it off? Definitely. I can sleep soundly at night knowing there is no way I can mistake a squirrel on the roof as an intruder now. I installed this system in about 10 minutes and have slept better in the past two nights than I have in probably a year. I have not tried the window alarm as of this writing only the door alarm itself.
