Well, I purchased and installed the viper 3305v a few months back and then sold my hard top for the S2000 so it bothered me that someone could basically have their way with the soft top without ever setting off the alarm.  Added this proximity sensor and it works flawlessly...plugged right into one of the open ports on the viper and ran the wiring to center of car.VERY easy to understand adjusting the settings.  Basically, set it, step away, test it...then turn car on and off after making adjustment to reset it and test it again.  Now, if you come look in my window it'll WARN you to back off, put your arm into the car and it triggers the alarm from both sides of the car.  If that fails, I have a woodchuck with a serrated knife and a bad attitude in the trunk!For $22, what the heck are you waiting for?  Buy it.
