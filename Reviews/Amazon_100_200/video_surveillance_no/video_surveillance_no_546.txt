After much research I finally decided to pull the trigger on getting a video monitor. Our babysitter has one, but it just looked kind of cheap to me. So my husband and I purchased this video monitor about a week ago. It came this last Friday and was super easy to setup. I set it up all on my own(even the camera). It worked right out of the box, and it was pretty self explanatory.I like that I can talk to my son through the camera, although I don't know that it actually helps him. And I love that I can take pictures and load them onto my computer easily. I also really like the comfort in knowing that I can purchase another camera(or 3) when my son is older and we have another baby - and have a split screen of them.My only issue is that there's no stand for the monitor you view your child on. I am always doing something and would prefer to just glance over and see my child, but this one has no stand.
