We have had this baby monitor for over 2 years now.  It is still working great. I pored a lot of time into researching baby monitors before getting this one. I didn't find a lot of info on Lorex baby monitors, but I did find that Lorex makes high end security monitor systems for home and commercial use. They recently decided to start making baby monitors and they are top quality. They are now including Skype in it which is cool because you can use your Skype app on a mobile device to see what's going on in your home while away.
