I got this monitor for the arrival of my second child and thought it would be great. We got the camera a month before our son was born and started using it about 1 month later. In general the VOX feature is horrible and does to work and the handset sometimes switches from one camera to another for no reason. After 2 months of use the mini USB port that is used to charge the handset detached and was completely inside the handset leaving no way to charge the handset leaving this expensive set useless. Amazon was no help in rerunning the item as the purchase was more than 2 months ago and the manufacturer has not returned any correspondence to date in regards to getting this repaired or replaced.Overall very disappointed. Will not purchase a Lorex again
