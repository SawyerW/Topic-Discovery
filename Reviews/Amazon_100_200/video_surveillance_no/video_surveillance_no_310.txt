This looked like what I needed: a sensor I could attach to an outside gate up against the house leading to the backyard. I set up the system with the AC receiver/chime plugged in to a exterior wall under a window about 20 feet from the sensor outside. It worked for a couple of days, then wouldn't "chime" even though the red LED on the sensor indicated it was working. I put a fresh battery in the sensor just in case, but it still didn't work. I removed the sensor (magnet and transmitter) and found it worked (triggering the chime to ring) only when it was within about six feet of the chime (still outside the house). Pretty useless as a wireless chime. I would return it if I could or at least exchange it for another to give it another try.
