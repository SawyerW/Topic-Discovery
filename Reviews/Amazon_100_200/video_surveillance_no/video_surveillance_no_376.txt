After pulling the wires thru my ceiling and getting up in my attic(nasty blown in insulation) and running the wires where they needed to go, I found out the ends were not the same. Dumb...but learn from experience. I taped the wires to a string(not the ends) when I pulled them back out, taped up the ends so they wouldn't get caught. Maybe this is why the connectors are so sensitive. If I bump my dvr, I loose the picture. So I just wiggle them again to get picture back. I would recommed to the manufacturer to have a connector at each end that you can take the ends off when pulling wires. Then plug the different ends back in. I did order more from the same company...I will just try to be more careful this time...adding two more cameras.
