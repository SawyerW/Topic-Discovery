I ordered Fake TV for my parents.  They are getting on in years and I thought this would be a good product to help them feel more secure. Even when they are at home they like to put in on in a back room to make the house seem like there are lots of people home. I tested it out before I gave it to them by setting it up in my house first.  You can not tell from the outside that there not a real TV on in the house.  The set up was so simple.  I love this product!  I have been telling my friends about it and they all will be ordering them for their houses.  It is a great item to give your kids if they are away at collage or living anywhere on their own.  You will not be disappointed with your Fake TV.
