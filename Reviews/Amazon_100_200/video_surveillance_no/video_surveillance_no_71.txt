Extremely impressed with the cost and functionality of this door stopper. It does 2-in-1 job,  1) stops the intruder from coming inside by force 2) sets off the alarm. I think this is a must have for all home, even though you have expensive security monitoring installed. It looks much smaller than what it looks in the picture. I wish I can find something small and similar to this product to use on sliding windows. It do not come with battery (9v), need to buy separately (approx. $4).Just a minor suggestion for improvement. The alarm should not stop when the door is closed back, it should have some button to reset the alarm.
