This was a great buy IMO.  Trail cams can be very expensive but this one is the best for the money.  Did a fair amount of research on Amazon and this was the cheapest one I could find with positive reviews.  I've been extremely happy with this camera.  I configure it to utilize the camera and take burst shots every minute and am able to get  a couple of months out of the batteries.  The quality of the pictures (day and night) are great as well.  Will admit that I haven't used it for video yet.  If I buy additional trail cams for next season I will definitely be purchasing more of these.
