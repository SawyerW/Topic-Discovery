I got this camera for security in my shed due to missing items.  It was very easy to install and hide so that it wasn't able to be seen unless you were looking for it.  I then hooked it up to an old VCR we had stored in the attic.  The picture is quite good for the size.  I do wish that there was a USB version of the camera with a motion sensor capability because it really wasn't fun to watch the video to capture many hours of nothing for days to find 60 seconds with someone taking a flat head screwdriver.  Now, it told me who was taking my stuff, but if it had a built in motion sensor and was connected to a computer, I would have saved myself many hours of headache.
