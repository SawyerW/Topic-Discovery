We have had a bunch of these installed for about a month now, and have yet to encounter any problems with them. The video quality is great (especially during the day). For the night vision, unless you have outdoor lights to provide some sort of illumination, the quality is just okay. You definitely wouldn't be able to make out specific facial features or anything. During the day, they are awesome, and catch movement in specific zones that you can specify in their software. The system hasn't failed us yet, and has remained up and running through our wireless router.You can change the frequency of the alerts you get, so if you don't want a million alerts sent you way on a particularly windy day (flowers/plants/leaves can set off the motion sensor), you can change the frequency to one e-mail every 15 minutes or so. This doesn't mean that the camera doesn't catch all the motion...quite the contrary. If you log onto your account, you can see every single motion alert that it caught, even if you had set up your e-mail to limit the amount of messages you receive. Highly customizable.
