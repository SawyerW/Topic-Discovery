First - this product is now listed on Amazon for $30 more than I paid for it over a year ago. The product worked well, until just over one year (which is the end of the warranty). Then it just stopped working! Would not charge. So I called tech support. They said it could be the monitor/handset, the battery or the charger... I KNEW that- those were the only options! I was offered to send in my unit and they would replace it - for $100+ shipping!!! I only paid $129.99 for the entire unit (including the camera which is listed at $92 on Amazon. That means my $38 unit ($130-92=$38) can be replaced for $100?? No thank you. I would NEVER buy this product or ANY product from Lorax again! A monitor should last at least 2 years. Save your money and buy a better brand that will last.
