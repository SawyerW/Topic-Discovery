This monitor is so awful I felt compelled to write a review.  I never write reviews. I bought this monitor to use at night to watch my 20 month old in his new twin "big boy" bed.  It is very difficult to distiguish the baby from the covers and we only have 1 sheet and 1 thin cover on the bed.  It does not show 3-D very well so it is impossible to tell how close to the bed rail he is, the whole point of getting the camera.  I am going to buy a different brand which hopefully will work better.  Should not have gone for the cheaper one.  It was a waste of money.
