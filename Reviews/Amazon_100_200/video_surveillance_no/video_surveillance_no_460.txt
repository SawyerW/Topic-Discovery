It's not going to stop an intruder, but it'll definitely get a parked vehicle's license plate #, time, date, and a face for identification.  Also provides entertaining cat/skunk/dog pictures.  Very easy to use, and pictures are sharp.My wireless LAN cameras failed in a storm, but this thing kept working and gave me a pic-by-pic play of who visited my house and when.  No-one noticed it in the tree (nobody looked at it directly) so I think if you planned out the location, you'd be pretty safe to hang it in a vacant building like I did.Battery life seems to be indefinite - ran for 3 months without issue.  Card size was SANDISK 16Gb and took a hundred pics or so.
