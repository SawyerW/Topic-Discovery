We initially really liked this monitor but soon found it has a few fatal flaws that are leading to it's return.  It does have a high pitch background noise whenever it is on (even at the lowest setting), but you get used to this and I don't even hear it anymore.  The sound doesn't go very low but the sound quality is good.  The night vision is great.  Now the downfall- one night it simply turned off and we heard the baby crying (for who knows how long).  It simply stopped charging.  You have to set it on the charger just right to get it to connect and charge.  And as we had it longer, we now have to wiggle the cord occasionally to get it to charge.  Maybe this is just a bad unit?  But to add to the problem, there is no alert when it is running out of batteries.  It simply turns off.  Our previous sound monitor would beep incessantly when running low on batteries.  This one definitely needs to add an alert feature, esp if the charging is so defective!  We're returning to Costco.
