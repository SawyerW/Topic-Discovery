This camera will not work when your bedroom is upstairs and your baby's bedroom is downstairs. No matter how clear of a shot I tried to make (which meant I couldn't leave the camera in the actual room I wanted it in) it wouldn't pick up signal. In addition, the handheld monitor's battery couldn't last a whole 6 hours even when fully charged. The snapshot isn't good, but that's not what was important to me. I am extremely disappointed with this product. The range they claim it will work in certainly isn't true because I'm well below the maximum. don't buy this product. Spend the extra money and get something reliable. This is horrible and very frustrating!! Wish me luck in contacting the seller trying to get my money back or a replacement!
