It was advertised that the motion sensors operate at up to 150 feet.  LIARS!!  >:(Not even CLOSE!!After wasting a couple of hours on this horrible and useless product I was furious to discover that it works only inside a range of 30 feet, MAXIMUM!!!  How can they advertise 150 feet!?  It was NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!  My bike has had its license plate stolen recently, and it's in my car port not even 50 feet away from my kitchen, and the control center device doesn't work when I go out and purposely trigger the motion sensor.  Next, I try move it outdoors onto the deck, walk across my small yard, wave at the motion sensor, and still nothing but a red flicker, indicating the motion sensor sees me.I then take the control center with me -in hand- and go trigger the motion sensor.  Aaaah, THERE it is, the alarm finally goes off.This thing is PATHETIC.  Do NOT buy this unless you need it for only a VERY short range.Do NOT buy this.
