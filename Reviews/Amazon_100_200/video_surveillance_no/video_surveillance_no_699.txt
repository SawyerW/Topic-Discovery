I like it and it works as described. Be sure to go outside your home and see if it is producing the desired effect.  I had to open the mini-blinds just a little bit to let more of the light out, for example.  It has 4 modes: on, off, on at dusk for 4 hours, and on at dusk for 7 hours.  I also use a light timer in the room with this and sometimes the light will defeat/fake out the FakeTV, but then when the light goes off, the FakeTV comes on again. I actually like that because it seems more random and mimics the way a real person might use their lights and TV.
