Better than paying for a monthly security system but of course won't actually protect your house from break-ins.  Most home systems don't protect your house either but an alarm will often DETER a burglar once the sounds goes off.  They either take off immediately or only grab things within arms length (unless they are professionals).  So this definitely gives me peace of mind without having to pay a monthly fee.  It's also a great security warning if an intruder breaks in while you are home.  Last year we had a home invasion when my husband had just turned in for the night upstairs.  He heard some rustling around and thought I had come home early, then after calling out to me, he heard the sound of several people whispering and scrambling around downstairs.  If we had had this alarm at the time he would have known the moment they enter through the back door.
