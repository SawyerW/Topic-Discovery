I bought these to use to communicate between motorcycles.  I've had some success.  These are well designed, but not perfect for motorcycles.  The wind over 30 or 40 mph is too noisy and you have to repeat over and over.  One thing that does work well is if you use a code for clicking the press to talk microbutton on the mic (which you clip to your collar, so it's close to your mouth), you can signal each other to pull over, slow down, or whatever, because each time you press the mic button, it beeps for the other guy.  When you are stopped or going slow thru a town, looking for a place to eat, they work fine because the wind isn't so bad.  I have used them on two trips so far.  I bought the GXT760VP4 Midland radios and they work great.  Another bennie is that the connection to the ear is by air, not electrical.  I did do a slight mod to these units and it cuts the wind down a bit, but I have not yet tried it out.
