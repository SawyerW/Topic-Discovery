These headsets are a bargain, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for. They have pretty thin cords, and the cord from the mic to the earpiece is too short to allow me (and I suspect most adults) to run the mic down my sleeve to use "Secret Service style." They work fine as lapel mics, though. I ended up buying two professional-grade sets that actually cost more than twice what the Midland radios I was using them on  did, but these other sets have long, heavy-duty coiled cords that fit me well. For the typical family or service-business use, though, the Midland AVPH3 headsets should fit the bill, and the price can't be beat.
