Got it installed and running in about an hour. Had my iMac running Parallels (WindowsXP) to do the setup. Went smoothly until the section on configuring the UPnP with the router. UPnP doesn't work with the Apple Airport Extreme. Call to the tech support: excellent support, domestic, knowledgeable, not rushed. My tech, Curtis, knew where to go, what to input. Macs were not a red-headed stepchild with Panasonic's tech support. :: Running great, especially with my iPhone. I use a product named iCam to send images to the phone. iCam even sends a push alert when there's movement in the view. Great for keeping an eye on the house when I'm at work. :: The takeaway: expensive but works great.
