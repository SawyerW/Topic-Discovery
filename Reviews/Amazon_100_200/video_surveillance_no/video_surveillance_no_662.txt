Good product.  It works perfectly.  It is very sentive to even low light though, so a distant hall light will make it go off and then it will reset itself to start the time all over again when the light is out.There seems like something loose inside it.  A big clunking sound if you move it side to side.  I stopped moving it for fear of braking it.  I don't believe it was made to have something knocking around in it. Warranty?Looks great from outside the house; just like a TV is on inside.  Maybe the thieves or neighbors will come over while we're out and watch "TV"!L.
