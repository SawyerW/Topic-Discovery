I looked around for a long time to see what earpiece would work the best. You WILL NOT find a better product for your money. They are sleek, comfortable, great quality in sound and construction, and they look as official as they get!!! Really... no need to continue to look around. These things are by far the the best unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars. I used them for our "security" at our wedding, and they honestly made a difference. They looked great, but most importantly got the job done. I don't feel like there was much sound quality lost at all in the earpiece or mic parts. I have messed around with two way radios most of my life, and there really isn't a difference between the sound quality coming through these or the radios themselves. Again, don't think twice. Can't go wrong here.
