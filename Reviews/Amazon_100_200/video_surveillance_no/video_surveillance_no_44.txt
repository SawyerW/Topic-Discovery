Bought it on Amazon.  The pick up pattern of the outside sensor is weird.  It misses the mail carrier on our mail box next to the front door, but triggers on someone walking by on the sidewalk.  Also triggers on nobody at all (a squirrel maybe?).  I tried pointing it down but does not help.  My wife leaves it turned off, so it does us no good.  The design and feel looks real good.  Maybe if you can orient it exactly right, or put white electrical tape over the lens to limit the sensitivity it could work, but I have not been happy with it so far.
