My problem is not with the transmitters themselves but rather with the way they were packaged and shipped.  This device includes, in addition to the unique code label on the device itself, a facility code of an additional 2 digits which provides further security (additional uniqueness of code).  This additonal code was not supplied with the device.  The manufacturer normally sells these in blocks of ten (I ordered ten) which are consecutive code numbers with the facility code labeled on the outer package.  The entry system is programmed to be able to enter these codes in blocks rather than each individually.  I received 10 randomly coded devices thrown in a box without any packing or identification of the facility code.  As I chose to keep them rather than return I have limited reason to complain I suppose.  Other than the foregoing the transmitters work fine.
