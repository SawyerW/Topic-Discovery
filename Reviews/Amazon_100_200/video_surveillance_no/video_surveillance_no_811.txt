We have three of these cameras setup around our property (2 outdoors, and 1 outdoor actually setup inside).  They work great.  It's been over a year.  We live outside of Boone, NC so the weather varies and they've held up well in the snow, rain, heat.  We use the free online service (alert.logitech.com) to checkup on the place when we're out of town.  It's a great affordable solution.  Recently, during all the snow, our river and creek overflowed while we were out of town.  Washed the gravel off the driveway, messed up the yard, etc.  We were able to see it happen on the recording when we returned.  Didn't really help but it was nice to be able to see.
