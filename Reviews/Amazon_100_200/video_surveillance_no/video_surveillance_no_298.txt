I should have listened to the other bad reviews for this one, but thought we'd give it a try.  First of all, the 100 ft distance is wrong. It worked at close to that, but only when it wanted to it seemed.  Definitely doesn't register at 100 ft.  The other main issue we had with this was it was way too loud, and the button to adjust volume was broken.  We had bought a 2nd chime, so we tried that one and even at the lowest volume, it was still way too loud.  We wanted this for our office, and there is no way anyone in our office would deal with this loud dinging every time the door opened. Why you couldn't adjust it to a quieter setting is beyond me-but this thing only has a couple settings Extremely Loud and then Moderately Loud!  Even if we had gotten the volume setting somehow worked out or it had a quieter setting, the distance was still a big issue for us.  We couldn't place it in a spot that worked for us since you could only take it maybe 50-70 feet from the door.
