I purchased this unit in March of 2013 hoping to provide a notification to us as people entered our driveway. I was not able to install the unit until recently and it is a total disappointment. It rings constantly when nothing is there. Some people have recommended shielding the unit or putting tape over it to make it less sensitive as it may be affected by sunlight or bugs. I tried shielding it and also mounted it in every location imaginable with no luck. It even rings at night with no lights of any kind nearby. It is a nice concept but bottom line is the unit is flawed and I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing it until it's flaws are fixed.
