I purchased this to see what was killing my chickens.  It originally didn't want to accept the memory card and continued to be moody about recording images to the card every time I reinserted it.  It did make a decent quality photo and video though once the card decided to work.  I used it through the fall and it was fine.  We had a mild winter, so I left it out to see what was ranging around in the winter.  At some point in early spring I turned it off.  When I tried to use it again this summer it wouldn't turn on at all.  I tried multiple sets of fresh batteries to no avail.  The manufacturer says I can ship it back for repair, but even under warranty I have to pay for shipping both ways.  After paying almost $90 for the camera it seems a rip off to have to pay another $20 when it is less than a year old.
