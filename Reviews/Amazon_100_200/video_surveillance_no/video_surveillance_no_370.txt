I had read several reviews on these cables and the reoccurring theme was that they were too thin and fragile, so I was concerned about this but the price was right so I took the risk. I ran these cables through my attic and despite every effort to be careful and delicate, this wasn't always possible given the tight space and route through which the cables needed to be placed. I'm happy to say the cables work great, I've had no problems with them at all, the signal is strong and the images are crisp and clear, I feel I got great value and quality for my money.
