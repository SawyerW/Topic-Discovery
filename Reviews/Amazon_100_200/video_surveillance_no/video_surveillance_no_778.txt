Purchased outdoor master camera (and additional outdoor support camera). Mounted Master high on front porch. Camera worked for about a week and had to exchange for new one. Second camera had to be reset numerous times which meant I had to pull out 20 ft latter each time. Finally camera stopped working an Logitech said they would send third one out. I returned it to store. Cameras are good when they work but after a couple of months they start to have problems. Phone support is very basic and after they exhaust their items to check, they suggest sending out a refurbished camera. They need better quality control of cameras. Now I have the second support camera which Logitech has disconnected until I purchase a new Master camera. Logitech has full control over the cameras including seeing what is filmed by them.
