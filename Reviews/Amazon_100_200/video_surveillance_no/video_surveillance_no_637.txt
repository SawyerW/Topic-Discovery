We bought this camera to be able to see our son during nap and night time. We had it for seven months, took very good care of it and it is already broke, 2 days before we are leaving for vacation when we really need it. The camera is expensive but I feel it is a cheap design. I love being able to keep an eye on my son when it is nap time but sometimes the camera gets really dark so I can hardly see him and then all of a sudden its very birght. The camera is hard to put on the charger because you need to put it on at an angel. If you don't get it right it breaks! I am extremely angry due to the fact that we spent too much money on this camera and we need it for when we are away. I use it every day twice a day and now I have no idea what I am going to do. If I knew the charger was going to be such a pain and cause it to break I would never of bought this camera.
