Primos Truth Cam 35 Camera It seemed simple enough to set up, but I got about 10 photos (which were as good as my digital camera-beautiful)and then it stopped working. I spent 3 days working all the kinks out of it and never got it to work right.  Their website was no help.  The camera damaged one 8 MB disk, so I tried another.  I got about 21 photos before it wouldn't take anymore.  The last 3 photos were infared and the batter life dropped from 75% to 20% with 3 photos. It may be that it was a bad unit, but I didn't waste anymore time, disks, or batteries on it.  But, it did take great photos!
