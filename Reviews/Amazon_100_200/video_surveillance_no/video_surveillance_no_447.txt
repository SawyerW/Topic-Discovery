Unfortunately I did not have a great deal of satisfaction so far. The flash started giving problems right out of the box. First I thought it was my SD card or batteries but I connected it to a 6V wallplug transformer and still had the same problems. It stops taking photos at some point and sometimes the flash just remains on. I am still very hopeful though that it was only a factory dud or something and wish to return it soon. The photos that it took seemed ok and was basically what I expected (quality wise) for the price it is good. If I remember I will try to give an update on their service and whether they could fix the other problems.
