We purchased the system because we had some things stolen out of our garage and vandalism to our vehicle.  We expect this to happen again and need proof of the identity of the individual.  The cameras work well.  The picture quality is clear and captures much farther than we expected.  The only drawback is the fact that we had the alarm set to go off at night often keeping us awake.  We were unaware of how many wild bunnies played in our yard in the middle of the night!  They set the motion sensor off many times and we had to turn the alarm off.
