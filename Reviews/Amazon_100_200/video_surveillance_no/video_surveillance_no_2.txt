If you take the time to "tune" the placement of the sensor, this works great!  I don't know if the people who complain about these got defective units or have a lot of animals or something setting them off, but I have several of these set up to form a perimeter around the house and they work great.  We do have cats around here, a whole bunch of them, but the trick of putting the sensors in a birdhouse worked great, and I haven't had any false alarms since doing so.  The sensors have been out in the hot Florida sun, cold nights (well, for Florida, down to about 26), torrential rain, and still work great.  It didn't take too much time to set them up and test them, either.  These are definitely a lower-cost way to set up a security system so that you'll know if anyone enters your yard.
