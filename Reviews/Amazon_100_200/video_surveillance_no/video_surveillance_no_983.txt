I do not recall this info being addressed in description of product prior to purchasing.  If I had known this, I would've ordered the non-night vision camera.  It is less expensive & why pay for an option you can't use anyway. Beyond this issue, the video quality is terrific. It did take several calls to Logitech support to get my system up & operating. The problems encountered were two-fold; my router required updates in order to acquire the camera feed, & Logitech support was lacking initially. The 1st tech support person did not follow root cause troubleshooting flow correctly which resulted in me ordering replacement camera unnecessarily.  This delayed getting my system up & operating for 4 days. Once I contacted the Logitech lead manager, support improved & all issues were corrected.  Amazon's response was outstanding handling reorder & return of product.
