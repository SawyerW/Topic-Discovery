I have been operating the outside and inside Logitech cameras for about 6 months; they are great.Installation was very simple (they successfully use house wiring for interconnection).  I access with the Mac software which was very easy to install.  The system provides email notifications each time a camera zone is active (the size and sensitivity of the zones are adjustable).  I can access the cameras directly via my iPhone for live shots as well as archived footage triggered by zone activity.I use the audio feature on one of the outdoor cameras and it works very well.Over the winter I experienced a few minor power outages and the Logitech units came back up everytime when power was restored.  I have not had to tounch them for any reason.The cameras themselves are very well built and render quality images.  Resoultion is very good; colors are vibrabt and true.  The infrared mode is very sensitive and provides nice video in the dark.All in all this is a very good security camera solution.
