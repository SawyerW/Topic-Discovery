Bought one, and it has been working fine for over a year.  Bought another and it went bad in a few days.This is an inexpensive piece of electronics from China.  But with luck and proper setup, it can work fine.  The first seems to be ok after a bit of adjustment and protection.  It is now sitting in a small birdhouse, and has more or less been performing well for over a year.  It would be nice if the indoor receiver unit came with a transformer, instead of the three C batteries.The second unit worked for a few days.  Following a heat wave, it would not stop sounding. Tried everything.  Still kept going off every few seconds.Seems like you are taking a chance with these.
