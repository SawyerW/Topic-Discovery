Spent all last year with two trail cams taking pictures of the deer on my property.  I was actually looking to step up, from the basic Wildgame cameras I had, when I purchased two of these Primos cameras.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! ALL of the night shots that this camera takes are out of focus. The flash distance in my experience is about 3 feet.  The batteries do NOT seat well in the camera even with the cover closed, they tend to shift causing the camera to shut down. I'd love to post some pictures here to prove my point, because Im very very disappointed with this product. I do not write many reviews on here, but I just HAD to share this.. Primos you have a lot of work to do on your cameras.. If I had bought just one and had this experience, I probably would had chalked it up to a bad apple.. I bought TWO, and had the same experience with BOTH of them..
