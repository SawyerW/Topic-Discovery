I purchased this to mount my lilluput monitor to my camera rig. The main reason I got this over other options was because of the pivoting ball head, everything else was just a bonus. For what I needed it for the only things in here that were useful were the extenders and the ball head. The x wing attachment broke in about 5 min, the screw mount on it came apart from the x bracket with just a little pressure. I dont know how this could be $39 for list price but for the $6 something its being sold as it a pretty decent deal. The ball head is pretty straight forward but still has its issues. You have to make sure you tighten it pretty good other wise itll droop. I probably wouldn't buy this again but for the initial investment at what it costs it has more than earned its keep.
