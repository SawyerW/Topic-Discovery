I mounted the sensor in a plastic box screwed to the back of my mailbox.  The sensor looks inside the mailbox and transmits to the receiver when the mailbox door is opened.  Essentially, the sensor spends 99% of it's time staring into a void.  It works perfectly when the door is opened however it transmits false alarms three or four times a day so what seemed like a good idea turned sour.By the time I had this set up the return period had elapsed so I contacted the seller, Corydor, to obtain a replacement unit.  They tell me that since it was "fulfilled by Amazon" they will not back the product.  Apparently if your unit produces false alarms and putting tape on the sides of the sensor window doesn't solve the problem you just toss it in the garbage.
