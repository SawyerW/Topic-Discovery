Bought this for when I go to hotels for travel. I was staying in a hotel in St. Louis last year and met another guest at the elevator. Apparently, even with the chain lock, her room had been broken into while she was sleeping! Bought this, put a battery in it and this puppy is LOUD. So far, the only time it's gone off is when I tested it! I'm sure if someone tried to break into a room I was staying in -  it would scare everyone in a mile radius! Nice peace of mind. The only thing I didn't really like is that you have to have a very small phillips head screw driver to remove the back so you can place the battery.
