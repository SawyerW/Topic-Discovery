This camera works well when it does.  Problem is, the software makes the decision FOR THE USER on when and what video clips to download.  Sometimes it just doesn't download all videos recorded on the SD card.  I am not sure if the download stops when Windows Update starts and doesn't know to finish downloading the rest or what.  There is a bug in the software for sure, which makes this product very unreliable.  It just stops and doesn't finish downloading the rest.The software should be able to allow users to manually download on demand, instead of allowing the software to make that decision for the user.  Because we all know computers are STUPID.
