Camera image is pretty good, construction is high quality, and POE works well.  But the motion detection software, when connecting directly through a browser, has some issues.  The window sizing is buggy- where you think you are putting the motion detection window doesn't match with where it is placed in actuality.  The sensitivity for motion detection is poorly explained in the manual and online support; I've spent hour trying to calibrate the camera's motion detection at night and during the day.  I am contacting Vivotek's customer support to see what the issue is, so expect to see an update from me afterwards.  I've had the camera installed for a little over a month.  The product got great reviews, so I am surprised by my experience.  There are also few useful articles on the web that can help owners with troubleshooting, FYI.
