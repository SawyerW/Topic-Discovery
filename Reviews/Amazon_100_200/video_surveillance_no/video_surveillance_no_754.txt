This product had severe issues connecting and it ultimately failed.I was able to connect to the camera and read the video stream, but their software never recognized the product. I spent two weeks with their support and never got past: Uninstall the software and reinstall it. For a high-end product, their support staff isn't trained to handle advanced technical issues and I wouldn't trust my home's security with this company. I love their other products and will continue to use them and was actually impressed by the quality of the camera and the quality of the video but the support is a deal-breaker on an otherwise attractive product. And the fact that it doesn't work. That was a problem!
