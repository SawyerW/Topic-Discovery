This is an excellent well priced automatic camera to leave outside on the trail. I use it to track the movements of game. It is not useful for anything else. The camera will not stand by itself on a table, it prefers being strapped to trees.You might think, "I could use this to keep track of who's coming into my garage and borrowing my tools".They'd have to be as slow as deer because the large case is very conspicuous, as well as are the bright red LEDs that it uses to illuminate the subject. I think they could have done better with the design. It looks like a camera, but I guess that's fine if all you want to keep track of is deer, which are usually very truthful anyway so I don't understand the implication of the name.
