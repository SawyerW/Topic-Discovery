We purchased this for our home because there have been a rash of burgleries in our town. We were not interested in setting up a huge wireless system, but more in alarming some doors and windows that are not used frequently.The package arrived quickly, have to love Amazon Prime, and the instructions (looks long at first, the book is fairly thick) are step by step and easy to follow. The main alarm is quite loud, defeaning almost, as when we tested it (we placed in on an unused side door) we had to place a sweatshirt over it so as to not wake everyone in the neighborhood. The smaller (window) alarms are not as loud, but will get the job done just fine.Simple, yet effective, I would recommend this system to anyone who has only 10 minutes, a screwdriver and a need to alarm their windows/doors.
