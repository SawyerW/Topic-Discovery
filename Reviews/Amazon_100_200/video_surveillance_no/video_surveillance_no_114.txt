This little gadget is quite nifty. I have a Canon HF-11 camcorder which is about as big as a can of soda. So it fit on the mount fine. Depending on the size of your camcorder and the angle of your windshield will determine how level your shots will be. You'll need to make the mount steadier since every bump in the road will cause the camera to jitter. I used a tiny bungee cord and attached that on the camera then to my rear-view mirror. Problem solved! Be aware that in many states, it is illegal to mount objects on your windshield.
