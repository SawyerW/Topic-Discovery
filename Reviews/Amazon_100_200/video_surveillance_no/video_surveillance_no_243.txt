We use these for our church security radios and they work very well.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is that it would be REALLY nice if they would sell some replaceable parts for the tiny piece that sits in your ear. Sometimes when you have community used earpieces they get waxed filled.  Yuck!  We have bought one for everyone as a result but still keep a few around to be shared by those who forget theirs and they get disgusting fast.  (guys!)  For a $10 earpiece that is not cheap to replace just for lack of a way to clean or replace a plastic piece for pennies.
