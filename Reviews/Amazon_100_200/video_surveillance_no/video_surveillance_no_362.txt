This is overall a great camera. If you are looking for a basic camera that allows you to watch your kids or pets than its great. Don't expect high resolutions or you will be disappointed. The camera is easy to install, but the wireless function requires a user with a little bit of knowledge in setting the network router.Great camera. I highly recommend it.To set up the wireless mode:Go Into your router and make sure it support port forwarding. Set both (the netcam and your router) with the same SSID name, and have both ports setup the same port number ( 50000). The manual doesn't help much, once you set up both port number to 50000 than switch to the wireless mode. I was having difficulty at first , but it is mostly due to the router setting. So make sure your router is set right , the camera just autodetect right out of the box !! But you have to manually go into the netcam setup to change the port number !!Good Luck !!
