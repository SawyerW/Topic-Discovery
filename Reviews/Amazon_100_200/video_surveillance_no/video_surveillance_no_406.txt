THIS BY FAR WAS AN AWESOME PURCHASE, THE CAMERA PICTURE QUALITY IS AS CLEAR AND CLEAN AS A WHISTLE. THE NIGHT VISION IS OUTSTANDING FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAMERA. IT IS DURABLE, DUMMY PROOF TO OPERATE AND UNIVERSAL. I USED IT TO SCOUT SOME HUNTING ARES IF THERE WAS GAME AND THE RESULTS WAS UNBELIEVABLE!IN ADDITION I USED IT IN MY HOUSE WHERE I HIDE THE CAMERA TO SEE WHAT NIECE WAS BREAKING THE RULES I GAVE THEM AND CAUGHT 1 OUT THE 3 WHO WAS DISOBEYING  AND EVEN LIEING TO ME AFTER I SHOWED HER IN THE VIDEO CAUGHT RED HANDED...DONT HESITATE AND BUY THIS...
