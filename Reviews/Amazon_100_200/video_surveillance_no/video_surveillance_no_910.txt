Bought this for my brother who's not too good w/ electronics and computer, and after setting up, I have to say i'm impressed with the clarity of the HD 720p lens.  Zooming in doesn't blur the image much, and getting alerts on smartphone is a nice touch.  Just replaced the 2gb micro SD card w/ a 32 gb chip, as the surveillance area has large tree branches that project moving shadows during windy periods, and thus took up more space on small chip faster than I anticipated.  We should be fine now, as I'm only downloading video every 2 weeks.  I'd buy another high-end model from Logitech again.
