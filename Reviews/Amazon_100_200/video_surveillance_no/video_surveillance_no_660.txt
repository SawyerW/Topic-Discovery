I placed the Fake TV on a second floor bedroom about 2 feet from some 2 inch white slat blinds, closed tight. From the outside it looks like a very bright tv is on in that bedroom. I think I can move it away from the window and place it on a dresser but will have to experiment with the changing light conditions since it operates on a photocell when in the 4 or 7 hour run position. There are 4 settings to choose, off, on all the time, 4 hour photocell controlled, and 7 hour photocell controlled. Additionally, when in 4 hour function and not yet operatingin tv mode, a red led lights up. 7 hour function gives you a blue led until the photocell picks up enough darkness to turn the unit on to tv mode ( same as the 4 hour). I thought that was a nice feature to add. The unit itself and the DC power cord are all made well. Good job to the engineering team who put this product together.
