These sensors are great. Very helpful and they certainly work. I happen to use them inside each entrance door in my home. Believe me, they work. Just need one of the actual alarm units near your bed at night and the sensors are all tuned to go off if anyone were to break the line of the sensor. I had one outside the home (RE:DRIVEWAY) but, any traffic in the street or most anything would set it off. Like calling wolf,to me. Therefore, I personally use them and like them as security devices after midnight, if you know what I mean...........They do work.
