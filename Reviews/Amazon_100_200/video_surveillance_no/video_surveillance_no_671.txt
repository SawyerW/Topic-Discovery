I think this is a worthwhile addition to home security lighting.  The color and movement on the shades makes a big difference in how occupied your house looks.And the feature which turns the unit on at dusk is a welcome plus.But mine arrived with a broken AC adapter.  Before I  could take action to replace the piece I got an email from the company asking if I was happy with the product.  I told them about the problem and three days later I had a new AC adapter at zero cost and minimal effort.  No questions. No "send back the broken one".  Just prompt and helpful service.
