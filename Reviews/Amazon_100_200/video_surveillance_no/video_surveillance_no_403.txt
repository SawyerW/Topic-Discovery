I bought my Primos Truth Cam in the fall of 2010.  At the time, it was a very good camera for the money.  It has worked well for 3 years but is finally starting to act up.  If the batteries are not new/fully charged, I now can not change the settings or turn it on or off once the batteries get below 60%.  When it works, it works great at taking pictures in the daylight and night, but night pictures are kind of grainey. But then again this is a lower megapixel camera compared to many now.  I can get well over 500 pix on a set of batteries with most being taken at night on a food plot.  Quality wise I've been happy with it.  For a piece of electronic equipment that runs in temps of 10* to 110*, in sun wind and tornadoes, I think it has held up well and done a noble job.  I'lm looking to buying another camera soon......maybe a Browning this time.....
