Nice camera, wild angle view. easy to setup when using POE. give a 2 for following reasons.1. expensive. and network over power line adapters that come with this camera are totally junk and are not working, I had to buy a POE switch (another ($60) to make it work.2. web and mobile commander (1 year subscription) Logitech wants to charge you USD $79, what a joke. the software is very limited in terms of configuring your camera, and Logitech is trying to make more $ from their crap software. and if you use their free web viewer, they make you click a button every 5 or 10 minutes to continue viewing. Logitech, fire your marketing people, they are getting too greedy
