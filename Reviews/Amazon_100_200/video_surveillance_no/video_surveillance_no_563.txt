I purchased this item a few years ago, it worked great for awhile. However, I started noticing an issue with the sound, it would crackle or be distorted. At times now,  the audio doesn't work at all! But the camera has been knocked over multiple times and still works well. We've used this camera in our barn while one of our horses was expecting a baby. The reception was sketchy, had to walk out on the porch with the monitor but it beat walking to the barn in the dark at 2 am! But for indoor use,mostly, I have been pleased!
