First of all, it only costs $13 bucks, don't expect miracles! That said, I bought one of these 5 years ago and it has been faithfully in service ever since. Generally speaking, it works as expected, but, as people note, it does have some issues. The main one for me is when the wind blows hard. I have to turn it off then because it goes off all the time. The other thing is sometimes, maybe when the battery gets low, it does not go off when someone comes down your driveway, or it only goes off in one direction. I think it has something to do with the angle or speed of the car or person when it hits the beam. If it could recognize birds, cats and squirrels and not go off, that would be great, but, like I said, it has been in use for 5 years and 95% of the time it works as advertised. For $13, if it works, it's a real bargain, but if it doesn't, it isn't that big of a loss. You have to try it for yourself.
