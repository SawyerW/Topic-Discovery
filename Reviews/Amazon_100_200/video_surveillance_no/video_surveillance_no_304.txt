I probably should not give this unit 2 stars, but I was impressed with the volume of the chime - very loud if you wanted it to be.  Unfortunately, that was moot because I could not get this to work if I was not actually touching the transmitter or the magnet!  No matter what I did, I could not get the receiver to chime if I was not physically touching either the magnet or the transmitter.  I tried moving the receiver unit to numerous different locations, near and far with no blocking walls to no avail.  If I was holding either the magnet or transmitter - no problem.  If both the magnet and transmitter were attached to the entry door - no luck.  The entry door and frame were aluminum, so not sure if that made a difference.  I returned it and am looking for another unit.
