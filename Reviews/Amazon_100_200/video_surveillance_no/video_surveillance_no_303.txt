We bought this product for our small office to let us know when/if a client comes in the front door and we are away from the front. The contacts have double-sided sticky tape or screws to mount them with. Screws were not an option for us, so we used the tape. The tape separated within 24 hours (as in the sticky stuff stuck to the door and the foam stuff, still on the contact, was on the floor). So I tried super glue and electrical tape which finally worked. The doorbell rang intermittently with no apparent cause. I read on some other reviews to remove the red wire and let it hang out to make it not do that. I tried that and it made it extremely loud with no volume control, and then it just started ringing pretty much every 30 seconds. Now I have a messy, non-returnable product that doesn't work!
