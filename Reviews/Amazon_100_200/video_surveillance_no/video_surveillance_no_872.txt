Initially I was pleased with the camera system.  It was very easy to setup.  I had the camera facing the driveway to my house and running 24/7.  It worked great; I was able to get video feeds on my iphone and over the web.  The video quality was acceptable.  Unfortunately, for me, the camera stopped working in less than a month of operation.  It simply died.  Logitech support was quick to respond to my initial request.  I was asked to send the faulty camera back for a replacement.  It has been more than a week now and I have not heard from them despite my repeated requests for status update.
