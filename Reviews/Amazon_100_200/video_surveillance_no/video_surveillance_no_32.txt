My two indoor cats love to watch squirrels through the sliding glass doors at the back of my house.  I put out peanuts to attract the squirrels, but there wasn't a way to assure the cats (usually sleeping elsewhere) and squirrels would be at their stations at the same time.The Driveway Patrol Sensor is the perfect solution.  I put the sensor just outside the door and pointed it toward the peanuts.  When a squirrel arrives, the chime sounds inside the house.  For the first couple of days, when the chime sounded I would yell "Squirrel!" (a word the cats already know).  They quickly learned that the chime indicated a squirrel was at the back door.It's not mentioned in the description, but the Receiver has a three-position switch:  HI, LO and OFF.  By turning the chime off, I can go outside without triggering a false alarm.
