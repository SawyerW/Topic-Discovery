The product I received does not work. It constantly transmits a signal to the receiver whenever there is a battery in the transmitter. It sends intermittent but frequent alarms even if the entire face of the transmitter is covered in tape as recommended in the user manual. I also tried to prevent the device from detecting movement using a blanket, a bag, and backpack, but the device continued to transmit alarms. In my experience the transmitter sent a signal approximately every two or three seconds. I spent all morning trying to figure this out until I finally decided that the error wasn't my own, but that the product was faulty.
