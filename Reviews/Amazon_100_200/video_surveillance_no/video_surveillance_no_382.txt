This camera is indeed as easy to set up and use as advertised.  But the latest version has even more features than are listed on the Amazon page, including:(1) Camera accepts up to 32 Gb SDHC Class 10 memory cards. For comparison's sake, an 8 Gb card holds about 3,330 daytime photos; a 32 Gb card holds 26,440.  IMHO, Amazon is selling the equipment short by not updating this.(2) While the camera does run off 4 D cell batteries, it also has a 6 VDC adapter plug in the bottom next to the memory card slot.  This could be very useful if you're using one of these as a security camera or near a steady AC power supply.(3) 1 second trigger speed.(4) 200% longer battery life (over the previous model)(5) ZERO capture noise.If you are considering this camera, please take a moment to read the manual, which is available online.
