This product has been a real help for me with my husband who has alzheimers disease.  He had the habit of going into the kitchen and helping himself to anything he could find.  He, at times obsesses on one type of food or another and overeats.  I have been able to use this to monitor the kitchen.  I know this is not the usual way to use this but, for me, it has been a lifesaver.  The product arrived promptly and works very well.  The only "Problem" I had was the alert sound was a little loud, even set on the low level.  I put tape over the speaker and it has helped.  I would recommend this product for whatever way it is used.
