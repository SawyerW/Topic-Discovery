THIS REMOTE CONTROL DEADBOLT LOCK IS EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED.  THERE WAS ONE ON MY HOUSE WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  REPLACING IT WAS A PROBLEM.  NONE OF THE BIG BOX STORES CARRY THIS ITEM.  I WAS SO GLAD TO FIND IT ON AMAZON.COM.  I WAS A LITTLE RETICENT THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD.  IT IS GREAT.  NO REGRETS.  IT'S NOT CLEAR IN THE DESCRIPTION...LET ME TELL YOU...YOU GET TWO KEYS AND TWO REMOTE CONTROLS.  PERFECT.  YOU CAN LOCK YOUR DEADBOLT AS YOU WALK AWAY TOWARD YOUR CAR.  YOU CAN UNLOCK IT AS YOU APPROACH YOUR DOOR WHEN RETURNING.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
