Dear Sir or Mada'am,  The Driveway patrol i anticipated in excitement for several days. I finally recieved on the fifth or sixth day, and when i attempted to use it, only the sensor worked. How did you not know it was defective when everybody else who got theirs said it was. I'm out thirty freakin' dollars all because of your inept product. I know it probably isn't your fault, but nonetheless researching the products you sell wouldn't hurt. Anyway i can't return it, because i already threw it away. 75% of the Driveway patrol sensors do not work, i googled it so i would know. There's not much else i can do or say, so good day to you.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
