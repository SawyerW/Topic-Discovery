People always comment how official you look when you have this on. This are comfortable to wear even if you are having to wear these all day long. The soft silicone ear piece is a lot easier on your ears to having to put a hard plastic piece in your ear, especially if you're having to wear these for more than a few hours. There are a few strategically placed clips that allow you to quickly and neatly hold the earpiece in place, even if you have to temporarily remove the ear piece from your ear.I use this with the Midland LXT118 22-Channel GMRS radio.
