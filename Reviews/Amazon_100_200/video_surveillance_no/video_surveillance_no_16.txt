This is my 3rd purchase of this item. The first 2 have worked  flawlessly, but this one has been a bit of a problem. It has a tendancy to give a lot of false alerts on sunny/cloudy days.  Have had to move it around to find a properly shaded area so as to reduce the effect of the sudden re-emergence of the sun after a cloud passes.  This one is much more sensitive than the first 2 but for the price it is doing a decent job of alerting us when someone approaches house. I have one in front of house, one in back and got one for my sister-in-law who has a hard time hearing a doorbell. This unit is very loud on "high" setting. Since both receiver units will recieve from both transmitters, when working out in garage or in workshop out back, I take one receiver unit with me so I know when someone approaches the house.
