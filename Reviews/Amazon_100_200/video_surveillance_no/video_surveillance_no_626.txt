The setup and functionality of this product is as good as any other video monitor that I have used in the past.  However, the monitor does feel flimsy and cheap in your hand.  After less than two weeks of use I had to return it for a replacement because the power supply on the monitor had broken off inside of the monitor.  I am hoping that it was a lemon and will not happen on my replacement.  I was able to get replacement through Amazon since I had just got the product so I did not have to deal with Lorex Customer Support.
