I recently orderd 4 two way radios that came with their own headsets Avph1,so just out of curiosity I decided to purchase two avph3,to see how they would do these head sets are awsome and works better than good compaired to the avph1, we are contracted to work night clubs on the weekends with the extreemely loud music I  could hear and be heard loud and clear, and the best part about it all is I could only hear the person I was speaking to reguardless of the extreemly loud music in this night club.had to give them 5 stars.they work well for what I needed them for next I have to complete replacing the AVPH1 and will be ordering more.Thank you!
