Setup was a breeze. The key was to plug in the wireless unit to the router and make sure it can be tested first. Then once setup is done, I disconnected the unit and then installed it in the permanent location. Works like a charm. It was probably an easy install for me due to an electrical outlet being there close to the install location. Otherwise, you might need to use the wires provided (more than 15 feet) to the closest electrical outlet. I found those wires to be more than sufficient. Bonus: Logitech now has the software system available for MAC as well. The fifth star was for that! :-)
