I am using this as a ceiling mount for my Video Camera.I think I understand the problem with the adjustment that people are having.  There are two set screws, as has been mentioned by previous reviewers.  The thumbscrew - the larger set screw - is the one that should be tightened first.  Neither set screw is designed to touch the sphere.  The thumbscrew, when tightened, secures the sphere to the mount by pressing against a cone shaped base on the mount below the sphere.To make the angle adjustment secure, the thumbscrew should be tightened first.  So first make sure that the smaller allen wrench set screw (2.5mm) is sufficiently backed-off before tightening the thumbscrew.  Then tighten the thumbscrew; and finally, use the 2.5mm allen wrench to further reinforce the fit.Enjoy.  I think this is a great mount with a lot of options, and a good value.
