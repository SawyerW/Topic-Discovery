We purchased this to watch our infant and toddler in their beds. We use it in conjunction with a traditional baby sound monitor. We love it, except that after only 4 months of use, the charging connection broke. Too late to return to Amazon, we will contact the company and see what they will do for us.The charging cradle design is my only major complaint. It is essentially a micro USB type connection. Very poor mechanical design. Is is hard to connect and disconnect the receiver from the cradle. And as we just found, suspect to easily break. Many other reviews tell similar stories. They should use a more traditional cradle such as is used with cordless phones. A secondary complaint is that the monitor can not stand upright when not in the cradle. They should square the bottom to allow for this.
