As a infant/newborn care provider,having a video monitor is a God sent to monitor crib activity (which is what I use it for). I would suggest anyone looking for a good monitor with the added visual perks of this device, purchase the Lorex video monitor.I love that it's in color, and the night vision is great as well.I would really like (if lorex could make an updated monitor) the option of connecting the device to the internet (so parents can view while at work),also the ability of the device's camera to rotate even just a little bit, and the option to zoom.But overall, it's a great buy! I would definitely share the product with new families or those I know expecting.
