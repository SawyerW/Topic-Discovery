This unit has good features and good video definition but it is exceptionally susceptible to interference from other radio frequency devices as well as noise on your power lines from other devices plugged in around the house. The interference noise is amplified and makes using the audio portion of this device unbearable. I would definitely avoid this device if you plan on using the audio feature. I was not able to find a solution and Lorex, the manufacturer suggested I send it back to where I purchased it from. To be fair this has happened with another audio baby monitors I have used but not to this degree, rendering it unusable.
