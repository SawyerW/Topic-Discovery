I bought this product because my girlfriend was scared to sleep alone in her apartment. There is only one entrance so this product is ideal. While this product may offer a little support by holding the door shut if someone is trying to get in, it is more of a "scare tactic". It has an ear piercing alarm which is sure to scare off any intruders. If you want added door security to make sure no one can get in your door. I recommend the MasterLock security bar. This product is well made and will give you a peace of mind when you sleep!
