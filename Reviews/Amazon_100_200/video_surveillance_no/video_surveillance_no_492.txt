This is my first trail/game camera.  I didn't want to drop several hundred dollars to find out it's not for me.  This camera takes great pictures.  Time, temp and moon phase all get stamped on the photo.  Battery life (on lowest setting) lasts months.  It has a video setting, though I have not used it yet.Some photos are out of time, meaning there are IR photos taken during the day while some night photos are sometimes not taken in IR.  Also has quite a few (about 30%-50%) false activations.Definitely worth the money.  I could probably get 2 or more of these for less than a real expensive one and set up a perimeter around a deer trail.  Actually, I may just do that.
