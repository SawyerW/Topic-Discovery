Ok, this is a MUST have if you're want reliability, sound quality...even using VOX (tap the mic [lightly] and 2 secondes later you'r 'live! Excellent for people who have a hard time hearing. Stability is the one area where I 'fault' it. And that is due to my personal perk about desiring a Pc. that stays put. This tends to fall out a little too easily for my liking.However, if you clip the back on and allow for maximum room of white/clear cord it stays just fine. However, that allows for it to be seen easier, or harder to conceal....Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great item at an even greater price. Usually, you  get what you pay for, in this case, I came out ahead-you will also!
