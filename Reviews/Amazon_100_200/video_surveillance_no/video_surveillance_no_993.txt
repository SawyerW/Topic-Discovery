I bought the most popular one in the list a few years ago.  I tested it when I installed a new sump pump a couple weeks ago & it worked.  Then when the rod on the new sump pump stuck the following week & my basement flooded, the most popular alarm did nothing to notify us.  Don't waste your money on it.This alarm is extremely loud - loud as in if it is going off in your basement it would wake you up on the 2nd floor.  And it doesn't sound like other devices in your home - it is a siren sound so it is easy to identify.  There is a loud & louder setting, and a button to push to test the battery.  I hope to never hear this alarm go off, but feel safer that it is there.
