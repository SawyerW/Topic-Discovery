First night out in the woods, the camera worked perfectly.  The camera quit recording date/time data on second use.  Left the camera out in woods over the weekend and now it no longer records identifable subjects in night time shots.  Night time shots are almost all black even though led's glow red indicating it should be working.  Day time shots are now completely out of focus at all ranges.  Bought this camera because of price and reviews but it's gotta work or it ain't worth anything.  I'm giving it one more try.  Not AMAZON's fault but they may get it back.
