We have a warehouse and sometimes no one is in the office area when a customer walks in.  We bought this to avoid having customers wait for us to come by.  At first it was easy to setup.  we used double sided tape to put it onto the door.  When we tried to keep the receiver at an area where we could easily hear it while in the warehouse, it would not work.  We could keep it about 15ft from the door at the most for it to work.  The next day the unit stopped working all together.  The transmitter showed a red light turning on when the door was opened, but the receiver would not chime.  We tried keeping the receiver and transmitter near each other and still no luck.  Buy it at your own risk.  I am returning this and trying another one that will hopefully work the way I want.
