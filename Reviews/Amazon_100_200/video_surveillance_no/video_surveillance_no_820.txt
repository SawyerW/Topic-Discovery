For 20 years, I have been looking for a home security system that didn't cost a fortune, was reliable and effective, and was easy to install.This is it.  Look no farther.  NO MONTHLY MONITORING/ALERT FEES.All you need is a Windows PC and a network router.  If you have that, this system is plug and play. Beautiful video quality. No need to run expensive Ethernet cables to the remote external locations or beef up the wifi strength (I think it uses the house 120V AC wires to transmit and receive) And it is expandable. And programmable!There must be some short-coming somewhere but I haven't found it.  If I do, I will repost.
