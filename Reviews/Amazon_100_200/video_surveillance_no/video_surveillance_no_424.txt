I've had a lot of trouble with this camera. For a while it wouldn't read the SD card, so I tried several and found that anything over 8gb the camera couldn't handle. Now, it will read the card but will go weeks without taking a picture, then randomly resume normal operation. I've reset it per manf. recommendations, replaced the cards, replaced the batteries, no luck. Frustrating. When it does take pics, they are good quality. I have some nice shots of bear, foxes, raccoon, deer, dogs and numerous smaller animals. It also took some wonderful shots when placed by a bird feeder.
