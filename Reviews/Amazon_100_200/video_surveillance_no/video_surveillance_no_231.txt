Bought these for two purposes...communication while off-roading in the desert, and for 'covert' communication in quiet situations like weddings and events. The headsets work perfectly for both, with no discomfort in either situation. Sound quality is perfect, even with loud engine noises in the background. Earpiece fits snugly without issue, and microphone can be located comfortably anywhere in the chest-area.One TINY thing...It'd be cool if the mic cord was a little longer so you would run it down your sleeve and have it sitting on your wrist (like the secret service does).Highly recommend these things...takes a quality product and makes it even more convenient.
