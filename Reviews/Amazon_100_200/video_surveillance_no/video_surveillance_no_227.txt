I decided to purchase the transparent headsets because I didn't want to look too obvious that I was wearing a headset.  The headset itself looks cheap and flimsy, but it has proven to be sturdy and put together well.  Best of all, the sound quality is excellent as long as you give your mouth about an inch or so of distance from the mike.  My only complaint is that the earpiece seems to be designed to fit in the right ear; if you put the earpiece in the left it has a tendancy to slip and rotate out of the ear every once in a while.  Altogether an excellent value.
