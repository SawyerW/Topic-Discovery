The advertised range literally means no walls in between (who has that situation?).  We lost signal when we were about 50 feet away going through two walls. The unit would keep the video but as soon as you turned on the VOX mode or power saving mode so you could actually go to sleep, it would lost the connection to the camera and not be able to pick it up.  The "video" is very choppy, probably about 1 frame per 1.5 seconds and that was with the receiver right beside the camera.  At that rate I would not call it a video monitor but more of a picture monitor.  It will be shipped back to amazon because of the pairing issues and lack of range.
