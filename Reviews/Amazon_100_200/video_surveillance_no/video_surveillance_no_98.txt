Purpose brought:  Used to make mounted vehicular videocam.Pros:  When set properly, this device sticks like glue!Cons:  Small swing arm limits mounting positions.The suction seal is very strong and after two weeks I still can't physically remove it unless I use the pressure release lever.The small arm limits the placement and use of a camera (ie: camera is inverted when mounting on a windshield), but it is perfect for holding small camcorders and digital cameras on a smooth, non-porous upright surface.If you already have a small handheld videocam and wish to use it as a vehicle cam, Use this and a 90mm mounting pad mounted on top of the dashboard as a cheap alternative to buying a dedicated vehicle camera.Great product but only 4 stars due to the small swing arm.
