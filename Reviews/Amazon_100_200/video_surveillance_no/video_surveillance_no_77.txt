I ordered one of these for each door to the house after some neighbors had breakins this past weekend. I also ordered buddy bar door jammers which I hope to have shortly.Pros:- Very easy to use - remove from the package - install batter (sold separately) and set in front of the door.- VERY loud alarm. This alarm will wake you from a dead sleep. LOUD and warbling it will likely frighten off an intruder as well.- stops the door pretty well on a solid push.- stands up to actual use - the cosntruction is sufficient for the use.Cons:- if it's not set properly the stop will slide (TEST it before you depend on it and see how best to use in your situation)- The door has to open at least slightly for the stop to engage - this means there will be a few inch gap even if it stops the door cold.Overall it's an inexpensive deterrent. Once I receive the Buddy Bars I will feel better as those are rated to completely prevent the door from opening.
