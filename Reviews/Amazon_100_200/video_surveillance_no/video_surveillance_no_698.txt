I purchased this item for our vacation home in the mountains.  Let me tell you it perfectly simulates what a TV looks like in a dark room.  When we pull up to the cabin when it's dark, it looks EXACTLY like someone is in the house watching TV.  It should put enough doubt into anyone's mind that someone may be home that I think they would stay away.You have to be careful that nobody who might try to peek in the windows can't see this thing, otherwise the jig is up.This unit is the smaller of the two, not sure how bright the larger unit is, but this one is adequate for a large bedroom.
