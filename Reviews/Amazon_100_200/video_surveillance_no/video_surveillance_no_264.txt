For $10ish a piece, these are pretty good.  But, you get what you pay for.  The ear piece fit is okay and the volume has to be turned up all the way when outside or in a noisy environment.  If it gets too loud, it can be quite difficult to hear.  The one major blunder is that the wire from the ear piece to the mic is way too short!  I wish it was at least 6-12 inches longer.  Midland probably had 10 year olds in mind when they designed this product.  This headset is a nice little toy that works very well for what you pay.  Obviously, I would never actually use this for any type of security job.
