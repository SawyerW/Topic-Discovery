The door alarm is too loud on chime and the alarm setting did not function correctly, so have opted not to use that setting. The alarm was accidently set off and the code did not work to turn the alarm off.I had to find earplugs and then unscrew the battery doors to remove the batteries in order to get the alarm off.Subsequently have purchased a monitored alarm system.If the code had worked to turn off the alarm, it would be acceptable. Really, the fact that the code didn't work is ridiculously unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have returned this item. It did not work as it should. The alarm is deafening. The chime setting is also annoyingly loud.However, made me think that if I were a burglar, I would just wear earplugs.
