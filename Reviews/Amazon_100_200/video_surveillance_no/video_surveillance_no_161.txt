I read the reviews on this product before purchasing it.  All the reviews were very favorable. I placed my order on Oct 13th and received it Oct 18th, I briefly read over the instructions and everything was installed in 10 minutes. I like the fact that I could use the window alarms on the doors, I have 3 doors on the downstairs level they Work perfectly. The chime is loud enough to be beard through out the house, the alarm sounds like a car alarm. I let my friend listen to the sound over the phone she couldn't believe how strong and steady the sound was. I was so impressed with the performance and price, I'm placing an order for her now.
