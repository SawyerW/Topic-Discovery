I purchased two of these as a xmas gift because of all the good reviews....one worked and one took endless pictures of nothing and everything was so "foggy" it was nearly all white, even though the weather was clear.  We thought the second one might have the settings screwed up so we kept messing with them, but it never improved.  Meanwhile the one that worked, suddenly wouldn't turn on anymore, so they were both useless.  Given that I also purchased holders, memory cards, batteries and a field reader for them....it was a huge waste of money.  With so many good reviews, I can only assume they have some serious quality control issues and we just happened to get two duds.  That doesn't really help.
