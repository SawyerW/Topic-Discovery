This product works as advertised and does make a very loud and annoying high-pitched alarm when triggered.  It sounds like a very high-pitched bird making a constant chirping sound with a wavering pitch.  My only complaint is that the sound only triggers so long as the pedal is pressed down.  So theoretically if someone was trying to sneak into your home or hotel etc., and set it off, they could immediately pull the door back a few inches and the alarm would have only gone off for half of a second or something.  It is so loud that I'm sure that it would wake you up, and you would know what it is.  But it would be nice if a triggered alarm would sound for at least 5 seconds or something so that neighbors would realize an alarm was going off etc.  Overall, especially for the price, this is a great addition to home security.
