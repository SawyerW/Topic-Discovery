I travel quite a bit, and previously have only had light timers as a theft deterrent while away. After a few burglaries in my neighborhood, I decided to ramp it up a bit, and decided that a Fake TV would be a good addition, especially since anyone watching my house while I was home would always see a tv on at night, and would not see it when I was away.... So I got this at a very reasonable price, and have been pleased with the performance. It took a while to figure out the proper positioning in the room so that it looked most 'realistic' from the outside (i.e., not too bright, not too dim), but it does look pretty realistic I think. I like the different on/off options as well. I think this will serve me well and put one more question mark in the minds of potential burglars about whether my house is the best one to break into!
