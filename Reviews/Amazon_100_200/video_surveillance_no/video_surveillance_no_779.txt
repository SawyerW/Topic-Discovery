Purchased the Logitech master system and this was our add on camera. We are very happy with the camera quality and picture. The sound pick up through the camera is amazing. Can hear neighbors talking 2 houses away. I guess I'll know when they are talking about us LOL. We intend to have a total of 4 cameras to our system so we will be purchasing more from Logitech. We did purchase a camera distributed through amazon and it was defective, but amazon took great care of us and refunded our money. I then purchased directly through amazon feeling more confident in their customer care. I will also buy our next camera through amazon.
