This monitor broke after about 2 months.  (The socket that attaches to the charger became dislodged, so that it could no longer charge).  To their credit, Lorex quickly sent me a replacement monitor...that didn't work right out of the box.  It was a little more work to get them to send replacement for the replacement, but they did it.  After six months, it broke too (same problem as the first one).  I didn't ever bother trying to get another replacement because I just want a monitor that actually works.  When this monitor did function, it interfered with our wireless devices, making our computers slow and roku box hopeless.
