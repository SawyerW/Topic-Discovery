got this camera because i was new to the trail/game cam world and it was cheap with a trusted name. i was very suprise how good it worked. i was a bit iffy about the cost of D batteries but i have gone 3 months in the vermont winter and batteries and cam worked just fine. i bought another and had same results. bought two more for my father more for cheap security cams. he like them so much he bought another. very impressed with cost, battery life, and how easy it is to use. i have used 2,4,8,16 gig sd cards. have pics up to 30 yards. great buy.
