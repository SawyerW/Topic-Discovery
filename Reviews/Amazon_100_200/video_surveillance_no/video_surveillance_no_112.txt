Purchased in order to mount Flip Ultra HD to car dashboard.  It wouldn't fit at first because the Flip would hit against the window (had to mount the Flip upside down, but all videos were then upside down), but I called Panavise Customer Service, provided them with the serial number stamped on the mount, and within a week, received the arm extension.It's a solid piece, with most parts being made of metal.  You can rotate and adjust to any angle.  The plastic suction cup stays sucked to the window.  The only problem is that the mount will get shaky at higher driving speeds (the longer the extension arm, the more shaky it is), but it's not really a problem for me.  You can be creative and stuff some tissue paper between the bottom of the mount and the dashboard, and viola.  Instant stability.  Even without the paper, it's still steady enough.
