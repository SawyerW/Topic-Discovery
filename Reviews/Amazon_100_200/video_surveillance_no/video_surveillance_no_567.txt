I'm extremely regretting the purchase of this monitor.  We've had this monitor for less than 2 years and it has broken twice (same issue both times). Like many other reviewers, the adapter for the power plug broke not only once but TWICE!! The first time it broke, it was still under warranty. We had it for only a few months. Lorex replaced it. However, the same thing has happened once again.  So, now our monitor is unable to charge and is useless.  It is ridiculous that we've seemed to run into the same malfunction.  I wound definitely NOT recommend purchasing this monitor.
