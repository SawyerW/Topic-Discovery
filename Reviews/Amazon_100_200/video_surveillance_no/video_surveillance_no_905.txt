I had FIVE of those hgh defenition camersa, Picture was OK, not as good as Dropcam system which I have now. Piriodicaly my camerasone after the other will disappear from my computer,finaly I called Tech Support with Logitech and they could not help me.Finaly I called them back in 2013 to cnacell my service.Surprice! Time for this years payment, it showed up on my credit card statement, I have a new card, which I had not given to them.That is worrysome, I had to get in touch with my card companey to cancell the payment.Besides providing poor service, these guys have ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES, watch out, before you divelge your persenal details!
