I had read up on some of the reviews on this about SD cards not working and it failing after a few weeks so i waited to write this.All i can say is so far so good, i bought the SandDisk 16GB SDHC memory card for it and even with a house with 4 animals i have yet to come even close to making a dent in the memory, i have it on 3 shot so it snaps 3 photos and it is very quick to do so, the wake up time is a bit of a drag but once it is up it works perfect.I have been using this Inside and out, i tested it inside for the first week and caught everything that went by my stairs, tried it outside in Minnesota weather and it still works like a charm! Lots of cars driving by, but with the cold and snow it is a solid little box!
