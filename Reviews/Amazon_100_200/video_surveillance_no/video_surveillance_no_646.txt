Okay...total update to my situation...First of all, one of the cameras came with a broken mic...after about a total of 15 minutes on the phone, they are sending another...you get a one year hassle free warranty from the date of purchase...the company seems to be on the ball.Second, be careful with your wireless system in your house...my advice...get an Apple router as it automatically bounces the frequency around so your phones and monitors are not disrupting your internet service.Other than that, I cannot say anything bad...the picture quality is good and the mic (on the camera that works right now) is very good...This is a nice product for a fair price...
