This is a horrible trail camera - I wish Amazon had a rating of less than 1 star as this camera doesn't even deserve that. I have used several different trail cameras to monitor wildlife as part of my job. I know how to set one up, and I know how it should work. I bought this camera for my boyfriend for Christmas but we had not had an opportunity to use it until this weekend. We spent 2 hours messing with it and trying to get it to trigger. The batteries were brand new, we adjusted the height, the settings, etc and could not get it to take a picture when anyone walked into the field of view. The only time it took a picture was when I was setting it up and had my face right in front of it. It's too late to return it as I missed the return window. Guess we are stuck with a $100 piece of junk. Will NEVER buy a Primos camera again.
