FOR THE MONEY, this is an outstanding product.  Nothing fancy, no off-site monitoring, but now the 2 doors and 2 windows in my apartment will shriek if the alarm is armed and door/window is opened.  If I'm asleep, I reach for the bright flashlight and gun next to my bed, close and lock my bedroom door and call 911 on either my wired or cell phone (both also bedside).  Leave the phone open with the operator until the police arrive (so my defensive actions are taped for possible later use in any trial) and use the gun as a last resort if my life is in immediate danger.  Remember, when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.  If I'm not home, the bad guy will get the same irritating noise and hopefully still run to a less protected home.  Either way, for less than 25 bucks, I am safer.
