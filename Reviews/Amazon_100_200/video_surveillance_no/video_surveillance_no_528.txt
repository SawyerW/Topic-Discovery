I received this monitor as a gift at my baby shower for my twins 6 months ago.  After 6 months of use the charging port detached from the circuit board.  I called customer service but they referred me to a manager because I did not have a receipt for this item that was received as a gift.  After 2 messages for the manager with no return phone call and 4 conversations with customer service, I was forced to purchase a monitor.  Lorex charged me $60 for a refurbished replacement monitor.  Shame on Lorex.  I owned a product that was clearly defective.  It should have been replaced for free.  Based on the other reviews, it appears this is a common problem.  Do not purchase a Lorex product.  There are so many other systems out there.  Purchase from a company that provides customer support and stands by their products!
