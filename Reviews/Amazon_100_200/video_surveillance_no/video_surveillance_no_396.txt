This is an excellent camera.  I have a couple Bushnell Trophy Cameras, and this is every bit as good.  Actually this is about the 8th camera I have purchased over the past 5 years, and this is by far the easiest to set up.  I set it out and in 3 weeks had about 450 photos, and the thing still said 98% on the batteries.  The images are good, and I like the ease of use.  I will certainly buy another one of these if they are available when it comes time to buy another.  the only reason it did not get 5 stars is that does not have as many options for the delay time between pictures as some other cameras.
