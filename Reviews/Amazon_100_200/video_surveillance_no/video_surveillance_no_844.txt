Great camera with a great field of view, good HD picture, the only thing about this camera is you can view live image on your computer or on Logitech site, you can view alarm picture on you Iphone but not a live picture on your laptop if you are not at home or where ever you can access the router it is connected to so be fore warned if you want live picture of home at work no can do you can see picture at Logitech website but they kick you off with timer so you will have to keep reloging in, sure would be nice to be able to log into my computer from another computer to view 24/7 or publish on my website so it can be logged into for longer time.  Other than that is a great camera that only need some software changes
