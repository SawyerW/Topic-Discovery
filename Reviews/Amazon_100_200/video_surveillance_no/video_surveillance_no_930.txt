I've been using this camera outside our house for over a month now and it's been great! I have instant access to a live feed through my cell phone (with audio), and I get snapshot notifications on my cell phone when motion is detected at my house. The system is easy to setup and has a simple interface to use.It has great resolution, it stores a lot of footage in its built-in memory, and it has decent night vision as well. Other than not being able to pan & zoom remotely (from my phone), I don't have any negative things to say about it.
