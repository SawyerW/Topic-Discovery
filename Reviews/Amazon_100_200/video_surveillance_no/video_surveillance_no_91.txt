My house got broken into about a year ago, this provided an excellent addition to security as the only logical place in my house to break in was the back door. Now we have a steel door with this little baby waiting for an intruder. This, with some other inexpensive security options seems to be a perfect fit. The low light indicator for the battery is a great idea, would have been one of my few critiques of a product like this, but its there, so it is great. Haven't had a break in yet, so this little guy has been tested.
