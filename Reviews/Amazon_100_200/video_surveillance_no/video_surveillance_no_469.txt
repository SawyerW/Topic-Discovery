The first unit worked but not right would not power up by turning switch on unless you lifted the battery up to break connection then unit would power up and work fine. returned for replacement second unit working fine. Update: took the camera to my camp notice two l.e.d.s did not work when taking pictures or video. also the camera would not come out of sleep mode after a few hours of operation unless power is switched off then back on. unfortunately this is the second defective unit I received but the seller was great and shipping was fast and I really like the camera but the quality is just not there and I am forced to return yet another defective unit.
