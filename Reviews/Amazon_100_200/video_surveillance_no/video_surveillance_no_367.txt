I spent many weeks researching cameras & after all the reviews, I found Panasonic to be the best.  I purchased the camera at a much cheaper price through Amazon (did a Nextag search), only $239.00.  It was SO easy to setup!  I did have some minor issues & called Panasonic tech support twice.  Both times they were great, very helpful (went above & beyond what they needed to do) and... they both spoke clear English!  A huge surprise.  Nothing like being completely frustrated w/ your computer & then not being able to understand the technician on the other end!After hook up, I was able to create the website & watch my dog (and house) from work!  It's wonderful!  The camera has a great zoom feature, pan, scan and the sound & picture quality is great for the money too.I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
