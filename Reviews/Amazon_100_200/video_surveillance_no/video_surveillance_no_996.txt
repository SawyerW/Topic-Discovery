Had to return 1st one I received since it was dead on delivery.  Got a replacement 2 days  after reporting broken one.  Love the Amazon no hassle return policy.  New one works fine.  As others have reported alarm is quite loud. Tested it in basement next to sump pump and could hear alarm in 2nd floor bedroom. Cord that the sensors are attached to is only 10" long so for what I want it for hanging over sump pump hole water would almost be overflowing before alarm would go off indicating that the pump wasn't working. Overall if you get a working one a good product.
