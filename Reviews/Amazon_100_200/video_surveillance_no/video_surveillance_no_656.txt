I have two of these.  The second one is on it's way back to Amazon after it quit working.  Using the other's power cord, it is clear that it is the unit itself that went bad, not it's power supplySometimes, it works great, realistic flickering, but at times, it seems to pause, and hang up in one mode, with no flickering of the lights for a couple minutes.  One of the reviewers complained that it couldn't be used on a first floor.  We have the vertical blinds closed on the first floor, as they would be at night, and the flickering looks very realistic... when it flickers, and in the unit that works.I use this on a vacation home.  On Ebay I ordered some Brinks window stickers, and a yard sign.  I hope that they are more of a deterrent than the lame generic fake signs available commercially
