We are now on our 3rd monitor in 6 months. The monitor's features and functionality are all great. The issue is the quality and reliability of the unit. Our original unit went bad after a few weeks and Amazon replaced it. Awesome customer support as always. Our 2nd unit just died after 3 months of use when the charging connector broke loose. You can read other reviews, this is a common issue. I contacted Lorex customer support and was given instructions on how to return. I can't say their support was the same quality as Amazon however. Additionally, the VOX on this unit does not work well. It is best to just leave the volume on at a comfortable level.I have decided to try a different monitor and sell the replacement one. Perhaps I'll have better luck with a higher quality manufacturer.
