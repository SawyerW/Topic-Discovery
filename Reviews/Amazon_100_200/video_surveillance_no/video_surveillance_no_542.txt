We loved this camera initially.  It was cheap, had all the important functions, and worked like a champ.  Unfortunately, like some other reviews, the micro USB port on the monitor broke off after about 10 months.  You'll notice that it's difficult to insert the monitor into the charging station.  We recommended this camera to our friends and the same exact thing happened to them but after only 8 months.Lucky for us, or so we thought, it was still under warranty.  As some others have mentioned, the customer service is horrendous.  They rarely answer calls and they don't follow up when they say they will.  Eventually, they replaced the monitor and didn't require that we return the broken one.  But with all that hassle it is hard to recommend this camera unless you're willing to be extra careful whenever you place the monitor on the charging station.  Even then I don't know if it's worth it.
