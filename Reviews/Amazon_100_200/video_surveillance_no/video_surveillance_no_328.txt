What a piece of junk.  At the same times as I bought a Sonos Play 1 I also bought the VideoSecu to mount my new speaker.  Now I know why there is such a drastic price reduction, 83% from 32.96 to 6.99.  Even at that price it's a rip off.  I mounted the VideoSecu, as best I could being there were no directions.  No matter how tightly a tighten the locking screw the mount would not stay in place.  Eventually I used a wedge to keep the speaker in place.  If I hadn't mounted it to the wall and it hadn't been so cheap I would have asked for a full refund but for 6.99 it's not worth it.  Go somewhere else, don't buy this product.
