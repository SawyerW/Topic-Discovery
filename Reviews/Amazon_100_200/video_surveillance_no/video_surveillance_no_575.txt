This unit did what we needed it to do and since we have twins, we had to get the 2 camera unit.  Well within 4 months, the plug in port on the bottom of the monitor broke so that we couldn't charge the hand held monitor.  The port that the base plugs into literally came unglued and went up into the monitor itself.  We had no problems with the unit and thought it worked well enough for what we needed.  So we returned and got a new one, thinking this was a fluke or just a bad one.  Nope, within 6 months, the other one did the same thing.  Lorex "fixed" it after waiting 2-3 weeks to get the unit back, it did it again after another 6 months or so.  We are on our 4th one after being fixed and it has broken again.  I'm done with trying to fix this product and being without a monitor for weeks, waiting for them to fix the same problem over and over again.  I hope our new monitor will last longer than 6 months without having to be returned to be repaired.
