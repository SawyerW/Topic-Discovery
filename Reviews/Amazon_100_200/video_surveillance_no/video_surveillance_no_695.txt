My purchase with Amazon went smoothly. I first saw this  item when I was visiting friends. I purchased it as you know and it looks like a real TV is on. The random color and time patterns was consistent with what I observe when walking down the street. I haven't consulted with any buglers at this time (LOL) but as a board member of our local civic association when have had Police Officers  tell us to leave a tv on  when away as a deterrent.  I am also considering putting  a radio on a timer so there seems like voices. Highly recommend this product and well worth the price for a little more peace of mind. Well done!
