I ordered this to enable covert listening to an iPod at boring meetings, church, etc.  :)The earpiece is reasonably comfortable, but will take some getting used to. The earpiece fits equally well in my left and right ears.It is compatible with my iPod Touch. The connecter is a two-prong block. One prong is multi-conductor for the mic and PTT control, and the other is a standard mono headphone connector. Both connectors are "male." The block connections look a lot like my old consumer grade Motorola radio accessories.It's not as loud as regular earbuds, but it's loud enough for my needs. If it's not loud enough for you, buy a battery powered headphone amplifier. You're already carrying a radio and a wire, what's another device or two?  :)In all, it's a good set. I'm happy with it. If it ever gets broken, lost, stolen, or confiscated by the KGB, I'll probably buy the same thing again.
