This product does exactly what it is designed to do...I bought three and have them outside, protected from the rain.  The distance advertised works fine, the product works fine...now, you will always get a false alarm now and then because these things cannot identify a bird or dog versus a criminal so let's be fair about understanding that these items are not high dollar military grade sensors, they are perfect for most home needs and I could not be more pleased with the quality, especially when considering the price. I have had and used mine for a month or so and have had no problems.  Keep in mind, it is important to think about where to place them...you don't want a bush blowing in the wind that may activate them and end up driving you nuts.  I don't even use mine as driveway monitors even though they would be fine for this...Mine are mostly placed around the house to detect unwanted guests.  Keep them protected from the rain and extreme weather and they could be the exact thing needed to help protect your home and keep up with who's coming and going.  I would buy more if needed.
