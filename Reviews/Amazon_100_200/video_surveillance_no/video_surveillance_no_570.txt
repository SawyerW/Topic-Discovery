I bought this last year with additional cameras to set up for my 2 kids.  The first week I was excited because it seemed to work well.  So I bought a 2nd unit with additional cameras for my brother who just had a kid.  Both of us dealt with similar issues with these monitors.  The monitor battery dies really fast.  We pretty much had to keep ours plugged in all the time.  We might get 30 minutes without it plugged in.  The cameras are actually pretty good and work well.  The big problem is the monitors.  Where the charger plugs in gets bent easily, which is what happened almost exactly 1 year after purchasing these - on both devices and within a week of each other!I decided to go with what I had originally wanted and bought the dropcam.  We have had no issues with that at all.  Well worth the money and you can add additional cameras.  Now we get alerts of motion or sound on our ipad or iphones or can just leave it open a  computer screen.  Save yourself the money and the headache and DO NOT BUY THE LOREX LIVE!!
