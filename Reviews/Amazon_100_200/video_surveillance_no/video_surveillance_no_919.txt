I had one camera for about a year and recently added 3 more. I would recommend, if you have the capacity to hardwire the cameras using cat 5, to purchase a PoE switch and just plug the cameras straight into it. No more powerline troubles or bulky bricks. Also, if power isn't readily available where you want to install the camera, it will often be much easier to run a single cat 5 cable instead of adding a wall outlet.This is the switch I use and have no trouble with the system whatsoever (I'm sure cheaper options are available that also work)...http://www.amazon.com/8PORT-200-08P-SLM2008PT-NA-Gigabit-Switch/dp/B004OA6VUA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1343944897&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Sg+200-08PFYI the aforementioned switch will only be able to run 4 cameras since only half the ports are PoE. With any switch you purchase, you will want to ensure the number of PoE ports included will be enough to run all your cameras. Usually not all the ports have PoE.
