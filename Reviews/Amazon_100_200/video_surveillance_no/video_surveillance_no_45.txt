I purchased two of these units via Amazon, for a very low price compared to others I had seen on the net. They arrived quicky and I put in batteries, not supplied, and tested them at various locations in and outside the house. The sensors actually activated very easily but one did not transmit to the alarm unit. Fortunatly the one that worked acitvated both sound alarms placed in different locations and we were able to utilitze the single sensor in a common location to activate upon any entry to the main part of the house.The alarms sound loudly but can be toned down to preference and I like the flashing light system built into the alarms. They can be turned off and on easily. With the alarm sounding and flashing I would think a burglar would be leaving quickly and not waiting around to see if they were part of a commercial system. they would function well as driveway alarms also. Overall I would have given them a five star but the one unit didnt work.I plan to buy a couple of more of these units
