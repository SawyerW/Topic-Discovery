I like this idea of using powerline for video transmission. Logitech is always the leader of high tech stuffs.I bought a 750i and 700i. The setup is definitely not as easy as it claimed, at least for my case. I still can't make it working after 2 hours of tweaking. The installation of software is straight forward, but it can not find the 2 cameras that I attached, even they are placed at the same room, same power line. Tried to reboot PC, cameras, router, disabled firewall, nothing helped. Not sure if it is related to my windows 7 64bit system. The help file for firewall settings isn't quite up to date (There are instructions for norton firewall 2001-2007, but it's year 2010 now).I will have to call them tomorrow to figure out what was wrong.
