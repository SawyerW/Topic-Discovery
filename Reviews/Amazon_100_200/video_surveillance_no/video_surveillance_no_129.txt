I'm a petrol-head, and I like to record my driving, so I have purchesed this to record my-self driving, and once I recieved it I discovered that it does not work on new model cars, because all new cars have a very slope front window screen, so when you wanna put it on the front window you will not have any room for the camera unless you have the extension arm or put the camera up-side-down (which means you need an editing software to rotate the video), other than that it works fine.but if the main reason you will buy this product to fix on a car's front window screen get the extension arm or get one with a longer arm, you can actually see in the product pictures that all the pictures of front window mount have the extension arm.
