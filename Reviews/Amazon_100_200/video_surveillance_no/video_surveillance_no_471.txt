I could set the time and date, and it seemed to take three pictures each time I was done accessing the menus, but otherwise it did not work. I got no pictures either in daylight or nighttime and the green and red LEDs never lit up.The main switch to turn the LCD display on/off was flakey and I had to press it about 10 times to get a reaction. Apparently there is no quality control in the manufacturing of these devices. The low price is too good to be true.The description on Amazon says there is a back-lit LED display. NO, it is an LCD display and you'd better bring a flashlight to see it.The description says "Live screen preview for setting up field of view." This is incorrect. There is no way to set up the field of view. You just have to guess.The description says "Password protection..." There is no password protection.BEWARE: read the fine print in the manual: If you press both the UP and DOWN switches simultaneously your memory card is erased. The sticker on the device ought to tell you this.
