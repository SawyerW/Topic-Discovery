After attending my first neighborhood watch lecture from the local police department. I was very impressed with all the information the officer presented. She  explained that she used the "fake television light" in her own home as well as other safety measures. My husband set it up in our house and I was really surprised as to how much light the product emitted. The instructions were also very clear as to where to set the device up for maximum efficiency. Until the presentation from the police officer I had never heard of the device. I think it is a wonderful addition to safety device.
