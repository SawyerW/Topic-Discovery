I have a home you cannot see from the street and I work at home all day.  This driveway alarm as saved me from so many "unwanted" visitors.  I don't have to open my door unnecessarily now, not knowing who's on the other side.The alarm started going off frequently from squirrels and cats.  I raised the alarm to 5 feet or so off the ground and now it does not pick up the false alarms. We already have leaves falling here and so far it's not picking them up.  If so, oh well!  I can just turn off the alarm on days it's sensing too much.  My sensory is in a wooded area away from direct sunlight, which I heard can cause false alarms.I LOVE THIS DEVICE!  Best purchase I have made in a while!You may need to readjust the positioning of the sensor but once you have it figured out, it's great.Yes, there is only off, low and high.  the high can be heard from the backyard if the windows are open.  You can't miss the low one!  I have my receiver mounted in the foyer away from where anyone can sit and be "chimed in the ear!
