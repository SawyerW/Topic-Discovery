We have been in this house for 3 years and 3 months. After about one month, we realized our son - who is on the autism spectrum - enjoyed going for middle-of-the-night walks. After we replaced the door locks with two-way key-entry locks, we looked for an affordable way to be aware every time the doors opened. With three main doors - and our requirement to be easy-to-implement and affordable, this was a challenge. This product is the perfect fit. With a family of six, there's plenty of activity, but we have replaced each of the sensor batteries once in three years.
