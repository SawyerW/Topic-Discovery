I got this as a second camera for my system in my offroad support truck. The image is much more grainy than my original camera, and although it is clear enough to use, it doesnt like nighttime. It is useless for any distance viewing, but up-close should be ok such as hitching up your trailer, etc. Cant give it more than 3 stars due to grainy image. Used it for about 6 months so far in harsh conditions and still works fine. The lens is rather large, so easier to get waterspots and mud on it. have to drill a large hole, and it comes with a holesaw which will work for light material(plastic, thin sheet metal, etc.)Dont expect to drill thru heavy gauge steel. Still a nice touch to include it! I used my good hole saw to mount in 3/16 plate steel.
