Excellent product! Sticks to the window that I need it to stick to very well and securely. At the first joint (suction cup end), it is notched so it "clicks" at different angles (not continuous). For me, it is great since less chance of slipping. The more minute adjustments can be done at the ball joint at the other end of the arm.I received the genuine Panavise product.  So, I called the company to get the extension arm.  The extension arm is NOT included in the box; I need to call the company to get it.  The Customer Service Representative was very courteous asked for the Patent Number on the product.  They shipped the extension arm at no cost at all.Great company standing behind their product!!!
