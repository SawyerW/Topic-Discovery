I'm not sure how anyone could beat this for the price. It's simple to set up and incredibly loud. It has two settings: "chime" and "alarm". I tested it on "chime", not wanting to disturb my neighbors in our triplex. Even the "chime" was super loud and annoying. Maybe it wouldn't wake up neighbors in a next-door building, but it'll certainly alert the neighbors who share a wall with us. (My dog absolutely hated the noise; she's not usually very intimidating but maybe if this noise set her off a burglar wouldn't find her as friendly as usual.) I liked that the two parts of the alarm don't have to quite be touching, since the way our doors and windows are framed necessitate the parts of the alarm to be a little bit apart from one another. No, it's not a centralized alarm system. No, it won't stop a deaf burglar from entering your house. No, it won't tar and feather intruders like the "alarm" system in Home Alone. But if you want a very affordable and very loud alarm that can be set for home or for away, here it is.
