From the street, it really looks like your TV is on.  Just make sure the device cannot be seen through the window while it is operating.  There are two option settings besides the manual ON setting:  Dusk + 4 hours and Dusk + 7 hours.  In the summer, use the Dusk + 4 hour setting:  the unit will power on automatically when it gets dark [probably around 8pm] and will turn off 4 hours later.  In the winter, use the Dusk + 7 setting: the device will power on when it gets dark [around 4:30pm] and will remain on for 7 hours.And, if you have to leave the house right away in the evening, use the ON setting and the device will immediately start flashing like a TV picture and remain on until you manually turn it off, when you return home.  It operates on LED lights, so energy use is minimal.
