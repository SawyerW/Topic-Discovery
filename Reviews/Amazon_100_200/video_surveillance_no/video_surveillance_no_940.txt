This camera is easy to hook up and installed anywhere near an outlet.  I don't like the fact there is no pan and zoom but I knew that.  It does record very clear.  It only recorders when it detects motion, that it.  The software included to replay is good you can fast forward.  You can also view it from any internet.  I did not get the android app for $79.00 a year.  Watching over the internet is annoying you constantly have to keep watching icon when it pops up ever 5 or 10 minutes or it disconnects you.  This combined with my Panasonic that does pan and zoom and free android are perfect together.  Logitech one monitors the whole picture from the outside and the Panasonic the small details (from inside).  This is the combination that works at a reasonable price Approx. $600.  Don't waste your money on other package deals.
