After purchasing 4 other cameras and returning every one of them (including 2 top rated Foscam and 1 First Alert unit). I was frustrated and almost gave up on having a security camera setup.The outdoor Logitech Master system is awesome........and you can add additional cameras to complete a whole house system. Inside or outside.Installation, configuration, and operation is a breeze. Much better than a WiFi system.Video is awesome clarity and the thing just plain works great, couldn't be happier.Do yourself a favor and get 32GB cards for the outdoor cameras so you can store a lot of video when not running the Commander software.I don't get some of the other negative posts.......some of the connection issues can be easily fixed by moving the camera and network connection to the same phase of power. Easily done.Not easy to remove the micro SD card? Why in the world would you remove it? Makes no sense.....it's used as a backup to hold video, not remove and download.I think some of the negative reviews are from people that have no clue how the system works.I think Logitech did an exceptional job here......top quality hardware and the software works slick.Great deal for the price.
