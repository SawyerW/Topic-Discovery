I bought this to record video from my race car during sanctioned events. When coupled with a SMALL camera you cannot possibly ask for more. This thing holds on harder than clamping-style mounts.It's lasted 2 seasons so far and it's never fallen off of the car. I used to only use it inside, but after my confidence in it grew, I started mounting it on the exterior. This is a fantastic product. Don't buy the knock-offs; my friend has one, and it's not safe for vehicle use.I would imagine that putting a heavy camera on it would compromise it's stability, though.
