We decided to buy this monitor after our angelcare mat gave us the scare of our lives, just started beeping and our baby was fine.  I absolutely love the video monitor, it is easy to use, and easy to set up.  We mounted it to the top of our child's crib for a "bird's eye view" of her.  I can move it with me to any room in the house and then take the monitor wherever I need to go.  I had my step daughter keep watch as I walked across the street with the monitor during my daughter's nap and I still had a crystal clear picture and signal until I stepped inside our neighbors front door (probably 150 feet).  My only compliant is it makes an awful screeching sound when the monitor and camera get too close together and the charging port broke off after using it for 2 months (My husband works with electronics so he was able to fix it, otherwise I would have sent it back and requested a new one).  I really love this monitor and would reccommend it to anyone.
