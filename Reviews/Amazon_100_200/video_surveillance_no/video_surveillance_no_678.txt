The unit is very small and easy to position. You have a number of settings you can use; we just leave it on all the time. Since it uses LEDs, it doesn't use much electricity or get warm. The lighting it puts out does in fact look like a TV.My only complaint is the brightness. To get the full effect, you really have to place it near/facing a window. And you'll need some sort of blinds or sheer to help defuse the light a bit. We do have a good amount of outside lighting on at night, so that may be part of the problem.If they could boost the light output a bit; maybe another row or rows of LEDs, this would be perfect. As it is now, it's a little pricey for what it is.
