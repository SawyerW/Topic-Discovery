When my son was 10 months old he learned how to climb out of his crib. We had a standard sound monitor at the time so I couldn't see what he was doing. After the first incident, we decided it was time to buy a monitor that I could see and hear what was going on in his crib. We didnt know which monitor to buy. After watching the video on this monitor we decided we would try this one.We have had the monitor for about two months now and it was the best purchase ever! The night vision is clear, as well as the day time vision. I can hear him clearly and even talk to him through the monitor. It was easy to setup as soon as I got it in the mail. We recently visited our families and they could use it with ease when our son was going down for a nap. They enjoyed keeping an eye on their grandson while he was sleeping. This monitor was a good buy!!!
