I ordered this camera in early September, 2013, to use this season. Battery life of this camera is excellent as one set of cheap batteries lasted about 3 months. I got several photo's and for the price the quality of the photo's taken by this camera are great, sometimes a little soft but for the price totally worth it. The infrared light is great when you use them correctly at the right distance between 5-20 feet, too close blown out too far not light enough. The transition between night and day can sometimes be a little dark as the infrared doesn't go off sometimes. It does make some noise when it takes a picture but it did not seem to bother the deer too much. The strap to secure the camera to the tree is very sturdy but can be a little tricky at first, it really depends on which direction you run the strap through the loops. Overall I am very pleased with this camera and will be purchasing another very soon.
