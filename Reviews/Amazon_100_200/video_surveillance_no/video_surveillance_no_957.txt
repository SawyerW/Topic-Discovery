Purchased this item along with add-on camera, maybe another later. Understanding the use of household electrical wiring for flawless camera operation is pivotal. Getting them wired on the same circuit made hardware setup a snap.However, the software was difficult for a noob like me. It ran okay and found the cameras just fine, but the user interface and Logitech website takes some patience, trial and error to achieve intended results. No interaction. Maybe future updates will help with this.After several tries and two days of reading forums I finally got the Web Commander set how I want it. I didn't want to call support. The issue now is motion sensitivity. I don't want the camera to keep recording bees and wasps and send alerts. More trial and error.All-in-all the system works as advertised so far (4 days). I'll give it a couple of weeks before adding another camera.
