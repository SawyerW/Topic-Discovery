We live in an off-grid home with minimal indoor plumbing, and purchased this alarm to warn us when the buckets under our sink drains are getting full and need to be emptied. We attached the alarm to the inside of the cabinet and draped the sensor over the rim of the bucket. The multi-use alarm works wonderfully and it is VERY loud.Three features keep me from giving this unit 5 stars: 1) The sensor lead cable is very short which makes placing it a bit awkward; 2) there isn't a snooze/reset on the alarm, you must turn it ON/OFF manually with a side switch each time it goes off; 3) the ON/OFF switch is small and lard to locate in dim lighting (like a basement or under a cabinet) and there is no LED to indicate when it's ON.  The last two issues are particularly troublesome if you're using it in a situation of frequent wetting vs. rare.I would recommend this unit for warning about occasional basement or appliance leaks when the unit can be placed close to the area of concern in a well-lit location that is easily accessible.
