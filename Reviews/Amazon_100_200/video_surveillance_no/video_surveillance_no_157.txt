Isn't that the point?  It's LOUD!!!  I am very happy with it.  Easy to follow directions and oh so easy to install.  I ordered extra window alarms and they are loud enough.  Nobody is going to know that it's not hard wired to a system.  All they will see is the blinking light, then WOWZA that alarm!so for less than $50 I have alarms on all my windows and doors. It makes plenty of noise and will attract plenty of attention.  The window alarms aren't too loud, but they are loud enough and I even set mine up so the magnet strip and the unit are at right angles to each other.  Works great.All in all, I am very happy with them.
