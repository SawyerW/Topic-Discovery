I purchased these Midland Transparent Security headsets with PTT/Vox.  I received them new in the package as stated. I also purchased the Midland GXT760 Two Way Radios to go with these.  These are much more comfortable then the Ear pieces that come with the radios.  I did have to put the little rubber ends that you find on MP3 headphones on the ends for a much better fit.  I will be using these with a ATV close faced helmets so these will fit much nicer with the helmet. Trails don't open until the end of May so I can't really try them until then.  We did try them in the house to make sure they worked and they did.  The shipping was good and I would certainly recommend them with the Midland two way Radios if you purchase them.
