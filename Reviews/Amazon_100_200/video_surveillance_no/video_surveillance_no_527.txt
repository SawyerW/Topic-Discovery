I'll keep this short but if you have wireless internet you will have that constant background interference noise that a lot of people complain about! For this reason we had to return the monitor and bought the Summer Infant Day and Night which has technology that does not interfere with the wireless internet.We tried everything to get the noise out (unplugged chargers, moved the unit, etc etc).... we had no idea it was something that we couldn't unplug every time we used the monitor - our wireless internet! I found this out with a bit of research online.DO NOT GET IF YOU HAVE WIRELESS INTERNET
