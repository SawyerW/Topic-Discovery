I really don't get the 35 second delay setting for the home feature.. since this is basically an alarm to scare off burglars. The Away setting gives you a 45second delay before it activates on departure.. and 35 seconds to deactivate upon arrival.. but lets say somebody breaks in while your gone or you want to set the alarm when you head to work to keep loved ones safe.That is 35 seconds that the intruder has to walk through your house on detected... The normal alarm feature works great but you can only arm it when the door is closed so i can't  set it then go to work.. so good alarm for a night when your sleeping but not the best.
