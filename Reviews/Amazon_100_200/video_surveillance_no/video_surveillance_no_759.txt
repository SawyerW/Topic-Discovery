I purchased four Logitech 700e cameras, three of them work and the fourth one is brand new and it will not work. Logitech will not repair or replace it this camera. Why? The camera is supposed to be under warranty for three years but Logitech says it is out of warranty based on the serial number of the camera. Logitech told me I would have to pay full price for another one even though I had proof of when I ordered the camera and it is still under warranty. Not going to do it! Not going to ever buy another Logitech product and do not recommend this brand/company to anyone. After you call their customer support all you get is computer generated e-mails. I wasted $300 plus too much time talking to Logitech. Save your money and go with another brand.
