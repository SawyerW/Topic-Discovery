Have recently installed single camera system.  Want very much to give higher rating as so much is right about this system.  Installation was a snap.  Picture quality is great.  However two things that are major short comings at least for my intended use:1) Remote viewing requires firewall to be open to protocol and ports that are blocked by my company so I cannot view from work.  Suspect this will be true of most who work for corporate America where IT departments are robust.2) The alerts I get are too blurry for identification.  Not sure what camera parameters are involved but even in ideal conditions the motion detection provides a picture where the thing/person detected is just a blur.Both of these seem correctable, but after forum search looking at other's complaints going back quite a ways I would have to say that Logitech does not appear to be responsive.There are cheaper systems if all you want to do is get a general "comfort level" view of your property.
