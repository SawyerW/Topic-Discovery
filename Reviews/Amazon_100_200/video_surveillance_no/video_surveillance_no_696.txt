This thing really looks like a TV from outside.  I set it up and took my daughter outside and pointed up tot the window.  She got scared and said, "who is watching TV in there?" (no one else was home).  So I assume it would fool the bad guys as well.  This unit has a light sensor that allows it to switch on when it gets dark outside (at dusk).  There are two settings, "Dusk +4 Hours" and "Dusk + 7 Hours). My only complaint is that the "Dusk + 7 Hours" setting goes WAY beyond 7 hours.  I have found that thing blinking away at 3:30 AM, when dusk was about 4:30 PM.  So the bad guys would think there is an insomniac watching TV in the middle of the night - maybe not such a bad thing, but not what it is supposed to do.
