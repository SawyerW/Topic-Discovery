when I installed this camera, all my other cameras stopped working.  Oops.  I had a lot of frustration, but in the end, all I had to do was reset all the older cameras by pressing a very tiny button through a very tiny hole on the back of the cameras.  Then, my system rediscovered all the cameras and I was back up and running.On the quality side:  I haven't had this camera long enough to know about durability, so I can't opine on that.  However, the video quality seems to be less than I get from the 700i cameras.  It may still be good enough.  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, so add your own grain of salt to my comment.I will buy another camera just like this one and would buy from this vendor again.
