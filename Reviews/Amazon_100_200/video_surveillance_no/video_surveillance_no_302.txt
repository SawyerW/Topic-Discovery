We use this dewvice on the front door of our business to alert us if we are out in the shop of a customer entering the building. The base plugged into the wall is only about 30-35ft from sensor on front door which is well within the advertised range, but the base only makes noise when it wants to. We changed the batteries in the door sensor to find the same problem. This product is 5 months old and will now have to go in the trash because the seller does not take returns after 60 days. I would not recommend this product to any one, this product is a piece of junk.
