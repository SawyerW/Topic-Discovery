I am extremely satisfied with this product, and have already thought of several ways to use it.It turns out to be a multi-purpose monitoring tool!One is as marketed, as a "Driveway Alarm". It does have a 400 foot range!You can tell when vehicles enter your long driveway.It also can monitor people walking by, as well as larger animals, when mounted 4 feet above the ground.The second is as a warning device to tell us when deer have invaded our garden, to eat our beans!The third is to offer me, a bowhunter, an opportunity to monitor deer trails remotely. (I wish it had an earbud jack!)The fourth is as a burgler alarm for our garage, or outside areas around our home. Any one of several sensors can set off one alarm!The fifth is to monitor the inside of our car, when parked in our driveway, overnight.The sixth is to monitor the entrance of our hotel room, and sound the alarm when an intruder enters.If you purchase several to strategically position for perimter surveilance, you can use one alarm at each of several locations, such as your bedroom(s), and have another alarm by your side while you watch TV!
