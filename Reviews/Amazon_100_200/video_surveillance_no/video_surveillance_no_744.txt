The camera is awesome - it does what is says, and records with no problems in the daylight and during the night. The IR movies are really crisp and one can see facial features - they are recognizable. It is infrared triggered (unless you set it to record all the time) and the range for the trigger is ~ 15 feet in my experience. The only reason I am not giving it 5 starts, but 4, is the fact that the base unit (recording unit) does not auto-restart in case of power failure. We recently went for a long vacation, and all the recordings are fine, but there was a power failure, and there was nothing for the last four days.
