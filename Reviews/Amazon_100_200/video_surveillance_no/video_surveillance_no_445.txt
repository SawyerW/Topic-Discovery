We have paid up to $500 for hunting/game camera's in the past - and all of them have been fine - or just okay, but for the price of this camera - it's by far the best one we have.  It does not flash at all - it has night vision - super important so anyone or anything in view is not made aware of, or scared off by it; it's lightweight and has great battery life, and with a 2G card, also purchased with AMAZON - I left it outside for 2 weeks and it's still clicking away.  Also does not have to be reset with time, etc after changing the batteries - it saves the info - how great is that!  SUPER great deal.  I should have bought 2, but I thought I would see how it was first, for only $88. When seeing AMAZON prices and deals, I always think "great deal". But then I worry "you get what you pay for" - not true with this camera - you get SO much more than expected. I will definitely be buying another one or two!
