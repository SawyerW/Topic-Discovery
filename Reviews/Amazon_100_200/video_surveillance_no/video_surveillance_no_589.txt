My husband and I had very high hopes about this monitor.  We did our research and we were watching it until it went on sale and then we decided to finally buy it.  I was so excited and couldn't wait to use it. It has great camera vision that is clear with excellent night vision but the first night we used it the hand remote beeped at midnight letting us know the actually camera battery had died.  Mind you it was fully charged when we went turned it on around 9pm (after 6+ hours of charging). The battery only lasted a total of 3-4 hours.  How can you a make a camera that only lasts that long?! So annoying!! We are returning this and buying a more expensive one with a longer lasting battery!Another disappointment is we purchased this "new", and the box was taped up like it was previously opened, and one of the instruction manuals were bent.  This made us feel as though it was refurbished or something similar, which would explain why it took 3 weeks to ship.
