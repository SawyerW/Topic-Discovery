Most anyone who has this camera/monitor combo will be pleased with their purchase. It does well in a variety of conditions (low light, through a lot of walls, over a relatively long range). The two-way talk feature is very versatile and the ability to watch up to 4 cameras split-screen at the same time is very impressive at this price point.The only complaint is how flimsy the handset/monitor is. One fall onto our tile floor and that was it. However, as testament to how highly we think of this monitoring system, we bought the exact same one as our replacement... and are now SUPER careful about how fragile the handset is. Now that we have extra an extra camera unit we are using a camera as a front door monitor too. This is a nice thing to have when there are so many deliveries coming to the door around xmas.The set up is brainless and the built-in rechargeable batteries are wireless communication make everything really convenient.
