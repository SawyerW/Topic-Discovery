No, this review didn't wind up in the wrong place!  We bought the FakeTV to deter raccoons out of our attic, and it works great!  All those changing lights are apparently very confusing and disorienting to the little masked pests.  We have searched high and low for a good, effective raccoon control to no avail, so we thought we'd try this on a whim.  The raccoons show up VERY briefly, and then leave every time. I'm sure the FakeTV is also great for what it is intended for, but we are SO happy to have discovered something that works for raccoons (and who knew??)
