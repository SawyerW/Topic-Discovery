I can't believe how easy this was to set up.  The majority of the time on my end was spent 'prettying up' the installation so that it looked nice (I purchased the Outdoor Camera).  Other than that, it was running the disk, plugging the camera in, and viola - video.  At first, the video was really crappy and I was disappointed.  I called Logitech support, we reset the camera, and the video was great.  Support was helpful, and now the camera is up and running.  My camera views my driveway and the cul-de-sac, so my son spends a lot of time out playing basketball, then coming in and critiquing his own performance!I owned a WiLife camera before, but this new one has a better look and feel to it.  It's worth the money.  If you are a PC genius, there are probably cheaper ways to accomplish video surveillance.  However, if you want the ease of plugging it in and not having to debug it, mess with a WiFi network, etc., then I suggest this guy.  Very happy!
