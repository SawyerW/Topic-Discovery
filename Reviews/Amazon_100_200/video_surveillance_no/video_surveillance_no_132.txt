I ordered one of these mounts so I could record video during our trips. The problem I have with this product is that the arm is a little too small and I could not get the correct angle for my JVC digital recorder. I had read in other post that there was a extension arm for this product so I emailed Julie at PanaVise and within minutes I had a response from her. The next email I received from Julie was a confimation that the extension was on it's way at no cost to me.I have not seen customer service like this is a LONG time. This company is going into my favorites list.
