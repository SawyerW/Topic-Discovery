wow this thing works great, and the variable setting is super sensitive.... which i like.paired with my Viper 5704, which a shop installed. I bought this 508d from here and it was plug and play. the 5704 brain comes with 2 slots (similar to USB ports on your laptop). one slot was already used up by the shock sensor (included in the inital shop install).  so when this thing came, i just located the brain under my dash and plugged it into the #2 slot. worked right away. setting the sensor is easy, there are two dials, one for interior/strength, and one is for exterior. fiddle with it, i found it fun to experiment.i've got lots of fog lights, tools, camping gear, radio equipment in my Toyota and this makes me sleep better at night.
