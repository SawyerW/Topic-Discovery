After reading the reviews posted here, I was actually surprised at the loudness of the 3 window alarms.  Perhaps the batteries were fresh, because all of the window and the door alarms I received are piercingly loud at 120-decibels.  The kits I received did come with all the necessary screws and double-sided tape to install the door and window alarms.  But, I used double-sided Velcro tape (as recommended by a reviewer) and this has worked like a charm!  Using chime mode, the kits have been very effective alert systems for toddlers in the house.  Also, if strategically placed, a burglar won't be able to see the window alarm attached to the frame.  It would be nice if the chime made a double set of 'ding-dong' sounds instead of a single set, but this is the only mild complaint I have about chime mode.  Also, the door system is pretty effective in alarm mode.  The alarm will continue to pierce even if the door is closed after being opened, so the only way to turn off the sound is to enter your 4-digit code.All in all, more than I expected and I'm extremely satisfied.
