We loved this monitor (despite the fact that it cannot function on a flat surface without falling over) until it failed when our baby was 7 months old: it would not work unless we reseated the battery or disconnected the power plug every few minutes.  Customer support originally promised an advance-replacement (we get a new one before we send the malfunctioning one back), but never followed through. A week later the rep sent us an email asking for the unit back first, and telling us the company would ship the new one a week after receipt.. We would also have to pay for shipping both ways. It took many phone calls to get the company to honor its original commitment - and nothing worked until I told the customer service person that I had purchased the monitor at Costco and would simply take it back. Costco must charge the returns back to the company, because there was an immediate change of attitude.
