Warning!!!I've had this system for about two years.  While the software is clunky and sometimes slow, it usually does the job and the quality of the video is very good.  BUT...be warned that the clear cover over the glass lens is a coated plastic and the coating on one of my cameras has failed.  I called Logitech to get a replacement plastic and was told that Logitech does not sell parts.  So, if your camera is beyond the one year warranty be prepared to buy a replacement camera.  I personally opened the camera and removed the failed coated plastic cover and will try to fashion a replacement.  I had heard that Logitech was not a very consumer friendly company.  This is now confirmed.
