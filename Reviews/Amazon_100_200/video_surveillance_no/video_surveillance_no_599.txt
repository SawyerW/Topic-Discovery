I've owned a baby camera monitor before and now need one that can monitor 2 rooms.  This product advertises long distances and easily able to switch between both cameras.  We got this system and the screen would not work unless the base was right next to the camera.  The base would not even recognize the second camera.  We kept trying over and over to adjust it and finally gave up.  Our house is small and we were trying to use them in rooms all adjacent to each other (which the product advertised it could easily handle).  We returned the system immediately and are now ordering a different brand.
