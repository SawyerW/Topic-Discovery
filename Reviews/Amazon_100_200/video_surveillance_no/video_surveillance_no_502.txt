I bought this camera to catch a thief that was stealing tools from me and other employees at work (Automotive servie center). I put the camera up about 12 feet high and attached it to a peice of conduit and angled it down so it would capture anyone in the vacinity of my tool box or the tool box next to mine.  Since it has been up nothing has gone missing from any of the 20 technicians in the shop. I even went so far as leaving tools out on my tool box as bait. I feel much safer knowing that the camera is guarding my personal property and have great confidance it will catch the perpetrator.The camera itself is very easy to use and takes pretty clear pictures. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is, it seems to have trouble switching from night (black and white) pictures to day time (colored) pictures. Other than that it is a great camera.
