I bought this suction mount to attach a webcam to the windshield of my car for taking road-trip time lapse videos. With a little thought, I figured out a simple way to mount a Logitech Pro 9000 webcam to the threaded stud on the suction mount. Works like a charm.Was concerned when buying one of these that it wouldn't stay put, that it would, sooner or later, suddenly throw itself off the glass without any warning. This hasn't happened, even with leaving the unit in place in sunny (ie: warm) conditions for at least four days.It does not require any special degree of cleanliness on the window, or other surface preparation to make it stick effectively. When mounted, it almost feels strong enough that you could hang a manhole cover from the thing.
