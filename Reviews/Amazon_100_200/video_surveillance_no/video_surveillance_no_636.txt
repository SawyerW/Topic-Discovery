I don't have a baby, but I do love tech things! I got hold of this little item a couple weeks back and I've had all sorts of fun playing around with it!First, the set-up on this is pretty easy. You rig up the camera where you want it to be, and then you just plug in the charger base and activate the remote. Next thing you know, you're sitting in one room and seeing/hearing things in another room!Now I will say that the picture quality is not the best, nor is the sound quality, but they are pretty good, and the low-light visibility is a real plus. I could see that being quite useful for parents who want to, for example, make sure the baby is laying on it's back. I also really like the fact that you can control multiple cameras with one remote!One thing the device doesn't have that I would have liked is the ability to pan and zoom with the camera. But that's ok. For what it is it's pretty darn neat!
