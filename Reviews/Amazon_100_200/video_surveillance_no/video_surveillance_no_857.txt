The product it self, i mean, the camera, lens, features are just great. well constructed and very easy installation.the headaches comes when you want to access your cameras through a remote computer (ie. office). The only way its through the logitech alert web page and they just give you the basic features for free. If you want to control the zoom and your recordings and configurations, you'll have to pay about $80,00 as an annual fee.This is very frustrating when you have already spend a lot of money in their system; they're not happy with that money...they want more!! they want more money from you! so they create this Web Service to access your own camera features...please...this is a home consuming product not a professional high quality grade domotic solution!!Every camera in the market has an embedded web server for aacessing it with every camera functions it cames with...but this camera does not...THE SOLUTION?Please try installing a VPN server in your home and using the propietary LAN Logitech software through web VPN access from your office... I have not tried this option, but theorically it will work...
