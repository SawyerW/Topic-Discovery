We purchased this monitor with an extra camera about 18 months ago and have been extremely happy with it. We have used it in our previous and current homes, both 2 stories, without any difficulties.  We have 2 cameras, one in each of our children's rooms, and love the portability of the handset.  The picture quality and night vision are excellent. We LOVE the walkie-talkie feature and use it often to quiet our older child when he wakes up from a bad dream or to find out if he really needs our help with something before we debate whose turn it is to go. The whole system is so easy to use and portable that we've taken it with us on several vacations and used it to let our younger child nap while we sit & chat, etc. in an adjoining room. We took on a lake cabin vacation last summer and found that it worked as far away as our relatives' cabin about 50 yards from ours.  The handset appears a little flimsy but it has withstood lots of hard use by us and shown no signs of giving in. I'd absolutely recommend this monitor to anyone!
