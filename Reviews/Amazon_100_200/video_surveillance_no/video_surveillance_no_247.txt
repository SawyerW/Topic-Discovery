I have used these now for two years and am modifying my review. We use these mics while hunting. The microphone is the weakest part of the system. You need to have the microphone almost in your mouth in order to be heard by other radios. You can't be heard if you have the microphone clipped to your shirt or lapel. We have six of these in our group and all have the same transmission problems with very weak pick-up. That said given the other options for the price it works as long as you put the microphone next to your lips. The ear piece is very comfortable but can dislodge itself if the cord is bumped or pulled when mounting your gun. This can be easily solved by picking up some Macks ear plugs, the inexpensive, wax type used for swimming. Place the mic plug in your ear and then cover it up with the wax. It will keep the ear piece firmly in place and will act as an additional sound brake to reduce gun noise. The product works, but is not great by any means.
