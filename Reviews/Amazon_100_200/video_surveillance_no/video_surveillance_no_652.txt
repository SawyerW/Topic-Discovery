This product review is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about "new and pre-released items." We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.We found this product to be difficult to set up but attractive for its compact design. When shared with new parents, they liked its functionality and product offering but found that it is not user friendly.Its pocket-sized video monitor with 2.4-inch super-bright LCD screen and camera is an excellent offering.
