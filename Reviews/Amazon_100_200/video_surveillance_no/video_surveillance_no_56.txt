This guy is super easy to set up and very loud.  I don't find it to be over-sensitive, so you can move it about without setting it off.  Once you do tap the metal sensor, however, a big, high-pitched screech is released.I bought this because my door alarm has a 30-second delay so I wanted a back-up alarm that sounds immediately when I'm in my apartment.  It works as intended and I'm happy with the product and the price.I docked a star because this thing slides a bit on wood floors.  If someone opened the door, it would still go off, but I think if someone flung the door open, it would set the alarm off initially and then the unit would slide away.  I haven't been able to test this theory, but I'm pretty sure it won't work as a door-stop for this reason.
