What a great mount. I use it inverted with the 3" extension that it came with. The mount is not advertised at all to have this mount but it sure came with one. Using my Canon Vixia HF100 it was a bit too bouncy. Even though that is a small light HD Camcorder it still weighs a few pounds.[...]It is a very small digital cam that can record reasonable quality 720p res video. A nice advantage too is a digital camera will give you a much wider field of view than a stock camcorder lens. I found the cam jostled around a lot less, and I think it was because it was so much lighter. It did however have this audio static when it was mounted for some reason.Anyway, the mount is well worth the money. I am not sure if you could use it on a race track. But I am using it to record driving around in my 2007 Yaris.
