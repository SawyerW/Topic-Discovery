This was a replacement for the old Black and Decker system that is no longer made. Perfect fit, easy instructions, great lock works 100%. Even comes with it's own phillips screw driver that is the correct size.This company have made great improvements on this lock and the technology is current. The key way is an SW1 the best keyway in the US. Locksmith was impressed, as old keyway was KW. It came well packages and very quickly. Would recomend that if you need an electronic entry way and don't want to mess with pushing numbers in the dark, this is the answer. Our entry is on the dark side and you can push the buttom on the key fob transmitter and open or close the lock. The red and green light tells you if the transmitter and reciver connected. Well worth the money with two fob transmitters and two SW-1 keys.The old one had a red led inside to tell when it was locked the new does not.
