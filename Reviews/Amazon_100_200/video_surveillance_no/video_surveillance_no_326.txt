I used this to install my Dropcam security camera outside.  I put the dropcam in a PVC pipe enclosure and sealed it with silicone.  I then drilled a hole in the top of the pipe holding the Dropcam and screwed in the swivel head.  I secured the connection further with some JB Weld to ensure it stays sealed.  So far, a week out, the mount is doing it's job perfectly.  The swivel has stayed in the position I locked it into with the adjusting screw.  The install was also easy, it comes with screws for the round mounting plate.  The mount is pretty solidly build from steel.
