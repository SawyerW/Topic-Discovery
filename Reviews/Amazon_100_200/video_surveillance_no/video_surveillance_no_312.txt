The last time I bought one on Amazon it was too big and bulky to put on this metal door jam and metal door frame.  This one was nice and small and I taped the bigger side up and superglued the small side to the door.  The chime plugs in so I don't have to buy batteries like the old one.  There are 3 ringtones.  I only wanted din so I had to add a jumper which it did not come with.  I finally have a chime again so people can't come in unbeknownst to me any more.  Also the chime has a volume adjustment.  I am happy.
