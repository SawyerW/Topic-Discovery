We have 4 boys and I really thought people were crazy for buying video monitor.  I mean really do you need to watch every move your child does???  HOWEVER, I borrowed my brothers because my 18 month old was sleeping excessively.  Come to find out he just likes his bed.  Sleeps, plays, sleeps again!  He is so quiet I wouldn't have known unless I could see him.So yes I would be one of those "crazy" people that watches their child all the time.  It has also been great with a second camera. We put it in our other boys room and we can talk to them or see if they are out of bed when they are suposed to be sleeping :)I would tell anyone to get it!  :)
