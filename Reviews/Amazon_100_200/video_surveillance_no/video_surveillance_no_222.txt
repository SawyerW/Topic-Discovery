I decided to up grade my alarm on my conversion van it was just your plain old alarm that only work if you open the the door to the vehicle and todays theif are very smart from what I have seen and heard i wanted a little more protection so i decided to give the506TIT audio sensor a try and I  very satisfied on how easy it was to intstall to my asisting alarm I placed it in center of the dash  and turned it up and went around the van tapping on the windows and every time I taped on the glass it would set off the alarm and now i can sleep a little better knowing i have a little more sercurity on my vehicle it works great
