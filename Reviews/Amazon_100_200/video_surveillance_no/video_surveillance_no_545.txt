So, this is a great little monitor... if you don't mind having your WiFi Internet connection slow to a crawl or just halt every time you turn the monitor on.  With ours, the monitor could be on upstairs (50 feet from the router), and downstairs (30 feet away) would not have internet connection.Other than that, video quality is decent.  About what you would expect for the price.  I love the battery operated handset.  It is compact and the battery easily lasts 5 hours.One other pet peev that we had (yes, we returned it) was that when the monitor is focused on a specific camera (we had two cameras), the camera would show a green light.  This was entertaining to my 3 year old, which tended to keep him awake so that he could wave to us :)
