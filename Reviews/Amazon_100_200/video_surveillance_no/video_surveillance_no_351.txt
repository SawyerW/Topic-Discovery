It was the glowing reviews here on Amazon that made me decide to invest in this fascinating little camera, and those reviews were spot on. I, like a few others, originally spent about $100 on the Linksys camera - which is a complete waste of time and money. The Panasonic camera blows away the cheap imitations, and the saying, "You get what you pay for" could never be truer.If you're like I was, and feel hesitant to purchase the camera because of the high(er) cost, trust me - it's worth every penny. Take that advice from someone who tried to save a few bucks with a cheaper camera.The resolution is great, panning functions are superb, sound is crisp, and the free hosting is fantastic. Plus the advanced functions are more than I could have asked for. And unlike the Linksys camera, this one doesn't bog down my whole network while streaming video. We'll be sure to buy a few more of these in the near future.My only complaint... the lack of support in Firefox. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. IE handles it without any problems.
