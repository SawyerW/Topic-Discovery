While the combinations of features, price, and form make the product appealing on paper, it's a terrible, over-priced product that is also plagued by quality issues. When I was using the system, it was constantly flapping, with video dropping at random times. In addition to dropping video, prolonged usage of the system would cause the internet to drop as well. As soon as the device was unplugged, internet service returned to normal with no interruptions. I used a combination of routers, computers, and operating systems, all to no avail.Needless to say, I've moved on to other options that are more reliable and of better quality.
