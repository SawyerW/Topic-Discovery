This mount seemed promising until I tried to use it. The main problem is that it is very hard to get the camera attached to remain in the position you placed it in. To lock it down you have to push down hard on the swivel cap and quickly tighten the screw. Hopefully the tension will be enough to keep the camera from flopping down due to gravity. This causes another problem, as while you tighten the screw to hold the camera in place, if you tighten it a tad to much it strips the teeth on screw hole and makes the whole thing useless. You might get some use out of it if you are extremely careful with it, but don't do a lot of adjustment or you WILL strip the screw.
