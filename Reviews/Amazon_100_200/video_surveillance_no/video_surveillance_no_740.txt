I purchased my first SVAT GX301-010 digital wireless security system for my home in December 2012.  Absolutely love it.  Very easy installation.  Easy to operate.  I have 2 cameras connected to a 19 inch televion for easy viewing.  I have since purchased 2 additional cameras to expand coverage of my property.  My most recent purchase was for my mother (age 82 and lives alone) which included a 2 camera system with 7 inch monitor.  She has a 7 inch monitor by her bed for nighttime viewing and a 19 inch tv to view during the day so she can see who is at the door prior to opening the door. I do plan to expand her system also.  She feels more secure and is very pleased with her system.
