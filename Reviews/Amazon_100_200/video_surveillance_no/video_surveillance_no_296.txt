I bought this door chime to let me know when the front door has been opened.  Thus allowing me to be aware if my children have opened the door.  The chime works great for this reason, and it is loud for me to hear upstairs.  However, if a movie is on, or music, or when one of my children or I play an instrument it also goes off.  This is very annoying!  Now when I hear the chime I'm pretty sure it is not from the door being opened.  This door chime would only work in a home that is as quiet as a library.  I now have to try and find a different alarm that is not sensitive to sound.
