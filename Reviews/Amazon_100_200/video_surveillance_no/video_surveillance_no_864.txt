I love these cameras - I bought the indoor ones - one of them with nightvision.  I have one in my living room which sees basically the entire 2nd floor of my place, and the nightvision one in the bedroom which looks out the door.  Works absolutely great.  Has an iPhone app so you can monitor them whenever and wherever.  It will even send you notifications if it detects movements in areas that you set up.  Logs all of the video for as long as you need it - truly a great security device and it was really easy to set up.
