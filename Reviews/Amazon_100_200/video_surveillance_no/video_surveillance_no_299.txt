Just installed in a small two story retail boutique setting.  The sensor is on the first floor in the back, the receiver/chime second floor in the front.  Works every time.  The magnet is about 3/4" from the sensor which exceeds the recommended gap, but it still works.  The instruction says three tone settings are possible: Westminster, Ding-Dong, and Ding.  I'm using Ding-Dong.  I've ordered another one, so that I can install it on the front door as well.  I'll use the Ding tone to distinguish it from the back door.  I'll place the second receiver on the first floor.  So far, this is working great.  An included spacer will come in handy for the glass swing door in front.  I wish they sold the sensor separately so that I don't have to buy another receiver. But, at that price, I don't really mind.  The "jumpers" are awkward for adult-sized hands, but I figure they keep the cost down.
