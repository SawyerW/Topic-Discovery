Bought this to see what was wondering up and down the wash behind my property.  Got amazing night time pictures of coyotes, javelina, raccoons and the occasional human.  I put it next to my bird bath and I got some great pictures of a couple of hawks and got sampling of the neighborhood birds.  It takes some pics of waving branches and flying birds will set it off and be long gone before the 10 second delay sets in.  Not the greatest resolution but I know an artist who uses the same camera model to take pictures and then enlarges the pics to poster size and then paints and draws on the images to produce remarkable art.  Overall, its been more fun than useful but I'm not a hunter and the price wasn't bad.
