Installed in 2009 Accord V6.  Not a real must in every security system, but as I went all out on my alarm I figured I'd truly go all out.  2way FM(6000' range), Window modules, R/S, remote sunroof open and close, dual shock sensors, tilt sensor, proximity sensor, AND glass breakage sensor.Placement is key for even coverage.  I removed the mic from it's bulky housing and crafted a much smaller bezel putting this in the bottom part of the center console.  It is almost invisible but a gentle tap of a key on any piece of glass sends a pre-warn.  Although it will pre-warn with jingling keys occasionally  :pDEI has always been the brains behind the mayhem in the automotive security sector, this lives up to Directed's rep. :)
