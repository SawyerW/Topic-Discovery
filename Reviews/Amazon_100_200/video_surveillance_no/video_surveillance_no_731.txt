My mom lives in a pretty small neighboorhood, though it is close to a few highschools. Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage. They look real from a distance, but I think when you're really close to them, they look basic. We hung our high. The stickers were a nice touch. The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house. The fake cord as packaged (at least in mine) was just hanging off the camera.
