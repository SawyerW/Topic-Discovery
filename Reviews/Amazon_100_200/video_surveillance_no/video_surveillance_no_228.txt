My family of 4 bought this for skiing so we can keep track of the kids. Wears very comfortably under helmets and my 180's.  The alligator clip is very close to where the button is to speak into the mic and I can't tell you how many times it came unclipped when trying to talk and then you have to fumble around to get it clipped back on. When speaking, it's very clear. We put our mics on the edge of our jackets and lined the wire underneath our jackets so it doesn't get tangled, that worked out great. Overall, it's a great product. My husband is going to have to jerry rig the alligator clip somehow though.
