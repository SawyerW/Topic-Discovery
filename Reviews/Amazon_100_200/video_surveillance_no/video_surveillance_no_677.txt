Very simple, plug it in and face it towards one of your window shades or a curtain that does let light filter through as the instructions state.  It flickers like a real TV.  It uses basically no power, the lights are LEDs.  It can be set to turn on at dusk and run for 4 hours or 7 hours.  One thing that surprised me is that it is tiny.  Just about as tall and wide as a credit card.  Some say that the light sensor is too/not sensitive enough, you can set the switch to the ON position and plug it into a standard timer.
