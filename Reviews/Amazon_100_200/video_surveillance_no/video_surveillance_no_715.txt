I purchased 3 of these hard drives as an upgrade to the capacity of my older Seagate 500GB 7200RPM 16MB buffer ES2 hard drives. These WD drives run quiet and are causing less heat. To rate the speeds, my PC's boot up time is much faster now compared to the boot up time it took for the Seagates with freshly installed operating system. These WD RE4 drives are booting average 10 seconds faster and are much more responsive such as when accessing large data.I always used Seagate hard drives, and didn't feel the need to try any other. Unfortunately, due to the drop in the quality of the Seagate hard drives, I have decided that it was time give WD a try.  I currenly own 3 WD RE4 1TB, 1 WD 750GB 7200TB 2.5" hard drives. Using them for about 8 hours a day, I am totally satisfied with the performance of these drives.
