I have three now and they have performed greatly over their price. I use the normal settings and have gotten great life from the batteries. I get clear pictures at around 30 to 40 yards away. For the price of some higher priced cameras that underachieve, I got three that may not be the highest tech but got me into watching multiple spots very economically. After reading some of the feedback from higher priced cameras that are horrible performers, these Primos 35's look better by the day. If I have a complaint it would be that some deer seem to notice the infrared at night but the deer do not seem to be spooked. It did not come camo but for the price some masking tape and spray paint took care of that.  I will probably add two more next year!
