So I bought this unit mostly because I am a "cheapo" and didn't really know how I would like using the trail cameras and let me tell you this thing is great for the price. I'm just going to list out the pros and cons and make this easier on you to read.Pros:High quality pictures during the dayThe ability to switch from video/pictureBeing able to change time of video recorded/amount of pictures takenVery easy to use and setupDecent battery lifeCons:On many of the videos the camera didn't start recording till the deer was dead in line with the camera (which makes me wonder if a deer didn't walk right in front of it did the camera even see it?)Night pictures aren't the greatest and if the deer isn't extremely close it's hard to tell the spread, points, and size of the deer. I assume this is because the LEDs aren't bright enough.Deer can definitely see this thing when it takes pictures at night. On the second picture the deer was always looking right at the camera.Overall, I would recommend purchasing the Primos Truth Camera 35 and I will be purchasing another for next season.
