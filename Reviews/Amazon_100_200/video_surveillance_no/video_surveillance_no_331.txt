I ordered many of these as suggested with Foscam cameras.  Turns out the cams came with their own mounts and Amazon should not have suggested to buy these to me AND should have listed that those cameras came with mounts.  These mounts are a little better than the included ones but not much and I found that 1 out of 3 screws didn't have a fully imprinted screw heads which means there was no way to screw them in through the mount in to a base and you'd have to improvise with your own screws to install the mount.  In the Foscam case you can not simply use their screws with this mount because they are too small for the mount's holes.
