I was not familiar with critter cams, so I was unaware that you can't use the camera to view the pictures taken.  You need to remove the Sandisk (not included) and view the photos on it with another device.  I have a Cannon Powershot, and it read the disk just fine.  You should also be aware that the camera requires four D-cell batteries (not included) to operate.Setup was fairly easy.  One minor nit on the user manual -- it should show the proper orientation for the Sandisk when installing it in the slot (Sandisk label facing the front of the camera, end with the copper contacts goes in first).  And note, it's much easier to install/remove the Sandisk with the camera "door" open -- it says that in the manual, but I missed it.
