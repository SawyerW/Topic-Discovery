The monitor has a good range (signal is strong all over our 2000+ square foot house) and the picture on the display is crisp and clear. Although it is advertised as a camera as well, it doesn't really have the memory to allow you to take lots of nice digital pictures. Buy it for its monitor features, not for its use as a camera. The materials and workmanship are a bit flimsy, with the plastic parts easy to break. Although I have not had to contact customer service, I hear it is a nightmare. Still, if all you want is a nice clear video monitor, this fits the bill.
