If you want a quality camera this sure isn't it. Trigger time is advertised as 1.5 seconds. Mine will not take a picture of a  slow moving car on my 150 foot driveway in the day time. It will take a picture of a deer if it stands and looks at the camera for an extended time. Called Primos and they couldn't find my warranty registration that I did online. The camera is 8 weeks old. Primos will send me another camera for $20. They advertise a 40 foot picture range, mine will take a picture of a deer at 15 feet. Very poor quality camera and Amazon shouldn't associate their good name with this product.
