Bought three of these (actually, 2 of them were the FTV-11 extra bright), as we've started to have some burglary in the neighborhood.Works as-advertised and very simply. I comes on with darkness and runs either 4 or 7 hours.You can also set it for constant on and use it with an external timer.I do that to make it look like the TV viewer is moving around the house. Also lets it come on in the dark (like early AM  when you leave for work before dawn like me.Even this smaller one is bright enough to show through thin roller shades on both sides of my house when it's pitch dark.If there is a downside, it's light changes are pretty dramatic at times and makes it look like you're watching action movies on commercial TV all the time.Still, beats static night lights for peace of mind while you're out.
