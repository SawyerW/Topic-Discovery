For around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love.  This is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. I put mine on my back porch so whenI open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody willbe there to surprise me. People who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. But these units are perfect. I've had mine for several daysand NOT once has it gone off for no reason....but it HAS sounded every time it should have. The range is even better then I expected. Only two things I'd change. Why the LED on the transmitter? I taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. Why alert intruders they're being watched? Andit would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an AC outlet to save on batteries. I have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind.
