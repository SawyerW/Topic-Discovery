I bought one of these to monior my house while on vacation.  The reviews suggested that it was the best for the price.  The set up was also supposed to be the easiest of the lot and it turned out to be relatively simple until I got to the internet set up.  Using a Mac with a Time Capsule router was not the "easy as pie" operation that I had hoped for.  It was more like French torte with cream and chocolate sauce. I began gathering the packing material for a return, and made the cursory call to tech support.  I've never had good phone tech and did not expect anything different this time.  I was wrong.  Best ever.  The guy walked me through the not-too-obvious steps and within less than an hour was up and running.  The phone tech was worth the price of the product itself!
