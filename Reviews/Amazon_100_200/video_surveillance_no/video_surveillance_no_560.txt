Our Son was 18 Months old when we started using the Snap Video Baby Monitor. Prior to that, we were using an audio-only monitor. We use it mainly to keep tabs on him when he's napping or sleeping, since those are the only times that we're not there with him, and his crib is like a fortress, so we weren't afraid of him climbing out. As you can tell, our needs were fairly simple, and the Snap Video Baby Monitor met them quite nicely. The video quality is nothing to write home about...in fact, there were times when I couldn't distinguish between Mikey and a stuffed animal, so if this were a case where I had to keep a close eye on a baby, like to see if he was breathing or moving, I probably would go with a higher-resolution camera. The audio quality is good, and the night-vision never failed to make me think my Son was starring in a preschool version of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. Not a bad product, if your needs are fairly simple and straightforward. If not, I'd shop around for a higher quality monitor.
