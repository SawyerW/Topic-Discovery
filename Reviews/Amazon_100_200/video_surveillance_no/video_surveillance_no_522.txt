This monitor is the coolest thing ever.- Love the portability and being able to take the monitor all over the house with me. After having this I would think a "tv" style monitor would be utterly useless.- Love that it has a color display during the daytime- Love that we can add more cameras to it when we have more children- Love that we can talk to our child through itWe've been using it a couple of weeks now and it has good battery life - hasn't gone dead on us yet, even when we start monitoring our child around  7pm and don't put the monitor back on its base until after midnight.I guess my only complaints are that it's a little difficult to plug the receiver into its base to charge. It always takes me a couple of tries to line it up just right.Otherwise - great product and at a great price too!
