I started off with the 750i master system a year ago just to try it out.  Since then I have added two outdoor night vision cams.  This system really work great.  The pic quality is 5 stars.  Easy to install.  Ignore all the reviews about recorded file size on your cpu...it can be adjusted to suit your needs.  I love the iphone / android app and sharing the live feed w/family so everyone is always watching. The camera motion sensors are very sensitive so the alert function can sometimes be overwhelming.  Outdoor cams have performed excellent in sub freezing temps.  Enjoy.
