I actually really like the way this monitor works.  The cameras are very cool.  They are easy to travel with and hold a charge for a bit and the two way voice is sweet.  What I do not like is the darn hand held monitor is hard to use and the place where you plug in the charger keeps breaking.  Once it breaks you cannot charge the hand held unit and you are out a monitor!  This has happened to me twice.  Although it was covered under the 1 year warranty both times...I have had to pay to ship them back, pay to have replacement monitors while I wait for the new hand held set and the customer service folks are not nice at all!  Very short when I call...like I am bothering them.  When they replaced the second hand held the battery was already shot.  It won't work unless plugged in.  So now they are sending me my 3rd hand held unit.  You can purchase this monitor and you will like it, but be VERY gentle with how you plug it in and don't expect a cheery customer service rep!
