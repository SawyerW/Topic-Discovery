We've been using this product for a while now. My overall feeling is that it is "good" for the money, but a bit of a pain to get going.Setup out of the box was a bit tricky:1.) Camera's didn't want to update firmware.2.) Running wires wasn't a ton of fun.3.) Finding a plug near where you need the camera isn't always easy.4.) Requires you to be online during setup.Problems once setup:1.) You are now down one outlet.2.) Poor picture in low light.3.) Price to expand the system.The price overall is "ok", but you can get a fully wireless (thought maybe not color) system for the same price. Yes, the Logitech offers a lot of bells and whistles but I will definitely do some shopping around before expanding this system.
