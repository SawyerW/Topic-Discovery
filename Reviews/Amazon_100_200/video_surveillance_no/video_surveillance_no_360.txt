I had this camera up and running out in my dog kennel in a 1/2 hour wirelessly 175 feet from the router. This time frame included a call to Panasonic and a call to my ISP. The wireless efficiency runs between 7-17%(weak to good). If I were to move the camera any further away(I tried)it loses the signal. Low light picture quality is non-existant. Even with a night light in the 5'x6' kennel you cannot see anything at night. Pan and tilt work fine. The microphone works fine. The software is easy to install and understand. Panasonic support is very helpful and they speak English!!! I bought a refurbished model and the tech never reset the user account with Panasonic in Japan. I contacted tech support and they had to send an email to Japan to have the user id reset. I cannot rate the internet capability yet until I can register the camera with [...]. All in all I'm ok with the product so far, nothing to write home about though! For the money I expected far more from this camera and the tech who refurbished it.
