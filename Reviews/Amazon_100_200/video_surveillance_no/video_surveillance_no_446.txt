Previously considered purchase of a trail camera on several occasions but was concerned about reliability and picture quality. Read reviews here and on other websites and decided to try the Trail Cam 35. At this price, how can you go wrong? ;^)Received the camera about 4 pm and had it installed and operating by 5 pm. Drove by on my garden tractor just after 6 pm and the doggone thing took my picture! Then we got multiple pix that night of deer visiting our salt block and even a couple of racoons that I didn't know about.Looking forward to learning about other critters that frequent our back yard here in the hills of northeast Tennessee.
