Door alarm: There is no way to tell if the alarm is set or not. Everyone in the house needs to enter the passcode every time to see if its on or off by listening if it beeps once or twice. They need an led light to visually verify that its on. Its no fun when you open the door thinking its off and the alarm blares in your ear. Its also not good thinking its on and protecting you when in fact its actually not. The only way to tell is by entering your passcode and listening if it beeps once or twice.Window alarm: they work well but only alarm when the window is opened, meaning they turn off the moment you shut the window again or move the switch to off, unlike the door alarm which requires you to enter the code. They are also not as loud as the door alarm.
