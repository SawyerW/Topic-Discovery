* if you got a wirless network with repeaters it will NOT work.* Blackberry software is still not available (under development)I beleive they should mention that in their ad!!!Our house is a two floors 550 Square Meters, so I have 4 repeaters connected to the main router in order to cover up all the area,how ever, the cam could not be found unless I plug the cam network adapter to the main router and be within the range of the main router!!!However, if you have no repeters in ur netwrok then this will be working perfectly with you, however I wont recommend it as its very expensive compared by similar cams.
