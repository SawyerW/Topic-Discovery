I bought this alarm system until could afford to have a professional monitored alam put in. We protect our house with the second amendment so I wanted something that would be loud enough to wake me up so that I can get to what I need to get to if someone w to break in.The keypad alarm is very loud and would easily wake up and scare anyone that broke in or was sleeping. The smaller window alarms are not nearly as loud, would still wake you up but are not as ear hurting as the keypad alarm is. It's easy to install just some sticky tape on the back of them line up the magnets and you are set. The keypad alarm is the same and very easy to set your code as well. We set it mostly at night but the away function works great as well.
