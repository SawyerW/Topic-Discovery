Got it, tried it with my Canon HF S21 video camera.  Mainly purc to mount on windshield but can't really do that and have the camera right-side up.  Sure, like others have said, it will work fine on windshield with the camera upside-down and flip it over in editing software but thought that would be for really BIG video cameras, not the size mine is.  Don't want to have to do do flipping or look at the LCD screen upside down.  Contacted Panavise- you can buy the extension for something like $9.99 plus shipping so might be up to $40 total then.  The Delkin is just a few dollars more and comes with an extension.  RMAd the Panavise and ordered the Delkin.  Awaiting arrival.The Panavise is well constructed and an excellent price but you may, in some situations, have to use a camera upside-down.  Nothing bad to say about the product, just wish it came with the extension like the Delkin so you have it if you need it.
