Granted, this is our first game camera, but I can't see buying any other brand/model when this one works exactly as it says it does and the price is so right! We put an 8gb Sandisk HDSD card in, strapped it to a tree by our corn pile, and have gotten good-quality pictures of does, bucks, raccoons, ravens, and squirrels. The batteries were put in over two weeks ago and are around 50% capacity, so I'm happy I won't be spending too much on D cell batteries. Check around, like I did, and see what your options are at this price range, and then come back to the Primos Truth Cam 35 because it works great and costs less!
