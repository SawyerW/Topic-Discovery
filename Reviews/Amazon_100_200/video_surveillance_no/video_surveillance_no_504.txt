This is the third motion sensitive camera I have tried and it was really intuitive and easy to use! The first was a pain to set up and then I couldn't see the pictures using my Mac computer. The second was impossible to figure out, and again, the fact that I have a Mac as opposed to a PC didn't seem to help any. This one was really easy and intuitive, set up took a mere minute.  Even my 9 year-old son figured it out.To set up: Open easily with just a simple latch, insert 4 D batteries, if you want - set date and time (again, really easy on this one), set options that are clearly labeled on the switches and then you're done!I needed a camera to try to figure out which of my cats was remiss in litter box use (I know, eewww!! TMI!) and this one finally did the trick. By the way, I almost never bother to write reviews but this was such a pleasant surprise I just had to for this camera.
