Cable seems to work but the camera's IR lighting doesn't seem to go out very far from the camera. After reading through the Q-See website, I discovered that it's best for long runs like these to put the power supply at the camera end, rather than use the power portion of the cable to deliver power to the camera from the other end. This eliminates the voltage drop from the 100' run of the light gage power wire contained in this cable. This should be included as a note on the cable packaging for this length of cable. Otherwise, the package is a good value, since you get gender-changer adapters as well.
