When I first got this sensor it worked great. After about a month it would go off for no reason and miss a few cars coming and going on my driveway. Now it has started going off non stop and wont stop ringing...Had to turn it off...Thought it was the batteries but after fresh set, it still isnt working right. The receiver is only about 30' away so it cant be that. It was cheap, I didn't expect it to be all that great anyway. But it doesn't deserve a good rating unless it is a good product so I am giving it 1 star.
