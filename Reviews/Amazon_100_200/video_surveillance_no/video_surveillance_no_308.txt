I wanted to use this to alert my back office staff in the event someone came in our front entry and the receptionist was away from her desk. The back office is only 30 feet away with only one wall in between. The door sensor could not reach the chime. So, we had to move closer to the front which defeats the whole purpose of buying it. Also, even at the lowest volume setting, it's really loud, especially in our quiet office. We had to cover the speaker with tape so lower the sound. If you're going to use this in a noisy location like a retail store, it might be ok, so long as you keep the chime close to the door sensor and put no walls between the two.
