I love everything about this little cam.  If I could make it more "perfect" I'd give it a mechanical IR cutoff filter so that it could work it complete darkness using IR LEDs.  Outdoors, this can see in dim light until about an hour after sunset.  Even though the cam says it is for indoor use only, I've had it mounted under a sheltered roof eave working fine for the past 6 months.  Another one in the outdoor hallway at my brother's house is subject to -20C temps and still keeps going.  So it seems OK outdoors as long as it doesn't get wet.  You can download a very useful Windows Vista Sidebar gadget to display the live cam images on the Vista desktop.  Go to the Windows Live Gallery and search for Panasonic.  With this gadget I have a bird's eye peripheral view on the desktop.  It's great to bring the outside world inside.
