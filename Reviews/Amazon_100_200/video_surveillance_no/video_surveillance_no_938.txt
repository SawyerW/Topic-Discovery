I think this is a great value for the price. Only issues I had were due to my network setup and not the camera. And I ironed them out quickly. I used the POE option, so I can't say anything about how well the network through the electrical cord would work. In fact I got it totally for the POE option. That lets me put them in places were there aren't near by electrical outlets. The video quality is great. I've also the got the Android phone app running and it works well too. The recording works well and is easy to review on a computer. Recordings are all saved on an SD Card, so you don't have to have a computer constantly connected for recording. And the software is easy to install and use too. The video quality is excellent and the night vision is amazing.
