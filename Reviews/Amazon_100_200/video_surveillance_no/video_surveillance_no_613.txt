After relying on an angel care monitor to ease the worries of motherhood, I decided to keep the ease going with using a video monitor for my almost 2 year old. He will soon be transitioning out of the crib so I wanted to have a way to monitor him as we take on the new sleeping arrangement. I was intimidated by the cost of video monitors, and even less impressed at how many do not have the hand held and only offer the smaller TV size monitor. I came across this monitor and could not be happier with my purchase! I was skeptical with how any handheld screens would come across, but this one is so clear and I can see the kiddo great! The 2 way communication is a great feature that I expect to be extremely useful when taking on the new sleeping arrangements! It was VERY easy to set up, infact I did it without reading the instructions on the initial set up even. I am so glad that I didn't go the route of paying more thinking that there wasn't a great product for less. This monitor is a great investment!
