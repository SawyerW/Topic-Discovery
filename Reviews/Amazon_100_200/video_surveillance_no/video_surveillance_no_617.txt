I spent forever researching video monitors. I was disappointed when this one didn't work. I read all of the directions which said the camera should be linked to the monitor. Mine was not linked. When I tried to link them the monitor would say that the camera was not detected. The battery on the monitor never charged. The indicator light came out showing it was charging, but never did. After three attempts I gave up and sent it back. even if it had worked I also didn't like the docking station for the monitor. It had a USB sort of plug in system. The base was light and it was difficult trying to link the two up. If I had to remove it in the middle of the night there is no way I would have been able to put it back on the charging base without turning the light on. I guess one would have to just leave it on the charger and pick the whole thing up. I wish it had worked!
