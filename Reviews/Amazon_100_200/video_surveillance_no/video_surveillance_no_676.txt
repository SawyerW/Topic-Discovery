After a rash of burglaries in the neighborhood, I was nervous to leave for vacation.  I'd taken all the precautions to make my home less vulnerable, yet I still was uneasy about leaving.  I remembered seeing this product on TV, perhaps The Today Show, a while back.  I ordered it after reading reviews, and it arrived in just a few days.  I practiced with all the settings, and I liked it on a timer. I stood outside and it looked like someone was watching TV....and was a night owl....GREAT! The second one I bought is for my single friend for Christmas -- she has everything, but not this!
