This is our 4th video monitor and I purchased it because we have a second child and needed the expandability feature.  Honestly, I hate this monitor.  The screen is so bright that you can't really keep it on your nightstand without finding something unsightly to cover it with (I use a black sock... ugh).  It cannot stand on it's end so you can watch it unless it is docked.  If you take it downstairs and want to set it next to you on the couch, you are covering the speaker.  Or you can lay it face down and cover the screen...  No way to prop it up.  That is very frustrating.  The sound is just okay.  I have to keep it cranked to the highest level and still have to hold it to my ear to make out what my daughter is saying.  The lights on the camera are not too bright, which is good.  But I will be sending this back.  It is such a pain to use and trying to explain how to work it to my parents is no picnic either.  Keep looking!
