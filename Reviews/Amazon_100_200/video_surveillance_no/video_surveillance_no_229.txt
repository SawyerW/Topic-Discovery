I bought these for use while wedding coordinating. I had a pair of older model Motorola business radios that I had intended to use these with, but the prongs on the headset were too close for the jacks on the Motorola radio. I ended up buying a new pair of cheap Midland 2-ways and the prongs fit perfectly. Before purchasing, make sure that your radio can accept a double-prong headset.As far as operation goes, the audio was clear on both ends using the headsets and the fit of the earpiece was very comfortable. One thing to note is that the cable to the PTT button is not long enough to run down the length of your sleeve, so it does need to be clipped to somewhere on the torso. The wire to the radio is plenty long and the radio can comfortably be placed in your back pocket if you'd like.
