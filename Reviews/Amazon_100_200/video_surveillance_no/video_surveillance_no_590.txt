I loved this monitor. Then one day i went to charge it and the part that you connect the charger too and the innerds, if you will, were up inside the unit making it impossible to charge. So i returned it very easily thru amazon and i got a new one. I went to use that one and one of the cameras only did sound. So i again returned it and they were very nice and sent me yet another one. Then this third one has lasted for a few months however last night i went to charge it and the thing was up in it again so its now useless. I am getting really sick of having to return and wait for a new one and don't know if i want one if this is going to keep happening.Amazon ended up replacing this one yet again and then last night (after about a week of the hand held not really charging) my husband got it off of the charging cradle and the connector was up in it AGAIN. So amazon is returning it and I'm going with a different brand for sure.
