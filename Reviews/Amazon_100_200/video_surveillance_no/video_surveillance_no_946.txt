Got this for my folks late Jan so for a few weeks now.They never had one before. Was surprising easy to set up and the program is great. It gives that peace of mind when I'm at work because the software gives you an online account where you can watch live stream from anywhere. I have my dining room basically on watch at work in a tab.Quality is 8.9 out of 10 and when you turn the lights out in the room it'll have the night vision automatically.Our house was burglarized a month in a half prior and so this was an great beginners step for my parents (always hesitant/passive) to get started on.Installing it was easy. We just found a place in the dining and hid in behind the curtain.Highly recommend for beginners and people wanting easy set up. Our street has been hit 3 more times since and we are planning on getting the outdoor one.
