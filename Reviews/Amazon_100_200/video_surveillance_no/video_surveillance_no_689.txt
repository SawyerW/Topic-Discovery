We purchased a single Fake TV for our home and found it to be so realistic that we bought a 2nd one for our upstairs window and set the timer to stay on for a longer period of time- it looks like someone is restless downstairs and then goes upstairs to watch more TV.We then bought another one to place at a family member's house that's become vacant and it is very realistic, definitely gives the impression that someone is living in the home.I just purchased a 4th one for a rental house we are renovating to give it the same appearance of being occupied until we have a tenant in there. Overall, if you have drapes covering your windows, a timer on a few lights and one of these Fake TV's you can feel pretty confident that your average smash and run burglar will go elsewhere. Highly recommend!
