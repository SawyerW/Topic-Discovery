Hard to believe it would even work for this price but it does.  Picture quality is OK on a 4-inch monitor.  The IR LEDs are pointless.  Would only work to maybe 3 feet if you intend to use it in the dark and it wouldn't be in color.  The mounting bracket is pretty thin.  The case is solid metal.  The lens is a standard 12mmx0.5mm thread.  It will focus down to an inch or less.  No adjustments other than focus.  The AC adapter included is 8 Volts, not 12.  If you use it in a system, I don't know if it will work on 12 Volts.  It's pretty hard to beat for the price.
