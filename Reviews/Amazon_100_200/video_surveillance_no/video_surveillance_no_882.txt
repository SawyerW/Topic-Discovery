It's been about five months since I purchased the system.  I started with one camera (the master system) and am currently up to three.  The first four months with this system were absolutely horrid!  I owned the wilife system and, while video quality was superb to the Wilife, the cameras would flake out constantly, requiring a reset.  I found another piece of software and was able to prove the problem was the Logitech software, not the cameras.  Finally, two weeks ago, Logitech put out a massive update to the software and camera firmware.  The cameras are 100% stable!  What an improvement!!!!  Since the update, I've had no issues with disconnects and the motion sensativity problems have been fixed.I must say, I was po'd with Logitech about this system.  No longer!  I'm about ready to order my fourth and fifth cameras!  If you're looking for a HD quality surveillance system, this is the one I'd recommmend.
