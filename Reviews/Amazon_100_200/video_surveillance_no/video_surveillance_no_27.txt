I originally bought the driveway patrol about a year ago and it worked great for about 6 months. Then after it rained several times it stopped working. It was not in a very sheltered location so I decided to buy another one and make sure it was covered. That unit only worked sporadically - the sensor LED would go off but the alarm did not always sound. I had waited too long to return it, so eventually I bought a third unit and that one had the same problem. After reading the return policy I would have to pay the return shipping and they will only repair/replace it and at this point I don't want to keep throwing money at this product since it seems the build quality is extremely poor.
