The customer service for Lorex is absolutely horrible.  This monitor broke after 6 months, so I called and spoke to customer service who said to mail it back, which I did.  It's been 3 months now of fighting with them and I still can't get them to send me a replacement monitor.  We have therefore been operating without a baby monitor for months now, trying to get either our money back or a new monitor, to no avail.  I have proof that they received the original package, but they refuse to replace the product after promising to do so.  HORRIBLE, SHAMEFUL company.  Spend your money elsewhere.
