I had purchased this door monitor because my youngest son kept getting up at night and had the run of the house all night long.  Since we have gotten the monitor, he has never come out of his bedroom at night, even to go to the bathroom.  So it is definitely working as a deterant.  Installing the equipment was easy.  The only issue I have is that there is a 2-3 second delay between the time that the door is open and the time that the chime sounds.  Since the speaker and the door are only about 20 feet apart, I am not sure why this is.  Anyway, my son is finally getting the rest he needs for school and I am not worrying about the house burning down every night.  Much better!
