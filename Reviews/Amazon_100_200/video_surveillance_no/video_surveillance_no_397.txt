I've used the Primos Truth Cam 35 for about 6 months now.  It does everything it's supposed to.  Although I have had to re-format my SD card a couple of times.  I assume it's because I shut off the camera prior to allowing it to save the images that were triggered as I opened the unit.  Since I have started to allow about 30 seconds after opening the cover before shutting off the camera I have had no troubles.  It takes usable photos at night that I can use to identify the creatures passing through my yard within range to trigger the camera. The day light photos are very good. The batteries last a good time if you only use the 3 shot setting but it's remarkable how fast the batteries go when used with the video setting.  Depending on the activity of course.  I am happy with the results and that I purchased this camera.  I recommend this camera for personal use.
