I installed this product a couple of days ago and I am thrilled with it.  I am using it at my vacation home in Tahoe to check the weather remotely, so that I can monitor my driveway / deck melt systems during snow storms.  What's good about this camera is that it can be totally controlled remotely through Panasonics hosted free web site.  You can view, pan, set pre-sets, and make many adjustments remotely.  A great feature is the ability to set up a trigger event, using its built in motion sensor, so that it sends me an email -- including multiple pictures when triggered.  That's really good for security purposes.It does take some time to get this unit to communicate properly through your router, but with some patience, the effort is worth it.  If you have a secured network, you need to put its two MAC addresses in your router -- there is one for the camera and one for the wireless module.  I cut and pasted them to the router MAC list.There is so much that you can do with this camera, and the Manual on the CD is very helpful in this respect.
