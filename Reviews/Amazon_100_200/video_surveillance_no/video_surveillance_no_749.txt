Do not buy this product.I purchased this system 18 months ago.  Here are my takeaways:1. The camera does not communicate with the network 95% of the time.  Even though it may record to its internal SD card, it does not send video feed to the computer.  I hoped that one of the MANY Logitech updates would fix this.  Yeah, no.2. There isn't an "always on" feature.  In other words, you are hostage to the motion sensing capability of the camera.  And, to speak frankly, the motion sensing function isn't capable at all. More on this in point 3.3. Motion sensing:  I tested the camera by walking in its view and even walking right up to it.  What I found was terribly disappointing.  It took a long while for the camera to sense motion in the first place.  When it did finally detect motion, it cuts off prematurely. So if there was an individual was moving in front of the camera, it would cut the video off amid motion.  Completely unreliable.4. I have not "seen" the camera feed on my pc in over a month.ProsWhen it works, the video looks great.
