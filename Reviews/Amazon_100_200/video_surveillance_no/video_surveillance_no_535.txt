I love these monitors it's my first time using this brand. I had Summer Day&Night; baby video monitor with my first 2 children and loved them, had no complaints.but now that I have 3 under the age of 5 I didn't want 3 different monitors in my bedroom so after searching and reading all kinds of review on different brands we dicided to try Lorex,now it's been about 4months since we bought them and we love them the fact that I can carry it it anywhere in the house,take it outside cause it's wireless.the only one thing I don't like is the 8second delay but it's ok now I'm used to it.I love the fact that I can talk to my kids thru the monitor.yes I would recomend this product.
