The first camera I ordered arrived DOA. Primos customer service said it would be quicker to send back to Amazon (it would take them 3-6 weeks to resolve the problem.). Amazon graciously replace it with a new camera. The new camera however failed after one use. Primos customer service again was no help. The second camera is on its way back to Amazon for a refund and I will order a different brand the next time. Praise to Amazon for their quick and easy return policy. Shame on Primos' quality control and poor customer service. I will not recommend or buy another product from Primos.
