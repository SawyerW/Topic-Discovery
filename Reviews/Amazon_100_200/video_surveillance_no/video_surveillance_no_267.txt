Arrived quick and in good shape.  Had to get on a ladder to get to garage door motor. Instuctions for me were this: Press and hold the button for remote then press and hold the learn button on the motor.  I did not have to take off the cover of my motor as it was clearly labled on the motor box.  Release the learn button for the motor but continue to hold button for the remote for about 30 sec. it should learn the code. I held the remote right up to the learn button just in case it needed really close proximity.  Hope this helps.
