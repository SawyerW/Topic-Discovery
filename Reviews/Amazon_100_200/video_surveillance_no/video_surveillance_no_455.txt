I have 2 Truth Cam 35's.  Very easy set up out of the box.  Initially worked great for about 4 months.  Batteries last several 1000 pics.4 months later, 1 camera couldn't get it together after replacing batteries.  Eventually, after burning through 2 sets of new batteries in a couple of days it somehow has "reset" itself? and is working again.2nd camera, after 3 sets of batteries in 5 months is now blinking 0000 with the last new set of batteries installed, which is a signal it is setting up, non stop.  Can't get it to get started again.I've sent an email to Primos hopefully will hear something soon.UPDATEPrimos repaired camera at no cost.  It has been working fine ever since.
