Whoever posted the customer photographs is a moron. They are lies. This mount does not have the extension arm on it and therefor can't handle even the smallest camcorder pointed straight ahead or straight behind. Unfortunately they don't seem to sell the extension arm by itself, and there for if you want this mount for a camcorder, buy the Delkin one that's identical except that one comes with the arm!Don't get me wrong; this mount is freaken solid! Its a fantastic product and would serve its owner well as long as they don't expect it to hold anything larger than a standard still shot digital camera. The suction cup is my favorite part of this thing. its a fantastically built item, just wish the ad wasn't so misleading.
