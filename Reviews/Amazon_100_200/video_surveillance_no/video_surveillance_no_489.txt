This camera takes decent pictures. I have yet to play with the video recording option. As stated in a few reviews allready, there are issues with pcitures taken right at dawn/dusk (it didnt matter if it was pointed north, south, east, or west) pictures are either very dark, or "whiteout" pictures happen. I own two of these, and two Stealth Cam 8MP cameras, and would say that they are about equal in quality pictures. I would recommend this camera to hunters that are just starting out to use cams (me). More experianced hunters that have used cams in the past and want a better quality picture may want to look elsewhere. Overall it is a good camera for the cost.
