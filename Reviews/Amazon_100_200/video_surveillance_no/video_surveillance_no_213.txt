Installed on a Viper 3002  on a 81 Jeep CJ7.  I also added a second Stinger Shock Sensor.  You have to play around with the positioning of this item but it does a great job  though 1" of wood, through seats and other solid materials. It's a must have item. I have set where a person can only get 3 inches from my vehilce (this is with a Noah Car Cover on) and it'll cherp.  Then if someone sticks thir hand through the window, it'll make the siren go off. This will make me sleep better tonight.  I'll update if there's a problem with it.
