EDIT: SEE updated review below!These cables work well, however are not shielded and are subject to interference.  I am a ham radio guy and my 40w VHF transmitter causes interference on this cable.  I believe it's due to it not being shielded very well, if at all.  I have another CCTV camera that is not affected however has a much thicker shielded cable jacket.  The cable does work for what it is intended, however beware of interference.  The only time however is at night time when the IR is active. I get some lines of red/blue when the transmitter is active.  Otherwise the cable is good.
