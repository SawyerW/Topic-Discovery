I bought this camera 5 months ago.  Setup was a snap and at first it worked really well.  Before long the camera seemed to lose sensitivity, so to counter that I turned the detection sensitivity to high, which seemed to work at first but as time went on it captured fewer and fewer events.  After a while it would miss me walking through the backyard, and event that always triggered a picture when it was new.  Next I noticed the night pictures were not lit (by the infrared LED's) very well.  I changed the batteries, but the problems remained. About 2 weeks ago it simply stopped working.We live in the Seattle area and I wonder if it was just too wet for the camera.  I noticed condensation on the infrared LED window after the first couple of months.The idea behind this product is great and it was fun watching all the animals walk through our backyard.  I will definitely buy another game camera, but I will try another brand.
