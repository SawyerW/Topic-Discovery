Had this baby monitor not been advertised to take crisp photos of your baby, I would have given it 5 stars.  However, since still photos are taken at .3 megapixels (my daughter's play camera is 3.0 megapixels!!!), the photo quality is horrible.On the plus side:I live in a large house, with just under 2000 square feet.  This baby monitor has GREAT range!  It worked from all rooms/corners of my house!  FINALLY, a baby monitor with good range!No interference from other devices.  This has been an issue in the past, with other baby monitors.Video quality is better than most monitors.  I love to use this outside while my daughter is playing.  My yard is fenced in, I stay in the kitchen, and my parents live next door, but I want to be extra cautious and be able to see her myself.  I can point this at the gate and know if anyone were to try and enter the yard.The down sides:If you need to call their customer service number, you''ll be disappointed.  I was told I'd receive a return call, but it never happened.  Luckily, I was able to search the internet and figure things out on my own.
