Unless you drive a 1980s vehicle that has a windshield that is almost vertical this device will probably not work for you with a modern car with a slanted front windshield  and you'll have to mount the camera upside down. I managed to mount the camera at 90% and was able to rotate the lens (Contour HD) but I'm sure most people will not be able to mount a camera on a modern car's windshield without having problems.Pity cos the item appears to be well made and quite nice for the price but as someone pointed out, all the photos have the camera with an extension arm. Odd. Will probably send it back.WHERE IS THE EXTENSION ARM PANAVISE ???!!!! Sure it's only a couple more cents to make the plastic arm longer but this is a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW SO BE ADVISED!!
