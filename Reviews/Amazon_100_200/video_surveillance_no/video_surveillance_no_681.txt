Purchased this Fake TV based on an email I received about things burglers look for when deciding what houses to consider for breakins.  Was headed for a vacation in Cancun MX so decided... what the heck, can't hurt.  Plugged it in, went outside and ... looked like there was a tv on in that room.Caution should be given to placement, so it can't be seen from outside (noted in instruction) and could be a little brighter.  Good news is it is not on a timer, so if you have a power outage it will NOT be affected... workes on dusk to dawn type timer...Would recommend this as an ADDITIONAL thing to use when away... d
