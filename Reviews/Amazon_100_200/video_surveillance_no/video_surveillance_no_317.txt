This unit works well once you change the frequency from that which comes factory set. If you leave it like the factory sets it you get quite a few false rings possibly from aberrant signals in the area.  Also, the battery in the remote unit does not insert solidly so you have to be really quick to get the door back on it.  Finally, I don't believe you can set it so that it only has one chime for the entry.  Your choices are either Westminster or ding-dong.  I'd prefer a single ding (or dong).  Otherwise, it is a very nice unit.  I'd recommend it.  Amazon's return is also very hassle-free as I had to replace the first unit I received.  They sent out a return label and a new unit.  Very efficient.
