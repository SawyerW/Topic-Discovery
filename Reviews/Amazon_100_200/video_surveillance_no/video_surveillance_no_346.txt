I have two of these cameras on my Mercedes Sprinter which has no windows. One is rear view, one is right side view. I love these cameras. They are wide angle without distorting more than your passenger side mirror---objects may be closer than they appear. BUT NO WAY ARE THEY WATERPROOF. The glass on the front of the camera is not sealed in any way and they take on moisture, malfunction till they dry out and after a while, they fail completely. I return them for exchange, but because I like them so much, I am remounting them behind a protective window.
