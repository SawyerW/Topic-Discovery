The camera lasted for about (8) months until it stopped working. Standard use hanging on a few different trees doing what trail cams are supposed to do. Took great pictures and my son and I were very happy with it.So, as I had mentioned, the camera stopped working about (2) weeks ago and I wen through the process of changing out batteries, buying a new memory card, making sure things were formatted the way that Primo's says on their website. Still a no-go.I emailed Primo's support via email on Sept 8th and have yet to receive a reply back from these people.After doing more research on this product as well as Primo's support, I have found that [a] not too many people are happy with the product, and [b] their support staff is much less than "primo".Should they happen to address my issues with this camera and help my 10-year old son and I out, I may revise this review. However, until that happens, 1-star it is. Spend a few more dollars with a different company.
