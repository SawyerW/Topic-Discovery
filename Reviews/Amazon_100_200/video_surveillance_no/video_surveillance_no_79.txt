I bought this for my mom since we've been having lots of thefts around town this summer, but as another reviewer noted, this may not fit under your patio door.  It didn't fit under hers, which is the kind that swings inward (doesn't slide).  Noise is quite piercing, and I'm glad it has an on-off switch.  The one thing I don't care for is the tiny screw that you have to unscrew to insert the battery.  When did this become the trend in electronics, having to find the right screwdriver just to insert a battery?  It's a pain.  I'm keeping it and will probably find a use for it at some point.  I'm not worried about thefts because I have 3 dogs, who also make noise that's quite piercing.
