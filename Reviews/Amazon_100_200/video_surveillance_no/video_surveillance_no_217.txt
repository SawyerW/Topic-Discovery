I ordered this for my Viper 5904v alarm/remote start system and it connects to one of the additional sensor ports with no problem. I read the installation manual for my alarm system and it states that you cannot connect this directly to the port because the port provides constant power and it must be hard wired. FALSE!!! I have done it for anyone who has been wondering. The only thing I noticed is that since the sensor ports are constant, it will cause this sensor to remain on constantly without turning off; it doesn't hurt it at all nor does it cause a power drain. You can, however, cut the ground wire on the connector pin coming from the unit that plugs into the main alarm module and tap it into the GWA wire (normally the Orange wire) on your system which will cause it to only arm when the alarm sets itself. Great product and I will order another for my other vehicle.
