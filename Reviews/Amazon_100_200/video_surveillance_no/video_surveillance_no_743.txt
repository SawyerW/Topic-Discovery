Easy to set-up, easy to install except for the bracket to the camera, it's useless. Thank goodness I had another bracket from an old camera to modify to fit because the one they send with this unit doesn't work. The camera did sync with the base unit right away. The unit has a good picture in day or night. The range for the movement sensor is limited to the 40 feet so if you want to detect movement from long range this unit won't work for that. Basically it's ok for the price other than the camera mounting bracket which is useless. The picture is in color and the movement audio sensor does work.
