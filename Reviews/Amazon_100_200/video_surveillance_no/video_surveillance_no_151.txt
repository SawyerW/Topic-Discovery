Nice product. Alarm is pretty loud for a 2-bedroom apartment. Not sure if the smaller window alarms would be heard in bigger houses. One thing that took me sometime to figure out was - for the bigger unit, you would have to activate the alarm every time it is moved from Chime to Alarm mode. We use the chime mode during the day and the alarm mode during the night and it took me a while to figure out that the alarm had to be activated every night and de-activated every morning. This would help if that wasnt obvious to you.
