Ordered the Panavise 809 window suction cup mount, and it came to me from VanGoddy ... I didn't get the extension arm with it, so I called Panavise and they advised me to check it for a patent number, which would be on the lip near the suction cup.  I checked mine, and there was no patent number.. which indicates that it's a counterfeit product.  Which was sold to me as a Panavise product.  Now, I've got a product that is not supported by the company who it was supposed to have been made by, and nobody is answering the phone at VanGoddy.  My reason for calling Panavise in the first place was to try to get the extension arm for the 809.. then when we determined that I had a counterfeit product, they told me that even if I bought an arm, it wouldn't work on the counterfeit product.  STAY AWAY FROM VAN GODDY!!!!!
