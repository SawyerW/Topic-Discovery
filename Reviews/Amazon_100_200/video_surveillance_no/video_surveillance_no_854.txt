Easy to set up.  Decent video quality.  Picks up and records motion in user defined zone. If you need detail such as vehicle license plate numbers this won't do it.  Mine is viewing a parking lot from about 50 feet away.  I can see the color and make of the cars and people walking around in the zone but the license plate numbers and not readable.  Decent night time viewing and recording in a lighted parking lot.  Reviewing of recorded events is easy.  SD card will store many days (depends on activity level in zone) and delete old files as new ones are recorded.  If an archive is needed a larger SD card will need to be purchased.  Adding extra cameras later looks to be rather expensive.  $200+ for a camera.  If it functions for many years then ok.  I have read some user complaints about early failure so here is hoping.
