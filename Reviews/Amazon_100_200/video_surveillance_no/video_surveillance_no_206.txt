I purchased the 473t for a remote start system in my wife's 2001 Honda Accord that was an add-on. We loved the system and when the old remote just puttered out I went looking for a replacement. Found 473t part number on old remote and ordered. Item arrived. After reading programming instructions realized I had to activate a "valet switch". Couldn't find it; went to Best Buy in Watertown, MA. For $20.00 system was programmed and I was out of there in less than 20 minutes. Learned that aftermarket installer never installed valet switch. Even if you don't have the switch, the whole deal was less than fifty bucks, a lot less than a new system. Note:  Your vehicle may have the valet switch installed and then programming is a zip. Check under dash near steering wheel area. Good luck !!
