Sadly I have to report that there are some issues with this camera and this is based upon my extensive use of small cctv camerasThe first to be aware of is the operating voltage, they will NOT work on 12v you have to use the supplied power supply which is approx 8v which is not good when incorporating into an existing system - mine being 12v!The second is that the infrared leds don't seem to work, I hold a known infrared light in front and I can see it, I illuminate my subject at night with the same source and it is visible, I hold a mirror or white paper in front of any of the cameras, I bought 3 and NOTHING, no infrared light!
