I got 2 of these cameras to figure out what was eating my garden.  They took really nice pictures in both day and nighttime conditions.  After a month, the original batteries are still going strong at 85% charge.  I do wish the video capture had more timing options, and sound would be nice, but the price for cameras that do those is quite a bit higher than the Truth Cam 35, so I can't really complain.One thing to note: the infrared LEDs for nighttime illumination glow a visible red, so the cameras may attract attention at dusk or during the night.  I got a few up-close pictures of  a deer staring at the LEDs from just a couple feet away.
