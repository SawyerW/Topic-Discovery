If I can give a 0 I would just because the customer service for GE sucks... I received my package on time. As am trying to put everything together, I notice that the main alarm with the key pad require a small screwdriver. I had the right size but I've tried for 20 minutes trying to open the battery compartment which was impossible. What happen then cause the screws to strip but still couldn't get in.I called the manufacturer, I get this very rude & tired woman on the phone. I explain the situation to her, she first was telling me something that has nothing to do with what I ask. Then I repeated myself & her suggestion was " I can break it to get it open" wtf !!!! I paid $$ for that. She then said there aren't responsible for that.I just decided to return the product & got my money back. She was no help & reflect bad on GE because they couldn't come up with a better solution ...Do not waste your money ...
