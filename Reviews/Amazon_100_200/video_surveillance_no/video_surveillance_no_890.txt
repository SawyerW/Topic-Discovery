Bought this system directly from the Logitech web site.Two outdoor cameras have been up for 3 years now and working fine.Just wanted to pass on the reminder that you should plug the network adapter directly into the wall socket and not a power strip or surge protector that somehow reduces the signal such that the cameras won't be detected.I had reorganized my office recently and plugged the adapter into a surge protector strip, then spent a couple hours trying to figure out why the cameras suddenly weren't being detected.  Plugged the network adapter back into the wall socket and the cameras went back online.
