I had been running the previous maximum of 6 cameras since January 2011 while waiting for a promised upgrade that one of the tech support folks told me about. They have now upgraded the software (Nov 2013) to support a total of 16 cameras. I tried it by adding one that I already had and the installation was flawless. I have now ordered 3 more with night vision (2 external and 1 internal) and have plans for more. I also like that they now have internal cameras which are slightly less expensive than the external ones that now have night vision. When I started, night vision was not available on the internal cameras so I installed 2 outdoors and 4 indoors using all "external" camera models.This review does not show this as an Amazon Verified Purchase because I started out with an Internal Master System.  You can see my identical review posted there.
