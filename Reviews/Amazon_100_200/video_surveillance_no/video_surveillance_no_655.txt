I borrowed one of these from my neighbors when I was gone for a couple of weeks.After night fell I turned it on then went outside. I couldn't tell it was on. I went inside and turned it so it faced the window. Then I could tell it was on, but could also see its lights through the drapes which would have given it away.I solved the problem by facing it away from the window then pointing it at a movie screen I had. Then when I went outside and checked, it appeared a TV was on. You could probably get the same results by pointing it at a large sheet of very white cardboard.Also the model they had was on all the time so I plugged it into a timer.If they'd put in brighter LEDs and a timer I'd give this five stars.
