I ordered it because I went on a family vacation where no one would be home.  I had tested before leaving; I had put the door stop alarm a few inches away from the door, as I open the door to see if the door stop would actually stop the door from opening too wide and see if the alarm would work, nothing worked.  Nothing worked because when I opened the door, the door stop alarm skid across the floor and wouldn't even stop the door from opening.  My floor is very well polish and too clean for it to handle the job.  I'm very disappointed that I wasted my time and money investing this useless defenseless item.
