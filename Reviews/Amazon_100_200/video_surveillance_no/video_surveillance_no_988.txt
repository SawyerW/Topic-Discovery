This leak alarm is just what I was looking for.  Wanting to check it out, I touched the leads to a puddle on the floor.  The alarm instantly went off, it was very loud.  I removed the sensor and reset the alarm.  I'm confident in the alarms ability to notify us in the event of a leak.  As far as the person who had difficulty with it mounted by their sump pit and rated it low - the sensor detects conductivity between the two probes, such as the conductivity of water.  The moisture generated at the sump pit was enough to trigger the alarm; they would be well suited to choose a different mounting location.
