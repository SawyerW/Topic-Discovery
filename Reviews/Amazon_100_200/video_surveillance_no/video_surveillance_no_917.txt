I have been the best customer that Logitech could have.  I purchased 6 WiLife cameras and when the Alert cameras were released, I purchased 6 of them.  At this moment, 1 of the original WiLife cameras is working.  Four (1 interior and 3 exterior) of the Alert cameras are still functional.  This represents a lot of money and more frustration.  I like the Logitech interface and IPhone app, but there is no excuse for this many cameras to croak.For what it is worth, I am now trying the Foscam F19821W cameras.  So far the 3 that I have purchased work well, but I have only 6 mos of operating experience.  I now use Blue Iris for all cameras.  It is not the slick interface of the Alert Commander, but it handles the full menagerie of cameras that I am left with.BUT SEE, follow up comment below.
