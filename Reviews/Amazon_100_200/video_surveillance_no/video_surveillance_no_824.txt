This is my second Logitech camera.  It took 10 minutes to plug in and add the camera to the command software.  It has a great picture.  We have security cameras at work that cost the company $600+ and my Logitech cameras are equal in picture. The night vision could be better.  You will see whatever the camera picks up however, I don't think I would ever be able to make out a license plate since lighting is very limited.  In addition, I don't think you could be certain of the make of the car.  All in all for the price, easy plug in installation and internet viewing from home or remote this system has filled my needs. I would recommend this camera.
