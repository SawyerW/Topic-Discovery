This was an easy set up and that ease of setup was a PRIME concern... and I don't see how it can be any easier than this system - install the Commander software, plug the network adapter into the router and electrical outet, plug the camera into an electrical outlet and you're done. Video quality is excellent for these types of network cameras - but don't expect HD quality like what you see on your TV. I also wanted a system where a PC doesn't have to be on all the time and this fits the bill as well.Happy and feeling safer.. Thanks for a good product.
