I purchased two of these units through one of Amazon's online vendors known as AsSeenOnTvGuys. This company has a bad reputation online for leaving customers nasty email messages with a lot of profanity, and by not honoring their products. These guys also advertise on eBay a lot, and they make up their prices by charging outrageous shipping costs. When you purchase from them, you think that you are getting a good deal due to the cost. But when you see your shipping charges, most of the time it is double if not tripled the cost of the product. The Driveway Patrol unit itself is ok if it stays in dry environment. I just had one of my two go out by sounding off constantly, and I have only had it about 5 months now.
