We purchased this unit as we have a 1 year old and another baby due and we needed to ensure that we could watch both rooms when the time comes.  Well 3 weeks after the first one crapped out on us (handheld was just a black screen) we sent back and got a replacement.  that unit lasted 3 days before it would no longer sync with the camera in the room.  After Amazon sent us a 3rd one that lasted less then a week while it would not work at all we gave up and demanded our money back..  This is a major disappointment as we still are stuck with out an option for our babies...
