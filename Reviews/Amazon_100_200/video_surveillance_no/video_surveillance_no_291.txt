I'm not the handy type, but I was appalled at how much I was quoted to replace the dying keypad I'd had for ten years, so I decided to buy this unit and do the replacement myself.What a pleasant surprise to find I could remove the old Honeywell unit from the wall, connect the same wires to this unit with simple instructions, and screw it in simply and quickly.  I didn't have to program anything (it remembered the entry code, which is in the alarm box in the closet) and I got a new keypad that will hopefully last another ten years.  I saved $100-200 in labor costs.
