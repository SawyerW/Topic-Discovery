We went through 2 of these, each lasting 3-4 weeks.  The first time the "female" hookup for the charger/base broke off in the receiver and headed to the interior of the unit and rattled around in there. Unable to charge it any longer, there was nothing to do but return it.  Our prompt replacement by Amazon made it no better than 4 weeks.  The receiver, sitting on the kitchen counter, began beeping and saying that the video could not be detected.  Then the rattling again.We've found the camera quite useful (we only use audio on occasion, as we can hear our son pretty clearly anywhere in our small house); the picture is more than adequate, reception good, etc. Battery life is less than impressive, but not a big deal.But our latest South Asian customer service representative says that the receiver is likely to fail again (and the reason we found such a good deal on it??) and wants to refund rather than replace. We're going to acquiesce.Caveat emptor.
