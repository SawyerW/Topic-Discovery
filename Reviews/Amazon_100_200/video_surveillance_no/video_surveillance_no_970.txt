Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security System with Night VisionThe camera and network adapter are solid and well built. Installation is easy and straight forward. Logitech states there are built-in surge protection in the camera power and network adapter, so I just plugged them into the electrical outlet directly. Overall picture quality is good especially during daylight time. Night version works, but not as advertised crystal clear. I used a motion detected night light with the camera to make the nighttime picture a little better. I can watch the live picture via a computer or a smartphone easily. Alerts can be only sent to your registration email. It can't be sent as text message as advertised. I guess it only works if I buy Logitech's rip off extra software. Now, I have to bash the awful software comes with the camera. There is no time control, no angle adjustment nothing else except a simple connecting tool. Logitech should come out with a better written running software for the 750e because I believe most of us don't want to paid the rip off $60 for a software supposedly free.
