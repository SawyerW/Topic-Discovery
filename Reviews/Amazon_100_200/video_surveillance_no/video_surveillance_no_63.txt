I love this alarm!  I bought two, one for each door, and I've tried to open my door with the door stop alarm placed in front of my door.  Of course when I tried to open the door, I did not have the switch turned on, so didn't set off the alarm.  I seriously could not open my door with this in place.  The rubberized bottom of the door stop grips the floor, and there is no way to open the door past the alarm.  The alarm itself is loud, and I've actually scared myself a few times by forgetting that I had the alarm in place and opening the door!  This was a great purchase!
