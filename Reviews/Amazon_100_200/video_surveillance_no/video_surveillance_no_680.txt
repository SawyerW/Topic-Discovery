I know it's crazy to say I love this little box with flashing lights, but it's true.  I leave it set up for dusk +7 hours in an upstairs extra bedroom where it won't bother anyone at home at night, and I don't have to remember to set it up when we go away.  It's so realistic I just have to chuckle when I see that TV-glare going from outside at night.I'm tempted to take a star away because I can't convince myself that there's anything close to $35 worth of plastic, LED lights, and timing circuitry in the thing.  On the other hand, it is a pretty reasonable one-time investment in an unmistakable message that says "if you're a burglar, there's someone at home, so move along, please."
