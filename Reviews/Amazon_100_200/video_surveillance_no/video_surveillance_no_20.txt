I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this driveway patrol sensor and receiver kit!  It was shipped promptly and arrived in the time that was estimated.  I put fresh batteries in both units and the sensor and receiver worked fine.  I checked them again after 30 minutes.  The red light on the sensor flashed when I walked in front of it, but there was no alarm.  If I actually rubbed my hand across the sensor, the alarm would go off.  I replaced the batteries in both units with more fresh batteries.  Still, the alarm went off only when I physically touched/rubbed the sensor.
