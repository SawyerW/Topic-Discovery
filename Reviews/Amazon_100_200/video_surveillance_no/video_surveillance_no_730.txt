I got a set of these a few months ago and they are great.  I came back to order more but they have changed the design!  The older ones were actual casings from real cameras.  This new design looks incredibly fake and too "plasticky".  Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light?  Almost none.  If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras.  Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find.
