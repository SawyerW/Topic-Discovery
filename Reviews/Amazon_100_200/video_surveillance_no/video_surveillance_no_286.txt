I think that every single vehicle should have an item like this installed in it. In Queens, New York, the thieves love to slightly jack up the front end of your car in the middle of the night and steal both of your front rims. A typical car alarm isn't going to go off if the vehicle is jacked up in this manner. But with this tilt sensor, you can be sure your alarm will be blaring.I checked all over the internet and could not find this product cheaper than I did on Amazon. You really can't beat the price for what this item is intended for. I cannot fathom my Mustang not having a tilt sensor. I would certainly recommend this product to everyone out there with a nice car with expensive rims and tires.
