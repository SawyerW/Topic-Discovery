The instructions were easy to follow and everything worked right away.  I plugged it into a outdoor plug and so far there have been no problems.  Rain doesn't seem to cause a problem.  I will see what happens when we get a big snowfall but the plugs and instruments seem well-insulated.  It worked well enough that I bought 3 other cameras to cover the outside around our house.  Occasionally one or more cameras will stop sending images. Usually it recovers spontaneously in several minutes to an hour.  Logitech has a good community discussion group and have pros that answer questions-I think the stopping of images has to do with powerline problems.  It would probably be better to transmit over ethernet cables but that would take a lot of work in a house and the power line works well at least 90% of the time.  It is also nice to be able to see the images on my Iphone or any computer when I am away from home.
