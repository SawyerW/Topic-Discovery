This is a wonderful alarm, and exactly what I needed.  VERY loud, no problems hearing it, and I have a three level home.  Unfortunately my exterior doors open outward so I wasn't able to get it for them, but I do have a door from the basement to the main level and I've placed it there in case I didn't hear someone break into the basement during the middle of the night.  I didn't buy this to deter a thief, I bought it to give me the chance to wake up, get the 45 on the nightstand and dial 911.  As loud as it is, it will 'definitely' do the job.
