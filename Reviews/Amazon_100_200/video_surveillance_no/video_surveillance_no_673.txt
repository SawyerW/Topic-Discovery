I was somewhat skeptical about how well this item would work after seeing it.  It is so tiny and totally unimpressive looking.  When you plug it in though, you will become a believer.  It truly does mimic a TV.  The only problem I had was hiding it as there are several windows in rooms adjoining the room where I wanted to place the FakeTV.  I decided to put my FakeTV on an independent timer so that I could more reliably control the time that it would run.  Just a footnote....during the installation process, I inadvertently dropped the FakeTV from about 6 feet up onto a hard floor.  Surprise....it kept right on working.  I think it's a great idea and well worth the purchase price.  Delivery was much quicker than I'd expected as well.  Overall, I'm completely delighted with my purchase.
