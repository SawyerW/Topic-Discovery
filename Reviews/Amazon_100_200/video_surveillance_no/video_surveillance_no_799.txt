A neighbor of mine had asked me to help her set up this home security system to feel more secure in her home..Instead of spending thousands of dollars to have a professional system set up, she had done quite a bit of research for something that an individual could set up..The Logitech Alert 750 e seemed to be something that was much more affordable, and just as effective as a much more expensive, professionally set up one...After having set it up for her, I was so impressed with the camera resolution and ease of use, i decided to purchase one myself...I ordered the camera, plus an add-on, and have not regretted the decision...Easy to monitor at home, or a computer or a cell phone while away from home...
