I still does the job well though. As for the power connectivity, I've already done the homework for you and it is safe to connect this unit directly to your Viper alarm system. The Viper manuals claim that they can't provide the current this sensor requires but in reality, it only draws 12mA on a full load. Even your typical 5mm blue LED draws more power than that!!The only recommendation I would make is to ensure your Viper alarm has a ground when armed feed for the sensor at its sensor connector. If it's anything like my Viper 5904 alarm, it will supply constant power and ground. For that, I ended up risking the warranty on my unit and modified it to supply ground when armed, keeping the installation neat and avoiding the microwave transmission when it wasn't required. The less RF noise in your vehicle while in use, the better!
