Nice clean, easy to open packaging by Midland. Both units functioned out of the box. Sound quality is superb and plenty of volume (I wouldn't recommend whispering in heavy traffic though). The Mic/PTT button functions perfectly, though the button isn't large enough to function reliably when wearing heavy gloves. VOX function works perfectly. The PTT/Mic assembly has a fairly rugged looking metal alligator clip on the back, and the earbud wire clip is plastic but appears hefty enough. The earpiece does sit deep in the ear and may be uncomfortable for some users. The earpiece does impair hearing slightly while inserted but not much. Overall, this is a quality and rugged looking product. I just recieved these today, 23-MAR-2011, as I use them more I will update this review.
