For online connectivity the older cameras (analog) work much better than the new HD as far as connectivity goes.  I have asked Logitech repeatedly and they act like they care but never improve the connectivity.  Having experience with being robbed and owning security cameras I can assure you that for your own piece of mind you need good connectivity to Logitech especially since you are paying extra for the service.  I run both the HD & analog camera and I love the way the cameras intimidate the bad guys.  I live in a very nice area however during these bad economic times we frequently get miscreants coming into our areas with cell phones and plausible deniability in their pockets.  The whole point of connectivity gives the home owner the option of getting the police into your area when these miscreants arrive.  Because of poor connectivity I end up giving the police information after events have taken place not in real time.  The cameras do protect my home because it intimidates the miscreants however, it doesn't keep them from robbing my neighbors.
