The title of this review came from my friends. This was their first reaction when i showed it to them in the office. It is low budget but it does what the description says it does. I bought this to put in the backdoor of my house. My husband is away on business and I hate being all alone. It is very loud and I have no doubt I'll hear it upstairs in my room. It is not an 'alarm system' so it can't call the cops for you if someone tries to break in but it will likely scare off anyone trying to break in.
