I have wanted to purchase an IP camera system for a white but the price has held me back.  The Logitech outdoor camera system is great but there are a few issues I have with the software.The Logitech software will not run on a server OS, as if Logitech programmers are afraid by running it on a server I am going to get more out of it then I should?The Logitech software will not run over remote desktop.  So, if your away and want to remote to your security system, forget seeing the video.The security software (or camera not sure which) seems to lose communication.  When this happens I often have to restart the software.  I have a web server at home running full time with this software, I don't want to have to keep restarting the software to make it record and send video's off site.
