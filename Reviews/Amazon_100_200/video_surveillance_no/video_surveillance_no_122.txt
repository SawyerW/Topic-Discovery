I got this mount to use as a dash cam holder for my camera. I used a Canon G12 which is a bit bulky so I had to mount it upside down and just flip the film which is no big deal. But this mount came in handy when I was involved in a rear end accident. Not only did the mount stay put, but it also recorded the impact during the accident. So if you're worried about the fall down, or something else happening - dont! If this camera mount didn't fall off when a car hit me doing 60MPH+, then it will do fine.
