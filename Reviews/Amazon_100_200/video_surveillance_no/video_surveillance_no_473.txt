This camera has operated above and beyond what I expected. After reading some reviews for this and other cameras, I was hesitant because you tend to get what you pay for. However, I have been happily surprised by how flawlessly this camera has functioned. Pictures both day and night come in clear, and the battery life has been great. The camera has been in the woods  now for a month and has taken hundreds of pictures of deer, raccoons and even a bobcat; and the battery life is still at 88%. I will definitely be buying one or two more of these cameras in the near future.
