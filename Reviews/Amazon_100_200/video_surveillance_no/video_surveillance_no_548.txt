I had read so many conflicting reviews on Amazon that I was worried that the product wouldn't work for us.  But, so far, it's been just what we wanted.  My biggest concern was that with a wireless network in our home there would be too much interference as suggested in many reviews.  That's not been a problem at all.  This is super easy to set up and to use.  The best feature is that it is so portable.  If I want to monitor something other than my child's bedroom, it only takes seconds to set it up somewhere else. My 22 month old son seems amused that I can "talk" to him using this system.  It actually works when I say "get back in bed"!  The cons as mentioned by many others is that there is no way to stand the monitor up if it's not in the charger.  Some sort of easel on the back would have been nice.  Also, do not buy this expecting to get any good snapshots.  That's kind of a worthless feature.  Now that I know it works for us, I'm planning to buy a second camera today for baby #2 on the way.
