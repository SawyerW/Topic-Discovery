This works great. Exactly as needed. The sound on the window alarms is loud and works well. You can set it to off, chime, or alarm. The alarm and the chime are both loud so beware. The door alarm can also be set to chime or alarm or if you set it to "home" and "alarm" it will not go off unless you put in your code.  It is extremely loud. Easy to install, and the units do not have to be right next to the magnets to work.  Just within 1/2" is fine. I used one of the window alarms for a sliding glass door. Works great.
