The alarm is very loud and I do feel safer after installing them in each bathroom.I've had issues with the double sided sticky backing.  After applying them behind my toilets to clean walls, the units fall off after about a week.  I've had to rehang them several times, which is pretty annoying.  The unit I attached to the metal side of the furnace next to the water heater stuck very well however, but not to painted drywall.I would prefer some kind of optional screw on mounting bracket.  The sticky tape is unreliable.  If the unit isn't positioned properly, it will be ineffective, so having it mounted correctly and having it stay in that configured location is a must.
