The fake TV burglar deterent is a great idea, don't get me wrong. This unit, however, is smaller than what I expected, so it doesn't throw as much of a glow through my window curtains as I would like. I was expecting a larger unit that would glow brighter than this product does. Also, I don't think the light changing pattern matches what the TV screen would be doing - the lights change but more slowly than I would have expected. I will keep the product and use it, even though I would have liked a brighter, quicker changing pattern of lights on a larger unit for this price. It works, just not as well as I thought it would. I'm glad this product has been made, but I will wait to buy a second one once I see an improved version.
