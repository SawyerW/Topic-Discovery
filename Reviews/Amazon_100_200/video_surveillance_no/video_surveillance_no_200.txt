These alarms work really well, are really loud and help me feel secure.  I have bought cheaper versions and I would say it is definitely worth it to spend the extra money for the GE product.  They are very easy to install with the sticky tape they come with.  These will definitely scare someone off, maybe even alert the neighbors, and give you the time and warning you may need to take precautionary measures.  They are also good to keep tabs if you have little ones.  Unfortunately, the door one didn't work with my door frame as the distance was too far, but I bought the door stopper, which also rocks.
