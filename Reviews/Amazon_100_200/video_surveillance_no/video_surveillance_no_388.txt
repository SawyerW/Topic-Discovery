I purchased both the Bushnell and the Primos to capture cat photos at feeding stations while searching for our lost cat. The Bushnell was $150 at a local sporting goods store, while the Primos was under $100 on-line at Amazon.com. The Bushnell quality is significantly less than the lower priced Primos, although it did have a flash (which the Primos does not). Both operated well during the day and night, although both had false trips when the sun shone through the leaves at the target area. The Primos has more accessible functionality inside the front cover via switches. The Bushnell requires scrolling through menus.Because of the lesser quality (blurred photos) and higher price, I would purchase the Primos, not the Bushnell.
