I bought this camera, had if for a few months before finally setting it up and the display didn't work.  Spent many phone calls to the company to trouble shoot & was finally told it should be shipped back for repair or replacement.  I paid for the shipping which was received by the company nearly a month ago & we have not heard anything from them regarding it's status.  Everything with this company requires action and effort from me and I am still not satisfied.  I have friends that have used this camera & it has functioned well but my experience has not been satisfactory.  Buy this product at your own risk and know if there's anything wrong with it, you may never get resolution with the company.
