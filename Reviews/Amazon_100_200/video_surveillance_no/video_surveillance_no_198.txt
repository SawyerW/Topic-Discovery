I ordered this alarm system for swimming pool safety, not as a home security device.  I leave the system on chime at all times on four sliding doors that exit to a pool area. The batteries in the main unit on my busiest door that is opened multiple times per day lasted about 2.5 months.  The chime is loud enough to hear at all ends of my 3200 sq. ft. home. The regular security alarm is quite piercing and would deter/turn around an unsuspecting or unsophisticated intruder. However it will not serve as an alert to neighbors without common walls, or passersby on the street.  For the price I got far more than I expected and ordered a second kit. If you want a high end system, pay for it....but for an interior alert or pool safety warning system, this is working great for me and my family.
