I'm a heavy sleeper and like the peace of mind these devices give me. I could sleep through a thud or possible crash of someone breaking in. But, these are loud and obnoxious and I doubt I or my wife would sleep through their annoying screeching. Certainly not as good as an active alarm system that alerts the police for you, but two of these kits cost as much as one months bill to one of those companies. As a supplement to those types of systems, or a cheap heads up to trouble these work great. Once rattled awake make sure a good defensive firearm is close at hand. Though for real away protection a monthly bill is inevitable. Plus, I would also mention a dog might be a better alternative if you don't mind a poop on the carpet occasionally.
