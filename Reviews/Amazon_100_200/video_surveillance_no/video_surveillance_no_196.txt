I have not been able to make the alarm go off.I made it learn the access code. It will start or stop flashing when I key it in. But if set the alarm flashing and leave the door open for a minute it never goes off.I did get it to work in chime mode once on the kitchen table but it has never worked on the door. Hopefully metal in the door frame doesn't cause it to not work.I called their tech support and they suggested it was broken. If I return and get a new one I'll update.If you are setting one up and using the tape to affix to the wall I recommend not using the tape until you verify it works.UPdate: Further testing on kitchen table does seem to indicate door frame is problem.
