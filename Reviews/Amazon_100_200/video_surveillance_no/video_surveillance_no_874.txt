Buyer Beware.  The Logitech Security system "appears" to be good quality.  The camera produces high quality video, the software & setup was extremely easy, and the GUI is professionally done.  But there is one serious flaw.  For those of you who plan to purchase one or more indoor cameras, there is no way to time schedule or lock out email and/or text alerts.  So in other words, you set up your indoor camera(s) and go about your regular daily business (activity in the home) the camera detects motion and continually sends email and text alerts.  Logitech knows this is an issue.  Their response is "set the motion detection sensitivity lower" or turn on/off the alerts daily.  What???  The whole reason for getting a motion detecting camera is to get email and text alerts so you know there has been an intrusion.  Now I have to remember to turn alerts on/off on a daily basis?  Too cumbersome. Don't waste your money.
