This was a GREAT purchase... should have done it a long time ago.  I bought 2 so that I could watch both kids rooms at the same time.  (currently a 3 yr old who hates to sleep & 9 month old who's just starting to sleep better!)  The picture quality is excellent.  Sound is good.  I love being able to flip back and forth and the option to be able to talk to them through the monitor is really wonderful.  The only downfall is the cord for the monitors - I wish it had a wireless option because I have a cord hanging down the wall to the outlet now.  Still - so happy I bought this.  I will use it for years to come!
