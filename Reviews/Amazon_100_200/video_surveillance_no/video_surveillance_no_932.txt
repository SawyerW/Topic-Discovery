Not true wireless. Not good quality. Just looks good and comes in a good packaging.Even within the same home, unless the receiver and the camera are plugged into the same line, they can't see each other. Forget about putting the camera in one room and the commander in the other. I guess a truly wireless camera is supposed to connect directly to Wireless A/B/G/N, not through powerline (I understand powerline adapters can suffer from isolated lines even within the same home).The camera quality is probably okay for surveillance but can't really get good quality on streaming or on video. To be fair, none of the streaming security systems I've evaluated did much better either (even while viewing locally on a Gig-E network).The only good thing about the camera is its wide zoom, wish the video quality would have been better
