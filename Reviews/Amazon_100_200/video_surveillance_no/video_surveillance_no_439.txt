Although the camera takes good shots, come to find out after I got them there is no way to shut off shots at night. I guess there are those that like night shots, problem is the flash consumes a lot of juice and drains the batteries quicker, given I don't care about seeing deer at night. I've owned four different cameras and this is the first that doesn't have a day/night op function or switch. They said they'd take them back but then I'd have to pay for shipping.If you only want day shots to extend battery life, suggest you look elsewhere and suggest, like I should have done, you call the company to verify if it has a day only function.
