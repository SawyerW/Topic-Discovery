Tried it only in the right ear.  Surprised at all the wiring needed and they tangle easily.  Makes things a little hassle to slip under your clothes.  But when everything is attached right, it's all out of the way, prim and a comfortable fit.The mike can be attached anywhere you need it on the front for easy or covert access.Has two clips that is used to keep the all the wiring in the right place.  One for the mike attachment wire and the other for the ear attachment wire.  The mike clip rotates for different ways to attach to your clothes.You should do a dry run to make sure you clip everything where you want it to be and it stays that way.  You don't want to walk around with wires exposed in the collar, chest, or belt area.  The excess wire should be tied up and tucked somewhere.Sound is clear and the mike button are easy to use.  There is a VOX and PTT option on the mike.All seems of high quality but have not tested for long-term use.
