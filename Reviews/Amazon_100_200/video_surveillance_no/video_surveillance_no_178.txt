For some reason I thought the door alarm one was a proximity motion sensor but I was wrong.  It just goes off based on the opening of the door, which is pretty stupid considering a break-in is less likely to open there unless someone stole a copy of your key.The window alarms don't fit on my windows because the alarm and motion sensor can't match up close enough.I'd recommend these more for devices within your home, like a DVR or a TV.I can only see this product being suitable for maybe a house with 3 total windows that are built like the ones in the picture, and a door that has a weak lock that's easy to "bump".
