needed this product received as a gift usage as followed:Product was easy to installed on PC and the camera was easy  to put on windowl, once installed settings were easy to follow and fix to my liking. Image quality is sharp in doors, when i received as a gift i though it was out doors as well but this camera is for indoors. Even though i use indoor i have one using out doors and the image is still decent as well. Its Reliable i am able to log on from iphone and ipad, motion is very sensitive and only records when motion is detected. when i set up the alert i am able to get alert by text and email every time a motion is detected.Using for a week so far so good.1/25/2011If someone moves at a certain paste it becomes a blur without good lighting.
