I'm not using it in the usual fashion.  I use it to warn me when someone is standing behind me in my work cubicle.  I disabled the speaker so only the LEDs blink when someone is standing behind me.  For this purpose it works pretty good.  The only downside I've found is that there is about a second latency between the time it detects a person, to the time it starts blinking the LED's.  This results in your coworker standing behind you, before you are warned.  In conjunction with a mirror, of which you check when the LED's blink, you don't get the cr#p scared out of you when someone sneaks up behind you.  It's also good at keeping your coworker from flailing their arms to get your attention when you are wearing headphones listening to music in your cube.
