I love this remote.  My boyfriend and I fight to see who can lock the door the fastest.  It is fabulous when I get out of the car and don't want to balance keys and items from the car.  It has a great range and I often crank my car and lock the door from the car.My only challenge it not necessarily a problem with the lock, but in the winter, my front door shrinks some which cause the deadbolt to not lock or not open.  Right now, the lock is not completely opening and I had to use a knife to get the lock to move completely out of the way.Update - 1 year later.  The lock broke in the locked position.  I had to break into my house through a window.  The bolt would NOT MOVE. I had to unscrew the lock from the inside once I got in, and had to replace the lock with a regular one.  I ruined the doorframe trying to pry the lock back and open.  I don't regret the lock, but it was a nightmare when it broke.
