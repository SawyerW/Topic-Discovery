I've had this camera up in a few locations and when it works, it works well.  For 80 dollars, it takes good pictures.  However, it also takes a lot of photos of absolutely nothing and doesn't always trigger when I walk in front of it, leading me to question just how many critters it's missing.  I just came back from the camera being out for 2 weeks.  It took 785 pictures.  12 (4 animals X 3 shots) were of actual animals, and literally 773 were of nothing.  Is it the sun?  The wind?  Who the heck knows.  I'd give this thing 1 star if it weren't for the good quality photos it takes, but I can't give it more than 2 because it seems to take a lot of pictures of nothing.  This is also on 'Low sensitivity' option.Edit:  I had to change this to one star.  Just got back from picking up the memory card.  I placed the camera three weeks ago.  Upon retrieval, it took about 450 pictures right after I placed it out there 3 weeks ago of nothing and then died of battery. This camera is useless.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
