Returned Item. The monitor does not charge. Only lasts off the charging base for a few seconds. Returned.Video is good, night vision is good.There is a beeping audio feedback as soon as you turn the volume on the monitor on. Very annoying, especially if you want to sit this next to your bed at night....so we turned the volume off.Not a great purchase, will look elsewhere.Update: Ended up purchasing this setup at Costco but it included 2 cameras..for $149. The monitor charges fine and works well. Would probably give 3-4 stars now, only remaining issue is the beeping feedback out of the monitor when the volume is on.
