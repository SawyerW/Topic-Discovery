This device looked like the solution for my porch access  gate.  The situation does not need high security just controllable privacy.  The product picture shows a conventional deadbolt and says it is just a drop-in replacement.  What they DON'T show is the backside (inside of door). Instead of a conventional key lock (double bolt) or a thumb knob there is a very large box (about 2" x 5") that houses the batteries and electronics.  First, it is too large to fit most deadbolt/doorknob installations, and second it is not weatherproof so it must be on an interior side.I really don't know who could use this.  It is suitable for a door with ONLY a deadbolt (no knob) and with one side protected from weather.
