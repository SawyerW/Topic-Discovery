We were interested in this for reasons other than the obvious. My son was getting married and we were not sure that my mother who has some physical concerns would be able to come to the outdoor ceremony. We set up the camera to provide a live feed to a nearby cottage. At first, I thought I would carry it to the front row and hold it; however, holding it made for an unstable picture.After setting the camera on something solid and adjusting the viewpoint, the quality was much better.Fortunately, my mother was able to come to the outdoor ceremony. We didn't have to use the monitor but we were prepared!Now we will set up the camera so that my mom's caregiver can check on her at night.A good and versatile monitor. Highly recommend!
