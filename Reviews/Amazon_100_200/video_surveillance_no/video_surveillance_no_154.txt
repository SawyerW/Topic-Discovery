Like everyone else says, you get what you pay for. System is OK for the price tag- window units aren't that loud, independent of each other and have an on/off switch, but they buy me time to reach for other items at my disposal if someone was trying to break in.Main concern is the door key pad, it doesn't always work unless the door is opened SLOWLY! What criminal, professional or otherwise, opens a door slowly 100% of the time?! Alas, like I stated earlier though, get what you pay for-works OK for an apartment, definitely don't get for a house.PS. If anyone knows how to fix the door issue I'm having, it would be much appreciated!!
