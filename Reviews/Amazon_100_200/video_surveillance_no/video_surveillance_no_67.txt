I bought this a couple years ago, & it still works fine. I had initially bought it for my wife to take with her since she was traveling a lot at the time, staying in a lot of hotels. So this gave her (& me too a little) some peace of mind to at least know everyone on the whole floor would be woken up if anyone tried to come in her room at night. The noise from this thing will definitely get your attention.  We keep it under the back door in our sunroom these days.  I doubt anyone would try to break though that door since the room is surrounded by more easily accessible windows, but who knows. We will occasionally still take it with us when we travel sometimes when we remember to grab it while we're packing.
