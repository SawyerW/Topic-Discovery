I really like this system.  I have been using the Vue wireless cameras, which are very handy because of the ease of placement and absolute independence of wiring (they use batteries), but the picture quality is not great.  It IS with the 700e!  Very clear and vibrant.  I even like the night vision, which just appears as a black/white negative, but still good picture quality.  I like that the cameras are accessible remotely through my IOS devices (with $80 yrly subscription), and controllable as to pan/tilt, focus area, alert settings, etc., all remotely.  Had wanted to get this system before but couldn't because it wasn't Mac friendly.  Now it is.  It was easy to set up and has a very long power to camera cord, which is flat and easily fits through a closed window, so there isn't any place on the exterior of my home that I can't put a camera.  No need to have an outdoor socket.  I also like that you can have up to 6 cameras supported and viewable on the same screen simultaneously.
