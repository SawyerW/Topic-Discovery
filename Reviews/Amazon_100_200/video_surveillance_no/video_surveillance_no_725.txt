They come with an lcd monitor and instead of that stand they are on a swivel with a base and the screws holding that stand hold a visor. They actually work well compared to even more expensive cameras. They have a Mic the kit if you buy it has x2 S-Video ins and little pig tail adapters you plug the rca and power into and the monitor powers them with out the monitor you just use a power supply. Thats an $80 set up when u can get 2 of these for 30$ plus a probably bigger and better mini lcd for 16-30$.
