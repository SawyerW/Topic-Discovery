I did a little research and settled on the Primos 35.  I planned to use this trail camera to view the various wildlife that roams through our yard each day and night.  This camera works as advertised.  Great color pictures during the day, time stamped with Temperature, Time, Date is very helpful for other "intruders" as well.  I mostly operate in photo mode,  5-shot bursts.  It works great at night too.  The pics are black and white at night, on the infrared LED is hardly noticeable.The video is flawless.  This is a great camera for the price point.We live on a private drive consisting of only a few homes, we are using the camera to monitor the 'traffic' as well.  Before owning this camera, we had a burglary at a neighbors residence.  It would have been nice to own this sooner to identify the criminals.
