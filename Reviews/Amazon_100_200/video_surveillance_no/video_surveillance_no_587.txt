The monitor works very well, the image is excellent and I love the night vision. The sound is also very clear and I did not experience any interference with the other digital equipment at home. I am giving it 2 starts because the only way to charge the device is on its base, the problem is that the charging slot is very small and have to support the weight of the hand monitor and eventually  broke. My husband manage to weld it back in place and it work... for a while, however it broke again just because the way is design. So it you decide to go with this monitor, that basically works very well, get an additional insurance coverage for repair or replacement  when the charging slot gets broken.
