Great camera for the price. Easy to use. Once you insert four batteries, you can have the camera up and running in 20 seconds. Takes photos or videos.It's quiet when it takes pictures. However, it has a red and green light that turn on when it detects motion and while it takes a picture. I place electric tape over both these small lights. The deer and foxes don't seem to mind the lights though when I leave them uncovered.The best part of the camera is the fast wake up feature. You won't have many missed animals and blank pictures. I will buy another one.Tthe only negative, is the buckle seems cheap. I haven't broken it yet, but i'm gentle with it when securing it to a tree.
