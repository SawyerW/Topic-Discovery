These units are amazing to give the illusion of a TV on in a room.  They have two different time length settings and come on with the dimming of room light.  We have used these for years in our business and home locations.  We place them so they are not in direct vision through the windows and they flood the room with a flickering light similar to a TV screen.We have not used the extra bright units but I am sure they work equally well.  In the very dark these original units seem very bright to us and we notice they are easily visible from outside.  Perhaps in a more heavily lighted outside area the brighter unit would stand out?Wonderful security product - thanks.
