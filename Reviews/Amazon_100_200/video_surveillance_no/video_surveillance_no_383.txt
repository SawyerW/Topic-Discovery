Comparing the primos 35 trail cam to another one I had prior to this one is hands down a lot better.  I like the strap with cam buckles for attaching it to a tree.  There are brass threads in the back for additional security or mounting hardware. There is also holes in the back for threading a cable lock.  So far it is working great. The 35 leds are far better than 12 or 18.  Infrared is great because there is no flash that goes off.  The primos 35 I purchased does not have the loud shutter clunk as some previous reviewers have stated.  Primos must have fixed the clunk. Mine has a slight shutter sound but not near enough to alert any animal.  I have only had it out in the woods a short time but so far it is working great.  My daughter and I enjoy going out to check for pictures.  I think primos did a good job with the camera and price.  I dont think you can find a better quality camera for this price.
