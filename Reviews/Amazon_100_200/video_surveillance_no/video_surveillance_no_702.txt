I'm not normally a fan of SATA drives, I've worked extensively with SAS/SCSI drives for servers/etc for the last 20 years and only used ATA/SATA when required.Still, I've had some projects come up recently where the only option was SATA and high capacity was required.After some bad experiences with the WDC Cavier Black 2TB, I gave the RE4 a try.  It's been great.  I've now had 5 of them running for the last six months and the SMART monitoring reports still show the drives as in almost new condition...no errors, no need for sector changes, no unusual increases of load cycle counts, etc.  Performance has also been very good....surprisingly good for a mere 7200rpm device.  Not to mention, the drives seem to work nicely in both software and hardware raid.  I'll probably end up buying another 5 of them soon.I'll be very happy if I can keep the failure rate to under 4%/yr....this historically is a good rate for SATA/ATA.I'm not sure what to think about WDC.....I generally prefer seagate, but the RE4 drives certainly seems to be able to back up its claim as an enterprise SATA drive.
