I didn't have great luck with this item for what I had originally purchased it for.  I would not recommend this to anyone looking to use this for outdoor security purposes.  I tried using tape, as it was suggested in several reviews, but I still ended up with too many false alarms in the middle of the night.  I think bugs must have been to blame, after a lot of testing and lost sleep - I ended up purchasing motion sensor surveillance cameras.  I sleep much better now.  Though it didn't work as I had originally intended, it does work fabulously indoors.  I put the sensor in the hallway outside my daughters' rooms - I know when my 3 year old is about to come down the stairs.  No false alarms indoors.
