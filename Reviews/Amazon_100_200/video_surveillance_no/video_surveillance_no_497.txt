Pros:  This trail camera is a great buy for the price.  We've caught several buck and doe on the camera this season with great detail.  We could easily count the points on a nice 8-pointer that was probably 20+ yards from the camera. The card is easy to remove and place in a camera or computer to quickly view the shots you got.Cons:  The SD memory card is easy to get to, but make sure you always keep the rubber protector gasket in place, with or without the card in.  Water easily wicks up into the memory card slot and can damage the card or the reader.I'll probably be getting 2 more of these for next season since the first one worked so well.
