This little camera window mount works perfectly as described. We have tried tripods and other methods to mount our wireless X10Com camera to the back window of our fifth wheel to use as rear view cam while traveling and nothing held the cam steady until this. This item is easy to use and rock solid steady while traveling, plus the suction is incredible. It holds itself against the glass with a push of the button and flip of the lever. There are two adjustable arms to position the cam better also and they are tight and secure. Wish I had found this item years ago before I invested $90 in a good tripod. Highly recommend this item for lightweight camera mounting.
