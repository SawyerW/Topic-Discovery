I've had this camera up for about a month now and I've gotten some great pictures. It will have some pictures with the so called "white out" but its not enough to really drive you nuts, just position it away from the sun and it'll be fine. Dawn and dusk pictures are the least quality but you can still see what your looking at. I was impressed by the video. For the price, its a sure thing. Would recommend it again. Had mine set to 3 shots and when I checked it I had three shots that all looked the same, until I flipped through them real fast and in the second shot you can make out one side of an 8 or 6 pointers rack, about 40 yards off in a very conjested hunting spot. I was impressed.
