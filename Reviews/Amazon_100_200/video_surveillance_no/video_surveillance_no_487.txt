With only one night under my belt with this camera I can say I already am impressed. I have been a moultrie fan for years but the cameras are like they use to be (flash blows out fast) so I was looking for a new brand. These are made in USA YAY and in my home state of Mississippi. I didn't know this till I received the camera. Major plus right there.The daytime pictures are chystal clear and the depth is unbelievable. IMpressed for sure.  I only had a few night pictures and they were fantastic too. The rapid fire of the picture is so fast I actually caught 3 pictures of the coyotes. Never had more than one because of the slow moultrie response.I love the Primos camera for the rapid fire of the pictures. Happy camper so far. Will update after using for a  while.
