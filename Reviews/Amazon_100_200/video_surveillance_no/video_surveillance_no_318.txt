Works as they said.  Needed an entry alarm at my new office.  Hung sensor on door in 5 minutes with just a screwdriver.  Actual chime is in another room about 80 feet away and works fine.  Only problem I had was my wireless door bell was on same frequency.  So if someone opened the door my door chime and door bell went off each a little apart.  Almost sounded like a grandfather clock.  Was easy to fix.  Per simple instructions I just had to change the little jumper position.Shipping was mega fast.  I had just printed the receipt after ordering and 5 minutes later the UPS driver showed up (just kidding but it was fast)
