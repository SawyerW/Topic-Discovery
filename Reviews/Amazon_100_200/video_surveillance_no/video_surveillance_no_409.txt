Good feature set. Simple to use. Good price. I have only used it inside so far due to the cold weather conditions. It seems to work well. The  motion sensitivity seems a bit sketchy; inconsistent. It might work better outdoors. Night time images seem a bit washed out from the infrared, especially if the object is closer to the camera. Interestingly, when the camera takes a picture, you can hear it. I dont know if this would scare away critters, probably not. Also, I have used infrared before and never been able to see the lights illuminate, you can on this camera, again, not sure if this would frighten off animals. Video mode works well. I did not seem to have the delay problem another person here spoke of in either video or photo mode. All in all decent for the money.
