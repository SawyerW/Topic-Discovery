This HD camera meet my expectation and price is reasonable,It was easy to set up and easy to operate.I am able to monitor my home even when I am away especially I would know what time my daughter walk in to the house after school. It's a piece of mind. My family usually turn it off when they're home because I have to respect their privacy.I think I'll get the add-0n outdoor night vision camera to see what's going on in outside. I have been researching different types of network camera and DVR as well as the price finally this is the one. I would recommend this systems to anyone.
