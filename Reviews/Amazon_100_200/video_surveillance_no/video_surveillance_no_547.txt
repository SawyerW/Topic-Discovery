I don't know how we did without, especially since my daughter has been a screamer since she was born.  She sleeps better in her bed (we don't co-sleep simply because she refuses to sleep when she's with us!) and yet she screams all the time.  With this camera we've discovered that she sleep screams- all those times we'd run in to "rescue" her we discovered we were just waking her up!Anyway, I also didn't think I'd use the microphone feature, but I've found myself using it quite often- although she was quite confused at first, she listens to us now when we tell her to lay down and go night-night.On a totally unrelated note, I get to see my daughter sleep!  She's NEVER been one to fall asleep in my arms unless she's sick, so it's so fascinating to see her in her sleeping element.  So worth the investment and I can't wait to use it for future children.My only complaint would be that I have yet to figure out how to delete the pictures taken (which are super poor quality).
