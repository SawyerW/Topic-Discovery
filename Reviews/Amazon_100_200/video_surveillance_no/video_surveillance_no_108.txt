I try to keep these things short and sweet.Positives:Mount is durable sticks to the car glass like glue.I was only able to use the mount out side of the car and at 40 miles p/hr no issues and pretty good video.Negatives:I purchased this mount for inside the car and with out the extention arm, I cannot use the mount with any of my cameras. (I have 3 different cameras and tried it in 2 cars)Called Panavise and I was told to buy the extention arm total cost with shipping $17.00 almost what I paid for the mount it self. I can't help but feel ripped off.Please be aware when buying you def. need the extention arm for this mount to be funtionable inside the car.  I would give it 5 stars if I was actually able to mount it inside my car.(Waiting Patiently for the Extention Arm)
