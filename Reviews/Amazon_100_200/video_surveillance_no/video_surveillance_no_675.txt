I am quite pleased with this product.  I have it in a front upstairs guest bedroom and I believe it will really be a deterrent for any burglar who might be considering breaking in after dark.  Looks like someone is still awake in the house.  I can see it might not be quite as effective on a downstairs floor window, particularly since there is no sound.  If a burglar were to walk completely up to the downstairs window and listen, and hear no sound, he might realize something isn't quite right.  But for the average troublemakers cruising around in a car looking for an easy target, this would cause them to think twice and probably move on.  It is very small, and very bright.  It does require the room be pitch black before it automatically comes on, or you can use the "always on" setting, although I think that would look unnatural if it were on til dawn every single night.  A bit of randomness helps keep it looking authentic.  That is where the 4 hour or 7 hour option helps it look legit.  Reasonable price too, and it seems well made.
