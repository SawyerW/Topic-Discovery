Purchased this mount for my Canon HF200 HD Camcorder in my car and aircraft. Construction appears very rugged and the suction cup is plenty strong for use on glass and plexi-glass (hopefully that will persist over time too as the plastic ages). There is the slightest of wiggle/wobble when secured; But I think that's inevitable with so much camera mass at end of the mount fulcrum (which, when zoomed-out, doesn't manifest itself in my recordings [which may be result of the image stabilization on the camera]). I would recommend for the casual consumer user looking to create personal videos; but would hesitate recommending for commercial/professional video production (if you required a complete, 100% vibration/wiggle/wobble-free mount). In short: it's a good mount for the price!
