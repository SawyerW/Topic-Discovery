Well, I have used this product for about a month and I could not ask for much more.  It's hard to tell if it activates with everything that walks by, but it certainly gets most things without shooting every branch that moves.  At this point I am quite pleased, but from what I have heard most every camera doesn't last forever.  I've also had it exposed to a lot of different weather and have not exactly been gentle with it.  Easy set up and removal.  Battery life has been satisfactory.  Comparing this to other cameras that my friends have I would have to say that this one is superior for a variety of reasons.
