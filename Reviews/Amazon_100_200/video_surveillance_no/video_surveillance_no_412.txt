I did quite an extensive review of trail camera's and the reviews for the "Primos Truth Cam 35" were quite good so I purchased one. The camera has some kind of software issues.  80% of the pictures are up-side-down.  20% are pure black.  When the IR flash works it does a pretty good job but day light pictures are variable.  Out of 150 day light pictures only about 5% are any where near correctly exposed. With a lot of picture manipulation you can get an idea of the wildlife in the area but if you are looking for some kind of picture quality this is not your camera.
