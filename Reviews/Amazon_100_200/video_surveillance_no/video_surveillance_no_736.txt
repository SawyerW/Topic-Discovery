This turned out to be a great video cam.  I had two qualifications for the camera I bought - IP capability and Megapixel capture.  I searched and googled for days.  This is a very well-made cam.  It is solid, metal, and pretty sleek.  Bigger than I expected - about 3" in diameter.  It is quite simple to setup and I have it working through my firewall at home and easily visible from anywhere.  It has 4 video streams which you can customize (MJPG, MP4, H.264 modes).  The smartphone viewing doesn't work, but that may be an issue with my Android 2.1 and video format.  I will try with my iPod Touch (iPhone compatibility test).  The quality is quite good and a decent framerate is broadcast across the internet.  Motion capture is sensitive and can be customized for regions and percent of view, etc.  The infrared mode is excellent, kicks in however you set it up to.  You can use strictly B/W or infrared with color.  It literally sees in pitch black.  Infamous 'ghost orbs' show up, which show how dusty your house can be (haven't attached it outside yet).  All-in-all, I am very happy with this product.
