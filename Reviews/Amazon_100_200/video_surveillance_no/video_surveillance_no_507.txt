Bought 5 of these and have had 2 of them out for the past 3 weeks. Best camera for the price I've ever owned. IR camera for under 80 bucks... no way you can beat that! The cameras have been good so far; quick trigger (which is the main thing I was looking for), decent pics, alright night photos, and really not that loud like other reviews claim. Not saying it doesn't make any noise, but makes no difference in the woods. Out of 830 pics only 2 were snow white. Not sure what causes this. Battery life may be the only down fall. Of the 830 pics, 700+ were from one camera over an 11 day period and battery life is down to 70%. Not horrible, but deffinately not that good. If battery life was better I would've rated 5 stars.
