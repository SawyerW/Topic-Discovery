Purchased this trail cam with plans to attach an external power source. Received the camera, then called Primos customer service for some technical information. Never have I ever talked to such an incompetent and rude person. From the moment I asked the first question, she raised her voice saying statements that made absolutely no sense. I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering and listening to the crap coming out of her mouth made me want to jump out the window. I even asked to speak with another rep or possibly and engineer and she replied there was no one else....In the end, filed a return with Amazon. Never used the product. Will never use Primos again.
