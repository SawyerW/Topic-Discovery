We used the Lorex monitor for about four months of my son's infancy, because that's how long it lasted.It's full of features, albeit many of dubious usefulness.  The microphone on the handset?  The baby that would be soothed by a garbled, crackly disembodied voice in the darkness has problems that run deeper than insomnia.  And the SD card slot for capturing grainy, 0.2 megapixel screencaptures that look like ATM security camera snaps?  Useful for profiling a budding felon or forensic analysis of an elaborate crib escape, but not likely to fill the baby book or decorate grandma's fridge.These would be fun novelties, I suppose, if the device worked for more than a few months, had a battery life of more than a couple of hours, and an effective range of more than a few dozen feet.  It doesn't, and we've thus far been much happier with the Summer Infant monitor that replaced it.
