This video camera works as described, and didn't present any major problems for us. I would say the best features are: compactness, portability (it is SO light!), video quality, interference and security of the signal.  Worst features: the screen periodically goes black for a few seconds (I assume this is to save power, or maybe it's a defect?) and it only transmits audio over a certain level (many parents want to hear everything).I should also mention that it comes with hardware (some screws) for mounting the video camera, and a fairly long cable (I believe 6') so you can plug it down low but still mount it above the crib. Overall, we are happy with it.
