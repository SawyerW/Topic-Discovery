I purchased this item to get an early alert in case one of my under the sink water filters starts leaking or one of the pipes breaks.  So far I have not had an alarm except for one time when in the middle of the night it went off and woke me up sleeping with closed doors in the floor above (yes, this leak alert is LOUD).  A slug that I had accidentally carried into the house with the trash bin cause the alert to go off probably because it touched both connectors.Anyway, I thought this was a good sign that the leak alert would alert me if I ever have a leak.
