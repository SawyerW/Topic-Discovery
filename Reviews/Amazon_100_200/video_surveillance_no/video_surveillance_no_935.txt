I have had this up and running for about a month now. The quality of the day and night vision is excellent. It was easy to set up. I have a second camera now and once you get the first one done, any additional cameras set up almost instantly. it is well worth it to pay the yearly fee for the online monitoring. My only complaint and it is a minor one is that the motion is almost to sensitive. I am working on that though by adjusting the monitor sensitivity. It will trigger alerts even when the wind blows. I tried 3 other set ups from other companies. this one may cost a little more but it is well worth it.
