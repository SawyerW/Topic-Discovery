I have tried everything to avoid false alarms, but it seems to me that this item needs to look across a perfectly barren expanse to work. I have a few 10-ish-foot-tall trees on both sides of my drive within about 30 feet of the pavement, and every time it's windy at all, as well as occasionally when it's not, the sensor activates falsely. The only thing moving in its view when it goes off is tree limbs 45 or so feet away. Narrowing the sensor's field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed, while about 15% open still gets lots of false alarms. I have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results. Upon thinking about it more, it seems obvious that a motion sensor is going to go off if anything nearby is moving, so any trees it its view would spoil its efficacy. I give it two stars because it does go off when somebody goes by it, but even a few false alarms every hour is too many. Doesn't anybody make an electric-eye type of driveway sensor? Why not? My garage-door's electric-eye stopper works great.
