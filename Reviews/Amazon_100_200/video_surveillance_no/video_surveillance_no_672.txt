It showed up quickly and was easy to set and understand. I have gone outside and watched it. It looks pretty good. I don't think my actual LCD TV puts out as much light or chnages in light level. It gets confused if the day turns dark (storm) and doesn't reset when the light level comes back, it runs it's 4 or 7 hour course. So, if it's running at "real" dusk, the deception may be over earlier in the evening than you had wanted. As often as this would happen, it wouldn't be a real problem. Still like it. And will like it even more if my house doesn't get broken into.
