I never thought about using this kind of security system because I've always had ADT.  But I recently decided to ditch ADT and get this system.  It's more cost efficient and I get a chance to see what's actually going on within my home.I have the master system and the outdoor add on camera.  My husband, stated the system was easy to install; and he hooked the outdoor add-on camera to the back of house.  In addition to monitoring the back of the house, I also can see my dog in the back yard.  It even offers free web and/or mobile app to see what's going, so  you can view from more places than just your home base computer.  Picture quality was okay.The system would be even nicer if it was wireless.
