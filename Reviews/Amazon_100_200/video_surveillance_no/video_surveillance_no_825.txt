I upgraded from the previous Logitech system (WiLife) and this one is significantly improved. All of the cameras do not have to be on the same circuit which makes installation a snap. Mount the camera, run the cable, plug it in and adjust. You may have to perform a firmware update which is all handled by the software after alerting you. The night vision works well and remote viewing on a smart phone or tablet is great. I would suggest that if you're going to order this, that you also order a much larger memory card. The card that comes with it is only 2GB and will not hold a weeks worth of video. If you don't download it on a regular basis and you don't have the larger memory card you will overwrite some stored video.
