I use one of these on a door that enters into my garage from the outside. Normally there would be no way for me to hear if someone was trying to break-in from that door but this little thing is so loud I can easily hear it from anywhere in my house. I also use glass-break detectors on some of my ground floor windows ever since I had some guys smash trough a double pane window in the back of my house trying to get in. I have a gun in the house so I use my alarms just to give me enough time to get my gun and call 911. I don't worry about people breaking in and stealing stuff when me and my family are not home all that can be replaced.
