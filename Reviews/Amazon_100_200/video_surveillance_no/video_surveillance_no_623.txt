Amazing monitor for not a whole lot! Bought the monitor so I could monitor my two boys and not have them feel as if mommy is hovering over them. My boys are 7yrs and 1yr. So as you can see this is why I wanted the monitors. I want to make sure the 7yr old is playing "nice" and not being a bully with my little one. The picture is amazing, sound quality is great & set up is a breeze! I really can't think of any cons at all. The hand set is a little on the small side but I really wouldn't consider that a con at all. You're getting a lot for your money and the quality is great!
