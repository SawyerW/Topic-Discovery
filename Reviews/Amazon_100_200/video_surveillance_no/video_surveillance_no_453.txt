Bought the Bushnell Trophy Cam and was less than satisfied.  So, reading the reviews that were pretty positive I thought I'd give this one a try.  I set it up at the same location as the Bushnell. Wouldn't take any night photos.  Returned and replaced by Primos. Second camera took some night photos but the resolution was terrible.  Smaller mammals unrecognizable.  Deer a little better. But, then I noticed that even in the daytime smaller mammals usually weren't triggering it.  For instance, the Bushnell got a good shot of a bobcat and the Primos didn't even fire.  This was true for a couple of dogs, as well.  Decided that even though it was half the price of the Bushnell, it was less than half the performer.  Returned for refund.
