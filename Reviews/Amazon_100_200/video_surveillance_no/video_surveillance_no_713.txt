I purchased two of the drives from Amazon itself through Prime, not from some other reseller on Amazon. The drives came in Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging and were packaged remarkably well. The drives are incredibly fast. I have them in a RAID1 array on a ServeRAID 8k on vSphere 5.1 Hypervisor. I regularly receive 100 MiB/sec transfers from these drives on my Gigabit network. The relatively large cache (64 MiB) allow the drives to run with amazing speed. The drives cache coupled with the ServeRAID's 256MiB cache allow the server to run incredibly fast.I have used Western Digital drives nearly exclusively since 1997 and will always recommend them. These two drives replaced two IBM 74GB SAS drives . They are very quiet and run cool, albiet at 7200RPM instead of 10000RPM as the SAS drives they replaced ran.
