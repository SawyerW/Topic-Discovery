These are a good earpieces. They look cool. -Especially if you have a beanie hat on! ;) They don't fit in my ear well. There are really small earbuds, with make them extremely prone to falling out. They feel really rough in my ears sometime. They are SUCH NICE SOUND!!! The walkie-talkies I got didn't work with these, unfortunately... I got this to work in my iPod, and the sound is very nice for an earpiece!Good: They look like an earpiece that local/federal agencies would wear. They have a lot of cord which can be good and bad, I guess... VERY good sound!!!Bad: The earpiece is small and it falls out and/or feel loose a lot. The earpiece doesn't feel to padded and that makes it uncomfortable sometimes...Overall, they are good. Not GREAT! But they are decent ear-pieces, I like them. -I am not 100% satisfied with them though. The number 1 reason I gave this a 4 star is because, they can get so uncomfortable sometimes.
