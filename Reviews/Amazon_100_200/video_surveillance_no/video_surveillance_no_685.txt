I plugged it in, positioned it according to the instructions and WHAMO! I go out side and I swear I was at home watching TV !!!  Very, very realistic as long as you follow the instructions to make sure that you position it correctly. The only thing better would be if you actually left your TV on. Five Stars all the way all day !!!....and night of course.Also has two setting besides just on. One setting turns it on for seven hours after it gets dark and the other setting turns it on after it gets dark and keeps it on for seven hours. So turn it on for four when it's summer and turn it on seven when it's winter. Or you can just turn it on and walk out the door like I do. The other option is that you can have it go on when you're off on a trip. If you do go on a trip make sure you have a couple other lamps in the house that are also on timer switches.
