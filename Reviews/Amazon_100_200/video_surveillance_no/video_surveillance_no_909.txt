I've had and researched many outdoor cameras and I just got the Logitech Master and Add on exterior camera.  After reading all the reviews, I was a little apprehensive.However, after tweaking my installation, I will be ordering another for my home.  The video quality is outstanding both day and night.  The software is easy to use and intuitive.The weak parts, as with many cameras, is their vulnerability to vandalism.  I took some extraordinary precautions with my most vulnerable camera in the front of the house.I'm planning on some pics to share how I was able to protect the wires and camera, at least to deter.  Very happy so far.
