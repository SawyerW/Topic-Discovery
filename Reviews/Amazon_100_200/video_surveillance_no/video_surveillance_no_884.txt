Installation was a breeze: install the latest software, attach a few color-coded cables, and connect to home AC power. Everything came up immediately. Nice interface. I liked it so much, I was planning on adding more cameras to cover additional areas outside my home.However, over the 3 days I have had this device in use, it has only been up about half the time - constantly losing connection with the camera. I've tried resetting the camera, unplugging power, trying different AC outlets, rebooting my computer, etc. No matter what I have tried, the monitor software usually loses the camera connection within 15 minutes.The idea to use the home's AC power lines for the connection to the camera has a lot of appeal. However, these wires were never designed for data. All kinds of devices such as refrigerators, washers, dryers, TV's, florescent lights, etc. are all pumping noise into the circuit. I think that may be the reason I was having so much difficulty. I'm returning it and looking for something more reliable.
