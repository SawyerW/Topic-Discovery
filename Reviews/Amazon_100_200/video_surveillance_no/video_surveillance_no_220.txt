I'm not going to say that I'm unhappy with the product as it does work well. But I have it set at max and you still have to be about touching the car to make it go off. There is no reason for two fields as the total size of the outer most field is so small.  The leds telling you which field is being tripped is great, I first thought that only the outer field was working turns out half the time the enter field was being tripped its that the first message was still being broadcasted.  I was thinking that you would want the first field to trip a warning and the second to trip the alarm, this will not work, it would be tripping the full alarm all the time.I just have the warning on. One more thing, when you approach the car, some spots trip 4 feet away and some you have to put your face to the glass..
