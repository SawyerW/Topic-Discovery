Living on my own as a single woman, I love this item it gives me comfort that now I'm protected when I'm home and away from home, next on my list is to get some of those stickers that my place is armed what not... I live in an upstairs apt so I'm not too worried about my windows as much, I used 1 of the window pieces to place on my back door and I love it!!! If your a single person and feel you need a little feeling of comfort when home and away from home this is a good item to have, tho it doesn't alert you if some1 has entered your place, its great I have an amazing neighbor she knows if the alarm goes off for a few mins or so that its not me to call the police, so if that were to happen she'd call me at work to inform she had to call the police and go from there, which I'm hoping that doesn't ever happen.. To any1 who may purchase this I hope they get the comfort I got from getting this item.... Enjoy if you do get this item.
