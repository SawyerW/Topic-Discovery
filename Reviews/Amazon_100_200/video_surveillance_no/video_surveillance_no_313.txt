Bought for a retail store so we would know when someone walks in and no one is out front. The chime sounds are ok, all were a tad annoying so we went with the single chime. The problem is range, it's WAY less than the product claims. It can penetrate maybe 1 wall. We ended up hiding the main unit in the same room as the door, it works but we wanted to locate it one or two rooms away from the front. We couldn't put it there because it didn't work reliably even one room away. The range of 100' is likely in open space with no obstructions. Through walls it's maybe 15 feet at most.
