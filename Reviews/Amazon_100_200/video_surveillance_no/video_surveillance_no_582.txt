Product had been working just fine for 11 months when suddenly the charging port on the monitor became loose and lost in the device. I was about to order another monitor (which comes with a camera) since I already invested in two cameras but luckily read reviews with complaints about the same issue. Although the product worked well for the past 11 months, I don't want to risk a new monitor breaking again which apparently is a common problem...some breaking in as little as 30 days per a review. Hopefully the manufacturer will fix this major glitch.HUGE CON: faulty charging portPRO: multiple cameras can be viewed on a single monitor screen
