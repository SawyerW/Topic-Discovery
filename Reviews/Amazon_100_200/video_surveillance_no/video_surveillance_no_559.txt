My wife and I bought this to replace a  Safety 1st Prism Color Video Baby Monitor, Black. Unfortunately, the Lorex had to go back. Here's why:On the first night we put our daughter to bed with the camera, she wakes up, stares into the camera and starts to scream. We run up to the room and look at the camera but don't notice anything. We look right into the camera and realize that in order for it to see in the dark, the LEDs around the camera need to glow red. I would freak out if something above me was looking right at me with a circle of glowing red lights.
