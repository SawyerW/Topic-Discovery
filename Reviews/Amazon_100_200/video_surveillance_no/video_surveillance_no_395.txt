This is a good camera. I was surprised by the quality of video it takes. I haven't used it enough to report on battery life. There is one major flaw (in my opinion) with this camera. The infrared LEDs are not TRUE infrared....they can be seen glowing (faintly red) with the naked eye. And, deer can see it too. Also, the camera makes a clunk/click sound when it activates, so the pictures are all of "startled" wildlife, rather than wildlife in a natural, calm state. Still, I'm not terribly disappointed in the camera. It was a good value for the price, I think.
