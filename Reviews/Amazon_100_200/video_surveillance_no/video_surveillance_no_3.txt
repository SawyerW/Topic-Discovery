these are a bargain compared to "the reporter" (3x the price) as they work as  well.  you need 9v rechargable nimh batteries for the infared portable sensor (but the base can work off a ac adapter not supplied)to go along with the purchase imho so as not to get clobbered with battery replacement costs. also if you like more range ....take them apartdrill a hole and pull the wire antennae out and let it dangle to get 500 ft. range.  amazing. you can buy multples of them for border intrusion security.  only downside is that winds stirring branches can give false cues.  cheers......
