We moved from our home of 18 years, and left behind an eight camera, $10,000.00 CCTV system. I was going to purchase a smaller system, but after trying these babies out, I am impressed with their ability to sense movement and flash the red light. My neighbors think they're real, and if they think it, the bad guys will too! Any ways, it saved me at least a few thousand dollars, and the city cops would never use my CCTV recordings when we did record bad guys doing bad things around our neighborhood. They'd tell me the recordings weren't official "COP" recordings, and only good for insurance purposes. When I questioned their apathy, they responded that this [the recordings] and they were not CSI!
