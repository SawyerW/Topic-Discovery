I easily installed this item.  The plastic packing is minimal and conservative.  Once opened, there are the main components and a set of screws and a spacer piece.  I didn't need either.  I just plugged in the receiver and double-sided taped the two magnetic pieces to my screen door top.  I tested it twice and it's great!!  As soon as the door is open, the alarm (an 8 chime Westminster note) sounds.  The volume is controllable with a simple screwdriver on the back of the plug unit.Not to worry, the plug can reach far away.  Rooms away without any wires.  That's right: NO WIRES.  Can't beat this.  I tried to find this at a local hardware store and they never heard of such an item.  Strange.  Anyway, this is a great item that I can now sleep peacefully with the back door open to cool the home at night and know if something happens, I'll know about it with a nice "chime".  Cheers!!
