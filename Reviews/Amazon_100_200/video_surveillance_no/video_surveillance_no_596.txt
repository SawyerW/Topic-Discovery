We bought this product when our 2nd baby was born about 3 months ago and and the monitor just stopped working. We bought 2 cameras (1 for each child's room) but without the monitor the cameras are useless. I bought this product after seeing at my friend's place and she had the same experience with her monitor (it just stopped working after several months)  and told me that when she called customer service they refused to pay for shipping to replace it. We haven't called customer service yet but i wanted to let parents know that if you're looking for a reliable baby monitor, better to pay a little more and get something longer lasting.
