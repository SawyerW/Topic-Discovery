This is a great product if you do not want to invest in an expensive monthly payment to the security company.  It has an easy to read direction on how to install it.  The main purpose of this kit is to ALERT people in the home who just opened windows/door and to SCARE off possible intruders.  It by no means tells you if an intruder has entered your home.  For example, you can have the device under CHIME, so whenever you open the door, it means one loud noise.  And if you set the device as ALARM, once you open the door, it'll keep on making loud noises until you close the door then the noise stops.  So, if the intruder opens and closes the door and yeah your alarm just went off until the door got closed, you have no way of knowing if the intruder is in your home.  So like I said, the main purpose of this kit is to ALERT the people at your home when coming in or out of the house and to SCARE off possible intruders.
