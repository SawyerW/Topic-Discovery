I ordered this baby monitor and 2 extra cameras to keep an eye and ear on my 4 children.  This product is easy to use and was no trouble to set up.  I LOVE the talkback feature. The problems so far are with the usb charging.  Its connection to the circuit board is so weak and flimsy that it comes loose.  Then you have no ability to charge the battery.  This first happened to me at the end of July.  It took 6 weeks, but Lorex did provide me with a replacement monitor.  Unfortunately, the replacement has suffered the same fate even faster despite my extreme care in plugging it in each time.  I called today and they have promised to ship another one tomorrow with a promise that I will send them the defective one when the new one arrives.  We will see if a new one arrives or if I've been fooled.  *UPDATE* I did receive a new camera in a timely fashion this time.  Now to see how long this one lasts...'**UPDATE** It's January 2013 and the cameras and the monitor are all still working.
