I was looking for a monitor with two cameras to keep an eye on both my kiddos. I didn't find any one product that had rave reviews so I went with the Lorex. When I got it, I immediately thought how cheap it looked, the screen being very small and not the sharpest image. But it wasn't for entertainment so I plugged it in and used it for a night. The VOX feature just cycled over and over, never allowing the camera to turn off. I eventually turned the VOX feature off all together, which was a waste since that was the big selling point. The charger is also just a small mini or micro USB in the cradle and if pulled the wrong way or too quickly I can see it breaking easily. Both of these problems I had read about in previous reviews...so it isn't a one time thing.I returned the product and went with the 2.5 Motorola monitor with an extra camera. While it cost me an extra $40, it is well worth it. The screen is much clearer, making me realize how bad exactly the Lorex screen was.
