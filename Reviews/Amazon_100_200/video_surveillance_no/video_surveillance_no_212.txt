I have the Python 323 (also known as the Python 3203P) installed in a 91 mustang, and this sensor plugs right into the brain with no wire splicing (4 pin MUX port - zone 7) - cable included with sensor.  Works like a charm.  I installed mine on the ceiling in front of the dome light, and ran the wire through the headliner over to the drivers side frame.  I placed the sensor up there because it seemed to get the best response.  It warns when someone is near the front or rear of the vehicle as well as the sides. This was my first alarm install, and I'm impressed with this product.If you have an alarm system that has a 4 pin MUX port, this is a great sensor to easily add another layer of security without breaking the bank.Get it!Install Essentials 508D Radar Field Disturbance Sensor
