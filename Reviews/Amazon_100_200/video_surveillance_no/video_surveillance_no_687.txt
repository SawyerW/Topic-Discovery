This is the second one we have bought for use in another room on a different side of our house.  The most important thing is you need the room dark.  Even a small welcome candle in the window some 6 feet away is enough to slow up the color changing.  It will stay mostly white.  Having done this, I then put the FakeTV on its own timer to keep it on longer.  From the outside, it definitely looks like a TV is on.  We bought one for our neighbor who cares for our cats when we travel, and they recently used it and could not believe how much it looked like a TV was on in the room.  Buy it!
