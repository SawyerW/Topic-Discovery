This is a good cheap home security solution. It is not by any means a perfect solution but for the price I would say it is quite good. Many of the points that people make are true. If you install this system and someone comes in your window and then closes the window, it will turn off. If this is not acceptable to you, call a security company and get a real system.Also not much of a fan of the larger front door pad as I have found no way to completely turn it off other than removing the batteries. It is no longer a part of my system.Yes, it may not be easily mountable on doors with molding around them, you might have to use some creativity or find a work around in certain situations. But once again if you want a "real" security system, this is not it. But if you want a little extra piece of mind to add some protection when you are at home I feel this is sufficient.
