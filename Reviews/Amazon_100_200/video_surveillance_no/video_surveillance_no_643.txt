In the words of Dwight Schrute commenting on Michael Scott's breath, "good, not great."  Scan feature nice.  Image quality pretty good.  Agree with other reviewers, feels cheap for the price.  Suspect these are mass produced without a company imprint and then Lorex just buys them and slaps their logo on.  BIGGEST complaint - receiver needs to be restarted OFTEN.  Audio and images get choppy and cut out - NOT an interference issue, just a software glitch I believe.  Cameras are nice.  Make sure camera swivel is good and solid and not loose or it won't stand up and move to your desired angle.  There HAS to be a great monitor out there, but we haven't found it.  Will use this 'til it dies I guess.
