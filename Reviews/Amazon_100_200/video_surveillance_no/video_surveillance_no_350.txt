Panasonic did a kick-a** job on this one.  I guess the prevous model, the no-sound BL-C30A has been around for a while, but this one, the BL-C131A adds sound and I get the impression a better web interface. Easy enough to set up, full of features that took a little bit to learn, but now easy enough to use. I especially like that the cam can store something like 130 images in time and in motion detect buffers (depends on image size). Once you set these up it is cool to look back in time and see what happened. Motion detect is configurable in many ways, as is the periodic timer. I have not tried multiple cams yet, but you can configure one IP address to access several cameras they say. I just ordered a second camera. The microphone is very sensitive - awesome. I get pretty decent frame rate from my home using RoadRunner cable modem -- several images per second. I get a good wireless connection from anywhere in my house, including the garage. Can't say enough good things about this camera. Thanks Panasonic!
