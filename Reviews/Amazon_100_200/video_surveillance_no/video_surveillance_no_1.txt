Purchased the first of these items just ten days ago. Once the unit tripped, it would NOT reset/turn itself off. Immediately returned it for another unit and experienced identical problem. Used the "patch" included with the unit (intended to reduce the range of motion detection) in both cases, both attempts failed to elimate the problem. Alarm was loud - as often stated in other reviews - but not a problem as the unit was tucked away in a room that often has a closed door.Our time is too valuable to waste playing with resistors and building unsightly shields. If this were a quality piece of electronic equipment it wouldn't be necessary to have to fix it in the first place. THUMBS DOWN, big piece of JUNK. Will upgrade to a more reliable product.
