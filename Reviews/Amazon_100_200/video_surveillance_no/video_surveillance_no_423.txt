This camera arrived and did not work at all...I returned it for a replacement and it doesn't perform well either. The daylight pictures are fine but night pictures (when it actually snaps one) are such poor quality that they are useless. I kept trying to figure out a way to make this camera work until the time frame to return it was past. I will probably junk it and buy another brand. I have been buying from/thru amazon for years and this is the first product that has been completely useless and of such poor quality. I am VERY disappointed with this camera...a waste of $$$.
