Longtime Logitech customer that thought their security cameras and software would be reliable. Have a six camera system and in 12 months of operation have had numerous problems. Five cameras have failed and needed to be replaced under warranty. Four power supplies have failed and were replaced under warranty. Software interface works intermittently where cameras are not detected requiring numerous reset of system and cameras which are in hard to reach locations. Product support for their security systems is disappointing as well, as every time you call them for support and warranty replacement you have to re-inform them of all of your purchase information with stupid questions on how you know their product failed!! Very disappointed!
