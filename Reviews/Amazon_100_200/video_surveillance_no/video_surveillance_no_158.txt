This item dThis item does exactly what home security alarms do with the exception of contacting emergency responders. It is very very loud. If you're looking for something to alert you while in the home, this is perfect. If you're looking to have the home monitored while you're away, then you have to be willing to pay the monthly bill and installation fee. The product is excellent. I actually plan on procuring more. Highly recommend. Gives you enough warning pending location to get to whatever you own to protect your family. For LEGAL LAW ABIDING firearm owners I imagine this is perfect for them.
