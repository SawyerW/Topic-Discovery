I own five of these cameras and the first 6 months they all worked great. After that they'll intermittently stop sending email alerts and I'm constantlyhaving to go into the software and reset them (wipe out all the custom settings). Because I don't sit around monitoring each one of them, it may be a couple daysbefore I notice one or two of them has stopped sending email alerts. The live video has never had a problem but the email alerts are hit or miss. If itwasn't for the good quality of the software and options I would have given these cameras a zero rating so I'm going to give them a two.
