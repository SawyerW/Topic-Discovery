After reading all the rave reviews I decided to buy the clear headsets as it looked less obvious than the microphone headsets I was using as a wedding coordinator.  I used it for the first time last week and none of my staff could hear each other.  Because we work in loud environments, I thought this one would be great since security guards at bars & clubs tend to use the clear headsets.  We tried adjusting everything including placement, holding the mic covered and close, but still it was so quiet that we couldn't hear each other.  We decided to go back to the headset mics just to test and it worked perfectly loud & clear.  Maybe I just received a bad set.
