We sold our home and moved into an an apartment in an independent living community. Here all the staff, service and housekeepers have master keys to all units. Doubtless, there are those who are no longer employed here who have had access to master keys. Recently, one of the 220 apartments was entered while the resident was sleeping, whether deliberate or accidentally we cannot know. I ordered one of the GE Door stop alarms and was impressed with its performance. Whether the alarm is on or not, the stop will prevent the door opening. I've just ordered 6 more units for other residents. Put me down as "sold."
