Bought this to keep the house 'occupied' while away on a trip and the unit seemed surprisingly well made. What I found though was that it didn't seem as bright as I thought it might be. Perhaps this was due to the fact that I tried to use it in my living room instead of a bedroom as pictured on the packaging and that we have fairly thick curtains as well. I think this would be highly effective in an apartment in conjuction with some audio.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.
