Don't waste your time unless your door and old lock is perfect. If you do not line up perfectly, even just a little tight on the bolt going intothe hole and it won't work. I had a lot of trouble with the remote somehow not working at all and had to re-set it up. It was a real cool idea but definately not worth the money or hassle. Just my opinion. Instead I bought one from Home Depot with a kepad and deadbolt latch that would spin unless you put in the code then it would let you manually turn and unlock it. I love this one and so does everyone else that seescit. You can program different codes for different people and delete codes anytime.
