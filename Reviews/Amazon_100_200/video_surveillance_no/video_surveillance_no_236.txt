The Midland AVPH3 are awesome headsets, especially for the price. They look and feel great and the audio is also on par. They're not great for loud environments, the throat mics work much better for that. These work on a lot walkie talkies you will find at major retailers (which use the S2 style 2-pin jack), but they don't work on a lot of HT (handy talky) HAM radios such as Kenwood, Baofeng, Wouxun, etc, this these use the Kenwood K1 style 2-pin jack. The size and spacing is different between the S2 / K1 mic/phone plugs so that they're not compatible between radios. In short order, Midland headsets don't work with Kenwood radios and visa-versa. Take a look at the picture I uploaded in the item photos to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.
