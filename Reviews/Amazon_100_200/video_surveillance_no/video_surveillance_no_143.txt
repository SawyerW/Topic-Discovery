I bought two of this mount and was pleasantly surprised at the quality for it's price. I'm using one for a Panasonic TZ5 and one for a Canon Vixia HG20. The mount worked for both holding them securely to two cars I tried it on. If you have a software that can rotate your movies easily (i.e. Sony Vegas Platinum) the easiest way to mount on a windshield is shooting upside down. The mount does work right side up but takes a bit longer to set-up depending on the windshield you mount it to. The angle of your windshield determines if you need the extension or not. The camera and the camcorder does vibrate when you hit some bumps (i.e. rail road tracks)but I expected that for the price. Small vibrations are mostly compensated by the built-in stabilizer of the camera and camcorder.
