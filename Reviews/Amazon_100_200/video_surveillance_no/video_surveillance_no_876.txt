This does what it says it does. I had it working in 15 minutes. It's fabulous and the picture is crystal clear. I have the older Wilife model in another home and the Logitech Alert system is 100 times better. Well worth the extra money. The picture is much clearer, the Alert software is more advanced than WIlife and the Alert system works with your wireless router so you do not need to plug directly into your computer. LOVE this. Will buy another one when I return to my other house.Also- I originally purchased this as a "nanny cam" but it is great for overall security. AND, they added a sound feature! The mic is a lttle weak but still you have the sound option.
