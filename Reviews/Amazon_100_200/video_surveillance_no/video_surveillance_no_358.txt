We bought our camera to monitor our toddler while he's in his room.  I picked the Panasonic because it had a good reputation of not disconnecting, something a prior camera we had purchased had problems with.  True enough, the connection was rock solid.  And it's a quiet camera too, like a whisper.  BUT... the image was heavily pixelated compared to other netcams, and it's absolutely horrible in low light.  If you closed the shades in the room during the day, or tried to operate it at night with a small night light, you got a solid black screen.  The image size on your computer is also very small compared to others I've seen.  To add to the issues, the mounting bracket was a joke and there is no ability whatsoever for a ceiling mount - it's wall mount only.  Finally, the range of scan was very limited.  In the end, we returned this camera, mostly because of the pathetic performance in low light.
