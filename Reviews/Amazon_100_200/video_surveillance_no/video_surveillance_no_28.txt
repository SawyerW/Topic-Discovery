After reading the previous review, it seems necessary to respond positively to the mention of the low volume being too loud, and to agree with the recommended fix of putting a 1K resistor in series with the speaker.  The mention of "normal IR noise" baffles me somewhat as I have had a home built passive infrared driveway detector for 17 years now.  There's almost no "normal" IR noise except the possibility of direct sunlight hitting the receiver occasionally.  I suspect the aim, especially whether the sensor is mounted horizontally or slightly pointing down from horizontal as it should be.  If the sensor is horizontal or higher than horizontal it will detect almost everything in a rather large area, not the least of which is birds, cats, dogs, deer, etc.  When aimed properly these devices are almost completely error free.  What I'm saying is environment plays a huge factor.
