We've had a traditional audio-only monitor for a while now, but our 6 month old is starting to move around in her crib.  We've found her stuck in a corner a few times and thought a video camera might be a nice upgrade.  We got this at a great price on Amazon's Deal of the day.  I have to say, I'm blown away.  It is perfectly dark in the baby's room right now, but we have a very clear view of her in the crib.  I mounted the camera on the wall next to her crib.  The camera flexes in every direction, so I was able to find a clear view of the entire crib.  I'm really impressed.Update:  After 18 months of use, the power connector (on the inside of the monitor) literally broke off.  I opened up the case just to make sure it wasn't just pushed back, and it was indeed broken.  I have mixed feelings.  While I love the monitor, I feel like it should last longer than 18 months.  Lowering to 4 stars.
