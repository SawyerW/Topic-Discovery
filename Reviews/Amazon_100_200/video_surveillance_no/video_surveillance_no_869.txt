I previously gave the camera 2 stars.  I've change my review because the camera may work well for some.  It was relatively easy to use.  Nicely made.  Yes, there's a but coming:  You must pay an anuual fee to access most of the useful features via the web.  The fee is not much but it wasn't disclosed clearly to me when I purchased the camera.  So, I sent it back (Amazon was very understanding.)  I purchased a Sharx that was cheaper, has no fee and was actually as easy to configure and has web-accessible features for no fee.  I will be writing a review for that product.So, buy this product if you want a brand name but understand what the costs are.Elight50
