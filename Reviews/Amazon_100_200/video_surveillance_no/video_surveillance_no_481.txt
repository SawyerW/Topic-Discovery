I purchased this camera to take outdoor pictures of a bird box nesting by Western Blue Birds.  I bought it on Amazon and it came in 5 days, I set it up with a 8GB SC card and placed it by the nest.  The next day I turned it off and took out the card and saw great pictures.  I put the card back in and turned it on and nothing was showing on the LCD window.  So I replaced the batteries with another set of new D cells then tried again.  Nothing... except the camera did take pictures without the LCD window on.  I went to the website for Primos and contacted them, they were NOT helpful at all, just told me to return it to Amazon for replacement, which I did today... now I wait for a replacement and read all the problems in the reviews that others have experienced..I would rate this camera 3 stars for picture quality and 1 star for performance.
