If the gap under your door as it sweeps across the entry is less than 1/4 inch (like my front door), this product will not work for you (insert unhappy face here).  That said, the product itself is fine, the alarm sound is incredibly loud, the rubber base seems to hold well on both tile and lanoleum, and for me, it will just be re-purposed to be used as a hotel room door warning device during travel.  I agree with others who have complained about the little mini-screw that holds the battery compartment closed...this product should have a simple straight-forward method of inserting the battery, rather than needing specialized tools just to power it up.
