We decided to try the Midland AVPH3 on a trip in a convertible with the top down which makes it difficult to hear anything. We were traveling with a group of 20 other cars and we could hear and talk more clearly than any other person. We had also purchased the Midland GXT900VP4 radios which had plenty of power to get out to the entire group. Later when talking to another GXT900 user we were able to talk about 2 miles when we got separated. The headset is very lightweight, the earbud goes completely in the ear and helps block wind noise. I would recommend this product but also make sure you have a good radio.
