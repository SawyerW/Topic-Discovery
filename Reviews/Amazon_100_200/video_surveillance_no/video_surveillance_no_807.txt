I have had a master system with three security cameras at a remote mountain cabin for over two years. They have been great for viewing weather conditions and security.My biggest problem has been slow DSL upload speed or loss of DSl. The cameras have probably paid for themselves in gas and time savings for unnecessary trips to the cabin. I am now spending more time at the cabin so purchased a camera for home.With my home camera now connected by FIOS,and increased upload speed I now have decent retrieval speed from Logitech Alert,I have been extremely satisfied with the cameras and system
