We had one expensive game camera that was so difficult to operate (too many settings that were hard to remember when out in the Gator checking battery & cards).  When my husband asked me to get him a new game camera for Christmas a couple of years ago, I read the reviews on Amazon & checked the Primos website.  After reading the great reviews & seeing the company's video showing the easy operation, & considering the <$100 price compared to the other big name cameras, I tried this one.  We now have several on our farm & even use them as security cameras in remote areas that have no electricity.  We highly recommend this camera.
