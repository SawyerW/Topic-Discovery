I purchased this camera to view the wildlife in my yard especially during the night.  The daytime pictures were stunning and very clear.  Yet the night vision was dark and sometimes every blurry.  I thought maybe outside porch lighting was causing a problem, but after just a few nights use, the images were almost completely dark and you could hardly make out the deer being captured.  The deer were fairly close (within 15 ft) of the the camera so the pictures should have been much clearer.  Sadly I returned the camera for a refund as I believe there was something wrong with it.
