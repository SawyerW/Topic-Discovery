I know there are lots of negative reviews on this product BUT it seems all those people bought the fake mount.  I bought mine direct from Amazon and this mount is STURDY and isn't going anywhere once you attach it!  I needed the extension arm and a quick call to Panavise solved that issue!  They shipped the extension arm out same day at no charge!  I used 3 different Canon point and shoot cameras and they all worked great.Do not buy this mount from anyone except a reputable dealer like Amazon so you get the real panavise mount! NOTE: Just because you make a purchase on Amazon doesn't mean it is sold by Amazon.  ALWAYS be sure to you look at who it's sold by.  I always make sure it shows "sold and shipped by Amazon", this way I know it's legit stuff.  Sometimes Amazon isn't the lowest cost but I have found the Amazon prices can be less than a few cents or dollars more.  I have a Prime acct so even if AMZ cost a few $$ more the free shipping makes up for that!
