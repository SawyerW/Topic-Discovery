As you probably have read in other reviews, you are hit or miss in terms of the necessary extension to use bottom mount cameras on your windshield with this thing.  I had a race event coming up so I shotgunned and ordered this mount overnight from Amazon.  Mine unfortunately did NOT come with the extension.  I ended up mounting it on my side window as opposed to windshield (or rear hatch glass).  Other than the lack of the extension, this thing is a stud.  Very little vibration and no noise are transmitted through this mount.  It functioned flawlessly for me and stuck to EVERY surface.  Mine was exposed to intense (INTENSE) heat and strong acceleration but didn't budge the whole day.  I didn't move or re-secure it once.  I got more than I expected from this mount.  I'm very happy.
