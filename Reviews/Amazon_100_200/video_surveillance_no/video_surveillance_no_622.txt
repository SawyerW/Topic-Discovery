Video makes all the differences. That is all I can say. The signal can deviated from its regular spectrum, which is Okay with me. Most of the time it functions as it should be. You can do two way communication as well, but I don't use it much as you know why. This product is simply not meant for this, but it is nice to have once you really need it. Everything else, like taking photos, is not critical to me. As I said, videos make all the differences --- compared to those product that you only can hear. How dumb is that, I mean. :) This product also has built in battery that can last for a while while unplugged from power cord adapter for . . .  I don't know how long, but the longest I had ever have with it is about 1/2 hour, and the battery hadn't run out of juice. Well, it is convenient with this price. You can find something else like this with this price, as far as I know. However, no idea how their customer service is, but I gave it a 5 stars anyway because I like this product.
