I bought this monitor and also purchased add-on cameras for my in-home daycare. At first I thought it was the best thing in the world. Now, after only having it for about 5 months, the piece where it connects to charge broke. I tried to take it apart myself to fix it, but couldn't. Sounds like I'm not the only one with this problem. Seems the company is aware of the problem and doesn't seem to care. I'm not even going to bother calling customer service as it sounds like nobody else has much luck going that route. As much as I hate to do it, I think I am going to start all over with another system, maybe a Motorola.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!
