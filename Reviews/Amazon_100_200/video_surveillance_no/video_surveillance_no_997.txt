Bought 5 of these to put up around the house.  Looks realistic enough to fool most people.  However, not sure what effect it will have in darkness, since it doesn't have a blinking red light.  I initially opted to get these because those with blinking lights required frequent changing of batteries & the areas that these were to be mounted presented a problem when changing batteries.  I gave it only 3 stars because of poor design by the manufacturer.  An electrical wire is mounted on the back of the camera but you have to use your imagination to determine what to do with it.  I decided to drill a small hole into the plastic mounting base, stick the wire through that hole, tie a knot on the open end so one couldn't pull it back out of the hole & then mounted it onto the wall.  Perhaps the manufacturer could have pre-drilled a hole or even supplied an instructional sheet with suggestions on mounting & placement of this wire to make it look realistic, even to the trained eye.
