Since you connect it using a sticker and the alarm goes off several seconds after the door is opened, when you are not home, which is the AWAY mode, the suspect can simply throw this device away or break it down. DO NOT buy if you need the away mode. Actually, I do not even think that when you are inside the home, this will help you for the same reasons. The window unit is funny. If you close the window, it stops beeping... In a nutshell, another way of wasting your money. You must buy an alarm that goes off immediately and it should have a remote controller.
