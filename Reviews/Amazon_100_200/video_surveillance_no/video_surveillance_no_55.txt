Take a good, careful look under your doors before buying this product.  I tried this door stop alarm on five ordinary, average doors in my house -- two exterior doors, three ordinary interior doors -- and it didn't fit under ANY of the five doors.  Unless you have a BIG (>3/4") gap under your door, this relatively high, thick product isn't going to be able to slide under the door enough to work properly.  By the way, my two exterior door were new from Lowes, while the interior doors were old doors from 1949, so the door stops didn't fit a wide variety of doors/frames.  No quibbles with product quality -- the door stops seem solid -- but the manufacturer needs to make them with a lot lower profile.
