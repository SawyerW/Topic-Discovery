This item is not going to stop a 250lb guy from trying to break your door down. What it will do is alert you when someone has broken into your home and opened your door. The alarm is very loud and will scare the cr@p out of you when you first test it out. My in laws recently had someone try to get into their back yard (broken/bent gate), and may have broken into their house, had they been successful. I got this item as a feel good product along with GE door and window alarm set GE 51107 Smart Home Wireless Alarm System Kit. These items are not a true alarm system, but they allow you enough time to call 911, get your gun, bat, knife, pepper spray, etc... For a non-career criminal, the loud noise and the attention it brings is enough to scare them away. This is also perfect for frequent travelers or coed college dorms.I had no issues with clearance on the 3 doors I installed them on and I am going to order another for their side garage door.
