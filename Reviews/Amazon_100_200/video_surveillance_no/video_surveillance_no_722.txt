I ordered this to aim at my front door from the inside of the house. I mounted it so you could get a clear picture of the persons face at the door. Also I wanted to be able to record the conversation when answering the door. The reason I was attracted to this was because of the audio feature/price. My many more expensive outdoor cameras do not have audio. We had an incident a few weeks back and was asked if there was an audio recording to go with the video. I had to say no while mentally kicking myself for never installing audio. I am really surprised how decent the picture looks. I did not expect much for 10.00 and free shipping actually I thought it would wind up in the garbage as lesson learned. I Also love the size I was able to install it in a place that your would not notice it and took the time to hide the wires. My only complaint is that the screws that hold the camera to the bracket are so tiny. I made sure I had a magnetic screwdriver ready after reading other reviews here.
