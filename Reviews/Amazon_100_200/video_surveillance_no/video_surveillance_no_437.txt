I order this camera and a Spypoint5 MP 35 InfraredLed to try out based on reviews and Close Price. Being a Fan Of Primos Cameras I was Extremely Disappointed in this Camera. I set up Camera at home prior to putting out in the woods. Seemed to work Acceptably. Once set in the woods next to the Skypoint on a Feeder Site, it took 93 Pictures in 4 days then the Batteries went dead. They Skypoint took 567 pics in 7 days with hardly any battery usage. They were both set on 3 pic burst. So far this Camera has been through 5 sets of Batteries In the last few months and the performance has gotten worse. The last check they lasted 2 days while only taking 7 pics. Maybe I just got a bad one,  but this Camera is Garbage.
