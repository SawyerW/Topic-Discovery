After reading so many Vine Program reviews, I was a little nervous about this monitor.  Why wouldn't you rate it fairly highly when you don't have to spend $ on the product?  However, upon receipt, I was first surprised at how small the box was.  It was literally plug and play.  Very simple setup.PROS:Simple SetupCompactStylishGood PictureGood SoundCONS:Camera Base not heavy enough for certain angles and will require permanent mountingFeedback when camera and receiver in close proximity to each other is rather loud and annoyingPrice for additional camerasCannot add additional monitors to a single cameraSo far, I like this monitor.  We use it for our toddler who wakes when we open the door, so we can now "spy" without waking her.  I would recommend it to a friend.
