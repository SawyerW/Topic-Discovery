I usually listen to previous reviews when purchasing things online, but in this case, I couldn't find a product that fit our situation like this one seemed to.  We wanted a video baby monitor with two cameras, and one hand unit that could monitor two rooms at once, the VOX feature was SUPPOSED to fit the bill.  However, just like others reported, the VOX feature never worked on the 2nd camera (kept cycling on/off regardless of settings and room noise) And while the first camera works perfectly for  the first 3 days, it suddenly stopped working too.Customer service was terrible. I explained the problem clearly, and received nothing but short, broken english responses - after 3x back and forth, their final suggestion? "read manual to learn how to use VOX feature"Hopefully I can find a solution that monitors the audio from two sources at once (without switching between the two every 7-8 seconds, which seems to be the only other option I've found)
