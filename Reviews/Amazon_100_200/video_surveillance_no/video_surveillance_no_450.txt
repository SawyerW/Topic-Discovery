Received it in no time which was a big plus. Easy to funtion. Took it to a nice hunting spot to try out the device, left it there for exactly 5 days and when I went and got it, it wouldnt turn on. Replaced batteries and it still didnt work. I contact the seller and he refused to exchange or hand me my money back. His reasons was that the camera was perfectly fine before hand and wasnt tampered with. So the seller pretty much blamed me and screwed me at the same time.Horrible customer service over this item. Very very poor and its sad how other americans will screw us over just to get money in there pocket. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM THIS SELLER!!!
