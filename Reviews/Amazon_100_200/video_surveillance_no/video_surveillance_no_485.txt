I have had this set up for several weeks now with very little success.  I keep it set at high sensitivity and it always seems to get my dog (a great dane) and me when I go to collect the SD card.  We had a snowstorm yesterday and when I went to check the camera there were tracks from a LARGE GROUP of TURKEYS right in front of the thing.  I was very dissappointed to find no pictures of turkeys.  The fact that it captures me and my dog is good.  But if you want a picture of anything smaller than a great dane or a deer... look elsewhere.
