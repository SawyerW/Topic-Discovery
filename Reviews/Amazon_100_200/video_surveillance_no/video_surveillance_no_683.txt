Just received mine today and turned it on this evening to test it out... Wow. It works just as advertised. It really does look like someone is watching TV in the room. From outside it would be practically impossible to tell the difference. It was also super easy to figure out how to use it.It really surprised me how small this device is -- a little larger than my fist. I was expecting something larger. Extra points in my book because it really can fit anywhere there is a power supply.I also like the fact that it mimics the pattern of real TV-watching -- it turns on at dusk and can run for 4 or 7 hours after dusk. This means that when it turns on is variable depending on when it gets dark. Great for different times of the year when the sun sets earlier. I hate fiddling around with timers as the seasons change.Great product. Definitely worth the $30 for the added peace of mind.
