I previously had used the Summer Infant baby video monitor, one of the non-digital ones. That was a completely defective product. This baby monitor works GREAT so far. The only downside of it is that it isn't very loud. If the volume on it was a bit louder that would be perfect but other than that the reception is great from one end of the house to the other. The video is clear from one end of the house to the other. The ability to add cameras, which we added one, and then view all the cameras at the same time is amazing!A wish list for this product would be if it had some kind of clip that you could clip it to something. Also the speaker for the sound is in the back so if you lay it down and want to continue hearing your babies you have to lay it down face down, so you can't see them anymore....Overall I think this is a great product. The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because of the sound.
