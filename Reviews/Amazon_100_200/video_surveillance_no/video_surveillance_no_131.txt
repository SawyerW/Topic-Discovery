Just want to say that this is a really solid item.Heven't had much of a chance to use it but it is really sturdy and nice.  It doesn't jiggle anywhere, though the plastic base flexes a bit.Its just really well built imo.  Its great to see a company do that for a great price.BE SURE YOU GET OFFICIAL PANAVISE THOUGH.  There is a patent breaking item out there which supposedly isn't as good.  Smaller sellers might not be giving you the official panavise.  Getting the real thing is worth is (probably) for anyhting other then a non moving application (fixed placement).  Panavise won't budge
