Terrible experience! I purchased the Logitech Alert 750n security camera (Master System) from http://Amazon.com. The camera didn't work properly so I contacted technical support. The representative said that the issue was a "know firmware problem" within the camera and gave me instructions of how to get a replacement. Over a week later and now (1/8/14) I was told that they will not cover the camera because it was purchased through Amazon. The camera was never registered before and was brand new, sealed in the original boxes. I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund, but I was shocked that Logitech avoided (at all costs) covering their own defective products. I canceled the current orders I had placed for additional cameras, purchased through Logitech direct and will simply NEVER purchase any Logitech brand products again! A company as large as Logitech should stand by its products!!!Going to Samsung Security cameras!!!
