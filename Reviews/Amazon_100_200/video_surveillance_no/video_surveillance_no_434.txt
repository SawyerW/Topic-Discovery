I bought this camera to see what animals are coming through our yard at night, and man o man have we gotten some great pics. For the price you can't beat it.Two criticisms:- I wish it remembered the last filename it used. As it is, it names pictures like "0000213.jpg", "0000214.jpg", etc., but if I remove all the pictures from the card, as of course everyone does all the time, it starts back with "0000001.jpg". That means you can't dump all the pictures into a single folder on your computer, but instead have to create subfolders for each dump. Ugh.- it should really have a way to stand it up vertically without propping it up, but that's easily solved with a couple of bricks or whatever.But with its great pictures, automatic switching to night vision, amazingly long battery life with the 4 D batts, and great picture quality in the day (night pics are definitely a bit blurry, but I see that as understandable), it still gets 5 stars from me.
