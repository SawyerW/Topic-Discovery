I haven't used any other cameras but I love  the Truth Cam. Inexpensive, idiot proof and does what you'd want a trail cam to do. I bought a Python cable lock and a pair of SD cards and I was off and running. I can look at the pics on my camera in the field but not video (my camera is a bit older). I didn't think I'd use video but it's a lot more useful than a still pic. Some of the day time pics are dark, the night mode is black and white but easy to see. Using multiple shots per event helps see what triggerd the camera. Cost vs. performance combined with ease of use makes this a steal. I've since bought another one.
