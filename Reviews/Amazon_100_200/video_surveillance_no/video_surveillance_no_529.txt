I have had this monitor for 2 years and in those 2 years, it has been replaced 3 times. The newest replacement came with a new battery in which I have been using for 5 months. The batttery only holds a charge for 25 minutes max before dying. I have replaced it with a new battery and after a few months its back to only lasting 20-25 minutes when not on the charger.Everytime I have needed the monitor replaced, it was for the charging port seperating from the actual monitor, where I couldn't charge it anymore. Replacement time is over a month so I am without a monitor until then. All the money I have put into this monitor with replacement fees, I could have bought one that would have lasted me a lot longer and given me less headaches. Do not waste your money on this.
