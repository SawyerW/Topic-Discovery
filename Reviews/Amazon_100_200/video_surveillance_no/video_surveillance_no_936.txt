After opening the box, I noticed that there was no instruction manual or software CD.  After returning the product back to Amazon and receiving a replacement a week later, there is still no instruction manual or the software CD (as stated on the box) inside the box.  Called the Logitech support, and a customer rep told me to download the software from their website.  After downloading the software and following the steps on how to install the camera, everything worked great as advertised.  I don't know why the 2 products I bought from Amazon didn't have any instruction or software CD inside the box.  Is it  just a coincidence or a bad quality control?  I would have given it a 4-5 star instead of 3 if everything in the box was complete.
