This product is a piece of junk.  I owned one a few years back and returned it to Lowes due to it having way too many false alarms.  I decided to try it again (maybe they had improved it).  Well, this one came in DOA - DEAD on Arrival.  I would have rated it a zero but the software does not allow that so I gave it a one.  NEVER AGAIN!1 to 2 month update: just got it out to see if I could find out what was wrong with it and try to fix / repair it myself.  After wasting 30 minutes, I dropped it in the trash can. - PIECE of JUNK !
