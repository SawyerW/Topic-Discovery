My wife, two year old daughter, and I live in a single wide in a rural area of Ohio. It is a low crime area, yet there are occasional disturbances. This gives me peace of mind. I'm a bit of a heavy sleeper, and although my wife is not, this noise would be guaranteed to wake me the second an intruder began to force the door, giving me precious seconds more to respond (with the handgun that's kept on my nightstand at night) that I might not have if I had to wait for her to hear the door, figure out what it was, and wake me.Additionally to the screeching noise, it also serves as a legitimate doorstop on most surfaces - I find that it would do a better job holding our door than the lock probably would, to be quite honest.All in all? Excellent and worth having. My brother and my parents both had me get one for them too, and they're all similarly happy.May they never come in handy!
