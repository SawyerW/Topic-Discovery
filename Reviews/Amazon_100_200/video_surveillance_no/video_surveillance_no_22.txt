From the minute I received this product, it did not work.  I placed new alkaline batteries as recommended by the instructions. When I turned the receiver on, the sensor picked up one image and the receiver let out one audible sound... that was it... and that was the end of the receiver, it never made another sound. The sensor worked, but if the receiver does not then one is usless without the other.  Oh well, you get what you pay for. For the money, it is not worth your time and frustration of having to return a defective product. Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit
