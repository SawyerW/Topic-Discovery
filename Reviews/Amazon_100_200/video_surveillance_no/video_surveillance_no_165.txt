This is a good system if you're trying to look for a cheaper alternative to a real alarm system.  It's very easy to install.  The only thing I would like it to have is maybe some kind of indication that the alarm (in Home mode) is on.  Sometimes I forget that I had set the alarm the night before and open my door and the alarm goes off!  But the sound is very loud, considering it's a small unit.  (Enough to scare any thief away and your immediate neighbor to hear.)Also, my husband actually suggests that I carry the smaller window alarm piece with me when I walk at night so when I need help I can trigger the alarm with the switch. :)Best of all is the price.  You get a peace of mind for just $25!
