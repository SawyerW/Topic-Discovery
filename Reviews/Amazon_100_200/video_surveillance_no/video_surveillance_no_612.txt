I have two Summer Day and Night Handheld Video Monitors.  Little did we know when we bought these, they are like gold compared with other monitors.  The first was a gift from 3 years ago, still works but doesn't hold much charge and the camera has grown grainier with time.  Second we bought on ebay for $80.  I wish I could buy a third.  I tried an Infant Optics monitor that supposedly retails for $400, got it for $100.  It beeped for no reason, randomly turned itself off, and I sent it back.  Then I bought the Lorex, hoping for better, for $130.  The first monitor wouldn't hold a charge.  What good is a wireless monitor if it has to remain docked?  The second one came today and I was very excited, opened it and tried to dock it to charge it. The port was broken on the monitor.  SERIOUSLY?  So I returned that as well and now I've purchased the Motorola with the 2.8 inch screen.  I hope it makes us happy because it cost double what I spent on the last monitor at $170 with tax.
