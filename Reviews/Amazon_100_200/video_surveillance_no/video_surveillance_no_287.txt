First of all let me thank, Amazon.com for providing the lowest price for this device as well as the fastest and easiest place to purchase anything...change their name to "Amazing".  Second let me state that I had this device on my previous vehicle...it works so well the alarm sound full mode if you vehicle is towed or jacked...I recently bought a new vehicle and bought another lift sensor from Directed Electronics.  An alarm can help in many ways but don't always protect against wheel/rim theft (buyers beware), however, this little inexpensive gadget, cheapest on Amazon.com, will give you peace of mind while you sleep, that you'll have wheels to get to work in the morning...thanks Directed and Amazon...I will continue to spread the word of your great products and services as well as price!!!!
