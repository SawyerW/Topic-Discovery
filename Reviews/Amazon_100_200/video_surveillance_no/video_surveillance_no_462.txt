I got this for a friend who was suspicious of activity around her home .I tested it first at my house & took a whole bunch of boring pics of my dogs laying around all day doing dog stuff. It worked as I thought it would. Although all the photos & videoss were black & white. When I brought it to where it was needed, it took a couple videos of me setting it up and basically stopped working from then on. I can dance around in front of this thing for hours and it doesn't record anything. Once in a while when I first turn it on after the 30 second  boot time it will take a single occurrence string of photos. so something must we whack with the motion detection part of the cam? either way, it's going back.  we've decided on a DVR surveillance system for the application.
