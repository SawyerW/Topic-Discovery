If you have the proper clearance to slide this under your door this is one of the best theft devices you can buy. Not only can the intruder NOT slide the door open but you also get alerted. My advice would be to make sure it won't slide when the door opens and make sure you place this at the end of your door. I glued a piece of very gritty sanding pad to the bottom of mine so it wouldn't slid with the door. You know this little thing can save alot of grief and expense if you use it every night and make sure it doesn't slide. I tested mine to make sure it works and so should you.
