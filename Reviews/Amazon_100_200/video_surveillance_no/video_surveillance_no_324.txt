I didn't expect much, but I did expect it to function. It arrived in a crushed box inside a padded envelope. Not terribly important, given that nothing inside was fragile, but still not a good sign. Then, it became apparent that the only real piece of this I wanted, the ball joint, was not functional.The thumb screw that tightens the ball joint in place is cross-threaded in the body, and cannot be completely tightened. The ball joint, therefore, is still wobbly and unstable no matter how tight you manage to get the set screw. If any weight is attached to it at all, like my iPad, it just falls over. It's a flaky design to start with, so I'm not sure it would be much better if the screw threads weren't messed up.I'd send it back for a replacement or refund, but at the price it's just not worth my time. I'll find something better locally. Save your money. This is a cheap piece of crap.
