In this case, you get what you paid for actually comes to mind. I purchased this camera to put in a discreet area, worried that one of my other cameras would be too obvious. The camera was the advertised size and actually functioned, which were the main two plus. After installing in a hallway I decided to shut the doors and turn off the lights to see how well the camera would function. My monitor went completely black, almost no night vision capability.The advantages:* The camera actually worked.* Small and discrete.* Actually the size shown in the picture.The disadvantages:* Very grainy picture at times.* Focus had to be manually adjusted.* Picture in complete darkness almost as bad a non-day/night camera.* Wire coming out of bottom of the camera makes it difficult to ceiling mount.* Had to purchase BNC-RCA adapter to make it work with existing wiring.Save your money, buy another camera.
