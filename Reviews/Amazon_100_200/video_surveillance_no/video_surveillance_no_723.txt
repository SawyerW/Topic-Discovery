I bought this camera with mild expectations. The camera is surprisingly very good at covering over 400 sqft. Initially, it overlooked the main entrance to my house; however, after experiencing the good quality of video and field-of-view, the camera (in weatherproof housing) was positioned over my BBQ area (15' x 25').I recommend this camera if one is looking for a low-cost RCA camera. I plan on buying several more (pending on the camera's endurance and reliability).Note: I bought a 60' extension cable and infrared lights to compliment the camera. The camera is part of a computer surveillance system. I hope this camera, considering the cost, will last for a long time.
