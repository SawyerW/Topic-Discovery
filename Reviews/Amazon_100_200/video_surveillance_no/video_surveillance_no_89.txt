Need privacy? You need one of these bad boys. Set them right underneath the door and bam, when ever someone opens that door they will hear a screach so loud it's almost painful lol.Good for those situations where perhaps you're a heavy sleeper and a home intruder breaks in through the door. It would definitely scare them off.Only thing that sucks is it doesn't have any type of battery notification to let you know to "replace it."Other than that, very good for the purchase. You can put them anywhere. I got one on my front door and back door at my home for safety reasons.Crooks wanna break into my home they'll be scared of that loud alarm the first second they hear it!
