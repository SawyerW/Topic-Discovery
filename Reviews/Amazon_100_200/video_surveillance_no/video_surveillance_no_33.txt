I purchase this alarm from my local farm co-op for about the same price on Amazon.  I didn't think to look here until after my purchase.  The unit is extremely sensitive and works in all types of weather, even at subzero temperatures.  The problem I had with the unit was its sensitivity and found out the best way to correct the problem was to put in into a cedar bird feeder; not only did that correct the problem, it also gave the unit protection from rain and snow and hide it from view.  It has two volume controls; one high and the other medium.  Most times the unit is set on medium.  Once, during the summer time, wasps built a nest in the cedar feeder that protected it, and it was going off constantly until I removed the nest.
