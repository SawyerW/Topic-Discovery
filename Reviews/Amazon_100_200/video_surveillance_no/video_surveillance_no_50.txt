I can't believe people complain about it being "too sensitive". I would think they'd rather have it too sensitive than not sensitive enough. I, too, had to put tape on it. It does ring loud. Better than too soft. And of course birds and rabbits and stray cats are going to set it off. It cannot tell the difference between YOUR cat and the neighbors, or, for that matter, a prowler. It's just not that high tech. Duh. I am very happy with this product and it's certainly worth the price for the security it provides. Some people will complain about anything.
