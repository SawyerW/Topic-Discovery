The alarm on this is very loud.  Also, I was glad to see that the alarm is not triggered immediately when the pressure plate starts to depress - there is a little play before the alarm sounds.  This was important to me because I needed to be able to slide the tip of the door stop slightly into the gap under the door to get a good position.  This slightly depressed the pressure plate, but didn't sound the alarm.  My only disappointment (and it is slight) is that I wish the bottom grip pad had more grip.  My door opens over a tile floor and the door stop has a tendency to slide and not stop the door if I don't wedge it slightly under the door.  A tackier bottom pad might do the job better.
