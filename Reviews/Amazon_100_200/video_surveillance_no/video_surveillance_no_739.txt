I wanted something for my entry so I didn't have to open the front door to someone I didn't know.  This system was easy to set up.  For me the remote control was easier to use than the monitor controls.  The picture is not great and the night vision range very limited, but is ok for my purpose.  The camera is about 15 feet from the front door.  The best feature of this system is the audio.  It is sensitive enough to pick up the sound of a leaf being blown by the wind.  Very good to talk to the visitor without having to open the door.
