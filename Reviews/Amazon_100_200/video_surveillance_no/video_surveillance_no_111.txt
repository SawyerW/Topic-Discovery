I've had this mount for about 1 year now and used it to mount a small vid cam on my truck and car windshield a number of times.  Worked out fine.Last month I had the opportunity to operate a Diesel locomotive (yes, novice engineer) and used this mount to take video the entire trip with a Canon G-11.  I mounted the G-11 with this suction-cup mount on the smooth shinny front inside wall of the locomotive.  It sat there rock solid for the trip. Trip lasted about 1 hour.I'm ordering another unit to be sure I always have one.... does that tell you what you should do?  BUY ONE!Update:  Learned from a follow photographer that if I was having trouble getting the camera in the correct position on a windshield, I should call PanaVise.  I did so and they will ship an extension arm free.  Be sure to have the unit on hand as they will ask for a patent # to be sure you have thier unit not a knock-off.******* stars for customer service as well.Update:  3/2/2013 - have been using this unit off and 0on for 2 years now.  Still does a great job.
