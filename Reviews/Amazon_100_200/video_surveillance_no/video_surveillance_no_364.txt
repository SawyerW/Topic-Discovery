Bought this product after reading all the reviews at Amazon. I was looking for a wireless network camera that works well with Apple products. As commented by other people, product works perfectly, although it is marketed as Windows only. Technical support is excellent. Called them and spent an hour on the phone working with installation and making sure that everything was OK. I am already planning to buy a second of these cameras. It is true that there is no sound using Firefox or Safari, but this you can get with Explorer. The rest works perfectly. Strongly recommend Panasonic after this experience.
