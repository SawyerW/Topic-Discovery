After using the Wilife system in the past, I knew an upgrade was in order. Looked at a number of options prior to purchasing the 750e. Price of this system is comparable to other competitors (Lorex & Uniden). Installation was self-explanatory & the camera was up & running in about 30 minutes. I'm most impressed with the picture quality but need to wait on the night vision feature. The Logitech alert app for iPhone works well & viewing is convenient. One change I'd like to see is faster download when viewing recorded videos from your desktop. Others have suggested that download took a bit long & I agree to some degree. Bottom line, if you're looking for a mid-priced system that performs at a high level, this is it!
