I was looking for a video monitor to replace the audio only I currently have, and saw the great price point and glowing reviews of this product. Given Amazon's ease of returns, I figured I'd give it a try. And wow, what a disappointment.Audio: Horrible, tinny audio. I'm used to the crystal clear audio from my other unit, but this in unbearable. It's sounds - and is - like it's coming from a tiny pin hole speaker in the hand held unit.Video: While the quality of the picture is fine, it's literally ONE FRAME PER SECOND. This might be OK for some, but I can't believe nobody else pointed this out. I'm trying to see what my daughter is doing, and all this is showing me is a series of pictures every second.Build: Very cheap feel - creaky plastic parts. The hinge for the camera swivel is sold, but squeaks when you move it, and generally feels like a very cheap mold.Overall, I can't recommend this. I guess you get what you pay for.
