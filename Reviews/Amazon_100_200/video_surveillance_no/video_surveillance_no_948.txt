Video quality is good and the application used to configure motion sensor trigger is very useful and performs as expected.Download from camera to computer over the network can be slow depending on the size of the recorded video.A few complaints:- The suction device does not work on all surfaces (specifically does not work well on wood in my experience). I imagine it works well on glass. End result when it does not work is that the camera crashes onto the floor- not the best treatment for sensitive electronics.- If you throw a few things on/around the camera, it can get incredibly hot. In my case it actually warped and destroyed the camera. This sucker has to breathe- I have to assume from my experience that nothing should be on/around the unit.- Logitech provides a free trial of their web-based system so you can remotely monitor video when away from the house. This was so incredibly slow that it was unusable.
