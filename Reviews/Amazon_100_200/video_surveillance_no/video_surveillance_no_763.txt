Bought two of these cameras back in February of this year to deter suspicious activity on my property. They both were unusable in about three months because of rainwater getting behind the lens and fogging  them up. I called Logitek at this point and they told me that there was nothing they could do because that cameras are were water resistant not waterproof. My question is how can you advertise a camera for outdoors use and it not be waterproof did they assume that it wasn't going to rain when designing the camera. For the price these cameras are garbage I hope this prevent someone else from making a $600 mistake.
