I never owend a trail cam before so I had no idea what to espect. I am impressed with the range on this machine. Mine reaches out about 50 feet. The photo quality is great during the day but sometimes blurred at night. That probably cannot be avoided unless you have a flash. The IR lighting seems to attract the deer as I have pictures of deer right up at the camera checking it out. I have a great nose shot of a 12 pointer sniffing the  cam. The deer don't seem to care about the box and its' activities. Great cam for the $$$. Glad I bought it.UPDATE. AFter using this camera for 6 solid months I am still glad I bought it. It delivers great shots and has gone 6 months on the same set of 4-d cell batteries.
