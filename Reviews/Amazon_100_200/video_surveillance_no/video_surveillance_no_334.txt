My DVR is in my office with my wireless router.  When I turn the camera on, the wireless router stops working.  Also, I could not tune in a picture (well, I could, but it was very noisy) and this is with the camera and receiver about 4 feet apart.  I tried all 4 channels with identical results.Also, it seems flakey that you have to "tune" the receiver.  It has a tuning knob you have to adjust for a good picture - just like an old analog radio.  Does not seem appropriate in our current digital electronics age.Does not work for me.  It is going back.  Your milage may very.  Good luck.
