I bought this for my back door to scare intruders when I wasn't home or to wake me in the middle of the night.The alarm only chirps when the ramp is pressed and shuts off immediately when the door is closed again. It would take a burglar seconds to figure out that this was not a real alarm. With a door between me and the alarm in the middle of the night, I can barely hear it. If you are right next to it, it's loudish, but not bad. On the other end of the house, it's quieter than a kitchen timer. And finally, within two weeks of getting it, the ramp started sticking and hanging up. It's hit or miss if the thing goes off at all now.I wish I had bought something better.
