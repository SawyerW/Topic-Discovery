This has definitely been a good investment so far.  Set it up in the living room and now my wife can keep an eye on the kids without running up and down stairs (she's 8.5 months pregnant).  The camera and software were easy to set up and didn't have any issues with them at all. I grabbed the android app off of the android marketplace too so I can check in on the camera whenever I want.  I've convinced several friends and family members to pick one up so far, now I just need to convince my wife to let me get another one for the basement.
