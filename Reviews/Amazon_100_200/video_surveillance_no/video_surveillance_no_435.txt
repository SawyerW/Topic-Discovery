Getting a new electronic device and not having to read the directions is always nice. I put the batteries in, set to photo (versus video) set it to a 1 min delay between pics and told it to take 3 pictures per, all via the well labeled buttons right on the front. I inserted my SD card, closed the cover and hung on the tree. Came back 24 hours later and had great pics of the local wildlife along with some cool pics of a storm that blew through and shook tree branches. The night pics are clear and the daytime pics have good color.I think I'm going to buy another one.
