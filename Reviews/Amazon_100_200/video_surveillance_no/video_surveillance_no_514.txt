I have been researching baby monitors for awhile and found one I wanted but did not want to pay the heafty price.  So I researched some more and came across this Lorex video monitor and in reading the other reviews and the price I thought we would give it a try!When the monitor arrived my husband set it up and said it was pretty easy.  We attached the camera to the crib and the picture quality is awesome. In both the day or night mode. Picture is awesome. Sound is great. We have only encountered interference when you have the monitor close to the camera. We keep the monitor next to our bed so interference not a prob. We have a cordless phn and router all in close proximity.The talking feature is pretty loud but just speak softer, We have not taken any pics yet as baby is usually sleeping.For the $$ this is a great monitor!
