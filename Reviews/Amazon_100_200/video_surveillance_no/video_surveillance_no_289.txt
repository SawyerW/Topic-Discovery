I have never written a feedback for any item on Amazon.  But I am writing because of this product and "Home Security 4 DIY's" unwillingness to return a faulty piece of equipment.  The item would not display, it would not move into "Programming mode" and displayed incorrect power status.  Based on Amazons great return policy, I purchased this a couple of months prior to installation.  When it failed, I attempted to return.  "Home Security for DIY's" told me they would not return....so much for a great return policy.  I will not purchase home security items from Amazon any more, and I STRONGLY urge people to refrain from purchasing ANYTHING from "Home Security 4 DIY's" store.
