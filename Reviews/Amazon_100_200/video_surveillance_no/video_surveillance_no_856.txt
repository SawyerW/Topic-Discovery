I bought 1 master system that comes with 1 camera and the software for the computer, and an additional 5 cameras (750i version) for my house. Put 1 in each room so I can monitor my son and the caretaker taking care of him while im not home. The system is EXTREMELY EASY TO INSTALL!!! Took me literally 2/3 minutes and the videos is up on my monitor.  I also install app on my iphone.  BEST THING EVER!! I watch my home live on my iphone from work. The only thing I would complain about is that there is no sound on the iphone. You can only see the videos.  The sounds is recorded on the harddrive.
