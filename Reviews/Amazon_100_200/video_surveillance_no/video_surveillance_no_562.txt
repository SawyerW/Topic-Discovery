CHEAP, Cheap, Cheap!I needed 3 video monitors in 3 different rooms, which limits my purchasing options. The Lorex Live Snap baby monitor was a horrible decision. First of all, the chords that plug into the video portion are cheaply made and dangerous. 2/3 video monitor chords have already broken. So now I'm down to only one video monitor. The chord can so easily be pulled out and wires and little bits of metal fall out and be pulled out.  Secondly, this has bad range, and when the video is out of range with the hand held parent part, then it beeps continusouly till it is back in range or you turn the entire thing off.A waste of over $300 (when added together to get all 3 video cameras)
