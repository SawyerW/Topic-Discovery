This is the best baby monitor I have ever had.  The setup is very easy, no cords just rechargeble batteries for both camera & monitor.  The picture is very clear and sharp.  Only downsize is I would like the monitor to be a little bigger, but it is also a camera which is really cool.  And this is a great portable system to take with you on trips.  The sound quality is very sharp, and I really like the two way audio option.  This system comes with 1 camera but you can use up to 4 for the monitor which is really great.
