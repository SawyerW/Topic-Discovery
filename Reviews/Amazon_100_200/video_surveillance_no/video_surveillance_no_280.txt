I Have been using this RF deadbolt for about 2 months now and it works great.  It was a snap to install and works as advertised.  Remote range is pretty good, about 25ft or so.  The construction is sturdy, and brass has a nice finish.  The instructions were pretty decent and only tricky part is lining up the dead bolt hole to the dead bolt.  If you don't get that accurately it may  not lock, and give you the annoying error beep.  It took me a few tries to get it right.  Make sure you check the little switch in the back and its in the position for left or right hand door otherwise the remote buttons will work in opposite.  I called Morning industries to verify this and their customer service was AWESOME.  Very helpful and knowledgeable.  I ended up ordering two more remotes from them too.  Best part of the system is you can add and remove remotes as you wish.  If you loose one just erase it from the system and add a new one.
