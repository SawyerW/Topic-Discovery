The units make noise if doors/windows are opened.  Its an inexpensive way to give you an additional chance of knowing if someone has entered the house so you can call 911.  I liked the first door unit enough to buy more than one kit to cover several doors/windows.  I may add a motion sensor that sets off a remote alarm as another line of defense, and perhaps more.  Multiple lines of defense are good.The door units have to be screwed into the door, if you plan to use the keypad a lot.  Each time you enter a number into the keypad, the tape is stretched.  After awhile, this unsticks the tape, and the unit will fall off of the door.  The included screws work well for door installation.  The tape is good enough for windows.
