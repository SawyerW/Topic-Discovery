When I ordered this item, I needed to make an extension to my pre-existing wiring setup that I had gong for a 4 channel security system that I had mostly setup a few weeks prior.  When I ordered this, I was expecting it to come with the adaptors that I needed to make it an extension cord although the ones I needed did not come in here.  It was not the company's fault, it was my for making an assumption and taking the wrong action based off of the assumption.  I should have know the terminology a little bit better and looked closer at the picture because it was exactly as described by seller.
