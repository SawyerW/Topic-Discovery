Flawless set up on a MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion, iphone 5, ipad3 and ipad mini.Zero problems or complaints. My house has is 85 years old and has some older wiring and I was expecting some problems but everything works perfectly. Best set up is Mac on all the time to log videos but not necessary. It will upload when you turn it on anyway but I like not having a delay while it loads to my hard drive, chose not to use Dropbox for my storage but that's an option. The Mac is on wifi only and I average 9mbps speed, very minimal lag or load to watch live view on the iPads via wifi and I have att LTE for the iPhone.
