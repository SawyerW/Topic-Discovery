if anyone has a door that has a gap under it that will let this item slip under your door you must have to biggest draft coming into your house there is. Also an outside door opens into the house, so how is it suppose to release the pressure plate when it is pushing against it and it does not slide due to the rubber backing on the bottom.

Someone got something backwards on this item. Unfortunetly I waited too long to return it so in the trash it went...
