I took it apart upon getting it, and the oring was improperly placed. I realigned the oring inside. I also used sealant on the threads, around the camera. There is no chance of water getting into it. I installed it in a pvc conduit 90 degree L bend, then filled it with sealant. When it got warmer, it caused it to fog, possibly due to a bit of moisture being trapped in it when i took it apart to reseat the oring that was incorrectly placed. Also it does have the backup grid lines, but they line up with my truck bed so they didnt bother me. The night vision works to the end of my bed, but i dont expect the leds to go any further and didnt deduct from my rating for that, however, they do halo on the glass blocking some of the view. Main deduction was due to the oring placement, and the fogging afterwards
