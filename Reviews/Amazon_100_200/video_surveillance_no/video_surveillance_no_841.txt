After buying 5 cameras, paying an electrician hundreds of dollars to mount and install each of them, and then spending hours with tech support, I now find that these cameras wont work with the way my house is wired for power. I didnt see anything on their web site or any of the advertisements saying that these would only work for certain houses, why not? Why did it take their tech support so long to figure it out? This company is totally incompetent and irresponsible with their marketing of these products and now I am out a lot of money and have holes all over my house that have to be repaired! Buyer beware, I am going to file a complaint with the ftc about this
