I am in the military and am gone alot and work some long hours. My wife wanted something for her peace of mind to let her know if someone is breaking in the house so she can respond. We bought this product and, although I am thankful it has not been used yet, it has not disappointed. The sound it makes is more than loud enough to wake everyone in a medium to large home as well as close neighbors. It stays solid on the floor and doesn't slide when the door opens into it. We plan to take it on vacations with us as well throughout Europe. I definitely recommend this product.
