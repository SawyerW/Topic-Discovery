We've got a couple of aging linear visor style openers. The buttons are messed up, and it takes a very precise touch to get them to work. These little guys are solid. Button sensitivity is very good and they were easy to pair with our opener. Also, I prefer having the opener with they keys instead of in the car. I'm always concerned if the car is parked outside, someone can break in to the car and have free access to get in the house. With these, there's no remote for a thief to steal from the car. It took longer to get the little metal ring installed and onto the key chain than it did to program this. If the price were lower I'd order them for our spare key sets as well. Shipping was fast. Ordered on a Thursday received on Monday. Kudos to North Shore Commercial Door for their accurate and prompt fulfillment.
