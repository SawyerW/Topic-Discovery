Unfortunately I had recently been robbed at night while I was at home sleeping and realized I needed something to alert me if someone were to open my door while I'm home.  This unit has both a "Home" and "Away" mode and I use both.  I even reccomended this item to my neighbor and he went out and purchased one as well.  It is loud enough to be heard from a long way away and the first time I tested it my ears rang for a good 5 minutes afterward!  For the price it really is an excellent product and it is easy to set up and program.  It's certainly no where near the top of the line when it comes to home security systems but for my apartment it is perfect.  I hope that anyone else who purchases this item gets the same peace of mind I got after installing it.
