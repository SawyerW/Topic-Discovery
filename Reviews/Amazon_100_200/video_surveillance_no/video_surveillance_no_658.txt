The Fake TV Burglar Deterrent is small, compact, and performs as advertised.  The changing light output of this electronic device, when the device is activated inside the house and strategically placed in a room that has a window with the blinds drawn at night, is very convincing.... A passerby would think that someone inside the house is either watching television or has fallen asleep in front of the TV.  The only drawback (if you can call it that) is if a desperate burglar gets close enough to the window and hears no TV sound, which may prompt him to revisit the same location two or three nights in a row to validate his suspicion of a decoy, and then decide whether to break in or not.  Additional Burglar deterrents, such as a live or electronic guard dog, a real or fake security camera, as well as security signs would probably reduce the chances of a burglar targeting your property.
