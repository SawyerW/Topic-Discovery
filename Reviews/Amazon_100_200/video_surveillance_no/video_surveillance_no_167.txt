I bought this system after reading many reviews. I live on the first floor of an apartment complex and I've always felt a little uneasy being there by myself. I do have two dogs but I wanted even more of a deterrent to potential burglars. The alarms were pretty easy to set up and the code is easily changed by removing the back and resetting if needed. The alarms are extremely ear piercing (great for when you need it - not so great for when you thought you had turned off the alarm). It took us a few tries (and losing our hearing a few times) to get it right - one beep means it's armed; two beeps means it's off. If you remember that, you're golden. I highly recommend this product if you cannot afford a monitored system.
