Be warned! This item is NOT a doorbell or ringer, where people at your front door push a button to summon you. It is ONLY an entrance alarm/charm, for use in businesses to alert when a customer enters a shop!In the picture, the middle sized item is a sensor/transmitter which you mount on the doorjam and the small one is a magnet, which you mount on the door. When the door opens and they separate, the chime sounds from the large item, which you plug into an outlet.The description used the term "doorbell" several times.It seems passable for its intended use, though the chine setup is somewhat complex, you use "jumpers" like you'd find on computer hardware to change settings. The volume adjusts well and the chine tone is clear
