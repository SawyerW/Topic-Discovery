I highly recommend this camera.  I bought this camera on recommendation from a friend who had researched a number of them prior to purchasing this one.  I bought it solely to see what was living in the woods on my property (I don't hunt).  Within 4 days I had great night shots of a raccoon and dinner-time (daylight) very clear shots of a LARGE BEAR.  Very clear pictures.  The camera is very easy to use....not fancy at all but honestly it gives you the features you'd want for this purpose.  My kids and I are now excited to check the memory card to see what is on it from the night before....Also - it is a great gift for someone who likes wildlife and lives in an area that has wildlife.  Or for someone who enjoys the outdoors.  I suppose it could also be a bit of a security camera if needed....but don't rely on it for that.
