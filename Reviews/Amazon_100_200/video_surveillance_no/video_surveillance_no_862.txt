Logitech has produced a great little modular security system that is easy to install without tearing up your home or re-wiring it.  This is truly a plug-n-play system that operates through your existing network and electrical system.  As long as you have an outlet nearby, you can easily mount a camera, plug it in and monitor your system though your home computer.  I thought the image quality was better than average, competing favorably with a system that my neighbor had installed for three times the price.  The record and review features are excellent and night vision quality and sound are very good as well.  What I like best is the option of using email and text alerts when the cameras pick up movement, along with the ability for live viewing from your cameras on the internet.  I am very pleased with this system and recommend it highly.  In two weeks, I have had no system related down time and very few problems.
