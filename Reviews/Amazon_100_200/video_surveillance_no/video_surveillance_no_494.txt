The Primos Truth Cam 35 Game camera worked great. I had like 300 pictures the first week. As others stated, night picture's are not as good. I had mine on an iron fence post, 20 feet away from feeder. (I'd cut a 2x6, the length of the camera, cutting a vertical slot in the 2x6 to fit on post, and wiring it with wire, and attached camera to it, with the strap and a rope. Waist high. Worked great.) I could still make out the animals, but should have put it at 15 feet. Day picture's great. Coon's,wild hogs, crows, tore my corn up. They ate up 4 bags of corn. It's great to see what's out there. This was my first game camera. Had been putting off buying one for years.  I would buy another camera like this. What are you waiting on? Can't beat the price.
