I have only have this unit for two days, and have not gotten one pic of an animal yet.  It is in an area where I have seen cats walk by it.  Sensitivity set to high, I have to get within 10 feet of it in order to set it off.  I am giving it one more night and then will have to make different arrangements for this system, so far it has not lived up to its claims.  Update:  Second night it seems to be picking up some things now.  Couldn't trigger it myself the first night unless I was very close as stated above, but now it does pick up from beyond 30 feet, maybe it is getting better.  Will give a final note in a week.
