Most deffinitely a great product and works very well as a deterent for possible thieves.  After my vehicle was compromised twice this easy to install device does the job.  Only down fall is possibly the sensitivity adjustment when the weather & seasons change.  It may sound off more than expected but overall a great item.  If unable to install yourself or would like to reframe from possibly getting your hands dirty, have a local sound shop do the installation for you..  Had mine installed for about $40 and the initial product purchase of roughly $25..  Great addition to an after market alarm system..  If you have nice chrome/rims I'd also recommend one other device called a tilt sensor..
