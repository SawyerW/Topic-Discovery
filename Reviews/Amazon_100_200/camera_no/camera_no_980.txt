Initially worked fine but after several uses the monitor quit working, mounted or not.  Completely dead, and would not take a charge.  I checked and the power cord was supplying power.  I liked the unit well enough that I would have swapped out the nonworking monitor for another one, but that's not how the system worked and I had to return the entire unit for the seller to check it out.  No problem dealing with the seller though I was told I only had a couple of weeks to return the unit for a refund.  I purchased my unit shortly before Christmas and the deadline may have been for Christmas gift returns regardless of any problem.  It may be that with the dead monitor the seller would have taken the unit back after the deadline.
