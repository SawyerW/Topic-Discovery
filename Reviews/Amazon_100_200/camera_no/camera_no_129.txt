This is a great little camera, but not worth the buy. I got mine for Christmas last year and within the first 2 months the pin on the command dial had broken. I had to pay to ship it into Sony's repair center and wait 2 weeks for them to fix it. Luckily, it was under warranty. I wasn't so lucky the second time. I went to take a picture with the thing and it blanked out. I thought the battery just needed to be charged, but no such luck. It won't turn on, it won't charge, and the lens is stuck in the on position. It's still under warranty, but Sony wants me to ship it back to their repair center, wait another 2 weeks to fix it, and pay $171 for labor on the thing, even though it's only 6 months old and barely been used. I have a carrying case for it and it is in excellent condition. This thing is not worth the hassles- check out another brand of camera that has a more reliable customer care policy!
