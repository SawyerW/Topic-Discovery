This camera is TOPS for home use.  The pros might find a few things lacking, such as the limited flash intensity and inability to add an external flash.  The ONLY other draw back I have found it the length of  time it takes to save a pic.  It takes approximately 3-4 seconds for the  pic to save, so rapid fire shooting is out.  But, with the floppy drive,  and ultimately endless storage capacity (how many disks can you carry?)  makes this a tolerable drawback.  It is not in the megal pixel range, but  in the 1024x768 fine mode, I have found that the resolution is very good.  NOTHING beats the zoom on this thing.  14x zoom!  A toy that I will NEVER  get tired of using and playing with!
