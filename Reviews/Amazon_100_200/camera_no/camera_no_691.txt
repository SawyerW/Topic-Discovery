I have been an Olympus Camera user since I bought my OM-1 over 30 years ago.  My first digital camera was the C-3030 camera which provided great use for over 8 years while living aboard my sailboat in the Caribbean.  It was a natural choice to move up to the e-520 as I have a large collection of OM lens and wanted to use them on the new DSLR.  The camera has a feel very similar to the C3030 in both menu and general feel.  After receiving the camera I was really impressed with the quality of the images, both vibrant and great resolution.  Although the original OM lens won't give me auto-focus, this has proved to be a minor problem as I am used to the full manual functions of the OM-1.  The quality of the pictures using the OM lens has been extraordinary. If you are looking for a camera that gives you a lot of bang for the buck I would highly recommend you consider it.
