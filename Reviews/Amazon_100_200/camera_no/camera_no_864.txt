I bought this camera in 2003 and it worked GREAT. I have changed the batteries a total of 3 times since I've had it and have taken hundreds of pix. I have just purchased the Canon Powershot A570IS, because my A70  has just 'broken' down as of October 31, 2007 (no Halloween pix). I won't bother to repair it, since its not worth it, however it did a great job for the past 4 years, and I hope the new one does a better job, if that's possible. I would recommend Cannon to my friends. Its a great product and does what its made to do.
