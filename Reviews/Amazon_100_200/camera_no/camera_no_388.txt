I'm so disapointed with Nikon. I bought a new D80... my first Nikon. My Wife bought me a Nikon 18-135 lens. I've invested about $1,200 into the camera and accessories. I've taken about 200 pictures and have taken exceptional care of the camera, yet I turned it on this past weekend and got the "Err" error on the display.I've tried 2 different lenses, removing and re-inserting the battery (fully charged), removed and re-inserted the XD card, tried the +- reset and then tried a complete soft reset using the reset button. The "Err" is still there.I contacted Nikon and I'm outside my warrenty so they said to send them the body and they will let me know what it cost to get it fixed. I guess I should just send a blank check also because they said they couldn't even give me an estimate of what it might cost.I'm sickened. I picked a Nikon because of the "supposed" quality behind the name. I can't believe this camera failed with so little use. My friend, who uses only Pentax, said his Pentax cameras have over 10,000 shots on them and still no problems.Last Nikon I will ever own.
