I got the Canon T3 and the manual is on a DVD.  That isn't real convenient.  I don't want to run to the computer every time I have a question.  The big plus is that this book is written specifically for this camera, which is just what I needed and wanted.  The camera is pretty simple to use but if I want to get a little more advanced this book walks me right through it.  I can take the book along with me and don't have to go boot up the computer to TRY to find an answer on the DVD.
