I thought this was wireless and used the technology like a cordless phone or wifii to communicate with the computer base unit, wrong.  It uses your power lines to communicate and the same house is not good enough, it has to be on the same breaker.  So I wanted to have my computer in my office and one camera upstairs and one downstairs, wrong doesn't work!  They state it works for a home up to 8000 sq feet, that would be true only with special electical wiring.  So, if you are building a house or are willing to pay an electrician to add a special circuit to your home just for this device, I would not buy it.  If you want one camera in the location of your computer, save money and buy one that just plugs into your computer.
