We had purchased a Panasonic wireless IP camera (BL-C131A) but had trouble with it staying connected to the router and we finally gave up and send it back after not getting any help from their tech support. The Trendnet camera is very easy to set up and works like a charm. I called TRENDnet tech support before making this purchase and they were very helpful and they have been great to work with. We have purchased two more cameras.Electronics, when they work they work great but when they don't if the company has poor support or does not stand behind their product, it's not worth purchasing! Thats why I'm done with Panasonic!
