I have had this camera for six months and still find it to be the best digitial camera available for the price. (Amazing in the computer world) Others have cameras with more pixels, more storage, etc., but no one has  matched the lens. a 14x (38mm-510mm) optical zoom is unmatched. Combine  that with the floppy storage (no easier method for transporting to multiple  computers) and the multiple viewfinders (LCD screen and eyepiece) and you  have an unbeatable combination.  The resolution is more than acceptable for  anything but professional use (and even for professional use online) and I  bet hardly anyone uses anything other than JPEG mode anyway. A real winner!  PS mine got stolen last night and I am ordering another even after  checking out all the newer models!
