I bought this camera back in July of 2004 and i have been a happy user of this product for over two years.  One of the things that i loved about canon powershot A70 is the battery life.  I use 4 Monster NiMH rechargeable batteries on this camera and they work awesome, over 100+ pics. The picture quality is nice, and the camera is easy to use.However now that 2007 is around the corner, I'm starting to think of upgrading, one thing that I don't like about this camera is that it is pretty bulky when carrying it in your pocket.  This camera is bigger than the newer cameras of its class, and at 3.2MP its starting to show its age.Overall, nice camera.
