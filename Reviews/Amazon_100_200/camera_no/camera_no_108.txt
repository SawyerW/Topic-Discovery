The D535 is my first digital camera and I think it is a great camera for the price.  The pictures are very sharp.  The software is easy to load and use.  The camera is easy to use.  I have been taking close-ups for ebay auctions and other shots inside and outside.  No complaints and nothing but priase for this little dude.  Yes.  It does suck up batteries but so does every other camera in this price range (I haven't looked at the more expensive ones).  The flash is weak, but I looked at the reviews of about 20 others cameras priced $100-$200 and they all had that problem.Yhe cover for the USB plug in looks a little mickey mouse but it is functional.  For $140, it exceeded my expectations!I often see wildly varying opinion on digital camera.  I tend to think that some people expected too much for their money.
