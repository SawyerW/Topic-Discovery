Its funny hearing all these reviews on this camera.  The problem listed in earlier reviews about the camera having focusing problems.  I too have had similar problems.  It almost seems like the video feed stalls slightly when panning out, or tilting the camera to one side or downward.  I received my first camera and right out of the box it was so bad it did not function.  My replacement I have had for about 3 months, and now similar problems are arising.  After contacting JVC they said they had no idea about any kind of problem and said I would need to pay to ship the camera and get it evaluated.  I asked to speak to the representatives supervisor and was promptly hung up on.  Now I am the last person to cause any kind of fuss in a company and rarely do anything like this at all.  But this has left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I will never again deal with JVC as a company.
