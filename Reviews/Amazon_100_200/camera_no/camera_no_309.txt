This camera arrived and I was amazed at how friendly it is.  Previously I shot film with a Nikon N70 as a serious amateur occasionally making some money with it.  All I had to do was charge the battery, easily set the time and date and it was ready to go.  The controls for even the more complicated features are very intuitive if you just spend a little time glancing through the manual.  Because it's winter in Minnesota, I haven't had any time yet to use it outside but the shots I've taken with just the on camera flash have came out well.  I'm still not sure what I'm going to use for an everyday lens for this camera but in the meantime, my AF 35 to 80 lens from my N70 works very well.  The 2gb card that I bought for it has plenty of capacity even if I shoot in RAW.  I still have plenty to learn especially about some of the on-camera editing features but everything has been so easy to learn so far so I expect that to come quickly as well.
