I am Drew Corey, a small time travel writer (you wouldn't have heard of me). I am only 25 years old, but I have 15(!)digital cameras, including this 1.This was my 10th digicam, to be precise. I have taken this with me to Kenya, New Zealand and Mexico. All 3 times, I have got fabulous photos, whichi magazines have accepted.True, this IS a beginner's camera, but one easily gets fooled by the looks, style, price and brandname. I got fooled, to tell you the truth. But even a professional photographer would be amazed at the quality of these photos;they come out ACE!! I mean, they ALWAYS come out ACE!!So the bottomline:THIS CAMERA IS A SNATCH. IT'LL BE THE ENVY OF YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOU'LL BE WOWED BY IT TOO. SO DON'T HESITATE:GO AHEAD AND BUY IT;YOU CAN WORK WONDERS WITH IT!!
