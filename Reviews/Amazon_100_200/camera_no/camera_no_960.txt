I bought the 8800 as a second camera to use when I didn't want to cart the DSLR and it's bag of lenses around. After using it for about two weeks, it's been returned.On the surface, it seems to have a lot of features, but I'd have to characterize the 8800 as a "fair-weather" camera. In sufficient light (e.g. daylight) it takes great pictures.Let the light get dim, however, or use it at it's extended zoom range, or indoors, and it just hunts, trying to find focus. Not being able to use the extended zoom in anything but the best lighting conditions make having one a bit pointless. The EVF is coarse, making it difficult to judge subject focus, and the camera's high ISO range (400) isn't really usable.For those trying to make the purchase decision, be aware, the camera has some major drawbacks. You'll definitely need to determine if it fits your needs and shooting style.
