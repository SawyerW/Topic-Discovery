Pros:o all internal functions work with Firefox 3.6.16/seamonkey 2.0 14 (linux):  - email and ftp uploads  - LAN rtsp and https (inc. audio), WAN w router port forwarding  - motion and presets (browser interface and command line via http requests*)  - DHCP and fixed IPo configurable without any wizard or other CDROM bits (DHCP or 192.168.10.30)o 'outdoor' video adjust workso recovers quickly (45 seconds) from power/network outages/rebootso relatively wide visual fieldMotion detection is integrated with activeX and external software not built in to the camera, not tested.Things I wished I would have have dug deeper in to:o infrared "night vision" can't be turned off, including black paint and duct tape attempts (problem in low light scenarios)o video quality/lens is NOT suited for:- outdoor views- windows or reflective (including white/shiny) surfaces- sharp images / accurate color / natural contrast- "sunrise" or "dim" (as in dusk) lighting scenarioso difficult to focus, even with portable laptop as displayWould recommend at price/performance point if strictly indoor environment where image quality is not important, else go with a non-infrared model.* look for a post on linuxquestions.org under 'hardware/TV-IP422W' in the next day or two.Cheers,
