I purchased 3 cheap cameras ($20, $99, $150) before learning my lesson. I did quite a bit of research (mainly looking at reviews) before I selected the DSC-V3. My reasons for choosing it were the excellent consumer and expert reviews, the price, and the image quality.I found the camera was not only easy to use, but produced great pictures. You can use either Memory Stick or CompactFlash memory cards. Comes with a lithium battery and has good battery life as well as decent recharging time.The camera doesn't come with a memory card, which is kind of a pain, and if you're looking for one of those teeny pocket-size digital cameras, this is really not the camera for you. I personally like the larger size, but maybe that's because it makes it feel fancy and expensive.Overall, I recommend this camera if you're looking for something that can give you really nice pictures without a lot of hassle.Pros- 2 types of memory storage, image quality, large LCDCons- no memory card included, size/weight
