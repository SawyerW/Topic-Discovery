I bought this D80 Nikon in Feb. 2009, it is now June 2012 and I have used the camera for over 3 yrs. with no problems, it takes great photographs, has many features on the camera.  Easy to use, instruction book is fairly easy to understand.  The built in flash is adequate for most all my use, although I bought an add on flash I rarely use it.  I would advise saving your money and relying on the built in flash.  Camera will take most any memory cards, 4gig, 8gig, 16gig, etc, with no problems.  The battery charger works great, I recommend having two batteries, a backup battery you keep charged as a backup when you go on a shoot, and extra memory cards.The camera is well built, reliable, and reminds me of the nice old film Nikons of days of yore.
