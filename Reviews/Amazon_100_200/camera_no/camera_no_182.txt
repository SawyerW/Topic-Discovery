I was sitting all the way on the other side of a ferry as someone was shooting pictures of the shore and I could see the image on his view screen. I was blown away because I was used to my Canon S30's tiny little screen. I asked the guy what model it was and as soon as I got home I looked it up. Based on everything I read, it was the perfect camera for me. I put it on my Xmas list when my Canon broke. It takes great picrures and is very easy to use. Amazon offered a free 1G card and that is more than enough. If you're a point & shoot photographer and you like taking your camera EVERYWHERE, you'll love this one or any of the Casio Exilims.
