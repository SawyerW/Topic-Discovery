This 7MP camera stands by its own.  Has all the basic adjustments and the quality is top of the line.  Although Sony accessories are not cheap, they are long-lasting and some items, like the tripod can be used with other cameras.  Dual memory option is pretty useful.The battery lasts a long time and it displays the remaining battery time.  Some cameras just don't offer this option which is a MUST.If you plan to invest in a good camera, buy this one.  I use this camera a lot for website photos ([...] for example) and also I found that the add-on lenses really give crisp and natural photos.
