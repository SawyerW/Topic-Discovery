My daughter and I had these cameras with the dock 3 years ago and they were the best cameras we have ever had.  Then the cameras broke, first hers and then mine.  We were told that these camera's were not available anymore, but if we bought another kind, it would fit the dock.  My daughter bought one and it did not fit the dock, nor was it half as good as the old camera.Recently, I typed the camera LS743 into Amazon Search and there it was!  I bought two of them and they work perfectly.I thought, "Oh no!  Once again something I love has gone off the market" but I am very pleasantly suprised by this.Thank you Amazon!Patsy Behrend
