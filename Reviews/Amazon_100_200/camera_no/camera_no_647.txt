I'm an Apple guy so I was looking to access the cam on my MacBookPro when at the office or travelling using my iPhone when mobile.  The setup recommends wired and on a PC so I followed the directions.  You can't use the software that controls multiple cameras on a Mac, but you can use the web version of the admin tool.Either way, the setup was quite easy.  I would suggest setting it up wired to a PC first.  Update the firmware.  Setup wireless and then do the rest from your Mac.  I did have a weird problem after I changed the default HTTP port where the built in web server was displaying broken images.  I had to reset it and it worked fine though.I was disappointed that it didn't work via Safari on my iPhone 4.  However, after some digging I found an app called EyeCam for 5 dollars in the app store.  It works perfectly and allows me to see live streaming, pan/tilt the camera and can even pinch zoom [which is only digital].I'm very happy with it so far and for 150 bucks, you can't really go wrong.
