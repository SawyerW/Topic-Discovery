Apart from all the good points rightly pointed by all reviewers there is one design problem with the camera: the LCD screen. It is simply too dim. To the point that is almost useless on a bright day. The quality of the pictures is great and the bundled software is very powerful and easy to use. Specially the Digital Photo Professional, that comes with no manual, is great. You can find an excelent tutorial here: [...].Maybe that is why another reviewer complains about the images being too dull. I first tried the camera on an overcast day in Chicago and as almost everything is gray, the pictures at the LCD screen were quite ugly and flat. Very different from another cameras LCDs.
