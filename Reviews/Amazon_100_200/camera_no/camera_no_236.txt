I upgraded from the D40 as my introduction to DSLRs to the Nikon D80. There were a few more knobs and gadgets on the camera but well put together. I went to Seaworld and snapped off some shots with my 18-55mm and my 105mm Fisheye glass. I couldn't believe the difference this was from my D40. I am so impressed with the quality, I am enrolling in UC San Diego Extension class to learn the things I can't seem to get from all the books and manuals I've read.  This has become my new passion and I feel, without spending a mortgage payment, this camera can get me to the next level and maybe start getting paid for what I now love to do.Research the product and figure out what you want to do with it. Whether it be strictly a hobby or move into the professional realm. This camera is a great starting point.
