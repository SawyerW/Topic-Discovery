This little camera does exactly as described and I couldn't be happier with it.  Easy to use which is a good thing cause the instruction guide is not good. But I was able to figure everything out on my own as it is very easy to use.  The Best Shot feature really works.  I experimented on flowers and it really makes a difference when you use the flower setting as opposed to automatic.  Having fun playing around with it and look forward to many photos.  Also, the battery is the longest I've ever seen!  I've had the camera a little over a month now, have taken well over 100 pictures and it still registers as a full battery!  My Nikon and Canon would have their battery's already charged.  Like the fact that I don't have to take out the batteries to charge.  Just set it in the charging station.  You can't go wrong with this one!
