This seems to be a pretty common problem with this unit. I should have done a proper research prior to my purchase, I did not buy from Amazon just to clarify.  I bought it at S##'s Club for $899 in 2011 it only lasted less than three years and yes I did not buy the five year ext warranty. The screen only comes on for a few seconds when the screen saver button is pushed.  The research for the fix has not been succesful, ? Need to change an inverter board or a number of capacitors more than likely will require professional repair. Do a search on this monitor and you will see the problems.BUYER BEWARE!!! And if you do buy it get the longest ext warranty possible it will certainly be worth it. Aside from that when it was working it worked like a charm.
