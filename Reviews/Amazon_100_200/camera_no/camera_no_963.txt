My Coolpix 8800 with the image stabilization and zoom is a real pleasure to use. I just wish somebody had pointed one thing out to me.  When I finally got my computer upgraded to handle large files, and tried some camera raw files, the Nikon PictureProject reported the raw (.nef) file was un supported.When I went to the Nikon web site which listed an update to process raw files, it asked for my camera serial number. It then rejected the number with a message that I might have a camera that wasn't a Nikon US camera, and cancelled the download.I'm not sure how this could be avoided, but recommend that any purchaser of a Nikon camera register it immediately while they can send it back for a refund if it doesn't meet Nikon US requirements. I still like the Nikon cameras and lenses, but I will point out this problem to anyone asking how I like my camera.
