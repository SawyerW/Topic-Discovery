This product takes great quality pictures but the camara internal software is spotty.Some times it will work with a USB, most times it will not. Very frustrating. After 6 months the USB features was not working & it started creating errors on all computers I tried it with. Their Technical support was nice but could not flash the camara or give me a software download, that was very disappointing.A driver disk should of come with the unit.They do not even have one. I will not purchase another product from Olympus due to the low tech answers & not being able to fix the problem.
