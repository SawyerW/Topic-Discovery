This camera, while small and easy to bring along anywhere, takes very blurry pictures at least half of the time.  I've been disappointed so many times, thinking that I have some really cute pictures, only to find once I download them that they are blurry.  I have to say I am very disappointed.  If there is even the slightest movement, the picture is blurry.  I have contacted Sony and plan on returning the camera to see if there is something they can do to fix it since it is still under warranty.  Buy a different camera - especially if you have young children, as I do, and pictures are too precious to waste.
