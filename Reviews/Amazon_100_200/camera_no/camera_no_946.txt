It is barely larger than a credit card and about 1.5 inch thick. It is a metal case but it is very light weight. Picture quality is good and the shutter response time is reasonable in normal light condition. The product description here is incorrect about the movie mode. It can record movie with audio. The quality is good but it is in QuickTime format. That means you cannot play it with Microsoft media player. It is a little inconvenient. But the quicktime file (.mov) is a lot smaller than the microsoft video clip format (.avi). A file of 30 second clip with medium quality is only about 9M. The software comes with the camera is not very useful. The file transfer using this software is slow. I usually pull out the SD card and copy the file to the computer using a card reader.
