I bought this camera on 9/21 and already the viewer through the LCD screen is broken.Can I take pics? Yes. I just can't view them on the screen before I take them anymore.Not that I really want to keep any of these pics. I know it's a cheap camera but the amount of white flecks on the jpgs I do get is ridiculous. No matter how still I am, they are almost always grainy and blurry.The only way I can clear them is by shrinking them five times smaller and working the levels in photoshop.Honnestly, this is the most regretable purchase that I ever made.
