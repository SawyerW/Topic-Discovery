There are fancier camperas with more features. There are slicker-looking cameras. They are all big. This camera can hide under a credit card yet it takes fabulous pix and even avi video. The software is even adequate for manipulating photos although an Adobe Photo package makes this camera come to life. Load it up with memory, crank the resolution and sharpness to max and go on a shooting spree with this camera. I used one for five days including video shoots, playback and lots of start/stop and the battery still shows a full charge. It's simply amazing for its size. Yes there are better cameras which cost more and are the size of a Nikon F3 but for a tiny camera, this one rocks.
