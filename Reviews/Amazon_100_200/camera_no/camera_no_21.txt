YOU WANT THIS.After you've read the Nikon book (if you can actually get through it), and after you've read whatever manual or Field Guide you purchase in addition -- Magic Lantern, Thomas, whoever, you'll want to have this with you.It fits in your pocket, it fits in your camera bag, it fits in your vest.  It lets you know where every function is on the menus and on the camera.  YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ALL THIS and you can't carry the Field Guides out in the field.Come on People, its not that pricey.  You spent thousands on your camera and lenses -- this thing helps.
