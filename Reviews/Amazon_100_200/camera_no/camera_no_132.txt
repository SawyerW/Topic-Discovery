I was looking for a camera to take better pictures of my daughter, who is only 5 months old and has a hard time staying still.  Wanted  a fast camera but not a DSLR.  I can tell you that this camera is almost as fast as a DSLR, and has a ton of manual controls to allow for fine adjustment.  I was basically a P&S; guy, but the camera is so intuitive that I am having fun learning the manual controls and am taking much better pictures as a result.  I also looked at the Canon G6 (I was also a big Canon fan), but the camera is too slow for my needs.  I am VERY happy with this purchase!
