I needed a small shirtpocket camera and was looking at Canon, Casio and Nikon cameras at the local Wal Mart.  I came across an ad for the Olympus Stylus 770SW.  While I was on the internet looking at the 770SW I saw the Olympus Stylus 750; it appeared to be just what I was looking for--it is an all weather camera with 5X zoom, and CCD shift image stabilization as opposed to the phony digital image stabilization.  It takes outstanding pictures, the image stabilization works great.  The 5X optical zoom (180mm equivalent) and macro mode takes great pictures of butterflies, flowers, etc., with very little cropping required.  The only drawback is viewing with the LCD; it is very difficult to use in direct sunlight.  I would much rather have a viewfinder, but, I guess they have to eliminate the viewfinder to keep the camera small.
