My first Digital SLR, and I love it.  I've had it for about 3 months, quickly switching from my Elan 7E film body to this.  I have numerous "nice" Canon lenses, all of which have worked wonderfully with this camera.  My Top Points:1. Autofocus - incredibly fast.  Very accurate.  I've read some people have had issues with back focusing, but I must be lucky, as mine is perfect.2. Start up speed - .2 seconds claims Canon - instantaneous for all intents.  I haven't missed a shot yet, althought I leave it turned on, and allow it to auto-sleep after a minute - wakes up quickly with a half-press of the shutter3. Construction - Body is extremely strong - feels solid and well manufactured.4. Shutter Speed - no other Digital SLR rivals the 20D's speed for the money.I have shot about 8,000 pictures since getting mine - weekends quickly accumulate 500-1000 photos.  The controls are well laid out, easy to learn and quick to navigate, even in the dark.No complaints here - only praises.
