My perfect camera has to do two things very well.  First, it has to deliver superior results.  Second, it has to be portable.  I think this Olympus C-7000 comes the closest to perfect and this is the one that I bought.For superior results I thought I wanted a dSLR, but after handling one I realized I wouldn't often want to take something that large and vulnerable with me.The Canon G6 and S70 are the only other cameras that I took any serious interest in.  The G6 was tempting but still a little thick (especially the grip bump).  The S70 was tempting too, but still longer than the C-7000.Neither Canons offer as much zoom as the C-7000 (5x optical), though they both offer a wider angle.I gave only four stars because I still wonder how it compares to the G6 in light gathering ability.  Maybe I'll upgrade it to five stars once I settle that issue.I was determined to buy a Canon or a Nikon.  I had no thought toward buying an Olympus.  This camera impressed me enough that now Olympus has a new customer.  Nice job Olympus.
