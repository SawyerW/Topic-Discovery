This is my first digital so I'm no expert, but I've had nothing but trouble-free fun with this puppy since August. My wife and I took it on a cruise to Alaska and all our friends have complemented us on the pictures we took using the A70. The all-automatic setting makes pictures totally easy for the novice and the manual settings allow you to experiment. The user manual is pretty good at explaining basic operation and features and the free software helps you get your shots on your computer for editing and uploads.Only two complaints: the visual display is very hard to see in daylight (use the old fashion viewfinder) and be sure you get rechargeable batteries. That huge sucking sound you hear is the power draining out of your alkalines.
