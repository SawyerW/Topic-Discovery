I found this camera to be a good starter to shooting with an SLR camera. I like amount of control and customization it has to offer along with a variety of shooting mode options (landscape, portrait, night, macro etc.). The 4/3rds system is a plus as well, as you can buy smaller lenses which comes in handy for traveling.As I said, this is a good beginner camera for the price. However, as I have started learning more and taking more pictures, I have found myself wanting to upgrade to a higher quality camera. If you are a low-light photographer, this may not be the right choice. I have noticed the quality is not as sharp and there tends to be a lot of noise in low-light conditions. However, when taking daylight/landscape photos, this camera can be really great.Overall, good quality camera for the price.
