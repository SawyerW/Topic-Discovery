I have had my wilife system for a year now. I have had one camera burn out. We have a lot of thunderstorms and power surges, but the two cameras I have now have lasted through a lot of bad weather, one for a year and one 9 months. They upgraded the software recently and I had a time when I did not get alerts, but I changed the sensitivity on the cameras and now I am getting them again. This system has been so user friendly that I bought two more cameras today. I wish I could figure out how to view my cameras with a Iphone/Touch/Ipad. Overall two thumbs up.
