I purchased this for my wife and I in an attempt to capture better pictures of our young 1 year old boy.The camera is very easy to use and coupled with research on sites such as [...] we are learning more and more.the 18-135 lens has a great range and is very good for our day to day photography.  Of course I already have a couple more lens in mind that I would love to get next!We also purchased an sb-600 flash which makes a huge difference indoors.This camera kit is great and very useful and I am happy I got this one over the 18-55 kit.
