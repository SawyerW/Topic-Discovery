Our first digital camera...& what a great choice we made.  This megapixel technology is phenomenal...enlargements are so clear..I can't underscore the quality enough.  I am certainly not a technical/electronic person...& prefer simpler gadgets to those that are over infused with a gazillion bells & whistles..but this I can use. It's not fussy & annoying to work with.  I thought it would be heavy..but it's not...it sits very comfortably in my hand.  On the other hand...this camera has it's faults!When taking pictures in dim or lighting darker than daylight...this camera really struggles ...& is quite sluggish.  The built in flash takes so long to go off...the camera takes so long to focus...that by the time the camera is ready...quite frankly you've lost the shot.  Also the camera is slow in getting from one shot to another...the delay in between is exasperating!  Overall I don't recommend this camera unless you plan to primarily shoot in daylight which it works great in....or you plan to purchase an additional flash for evening shots...which is what I'm going to have to do.
