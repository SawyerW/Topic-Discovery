This is my first digital camera and I am extremely proficient with computers and the Internet, even so I was amazed at all the things that this camera can do.  You can go from just taking it out of the box to taking really great pictures and it's fairly fool proof.  It does use quite a lot of batteries and I will need to buy a larger SmartMedia card, especially since we go on a lot of trips.  That said, I couldn't be happier with it, it is possibly the best present anyone has ever given me! And the software is just amazing, it has great possibilities that I am just now beginning to discover!
