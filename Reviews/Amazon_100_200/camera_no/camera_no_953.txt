As the owner of a bigger, more complicated digital camera for "serious" photography, I purchased this camera to bring along with me in my pocket to parties, happy hours, etc.  BIG MISTAKE.  This camera will not focus AT ALL in low light.  I sent it back for exchange, thinking I had a lemon, and received a replacement that was just as bad.  I called the manufacturer to complain, and was told "a camera at this price has limitations."  Like being unable to focus?!?!  I would expect this from a cheesey, no-name brand, but not from Konica Minolta (who now, in my opinion, rank with the cheesey no-name brands).
