This camera is amazing.  After using a sipix 2.1 and a very expensive Nikon 995 I'm glad to say this is probably the best camera you can get for the price.  The picture quality is great.  It is a very easy camera to use even if you've never used digital before.  CompactFlash memory is great and cheap.  I do wish they gave at least a 32 meg card though instead of the 16 meg card.  The software included is easy to use and has a lot of cool features to add to your pictures.  The ability to shoot short video is also great.  Although you will probably need a bigger memory card if you plan on doing this.  The LCD display is very clear and the red eye feature is very cool a lot of other digital cameras don't have.  If you are looking for a great digital camera at a reasonable price go with this one.  I looked into many other cameras before deciding on this one and can say this is probably the best thing you can get for just casual picture taking.
