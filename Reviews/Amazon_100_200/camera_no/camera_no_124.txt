This was not a cheap camera.  We paid over $200.00 for it, trusting the Sony name for quality.  First of all the buttons are very small so if you have larger fingers, you may not like the controls.  Secondly, it does not take the photos as quick as a digital of this caliber should, often photos turned out blurry.  Additionally, our camera broke while still under warranty, we had to pay to have it shipped to a service center and were required to add insurance and only use UPS shipping, all of which cost over $15.00.  The camera was returned to us and worked for about a month and then the same problem happened, however this time it was not under warranty and Sony would not cover the repair unless we paid $112.00 for the repair service, plus additional shipping.What a waste of money this purchase was!
