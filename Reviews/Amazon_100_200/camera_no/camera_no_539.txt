I have now had this camera for 2 years. The quality of the photos is usually excellent, and you can set the ISO to 800 and take pics without the flash in dark places. Or so I thought until the other night when several vital pictures I really needed for a blog came out with lines across them. I went to Steve's Forums and sure enough, this is a common problem with the processor on this camera, even though apparently Fuji will deny this 'till its dying day. I've also started having some problems with the telescoping lens and fussiness with the on/off switch.You'll be really happy for a while with this camera, but then it will break.I expect any camera to last for more than 2 years. I will certainly NOT make my next camera a Fuji.
