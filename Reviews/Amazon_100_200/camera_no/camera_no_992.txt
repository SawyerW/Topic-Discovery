I bought this because I wanted a simple, easy camera for vacation photos, but was pleasantly surprised by how great the pictures were!  It is simple to use, takes really great pictures, and everyone loves the photos from it.  The quality is good, it's small, portable and easy.  Lots of editing options to improve the photo on the camera, and photos are easy to upload to Internet.  Much better than my old digital camera!!!  My new favorite as it makes me seem like a better photographer than I am.  I haven't used it for video, and the battery life seems fine.
