These cameras provide excellent performance for the price. While they are not high-resolution cameras, they still provide an excellent image. The zoom, while helpful in some instances, is only a "digital zoom" that essentially enlarges a portion of the full image, while losing resolution. Still, for the money you can't beat the technology.The tilt/pan function is fabulous. The units can have up to eight preset camera views that can be accessed by a single click. Those views are extremely easy to set up and use. The camera reaction time and movement are quite good. The ability to simply click on a portion of the viewed image and re-center the camera on that spot is very user-friendly.The IP setup could have been more clearly explained in the documentation, as well as some hints on how to monitor remotely.
