I have the Canon Digital Rebel SLR for use in all of my performance shots.  However it's terrible for vacations where hiking, biking, or activites are involved.  In comes the Optio.  #1 on my feature list when looking for a second camera was size.  The Optio will fit in a tin of Altoids.  Second I wanted a good lens, optical and digital zoom, and simple menu navigation.  Check, check, check.  I was also surprised to find that the Optio had an LCD screen that rivals some of the larger SLR camera's.  This camera is absolutely perfect for the activities that I take it on.  You won't be dissapointed.
