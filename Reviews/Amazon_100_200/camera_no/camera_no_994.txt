Bought the Fujifilm Finepix J38 camera for myself (non professional) just in time for Thanksgiving & Christmas.  My previous camera was a HP digital, older model.  It had great quality pix, but was a bit large, and also ate AA batteries for breakfast.  Was time for an upgrade.  I still have a Fuji 35mm camera (non digital), purchased early 90's.  Still works great so sticking with quality company. I'm enjoying the camera.Easy to use.Nice and small, fits the pocket inside my purse.Easy to upload pictures to my computer (or straight to [...])Picture quality seems pretty good, lighting/flash works well automatically.Fully charged the battery once before Thanksgiving and it's still going (January).Great little point-and-shoot of camera.Easy to preview and review stored photos.Haven't tried anything fancy with settings or video yet, but very pleased so far.
