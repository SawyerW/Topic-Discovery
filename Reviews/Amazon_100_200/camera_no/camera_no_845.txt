My Second Digital Camera, I just love it.I am not a professional but the pictures I take with this camera makes me look like a like a professional. The pictures I take are very sharp and no adjustments are needed when you download the pictures,unless you feel you have too. It's very easy to operate,just leave on AUTO if you want too,the batteries last a very long time,(keep a spair set)there is no battery use indication.Just a warning to change the batteries.I discover more and more operating features all the time. You just can't beat this camera. It's small,well balanced ,feels confortable also.Check this baby out! My last camera cost [a lot], but when I downloaded the picture's,I had to adjust every picture to make a decent print.
