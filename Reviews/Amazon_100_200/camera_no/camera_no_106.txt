An excellent out of the box camera that provides clear sharp pictures at a very affordable price. The software included wasn't used since I prefer to use San Disk readers rather than the included factory software.Almost impossible to beat the quality to value pricing for this camera with features you'd see in cameras costing $100 or more than the base price of this one.The only drawbacks I found were the delay in the shutter time which makes it very hard to keep steady long enough to allow the camera time for the auto focus mode to kick in. To resolve this I had to get a tripod.The next drawback is the size and shape of the camera. While it can and will easily fit into any size camera bag it is a little difficult to hold even for small hands and the shape of it is a little bulky in the front to back measurements making it awkward without a fixed base as your holding platform.Other than that though, it truly is one incredible camera that will deliver sharp crystal clear pictures in almost any type of setting or light.
