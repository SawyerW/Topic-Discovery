This is my first DSLR.  I bought this and the Canon XSI at the same time and tried them both for a week.  To make a long story short, I returned the XSI and kept the E520.  It was just easier to take good pictures indoors, which is where I do most of my shooting.  The Canon took more effort to produce good pictures.  Plus I liked the interface of the Olympus more.The XSI has a better viewfinder and a slightly better autofocus system but the Olympus image quality won me over in the end.  Its white balance and exposure was just easier to get right than the Canon.The key is to purchase a camera that you will use and the Olympus does that for me.
