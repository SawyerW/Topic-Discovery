If you are looking for a great digital camera with great features, this is the one.  This camera take awesome pictures and has more features than I know what to do with.  What I liked most about this camera is that it can be completley manaul and completley automatic.  This camera has all the features you will ever need and produces awesome pictures.  The only think I don't like about the camera is that it does not come with a rechargeable battery.  But this problem is easily solved if you buy the Canon battery pack.  All in all a great camera for a great price.
