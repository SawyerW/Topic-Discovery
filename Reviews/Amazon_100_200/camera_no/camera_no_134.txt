This is my 2nd digital camera and after a month I am very pleased.  It is the fastest for its category and it still fits in a coat pocket.  Yet it has many advanced features you don't find on a small camera.  If you are shooting wildlife, action or small kids, nothing beats a camera that starts fast and responds quickly to shutter release.  The add on lense feature is also well thought out and since you have a hot shoe you don't have to worry about the small flash on the camera being hidden by the add on flash.  Two types of memory card allows you to use one for stills and one for video or backup stills.  Good design and lightweight
