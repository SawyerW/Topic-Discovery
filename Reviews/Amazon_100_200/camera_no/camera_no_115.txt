I just bought this camera and am extremely happy with it.  I have already had the chance to use it under different lighting and it works great with the preset functions.  I also bought the sports pack and am absolutely thrilled with it.  I took it skiing on the weekend and the camera was perfectly safe.  In summer I can take it to the beach and not worry about getting sand or water in it.When I used it in the snow I used the preset "Snow Function" and the pictures were amazing.  It really contrasts the individuals from the extremely bright backgound.In all, a great camera the size of a candy bar.
