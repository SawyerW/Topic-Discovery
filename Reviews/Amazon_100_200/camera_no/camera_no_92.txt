First, Olympus as a company does not sell any of the verves cameras at a seprate price structure.  The Prices venders pay for the cameras are exactly the same, so if you see different prices for different colors then the vendor is setting those prices.  Just look at Amazon every color is the same price.  As far as bad picture issues my Verve is great!  The pictures are awesome and look really good on the LCD screen.  Compaired to some of these small LCD screen cameras, I can see everything in great detail.  I really dont se how you could take a bad picture with this camera.  Plus, as far as awkwardness, I find the camera very easy to use.  I can take a picture and zoom in and out and switch between movie picture and play back modes with one hand!  Im again dont understand how it could be awkward when everything is so easy.
