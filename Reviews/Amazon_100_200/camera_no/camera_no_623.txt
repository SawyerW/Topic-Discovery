A decent enough camera with two things that will bug you.  My old easyshare camera came with an RCA cable that plugged into the camera's tiny USB out.  this made for easy viewing on any TV.  The C813 does not and I don't think any of the new Easyshares do. Even if you take the cable from an older model and plug it into the C813's USB out, nothing happens.The other thing that bugs me about this camera is no speaker for playback of videos,  Maybe I've just been lucky, but all my old cameras had a speaker (if they shot vids).
