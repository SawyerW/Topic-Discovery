This was the first purchase that I have made through Amazon.com and I coult be more pleased. I the kind of person who comparison shops before making a purchase to be sure that I have the best deal. I normally came to Amazon for descriptions of pricing but never to buy. Well this time around they had the best price overall and I mean overall. Im in the military and live in Hawaii. So alot of companies charge like crazy for S&H.; Not only was there price cheaper then our Military Store by $130...I also got FREE S&H; to Hawaii. This camera will need a better Flash on low lighting situations indoor.
