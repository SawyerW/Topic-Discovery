The Coolpix 2000 is a easy-to-use digital camera with two important features: 3x optical zoom and great picture quality.  However, it lacks an optical viewfinder, so you must use the LCD screen to shoot pictures -- which is awkward and annoying. I thought this problem was gone on all but the cheapest DCs.  Guess not. Also, the CompactFlash memory card is hard to remove. Another problem is that the path to deleting photos is a little confusing at first. Be FOREWARNED: Battery life is the worst I've ever seen, and this is the third digital camera I'ved owned and about the sixth or seventh that I've operated on a regular basis. It's a good camera to keep in the car for emergencies or to use for work.  If you're serious about digital photograpy, though, spend a little extra on a [more expensive camera]. You'll be happy you did. My wife owns a 2300 and I bought this, so I'm a bit disappointed.
