I bought this product expecting to see a drop in quality - it was part of a system to connect a PC and a HD video camera system to a projector on another side of a gymnasium/multi-purpose room. To say it worked well is an understatement - we are running through 100 feet of cat-5e cable and the picture looks every bit as good as connecting the projector directly to the machine using a VGA cable. I am totally impressed with the ease of set-up, quality of the balun (it even comes with velcro to mount it), and quality of the image transfer.As a result, I am buying another set of baluns to allow presenters to use their own laptops on-stage but tie into our audio-video booth on the back side of an auditorium.
