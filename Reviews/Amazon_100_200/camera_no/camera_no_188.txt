My first camera was stolen just a few months after purchasing it, so I decided to re-buy the same camera because I loved it so much. It not only looks great, but the size is perfect yet still has a huge screen for clear image viewing. There are more options than I need or find myself using, but they are easy to access and play around with. I use a 2GB SD Memory card and on the highest image quality setting, can still fit several hundred pictures and video on the card. That brings up the video...the video quality is definitely not that of a digital camcorder, but I am very impressed with it. The sound isn't the best quality, but it serves its purpose. I highly recommend this camera!!
