I agree with everyone else - this camera is awesome. the only thing i have to add is that if you are clumsy like me, and drop it with the lens open, it will break. (i'm sure this is the case with any digital camera....) the lens will turn slightly enough so it doesnt open/close properly...it kinda slowly malfunctions... it wont focus etc. if you have a canon warranty they will fix it. this has happened to me, my father and another family member that had the camera. just dont be clumsy and youre all set!like i said... AWESOME camera. quality is amazing, and 3.2 megapixels is plenty.
