I owned the D30 before this camera, which I loved and had no problems with.  I upgraded to the 20D and enjoy the speed, but pictures using the internal flash are often underexposed.  There are many discussions on the Internet about this problem.  Some people have exchanged the cameras several times before getting a good one, others argue it's a pro-level camera where the user should manually adjust everything first (why have an automatic mode then?).I'm not a pro and just want a fast camera with interchangeable lenses that works well in automatic (and P-mode).  I don't want to have to fiddle with a bunch of settings just to get a good flash shot.I wish Canon would address this issue (perhaps something to do with the DIGIC processor?).
