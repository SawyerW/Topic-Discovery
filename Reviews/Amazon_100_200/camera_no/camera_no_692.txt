I looked at Canon XSI/XTI and Nikon 60D and decided to go with Olympus.  And I am very happy with my decision.The body is light, the pictures are sharp.  AF is very good.  When I showed the pictures to my friends who owned Canon and Nikon, they kept asking me if I improved the pictures on photoshop or not.  I told them no and they didn't believe me.The battery lasted very long.  I took hundreds of pictures so far in the last month and I have only recharged my camera once.3.5 fps is pretty decent.  The only minor complaint is that AF is a bit slow in low light situation, but it is no big deal for me.Overall, this is the best entry level DSLR in the market.
