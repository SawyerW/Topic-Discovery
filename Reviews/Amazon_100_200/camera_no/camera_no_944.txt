I have had my Nikon D70 for just over 4 years now, and yes it is my first digital camera.  Yes I still shoot film.  Just yesterday I shot 9+ hours with this camera on one battery!  My wife's D3100, dead after 7 hours.  My sister in law's Cannon Rebel, dead after 7.5 hours.  I was still shooting.  This camera is a work horse.  Drop it, smack it, treat it like a Nikon, it can handle it.  It does not have all the bells and whistles of the newer models.  It only shoots 1.5 frames a second.  It's review screen is really small.  It only takes CF cards. It is heavy, which I like.  The ISO only goes up to 1600.  It processes photos really slow.  So for all the negatives, I still love it.  When I upgrade, I want to keep it as a back up or for someone who wants to get into photography.
