I got this camera about 6 months ago for my birthday and it seemed pretty cool at first. After a few weeks though it said that, "Head cleaning," was requiered of it, so I bought a cleaning tape and used it whenever it said to, but the problem was that after 5 minutes of using it said to use it again. This is still happening with it, and unfortunatley makes the video appear choppy and with res. lines through it. Also I use it to film skate videos, and it isnt the best camera for that becuase it cannot support a normal fisheye lense that is a 37mm. Also it does not have the best video quality, and often eats the tape if its not charged all the way. Although it is certinatly a low end of the line camcordere, I expected more from it. I would go with something smaller, and perhaps (more expensive) for a good camcorder.
