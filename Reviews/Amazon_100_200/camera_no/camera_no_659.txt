September 17, 2010 is when I  purchased the IP cam. the software that comes with it has just OKAY but, the Tech support was second to none ! Most of them speak english and are very helpful!! I Loved the support soo much I bought a Trendnet Router.It is now 8/19/2013  and the cam is STILL up and working just as good as it was 3 years ago. I love how you can watch, listen and talk through your I-phone. I would have to say on a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 20 +++++TRENDnet SecurView Wireless Day/Night Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance Camera TV-IP422W (White)
