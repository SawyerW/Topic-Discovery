At the time this review is written, Powershot A70 is the best digital camera someone can get for this amount of money. After doing some research, by comparing to other digital cameras at the same price, the choice was easy . A70 outstands them all. The image quality is very good for 3.2 mpixels, the manual mode is excellent for such a cheap camera, and it is possible to use extra lenses from Canon. The only problem is the Red eye effect which is quite intense with this camera. This is not very important of course because it can be corrected with the use of software. Another drawback is the use of 4 batteries, where other 3.2 mpixel cameras use 2 batteries. Last but not least the flashcard included is way too small and the purchase of a bigger one is mandatory.In a few words :Pros : good quality, excellent manual mode, excellent video modeCons: Intense redeye, small flashcard, 4 batteries required.I highly recommend this one, it's a great buy.
