I spent a long time trying to find a decent but affordable wireless camera to use outside in our barn. After reading multiple reviews I settled on the IP422W, not knowing what to expect. I am completely amazed. The camera is located 125 feet from my router, outside in a barn. The setup was easy, I gave it a static IP address. The picture is very good and the infrared at night is spooky and clear. It is very easy to control and responsive. I was able to set up internet access outside of my router using [...] using port :8080. The sound at first is the only downside since when there is silence you only hear static, but any sounds do come through loud and clear without the static. You can also talk to the camera by attaching a speaker, and use it as an intercomm  if someone is near it. The price is incredible for all of the things this camera does. I have been using it for 4 days without a single disconnect.Review Update: Disabled Indication LED, UPnP and Bonjour in the setup menus and I never have a disconnect.
