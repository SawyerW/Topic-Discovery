I recently purchased a Canon T3 - an upgrade to my original Digital Rebel.Bought this title based on the 5-star reviews here.I was a bit skeptical when I read in the first paragraph of Powering Up/Setting Date and Time:Rotate the On/Off switch on top of the camera to the On position. "Automatic sensor cleaning takes place (unless you specifically disable this action) as the T3 powers up."As the Canon salesman pointed out to me - the T3 does NOT have any automatic sensor cleaning!Back in Chapter 13 he posts the correct info:"The EOS T3 lacks one of the most common features found in all Canon cameras other than a stray entry-level model or two like this one: automatic sensor cleaning."I'm thinking this was a copy/paste of the T3i or T2i with editing done.  I wonder what else I will find amiss.He also fails to mention that to get to a lot of the camera settings via the menu, the mode must be set to M.But, all in all, I suppose I will actually learn how to use my DSLR on other than the creative or auto modes.
