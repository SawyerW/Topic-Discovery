I was looking for a small good quality digital camera for around $300. I wasn't sure whether to get the canon a70 or the Kodak EasyShare DX6340. I read reviews anywhere i could. I saw some pretty discouraging reviews of the canon. Although, i liked the size and the layout. I also heard from friends and family that i should definitly go with the canon. That the lense was crystal over kodaks glass. I'm very glad that i chose the canon. It takes amazing pictures and i couldnt be happier! I strongly recommend the canon a70 to anyone looking for a great little camera.
