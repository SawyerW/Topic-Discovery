I thought it looked cool and would give it a shot despite others negative reviews.  Boy did I regret it, the camera is broken right out of the box!  When I take pictures it doesn't even flash, following the instructions and a full battery charge, which results in blurry dark and grainy pictures even outside in the sun!  When I set it to 'flash when taking a picture' mode, the lcd screen keeps turning on and off as if the capacitor from the 'flash'light is draining all the life out of the camera!  And it quits responding!Also, the software doesn't work.  I can't even use it as a pc camera, shame.I have lots of experience with high tech equipment and a masters in electronics engineering, so I know what I'm doing.  I'm not a noob in handling a simple camera.  I have tossed it in the trash and considered it a lesson learnt.
