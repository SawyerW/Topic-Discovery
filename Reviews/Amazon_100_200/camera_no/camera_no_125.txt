I got this sony camera for Christmas after my finepix fujifilm camera broke. The sony definately has more options (landscapes, night shots, black & white, etc) and the video quality on this camera is awesome. Also has sound with the video and unlimited video depending on how much memory space you have. Only drawbacks are that you cant zoom in and out once in video mode and also for some reason, I find that alot of the pictures come out blurry, especially when there's any movement. The fujii tends to take better daytime pictures overall, even though it is only a 3.2 megapixel camera, but the sony takes better night pictures. Anyway I guess the biggest drawback is price. This sony camera is over $200. I'm looking into getting a sony digital camcorder next but those are even more expensive. However, I will be getting mine for free via freepay. If you're interested in getting one free, check out this website, they have free digital cameras too!: [...]
