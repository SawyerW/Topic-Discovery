Well, this is my 3rd digital camera, and my second Sony. I recently sold my Canon SD110, which was an excellent camera but I needed the $$$. This camera I wanted it to be an upgrade, so I went from a 3.2 to a 4 megapixel camera. I am very happy so far.Probably the biggest selling point is the SIZE, Wow! My Canon was a bit thinner, but this is smaller and with more megapixels for 25$ less than my Canon when I bought it new.For me, Canon and Sony are in a dead heat when it comes to consumer friendly/amateur/high resolution/amazingly compact cameras. Canon has a bit of a technical edge because they seem to have more features and better photo quality (probably not discernable to the naked eye). But Sony has the technical edge on simplicity and size. You decide which is best, but both brands are excellent.I am happy so far, and I highly recommend this camera. If you want great, high resolution photos, with a metal encased camera the size of a chubby snickers bar(just shorter) for about two-fifty$, then this is the camera for you.
