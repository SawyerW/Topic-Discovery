While the features and ease of use may be good on the A70, the overall quality and durabilty is VERY POOR.  My camera developed a fuzzy spot (presumed inside the sealed lens) that appears at the top corner of every photo.  A panel on the body also has begun to loosen, even though the camera has always been cased, and never mishandled.In reading other complaints and problems in this forum, it seems that Canon sees users of its consumer cameras as idiots, who will gleefully send these cameras back to the factory and pay a further $150 (plus shipping) for a refurbished replacement.I suggest you purchase a higher-quality brand (Nikon, Leica), and leave Canon to sort out its obvious Quality Control problems on other, less-informed consumers.
