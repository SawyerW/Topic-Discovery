Our other digital camera (panasonic FZ) was stolen and I wanted to get another camera as a replacement.  The FZ was way to bulky for me to take out on my job so I wanted something a little smaller but with decent zoom capabilities.  The Olympus 750 has hit the mark dead on.  With its CCD shift stabililation the shots come out perfect everytime.  The zoom works nicely and with the digital zoom you can really get some good shots from far away.  The only complaint I have with the camera is that if you are out in sunlight it is very difficult to see the LCD.  You just have to point and shoot and hope you got the shot.  I have taken pics in the sport mode and have gotten some excellent action shots.  The on screen menu is very good.  Definately a keeper by a long shot.
