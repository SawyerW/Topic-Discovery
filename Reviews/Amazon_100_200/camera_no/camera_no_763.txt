I would highly recommend playing around with this camera in a shop before ordering online. ...but when I received it, I found a lot of defects that finally made me return the camera for a refund.It started with the weird design of the On/Off buttons. It was so tight that I broke my nail trying to turn it around. I tried some recording with zooms, and the time taken for the camera to focus sharp on a zoomed object was slow enough to blur the zoomed object. The camera is light, but the shape is weird with a pointing lens. When I switched to playback mode to review my recording, it took me 3 minutes for the 2 minute recording to rewind to the beginning of the tape...
