Sorry to inform all of the final death of film photograhy.  Finally, a full featured digital SLR that makes no compromises is available for the consumer market. The camera is amazingly fast, works in the dark, has a great integrated flash, is easy to use, has a battery that lasts for days, and is fully compatible with all nikon AF lenses. Not only that, it takes pictures that will shame the 150 year old chemical film process into oblivion. I own a nikon 5700 and I am happy to report that this camera simply blows it, or anything else in the market at any price, away. Thank you Nikon, this is the digital camera all photo buffs have been waiting for!
