this is a great camera!  i'll be honest, i did alot of research and did find that certain comparable models made by cannon have a little more crispness when all the way zoomed in on the digital image, but personally, i trust nikon as a brand more than cannon.  mostly its because the nikon uses the standard F-mount, so even my nearly 30 year old pro lenses that were originally purchased to work on a nikon f2 WORK with this camera!  yes, they dont auto-focus or use all the built-in features of the newer computerized lenses, but they work manually as they did on my f2.  cannon is only apparently compatible with the newer computerized AF lenses.in the end, i hightly recommend this camera.  however, if you have a bunch of AF cannon lenses already, you're probably not reading this.  :D
