Though I have not learned how to use all the amazing features this camera has to offer, I am very pleased with the results so far!  It is a GREAT camera!!  So far I have taken some amazing professional like photos even though I am only an amature.  I have two small children and with my previous digital (point and shoot) camera, most of the 'action' photos came out blurry and it was very frustrating.  With this camera I have caught my children doing all kinds of things in action without the blurriness.  I could not be any happier with this camera!
