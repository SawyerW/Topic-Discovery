I've owned 9 or ten point and shut digital cameras including the best so fare the SONY F828 . So I will say this without trying to tare down Nikon's reputation.In quality of photos it is very comparable to the best , but my gosh !!! what happened  to quiet smooth auto zooming with this Nikon 8800 ? Terribly noisy and very slow.Next problem I had was almost immediate ; The micro-drive fits in very tight and the Flash card latch will not close properly and completely  if I want it to  use my micro drive with the Nikon 8800.It would also not transfer the photos and froze up my computer on the transfer attempt !!And I do own a very good computer, so it couldn't be my computer. And again I can only compare it to Sony F828 I own right now. In all fairness to Nikon ,they made great cameras in the past and they have a lot of other good ones out there today.So in final I would not recommend this one to some body woe wants a precision instrument, and a digital camera of this price range , should be just that !
