I recently purchased the Nikon D5100 and read the owners manual as diligently as I could, trying to figure out how to fully use all of the possible options this camera has to offer.  It becomes quite apparent that the Owners Manual simply isn't enough.I ordered this book and it arrived a couple of weeks ago, and it really opened my eyes as to what this camera is capable of.  Everything is set out in sensible chapters, shows and explains every mode available, and gives you a sense of empowerment over the camera, instead of bewilderment.If you are upgrading from a basic DSLR or taking a huge jump to this camera as a first DSLR, then this book is a must.  Without it, or something like it, then realizing the full potential of this camera could take a very long time, and be very frustrating.With my camera body I bought a very good lens.  I'm delighted I also bought this very good book.
