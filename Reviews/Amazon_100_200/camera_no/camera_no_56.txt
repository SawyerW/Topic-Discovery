I bought this camera and it broke 3 weeks later. I'm so glad I spent 6 bucks on the warranty and got my money back. Now i'll go out and buy a real camera. I was living in the dark ages and never bought a digital camera. I broke down on the morning that I was leaving for a weekend trip and headed around the corner to Radio Shack to zip in and oout with a new camera. This one SEEMED like it was exactly what I needed so I was satisfied at first. In and out in 10 minuted. I took it with me and was disgusted. Focus is terrible. God forbid you want to take an action picture or a picture with low light. All you'll get is a blurry, grainy mess. Anyway, one day I simply hit the power button to turn the camera off, and it completely froze, for good. Nothing. Took it back to Radio Shack, got my money back, and I'm gonna buy someting that's actually worth $300. Well, at least I got to use a camera that weekend for free. Don't buy this camera.
