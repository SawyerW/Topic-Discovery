awesome quality, excelent camera, and major stuff to learn about it, if you want a professional picture this is it !, although it is kinda overwhelming to learn(atleast in a hurry).this is by far, no point and shoot, like a credit card camera, there is allot of things you need to just sit down for a day and read the manual, otherwise your just going to get frustrated with yourself , and the pic wont come out like you want it too......... take your time, learn the cameras features, and it's a camera you will want to keep forever...... awesome job nikon, by far, superb !!!!!!!!!!
