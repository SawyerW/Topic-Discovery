After owning the Canon A-70 for a relatively few short weeks, I am extremely happy with it. I have had other cameras in the past. Olympus 35mm, with wide angle and zoom telephoto lenses, small point and shoot, etc. This camera has them all beat, and comes in such a small size that it was and still is hard for me to appreciate just how complex it could be, if I choose to take advantage of all functions.  Ten years ago, a camera with as much versatility, would have cost thousands of dollars. This is one heck of a buy and for $300.00 you really can't go wrong.
