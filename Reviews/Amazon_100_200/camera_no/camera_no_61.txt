My husband bought this camera about 3 months ago and we continue to love it...wow, what an improvement over our old Canon Digital Elph. The Casio is SO easy to use: I've never even looked at the manual. Admittedly, I still have a soft spot for my (aging) Oly C-2100UZ but of course it is not pocketable like this Casio. This little workhorse gets taken anywhere and everywhere and gets a lot of use!The Casio has a HUGE LCD and it feels very sturdy. It's incredibly responsive and just feels good! I'm happy with the picture quality (quite good for a subcompact) and I didn't realize how much I would like the cradle for recharging the camera. We bought an extra battery, and haven't even needed to use it yet!
