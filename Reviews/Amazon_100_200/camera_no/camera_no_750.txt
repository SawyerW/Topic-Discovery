I have been using the Olumpus E-10 and wanted a smaller camera, and the 3020 is perfect. It's MUCH less expensive, and when the settings and card are right, can hold many pictures. The only disappointment is the AA battery situation, but it's not too bad. I was very impressed with the clarity of the photos, even when printing out on my junky printer. Super easy to use, the five preset scene features work great, the Quicktime movie feature is a lot of fun (the video looks like circa 1970 home movies!). I love it. Lightweight, the automatic flash is great. If you are looking for a good all around camera for personal use, this is what you want.
