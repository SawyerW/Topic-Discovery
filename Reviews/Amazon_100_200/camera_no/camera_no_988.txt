I don't want to take my Nikon D-40 out all the time.  I tried the Nikon S-230 (same price and size) and took it back next day.  All I ask out of a $100 or so camera is that it at least be as good as my cell phone.  Got this one a good old Wal Mart.  Compared the same pictures I took quickly around the house with the little Nikon and this was noticeably better and I did not have the anti-shake option on.The menu system on this is the most user friendly of anything I tried.  I have not tried the video option nor care as I have a small HD camera.
