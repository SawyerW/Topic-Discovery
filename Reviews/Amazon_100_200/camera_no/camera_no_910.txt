do not buy this product. their software is full of bugs. customer service is a joke. bought active home software and it shuts down when clicking on certain things inside the program. bought iwatch mobile to view cams from smartphone, have had the software for 4 months and has only worked twice for a total of 5 mins., get message "server not found". they only have one level 2 tech for the whole company, level 1 techs cant seem to do anything but tell you how to plug the stuff in or email instructions to you, none of which help. you make an appointment with lvl 2 and wait a week, you get an hour, nothing gets solved, then you make another appointment for a week or two later, then repeat. been doing this for months. i dont know how they get away selling software that does not work, even the tech said it rarely works for him. buyer beware.
