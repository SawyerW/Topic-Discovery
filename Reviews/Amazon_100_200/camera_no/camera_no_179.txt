I am really enjoying my new Casio EX-S770. But i was kind ofwarned (helps reading other reviews) when i recieved this digital cameraduh!!!...the battery they mail you with this camera was a dead-battery!!!Litterly when charging camera w/battery it would blink red, red, red.Meaning it wasn't going to work at all.  So i went back on Amazon.comand purchased another brand of battery. When i received that batteryfor this Casio EX-S770...it worked! I am very pleased with the picturesi've taken, clear with no delay ..fast performance, great clear video andpritty good audio! I really do like Casio cameras, i've owned other older models...I was going to purchase the lastest newest Casio model(s)with the 3" inch screen but you're stuck in that one video mode of having to use U-TUBE when downloading your videos (all the lastest Casio digital cameras are stuck in U-TUBE mode)..WHY????I'm  hoping for this New Year 2009 Casio will think of their other loyal customers like me and revert or have a choice of making all their newest camera modelsNOT HAVING TO GO THRU the U-TUBE mode..now that would work perfectly!
