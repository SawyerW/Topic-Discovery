Perhaps I got a rare defective product, but it was annoying enough that I felt the need to write a review.* After 6 weeks, the replay mode stopped working.  I couldn't look at old pictures I had taken.  Furthermore, since the camera needs to be in replay mode to download pictures, I couldn't even get them onto my computer.  I sent the camera back for repair ($10+ shipping that Canon doesn't cover) and they repaired it in about 3 weeks.  Problem solved.  Or was it...* A month after that, horizontal lines started to appear on LCD, and also on the pictures I took.  Annoying, but I dealt with it.  Some pictures were so distorted, it looked like LSD rather than LCD.  After a while, the display would totally give out and remain black about 50% of the time.  The resulting pictures were also black.  I sent the camera in again for repair ($10+ shipping).  This time Canon fixed it and sent it back within a week.Canon gets halfway decent marks for doing the repairs smoothly, and the camera itself is great.  But as far as reliability, chalk this user's experience up in the lemon department.
