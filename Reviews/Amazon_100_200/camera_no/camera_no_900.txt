This is my first digital camera, but I have had experience with others that family members own. I did a lot of research to determine what I wanted out of a camera and the A70 had all the features I wanted. I have had it for about three weeks now and love it. The insrtuction manual isan easy read, so easy that when I was finished reading it I was taking pictures like a pro. The quality of the pictures is excellent. The options allow you to take pictures in all sorts of settings, and lighting. It's portability is awesome. I fit it into the lapel pocket of a jacket and it fit perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend this camera even though it is a bit pricy.
