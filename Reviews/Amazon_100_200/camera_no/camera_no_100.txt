I love the size of this camera. As someone with tiny hands, most camera's are too large or make my hands cramp up. This one did not.The flash seems quite good too. I was amazed at my photos. I have a black cat and a dark home and most pictures turn out horribly. Every photo of my cat taken with this, even in the darkest of corners, turned out bright as day with no wash out.Battery life is good too. Amazon delivered this so fast that my rechargeable batteries hadn't arrived yet and one pair of alkalines lasted me for 2-3 days of playing around and taking about 50+ experimental pictures.The only downside being your picture will come out blurry if your hands shake while trying to take a picture.
