This camera is my first DSLR after having had a number of Olympus P&S; cameras over the years.  I have larger hands, and this model was one of the few entry level DSLRs that I could grip comfortably.  Similarly priced Canon and Nikon models were simply too small for me.  The performance feels very snappy to me; I'm never waiting for the camera to do anything.  The in-camera image stabilization is great, as is the ability to configure the camera in so many different ways.  At times I am disappointed by the sharpness of the images I take, but that is a minor quibble.  I take so many pictures now, and still love this camera.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
