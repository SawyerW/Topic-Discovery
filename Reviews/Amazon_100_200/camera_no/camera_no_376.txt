I have used the D80 camera with the 18-135 lens kit that was a package when I bought it in Dec 2006. Not even 3 years and the lenses has malfunctioned. I was on vaction in Yellowstone and the camera does not focus anymore, so I ended up doing manual focusing. I knew it is the lens because I have 2 other G lenses from my old N65 and the camera focuses well when using the old lenses. Nikon only has a 1 year warranty on this. Otherwise, before the lenses broke it was a great camera. Nikon has very poor customer support.
