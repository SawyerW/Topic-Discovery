This camera though very similar to the Canon G6 comes out ahead in some aspects:1) Cool Sleek Black Body with a nice feel and made out of metal and plastic;2) Several Night shooting modes including a very nice laser hologram focus tool;3) Dual memory slots for CF and MS;4) This one is the killer: Full Screen VGA video (G6 does not even come close);5) Pictures are more detailed and sharper than G6.6) Great 2.5-inch LCD which auto-brightens in low light7) Full on high speed USB2.0. Canon G6 has the older slower USB 1.0.I have always found the Sonys to be more reliable than the Canons.. So as far as this one is concerened..I went for the Sony
