This camera is certainly worth the step up from the Rebel if you truly want to get serious about photography as a hobby.- The build of the case is superb- The ergonomics are excellent, it fits right into your hands and all of the buttons are easily and intuitively accessible while you aim at your subject.- Camera is large and heavy enough for heavy telephoto lenses, whereas the Rebel feels complete unbalanced- There are just the right number of wheels/buttons for controlling aperture, shutter speed, metering, and focus points.- unlike the new Rebel, there is an LCD display on top so that the big screen on the back does not have to turn on to show you the settings.I am recommending this camera over the rebel for build and ergonomic reasons.  If you are going to be taking lots of pictures and putting a lot of effort into them, then this next step is completely worth it.
