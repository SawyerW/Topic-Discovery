I was upgrading from a tiny 3.1 megapixel, credit card size, and liked the idea of a camera with a docking station. It takes minutes to download 50 ++ pictures. It is very, very easy to use. I have taken this small camera everywhere; Italy, Switzerland and France, and my own backyard.  This camera has made me a better photographer(see images). It has performed perfectly for me and the only assesory I've purchased is a bigger memory card (1 gig) for $29.00. It is so small, I keep it in my purse most of the time.Sure, you'll need a larger camera for telephoto, and wide angle but for the size, this packs a punch.BUY IT!  You will not be dissapointed.
