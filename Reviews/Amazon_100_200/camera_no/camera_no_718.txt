I did not have any problems loading the software like some of the people who posted reviews here.  As soon as I plug the camera into the usb port the Fuji software automatically downloads the pictures to their viewer software.  The pictures are very good quality.  On a epson 870 photo printer the results are excellent for a 4X6 print (I have not tried to print anything bigger).  It is not a replacement for a 35mm camera with a zoom.  I still use my Canon Sureshot 135 camera if I am shooting alot of pictures, like when I go on vacation, but if I only want to get some quick snapshots (which is most of the time) this is the camera I use.  I can only get 10 pictures on the 8meg smartmedia card at the highest quality setting.  I will probably get a 32meg or 64 meg card soon.
