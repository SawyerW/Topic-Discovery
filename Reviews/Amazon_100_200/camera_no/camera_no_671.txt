This camera is just about excellent. Its size and weight is very ideal, its built and design remarkable, and above all its performance and image quality is very good. And it's got loads of features(withn built-in IS too) that with patient exploring and tweeking, will give you results that's expected of a DSLR made by one of the finest names in the imaging industry. Plus, other than the kit lenses I got with it which aren't really bad, I got a lot more better Zuiko  lenses to look forward to for higher levels of photography. As it is right now, I am very much satisfied with its performance. I will highly recommend this to a fellow enthusiast who aims to reach higher grounds in the art of photography. And the price makes it all worth it. Very good camera...in fact, excellent!
