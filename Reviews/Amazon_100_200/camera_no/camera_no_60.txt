The Casio Exilim EXZ55 competes head to head with the Canon SD400 and SD450.Likes: The Casio zoom control is in a more convenient place than the Canon. It is right where my thumb wants it to be. The Canon zoom is on a ring around the shutter button and I feel like I'm going to drop the camera when I zoom out. The Casio battery life is almost three times as long as the Canon. So long that you should not worry if you forgot your spare battery. The Casio battery can be charged inside the camera using the docking station (the Canon battery must be removed from the camera to charge). The docking station is also a little more convenient than Canon's loose cable if you want to use USB to upload pictures.Dislikes: I think the Canon does a little better job in low light situations with no flash. The Casio images look a little "blocky" on close inspection. However, with flash, the Casio does a better job. The Casio has very even lighting (I think it has digital compensation to reduce dark corners.
