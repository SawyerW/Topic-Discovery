I've had my PowerShot A70 for about a year and a half and I love love love it! I bought it because I wanted a point and click camera that I could take anywhere. The photographs it produces are so much better than I expected from a camera in this price range. Pictures taken on the automatic settings come out well most of the time, and other options that can be set manually let you take perfect photos in trickier situations. Battery life is also good, and the downloading software that comes with it is easy to use. Highly recommended.My only complaint is that the red eye flash takes really bizarre photos - it looks like the flash goes off twice, so if you're taking a picture with any action in it, you get a sort of double image. But redeye is easily corrected in an image editing program, so I just don't use that feature.
