I got this camera body used and it's been great! It's not as fast or clean as my D7000, but otherwise it serves its purpose well.There are 2 reasons why I bought this model:1. Price2. auto-focus compatibilityI could've bought a used D40, D60, D3000, D5000 (etc), but I would not be able to use auto-focus on so many lenses available for Nikon. The lenses I own are not AF-S and I like the convenience of auto-focus ( although there's nothing wrong with manual focus). I read quite a few comments where people were mixed up over the tech specs of this camera compared to other models. If there is a good lens on this camera, then tech specs have little to do with the image quality.This camera is built tough, easy to use, and versatile. Right now there are so many cameras on the market, which makes this model cheaper and cheaper.If you're a beginner or a novice, this camera serves well. It takes great pictures. Auto-focus is fast, and colors and contrasts are great.
