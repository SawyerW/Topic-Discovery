Incredibly small (you just can't prepare yourself for how small it is), great photo quality, extremely easy user interface (didn't need to read the book to figure out the basics)Seems to get warm after being on for a few minutes, no longer fits in an Altoids tin (because of the camera strap), buttons could be bigger/easier to use.I'm replacing a Nikon 990 (very large digicam) with this. I'm simply tired of missing photo ops because I don't have my cam with me. I'm highly impressed with the S4i - the quality exceeds my expectations (and I've been considering this purchase for quite a while.) It's just so gosh darn cute too!
