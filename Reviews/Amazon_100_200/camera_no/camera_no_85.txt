I concur with the other reviewer in that when the camera manages to focus correctly, the pictures look great.  But be prepared to through out 30% of your pictures due to focus/blurring problems.  I to have tried numerous camera settings and have yet to find the magic formula.The 7Mb image size is great and the 30 times zoom are very nice.  Also, the camera powers up and is ready to snap pictures very quickly (much faster than any digital camera I have owned).  I am going to stay with the camera, but I am a bit unhappy with the focus problems that I have to deal with, especially in lower light conditions.
