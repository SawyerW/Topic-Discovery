I was so excited about this camera. Had all the features I wanted at a great price. I did not believe the reviews about the screen could be right. Boy was I wrong. What good is a camera with great features and that will take great picture, but has a view screen that you can not see in sunlight? And I don't mean it is hard to see, I mean it is black. There is no way you can compose a picture in bight sun. I wanted this camera to take on a trip and figured I would be outside and in the sun-- with this camera, you would be just pointing and praying you got the shot you wanted. I returned it!
