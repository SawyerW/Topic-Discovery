Solid Camera. Awesome that it runs off 2 AAs. Decent camera for the price. Don't expect insane options since this is a fairly cheap (in terms of price) camera.I also traveled to Harbin, China, where the temps were around -25 C or -15 F in the daytime, and the camera would not function or open after about 15 minutes in this weather. However this is extremely cold weather so I am not sure many digital cameras would work. I was able to use  my iphone4 to take some pictures when that happened.If you use the wrong type of batteries, this camera will eat right through them.That is all.
