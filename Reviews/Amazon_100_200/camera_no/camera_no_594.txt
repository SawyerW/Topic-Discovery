I tried to set up my Wilife, but nothing worked.  Called Logitech and was told to upgrade the software.  Did that and still nothing.  Another call to Logitech and a very long back and forth with various attempts to get it started.  Nothing worked. After four hours of attempts it was finally concluded that the power pack was defective.  I was instructed to send it to Logitech and they would send a replacement in 2 to 3 weeks.  (Incidentally, both power packs, the one for the camera and the one for the receiver became very warm within a short time of being plugged in.) From previous reviews I was aware of the trouble with the power pack, but since most were old I incorrectly assumed that Logitech had fixed the problem.  They apparently have not.  This is an inexpensive security system and the cheapness of it is unmistakable.
