After 8 months with the Nikon Coolpix 4200, I am convinced I could not have found a better camera.  Photos are as good as any I would hope for.  The auto point and shoot setting has yet to disappoint me, and yet the options for special situations let me make the images I want, easily-- from macro mode all the way to photographing the northern lights.  Menus are a snap to use and intuitively arranged, the camera "fits" my hand, buttons are where I expect to find them.  The LCD screen shows clear and crisp images that let me know immediately whether I have the picture I want, or should try again.  And presto, a quick cable connection, and everything loads into iPhoto in no time.  -- Hooked, I keep looking at other similar models, and am convinced this is the one I'm happy to have with me.
