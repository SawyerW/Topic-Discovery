Have not had that much time to enjoy this little camera, but when I have used it is fabulous, the picture quality is devine and the technology in that little case is incredible!  I have experienced the outside sunshine problem that has been noted in previous reviews, but a b/ball cap for a visor and it worked great. I think we will have years of enjoyment from the memories captured on this fine device. It is Olympus quality in a little credit card size box! Am thinking a ViewFinder would have made the price a definite bargain.......but as they say......we can't have it all, so enjoy what we have!
