It's been awhile that I've used a SLR (Canon AE-1)and (IMO) Digital is far superior to film! I've had thiscamera for a month and have taken some great picswithout knowing all of the functions and the camera'spotential. I'll get the (heavier) 70-300mm VR Lensnext, and that will meet my current needs. This 18-135mm Lens is very light and is great for the moneybut has some minor limitations that I can live with.Other reviews will point out these limitations, butkeep in mind the cost and your use/needs. However,the wide angle does a good job! Also, keep in mindthe pics will look much better when up-loaded to yourcomputer versus what you see on the camera's LEDmonitor. The camera's monitor doesn't begin to do yourphotos justice at all! And, this D-80 is much lighterthan the pro D-200. BTW- I bought the Hoya 67mmUV(0), Skylight 1B, and Cir-Polarizing  filters and Lexar2 GB 133x SD Memory from Don's Camera. I also boughtthe Nikon Camera bag, but need another for all of theaccessories, etc. I think I'll get the Sierra bag for D-80ssince it has easy access and holds a camera with a longer6 inch lens (70-300mm) attached.
