The Nikon D80 is a fantastic camera. You can't get a better camera for the price.I am a professional photographer, and actually own two D80s. They have served me well as my photography business has grown over the past two years. Almost all of the images at [...] were taken with the D80.I recently upgraded to the D300, but will keep one of my D80s as a backup.If you are on the fence, take the leap and get a D80.The only reason I did not give it five stars is its performance is somewhat limited in low light conditions. But this is not a problem for most 'personal use' users, and even many pros if you shoot a lot of outdoor stuff.
