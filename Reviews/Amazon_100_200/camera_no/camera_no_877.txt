I got this camera in 2003.  It was my first digital camera, so I dont have much to compare it to, but it seemd somewhat troubled from the beginning--for instance, within a few months after I bought it the tiny memory card that it came with got corrupted and destroyed all the pictures that were on it.  I also found the flash to be too bright--if you used it, the pictures were too bright and washed out.  However, the real problem was that a few months ago (spring 2005) the camera died.  For a few weeks it would still take pictures but they were completely distorted, and then it stopped altogether.  Of course, the warranty was expired by the time this happened.  I have had previous, non-digital cameras for years and years, so it seems ridiculous that such an expensive camera would die so fast.  I will not buy another digital camera from Canon.
