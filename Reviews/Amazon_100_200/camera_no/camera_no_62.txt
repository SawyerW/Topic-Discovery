I've had the camera for about 6 months now.  Overall I'm thrilled with it.  I like pretty much the same stuff as everyone else - nice big screen, loaded with features, intuitive operation, long battery life, small - all terrific.I agree with those that complain about some picture quality although I've had quality problems on other expensive digital cameras too so ...  The quality problems I have on this one relate to curvature in the corners in some pictures and can be kind of dark for low-light conditions (night time indoors).  Most of the pictures turn out great though.  Lots of detail and look fantastic when printed.  The occasional pic problems are minor nuisances in the overall scheme.  It's a terrific camera and I happily recommend it to anyone.
