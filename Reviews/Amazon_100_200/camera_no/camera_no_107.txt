The camera is pretty good for its price. It was my first digital camera and was pretty good but now I'm looking to upgrade only because indoor pictures, even in well lit areas look very dim. Also I have to keep playing around with the settings in order for it to take a picture at all indoors, and it often times takes a really long time to actually take the picture. You have to have very steady hands in order for night mode/close up mode not to blur. It takes a bit of practice. Also I found the video to be quite pointless since there was no sound to it. Also I tried to take firework pictures, but that was a disaster. Pictures are excellent outdoors, and sometimes the bluriness during night photos can give an interesting effect...sometimes.It's very easy to use though, and I usually brighten up dim pictures easily in Paint Shop Pro.
