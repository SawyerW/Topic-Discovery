By now you've read everyone else's reviews.  I agree withthem except that I do have some issues that people mightrun into with this camera.1> My main problem with thiscamera is it's low light focusing - in low light conditions,I would swear that it does its focus sweep, seems to getthe focus close, then picks something completely off.I have an old Coolpix 990 and it does a better, faster job offocusing in low light.  It "smells like a firmware issue" tome.2> There needs to be a way of disabling, in all modes, thefocus assist light.  Nothing freaks out wildlife fasterthan beaming a bright orange LED in their eyes.3> There should be a focus mode that acts like "continuous"mode - but only when the shutter button is partially pressed.This could help with the overall focus speed issue.
