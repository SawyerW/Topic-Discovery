It is easy to switch between modes of the camera.  The included video cable allows you to display video or photos on a t.v. with the setting of only one option.It seems to eat batteries though.  I was surprised when after shooting a few minutes of video and taking 8 photos with the LCD screen on, I didn't have enough battery power to download them onto my computer.  In two days, I had used up 3 new pairs of AA alkaline batteries. Perhaps that is normal - this is my first digital camera.  The service department recommended I buy lithium rechargeable batteries.
