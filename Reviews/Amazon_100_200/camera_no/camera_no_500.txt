I did not expect much when I bought it for that price, but after I got it I am surprised I got a real deal. Very satisfied so far.Pros:It has every function a camera can possibly have, and very easy to access. It can print directly to the printer with picbridge. The vedio funtion is just superb, very good picture and sound; you dont need to buy a camcorder. Light enough for me to carry every day every where.  Lcd is also not bad. All the keys are designed for easy access, most suitable for a newbie like me. 10M picture is very good, and you can also adjust it. 3x opitical zoom is enough for daily use. 2 AA batteries for easy change.Cons:Batteries use up fast, probably because of 10M pixels, but when I changed to rechargable batteries, it works good, and I usually have 4 batteries for backup. If optical zoom is 5x, it's perfect :)
