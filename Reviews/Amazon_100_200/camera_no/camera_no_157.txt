I'd purchase one of the first Casio Exilim cameras when they first came out. Super compact, easy to use and easy to upload and manage pictures.  (Techni-friendly) What's the point of buying a really expensive camera that's way too complicated to take full advantage of?  When I decided to upgrade, (I was looking for a few more features) - I didn't hesitate to choose another Casio Exilim because I knew it would give me everything I wanted and still be super easy to use.  This camera did not disappoint and I recommend it to anyone who wants to take great pictures, and enjoy all the advantages it offers.  This camera is easy enough for beginners -- but provides enough great features that even a pro would appreciate it.  Casio also provides great customer support and service.
