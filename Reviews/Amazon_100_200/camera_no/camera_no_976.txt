I bought this camera few months after it came out.  I like the features that it has.  The Remote, the stabilization, the zoom.Why, you ask I give this camera a 3 star?well, first of all, I took many pictures with normal light.  The results aren't as great as Nikon advertised.  During my first use, I had pictures that for some odd reason gave ppl black lips.  No, I know for sure that they weren't wearing any lipstick.I asked Nikon support for this anomaly, they still haven't gotten back to me.  I just updated the firmware today.  Hopefully this makes a difference in normal picture taking situations.  The lip color for some pictures is a mystery.  I haven't seen this problem much lately.  Maybe I don't take in door pictures as much.The Remote, it doesn't work well either.  It seems to work when it wants to work.I do like Nikon's softwares that accompanies this camera.
