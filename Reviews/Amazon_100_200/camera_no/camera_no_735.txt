This is a good little camera for the price, don't get me wrong.  But the thing that bothers me about it is that you are always compensating to get the actual shot you are looking for.  Even though the lens is right under the eye hole, it seems to take pictures right, left, up, or down of that point and so when you are trying to use the camera for life's little events, you can lose a lot of shots!The quality of the picture isn't that great either.  Alright, but not great.Let's put it this way, when I wanted to take pictures of some jewelry I was listing on an auction site, I took better pictures with my scanner.  Nothing flat, we are talking rings here, and that's just a bit sad to me.
