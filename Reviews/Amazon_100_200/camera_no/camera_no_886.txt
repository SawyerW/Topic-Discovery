This is my third Digital Camera, before I decide to purchase this particular A70 I did so many research on megapixel comparison, picture detail samples and many more.The awsome thing is the FLEXIBILITY of this A70 you can find this things everywhere AA Battery, Compact Flash MEMORY is so cheap, the detail of the pictures quality is same as the 4 Megapixel believe it or not but I found other Camera that pull my head off is the Canon G3 4 MPixel but to bad had been discontinued... so anyway I do highly recommend this mini tiny and beautiful design camera to everyone from beginer to advance user.
