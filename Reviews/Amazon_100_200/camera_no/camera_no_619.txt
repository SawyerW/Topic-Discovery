This is a good camera for the price (sub 80) , with some issues.Positive pointsNice photos.Big screen for previewing.Easy to figure out, my 10 year old quickly learned to navigate the menus.Easy to download photos and video into XP,  just plug in the included cable (one of the tiny usb cables)Excellent red eye reduction, better than my Canon.Uses 2 AA batteries,  a big bonus since they are available everywhere.  We use rechargable Eneloop brand, they work well in digital cameras and hold their charge when stored.Negative pointsNo viewfinder, which makes it tough to see what you are taking in bright sunlight.No audio playback for video on the camera.  It does record the sound, but to hear it you have to download the video.A little slow between photos,  perhaps 5 seconds after a photo before it is ready to take another.  We are using a Kingston 2 GB SD Flash Memory Card, perhaps if you bought a faster card this might improve.
