This camera was horrible.  Picture quality was the only good thing about it.Batteries - I burned through 8 AA batteries in the first day!  Think about it.  It's like getting a laptop and having to plunk 4 D size batteries in it to use it.  Any small mobile electronic item that does NOT come with a Lithium Ion battery should be avoided in my opinion.Lens cap - piece of garbageShape - VERY awkward in you handsAnd much much more...I returned mine and bought another brandFor the same amount of money look to other brands, you'll find that they offer all that this lacks at similar prices
