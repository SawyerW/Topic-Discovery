The good:  This camera is very attractive: compact and sleek.  Pretty easy menu system and the most important functions are readily accessible.  When conditions are right, it takes clear, beautiful photos.  Rechargeable internal battery means you don't spend a fortune in double A's.  LCD screen is a good size.The bad:  Focus problems!! In certain lighting conditions (e.g. fluorescent lights) you cannot take an in focus picture using the automatic setting.  I missed so many potentially great holiday pics of my kids due to fiddling around with the settings.  Mostly, I simply gave up trying to get a clear pic. I finally contacted Sony tech support and they acknowledged the focus problems under certain lighting conditions, including bright sunlight.  They suggested changing the white balance and shutter speed- but when you're a novice photographer, changing these settings is not so intuitive!Bottom line:  Buy a Canon elph.  I wish I had.  It would have been worth the extra money!
