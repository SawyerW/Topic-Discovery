DO NOT PURCHASE!!!  CHEAP & NO SUPPORT (software or product)!!  Software AND support for this camera is non-existent.I have owned this camera for OVER A YEAR, but have used it very little.  The software is only Windows 32-bit ONLY and I could never get the firmware updates to update successfully.  (I was hoping the firmware updates would resolve the issues with dropped wireless connection.)  CAMERA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED (after only owning it for a year).I will NEVER purchase anything from TrendNet again... I don't care how inexpensive it is!!  Their "support" sucks and you definitely get what you OVERpaid for in this case!!!DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM TrendNet!!
