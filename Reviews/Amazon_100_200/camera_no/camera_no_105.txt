I just recently purchased this camera and I really enjoy it. Its small for a girl and it has really clear pictures except for when you are trying to take a motion picture. Most digital cameras that I have used before has an mode strictly for pictures in motion but this camera does not. When trying to take a picture of moving objects everything including the object appears in a blur of colors. The camera has night vision, self portrait and landmark mode.. all of which makes the camera good but not great because of the lack of the ability to shoot in motion. I would recommend this camera, just not for concerts!
