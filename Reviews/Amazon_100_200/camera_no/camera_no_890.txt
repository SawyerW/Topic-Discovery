This is a good camera no doubt but I won't rate it as the 'best' I have ever seen. Because 1st of all it's not so small. It can't fit in your purse. 2ndly, it takes four batteries every time. Batteries last long no doubt but since I had only four rechargable batteries, I couldn't let one set for charging and use the other one. When I was out for long time, I had to leave four of the batteries for charging for eight hours and go out without any camera. So, anything else which uses two batteries at a time is far more better. 3rd point is, sometimes the photos in night mode are hazy, for that you probably need a tripod, because if you shake your hand for a fraction of second, the photo will be a mess. Overall, canon A70 is a good deal.
