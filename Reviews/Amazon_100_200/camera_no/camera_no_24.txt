I bought this at the same time as my Nikon D90.  This actually arrived before the camera itself.  I read the PDF version of the manual (from Nikon) before the camera arrived and I was pretty well prepared.  I only needed a few days with the camera to get to know a lot of the functions that I will use.  I also read the D90 guide from Ken Rockwell for some tips based on his actual usage.  In my first two weeks with the camera, I haven't used this reference card more than once or twice, but I'll probably pack it into my camera bag anyway.As far as a reference card goes, it's clear, colorful, and well laid out.  The lamination will keep it protected.  It's a good reference but not a must-have.
