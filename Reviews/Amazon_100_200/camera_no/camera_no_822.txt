this camera's lack of any battery life at all makes this camera absolutely useless.  with the rechargable batteries that it comes with, as soon as you insert them fully charged, it indicates half battery life and the camera lasts no more than maybe 4 pictures.  i've replaced the batteries with new kodak rechargable ones, but the same thing happens.  what's the point of a camera if it is impossible to hold enough energy to use through a single session?i see that many other consumers are complaining about this as well (even the consumers giving the camera four stars!)absolutely DO NOT BUY this camera because you'll be finding yourself bringing bulk packs of batteries to your next family gathering.
