I got this camera about three weeks ago, and so far it works great. I haven't used it heavily, but what pictures I've taken have come out great on the computer. The pictures are surprisingly detailed, colorful, and smooth. I originally wanted a DX3400 (4300?) because I wanted finely detailed pictures, but the price was way too high for my budget. I'm glad I decided to go for this one, though, because honestly, I don't think I would have been able to tell a difference between the pictures from this camera and the DX. I also didn't expect the camera to be this small and light... My only gripes would have to be that the batteries exhaust themselves pretty quickly. After having taken about 30 pictures, the batteries that came with the camera are half gone. Also, there's a small delay between pressing the button and the actual picture being taken. All in all, though, the camera was a pretty good deal. ...
