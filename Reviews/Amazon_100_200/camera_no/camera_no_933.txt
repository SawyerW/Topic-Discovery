This is a very small camera with no protrusions so that it is easily carried in a pocket or purse.  Two of my friends have this model and have taken hundreds of excellent photos.  However, my experience with it not been good.  When the camera arrived, the on/off button did not function correctly.  I managed to take a few good pictures with it on a vacation trip before it became unusable.  When I returned it to the Pentax Distribution & Service Center, the Center claimed that the camera had internal damage "due to the penetration of liquid or oily substance" and could not be repaired under warranty.  The camera was never exposed to a liquid or oily substance while in my possession.  I cannot recommend this camera or any other Pentax product because of this failure to repair or replace this camera that was defective or damaged before I received it.
