I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BRAND NEW FROM AMAZON WITH THE LENS PACKAGE IT CAME WITH.  AFTER TAKING ONLY 68 SHOTS IT STOPPED WORKING.  I GOT AN F-- ERROR. I REMOVED AND REPLACED THE LENS AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. THEN I NOTICED THAT THE TOP BORDER WAS BLACK. I HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2.5 MONTHS SO IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I FOUND OUT THAT I HAD TO PAY $37 TO SEND IT INSURED BY UPS TO NIKON. I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I WAS SOLD A BAD EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT FROM THE BEGINNING AND I STILL HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK SO THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT.  I DECIDED TO TRY NIKON BECAUSE MINOLTA WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.  THAT WAS A SAD LOSS FOR THE PHOTO WORLD. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER NIKON AGAIN.
