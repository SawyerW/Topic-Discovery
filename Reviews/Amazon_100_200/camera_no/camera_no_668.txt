The E-520 from Olympus is my first DSLR purchase and I must say that it is an excellent camera. I've taken some great shots with it outside and I'm very impressed. The kit lens (Zuiko 14-42mm) i find to be a great starter lens although in low light situations the auto focus takes much time and can be inaccurate. i plan to get the Olympus Zuiko 12-60mm lens to go with this camera as it handles lower light situations much better. the auto white balance can generally be accurate but i do suggest using either one of the presets or making manual tweaks. while live view is one of the big features in this dslr, as it has been with almost all of their dslr cameras, i find myself having more fun using the viewfinder, which hasn't really given me any problems. the anti-dust system is great, i still encourage cleaning the camera every once in a while as well just as a precaution. I encourage anybody in the market for an entry level dslr to look @ and try the e-520.
