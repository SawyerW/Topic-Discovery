I tried using the Canon XTI, then the D80, I was so amazed with the D80 I wouldn't ever recommend the XTI.  I took two photos of my girlfriend, one with the XTI and one with the D80, the one taken with the Canon looked like a photo taken with a 5.0 MP Point-and-shoot lil' digital camera, the one I took with the D80 looked like a photo ready to use for a magazine cover, not even exagerating.  Nikon D80 felt better in my hands and the extra LCD on top just works for me! Awesome camera, I would recommend it to ANYONE. It's my new favorite toy =]
