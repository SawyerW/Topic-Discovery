This made an excellent started camera for my husband who now takes pictures every chance he gets.  I already had the lenses as I have a d90.  I don't see much difference in the quality of the images that come out of this camera and the quality of images that come out of mine.  It does seem a bit lighter though, but not cheaply light.  I like the fact that the focus motor is built into the camera and we can use older lenses.  The fact that it doesn't have live view or video means nothing to us as I've not once used those features on my d90.I bought this body used and at $200 it was a GREAT deal.
