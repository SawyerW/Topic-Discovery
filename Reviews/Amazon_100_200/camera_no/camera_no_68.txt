I came accross this product online and i read reviews from different customers and i was impressed. I decided to give it a try. Among other rivals are sony DSC-T7 at $499.95, nikon and some other like that. Sony DSCT7 was the bottom of the least rated even though it's slim and cute. I have a bad experience with sony handycam dcr-dvd 301. It shoots movies nice, but can't take good pictures. that's when i started shopping for digital cameral. My experiece so far is unimaginable. No regret at all. The pix are excellent, the movie is good and the battery continues to go and go. The foto loader is da bomb men! i will forever recommend this product.
