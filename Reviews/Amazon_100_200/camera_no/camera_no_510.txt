The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is  unreadable @ outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions depends on good luck.Not having eye view as a option is very frustrating. The selection of night pictures scene is always blurry, may I need a tripod for that. However the selection of pictures with available light is very good.Battery life is good, I used it all day long in different set ups and the battery holds very well, do not forget to recharge it at the end of the day and will be ready for the next day. Xd cards are not available everywhere, and is more expensive than sd cards.I will buy it again if comes with a eye view option...
