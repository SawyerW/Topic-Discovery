I purchased this camera to replace my Casio EX-Z4 which broke.  This camera takes great photos.  The controls are much easier to access than my EX-Z4.  i.e. there is a dedicated delete button, dedicated dial for choosing mode, etc...  The power button while small is much easier to press than the EX-Z4.  I was really looking for a camera with at least a 4x optical zoom because I like to take lots of wildlife photos and I can get too close to my subject.  The downside to this camera is that it's too big to slip into my pocket like the EX-Z4 and there is no cradle charger.  The camera also does not automatically shutoff when idle when attached to your computer -- which drains the battery.I purchased a 2GB SD flash card on the Internet and I'm very pleased with this camera!
