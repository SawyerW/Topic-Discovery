I was shopping around a basic digital camera and encountered this product. At first sight, this camera looked great. It has 10Mpixel and all common features, yet a real bargain price tag. The user reviews I found on the web were mostly positive. But once I tried it, I have to say I was very unhappy. Quite simply, auto focusing works only under very bright conditions and this camera does not have manual focusing. When I tried to take pictures in my home under normal room light, auto focusing failed quite often and the images are terribly blur. I don't know if this is true for all of this model or specific to the unit I got, since nobody else has reported this kind of problem. I hope more people would post a review of this product which shed some light on the focusing performance.
