The best twelve-Dollar investment in D300 accessories, stows nicely in the camera bag. The laminated folding cards are very sturdy and will hold together for years on end. If they put spiral binding it may scratch the expensive contents of the camera bag. This is a lovely, color coded guide or cheat sheet that will keep you alive when you are in the field, away from the 450+ pages manual that is not very portable, yet indispensable for such a vastly complex camera. I'm so happy with this quick reference. Maybe a tad larger font would have been in order, but I won't chuck it away just because of that.
