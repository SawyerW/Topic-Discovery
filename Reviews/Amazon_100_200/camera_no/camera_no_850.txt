We were looking at a slightly less [costly] 3 megapixel digital camera when the sales guy told us about the Canon.  We are SO glad we got the Canon.  This camera takes terrific photographs, is easy to use and is rich with features. I haven't seen in any other digital camera at this price range with these features and we've been researching for months.  I'm looking forward to learning more about the manual modes and seeing the results in our photographs.My mother has a Samsung 3 megapixel camera which is much slower and I think our picture quality is much better.  We're just THRILLED with the results.I also love the short movie clips and was able to put together a short movie clip with stills and the video.  I think we'll be looking to upgrade the included software but it worked well for starters.
