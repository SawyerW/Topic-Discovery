I ordered this product late Thurs evening (PST).  I couldn't wait for the Free Shipping to arrive, so I paid the extra 2 day shipping for this and the Nikon camera bag also through Amazon. ~$16 extra total for both shipping.  Recieved the camera on Monday and the case on Tues. Through research and debate between this and the Cannon Rebel XTi, I chose this due to the massive reviews.  I didn't mind paying the extra $100+ because this would hopefully be the only dSLR I plan on purchasing for a loong time.  I chose Amazon to purchase because the price is still less than purchasing it through the store.  (Camera + case = $1190 less than store where it's $1299 for camera & lens only.)Hopefully this helps, g'luck!Have yet to use it yet. Played around with it. Will edit once taken pictures!
