I've used this digital camera many times...it's very versatile in that not only does it take good pictures but, you also can use many accessories that a photographer would normally want to use on his or her slr, i.e. close-up  lens attachments, filters etc., etc.  The amazing thing is that after  taking those wonderful pictures you eject the floppy disk and insert it  directly into your computer and go to work.  Most of my work is law  enforcement and this camera has been a God sent tool.  Other features such  as image stablizing lens and flash, what else is need, just point and  shot...go to work with your images.  The best of luck with yours.
