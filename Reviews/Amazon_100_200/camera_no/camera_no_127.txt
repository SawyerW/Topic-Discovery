This is a very tiny camera. It fits the pocket. Has a very helpful joystick that let u pass the photos, play the movies and navigate through the menus. the only thing i didn't like is the position of the microphone, the sound of people speaking 3 meters far from the camera can not be listened.Excluding this, the camera is perfect. I loved it. The flash is very powerful. and the precision is very sharp.When I decided to buy a camera i saw many many models of almost all brands. The fact of this camera be very small, with the box made of metal and only one position button(at the top, where o select play, picture ou movie). Other cameras have many position buttons(switch button) that a imagine it brokes very easy with regular use.I recommend u to buy it. U'll have a cool experience.Hugs
