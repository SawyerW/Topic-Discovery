Everything said on this forum about the fragility of this camera and the terrible customer service is true.  The camera worked great for a few months, then mysteriously stopped working.  When I took it to an authorized repair facility they voided the warranty because of "impact damage" and claimed that the entire zoom mechanism would have to be replaced to the tune of $200.  What a bunch of b.s.!  The "impact damage" was a tiny scuff mark that did not result from a drop (since it was never dropped).  We babied this camera and took extreme care to be careful with it and it just decided to quit on us.  I suspect that taking this camera out of its case subjects it to "impact" -- it just feels delicate and is an accident waiting to happen.  Don't waste your money.
