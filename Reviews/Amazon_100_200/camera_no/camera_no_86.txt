This camera packs a lot of features into a small little camera.  However, the focus issue is HUGE for me.  I have little ones that I'm always photographing, and the auto focus issue doesn't cut it for us.  Family photo taking?  This camera isn't for you.  Even using auto focus mode (battery draining indeed), and using a flash indoors, you will take several pictures before achieving a sharp picture. In the meantime, your subjects will be temporarily blinded by the "red light".  (A big complaint from our family).  Not too great for those impromptu moments of catching your children's smiles and "firsts" on camera.After reading the other reviews, I think this one is not a keeper for us.  On a positive note, it does allow the experienced photographer to venture out of the "box", more so than most digitals.
