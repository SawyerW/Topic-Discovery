I have been using this camera for 2 years.  I have it set up as a baby monitor, installing it on the wall above the crib using the bracket provided.  The product works great.  The set-up is very easy if you only view it on the home wireless network.  It does get a bit tricky if you want to access the camera from an external IP (i.e. your phone or another computer not connected to your wireless network) but with some basic knowledge of IP addresses and port forwarding it only takes about 10 mins to set-up. Camera has excellent low light performance - I use it in a completely dark bedroom and the IR sensors provide excellent performance (I would approximate up to 6 - 7 ft).The only issue that I have with the camera is that you have to use Internet Explorer - not a huge issue, just annoying.  Nevertheless, the camera works great with several apps, both on Android and Blackberry.
