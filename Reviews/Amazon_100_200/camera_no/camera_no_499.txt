Negative:Plastic cover,small USB jack is very fragile and not a standard one. Be carefull not to break it. Automatic funcions are the main defect.Positive:Price.You can change all values as if it was a manual camera. With it i managed to take a shot at night with no light or flash as if it was a nightscope. I could not do the same with  a 400$ cannon. You can set values for exposure, shutter speed, white balance and ISO. If you know a little of photography you can take great pictures. Do not expect much from the automatic function. It is not a point and shoot camera.Menues are easy to use.I'm happy with it.
