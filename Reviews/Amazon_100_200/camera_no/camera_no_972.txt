This camera has a built in zoom lens.  If the lens breaks, you don't have a camera anymore.  My lens is failing to zoom and now I have to buy a new camera although the rest of the camera works fine.  It's money down the drain.  Before the zoom malfunction, the camera took great pictures on a perfect day, but night time, indoor, and action pictures were almost always blurry even if you put it on the night time, indoor, or action settings.  Also, the macro doesn't focus as close as I expected.  That's something I should have known when I spec'd the camera though.  I liked the swivel view finder.
