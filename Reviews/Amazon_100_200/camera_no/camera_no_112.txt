This camera does not have an optical viewfinder. Do not buy it if you do not have very good closeup eye-sight (unless you want to always wear specs/contacts to see the LED screen).Olympus claims a new 'sunshine' technology LED that can be seen in bright sunlight.  In bright sunlight, it is necessary to adjust the LED brightness using a menu selection to be able to see the LED - for shots in any direction relative to the sun's position. Otherwise, you are shooting blind!It would also be useful to know at what ISO the camera is shooting - a lot of shots are moved due to low shutter speeds.On the plus side, the camera does a good job capturing indoor shots and still-lifes - though the flash is too strong for any closeups. The 2 in 1 feature is useful/fun to use.
