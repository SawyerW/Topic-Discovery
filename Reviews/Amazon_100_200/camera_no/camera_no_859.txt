Although this camera takes wonderful pictures and it easy to use, I wouldn't buy it.  We bought it for about $300 and we've had it for less than 3 years.  We've need to repair it 2 times.  After using it for less than a year, the LCD screen stopped working and the camera took all-black pictures.  Canon fixed it because it was still under warranty.  A year later, the camera had the same problem but Canon would not fix it. They said I could pay them $150 for a "refurbished" exact same model and send them my old camera.  Humm...doesn't make much sense since this camera sells for a little over $190 now anyway.  I think it is a bit of a scam. I'd look for something different.
