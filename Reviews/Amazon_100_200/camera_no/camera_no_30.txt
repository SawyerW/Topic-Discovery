Canon considers memory card capacity a deep dark secret.  You can look for it, but you won't find it.  The 20D will support an 8GB CF - MAX.You can buy a larger CF - but you can't write more than 8GB.  If you format it, you'll discover its size has been reduced to 8GB.  (You can use a partition editor like Linux's gparted to resize the partition table back up - but you shouldn't have to.)So stop eyeing those 16- and 32GB CF cards.  Since you're limited to 8GB, you can spend the difference on faster write speeds.  And more of them...
