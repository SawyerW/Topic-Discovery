Previously had Exilim Z-60 which was excellent - I gave that to a daughter to take to University and got this one which is slightly bigger.  The 2.8" widescreen is very nice, the icons that run down the side is great.  While the menu on the Z-60 was good, the menu on this is much better.I use this in work in mills to take pictures of our equipment.  Limited use of this one so far.For portability this is great.  I also have a canon G5 (larger) and Canon Rebel XT with ~7 lenses.  This one is certainly much easier to take with me and always travels with me.I'll also review the Casio case.
