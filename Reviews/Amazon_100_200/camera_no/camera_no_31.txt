The 20D is actually more responsive than my film SLR.  Start up speed is virtually instantaneous.  Almost no shutter lag.  Image quality is excellent with usable images up to ISO3200. Nice to have the 8MP for the extra cropping.Small quibbles but the controls are tricky to set the ISO and continous shooting.  On the other hand the menu system is very easy to use.Build quality is excellent, but small corners cut on the battery cover and compact flash cover. Also, the battery recharger does not have a cord.  Would be nice if battery could be recharged in camera.  USB 2.0 support but no firewire (what a drag for a camera of this level).The 20D has similar controls to the old Canon film SLR's.  I felt right at home after using my Canon A-1 (unfortunately a relic at this point).Camera is a little big and heavy, but that's part of the price to pay when you leave the amateur ranks.  The 20D gives you kudos among serious amateurs and semi-pro photographers.
