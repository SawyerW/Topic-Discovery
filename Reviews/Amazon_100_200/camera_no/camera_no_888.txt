I am a reader and not a photographer.  I enjoy taking pictures with the next man but I would not call it my hobby as much as a necessity from my wife.  I bought this camera because frankly we needed a new camera that was digital and would allow this amature to delete pictures before running to Wal-Mart to process them.  This camera is great for me!The camera itself is lightweight and quite easy to learn.  I had some difficulty at first figuring out how to take pictures, switch to the video, and then move to cutting and deleting pictures and short films.  However, Canon sends an easy to follow book that teaches you all you need to know to run the camera.Finally, buy rechargable batteries!  This camera (as I am learning with all digital cameras) eats batteries for fun.  Spend the $50 to get a battery pack and get a nice camera case as well (Canon does not provide you with one).
