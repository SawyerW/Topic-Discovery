I have had the Logitech indoor camera for at least 2 years.  My son helped me install it.  I had to call the customer service line once for help with the installation.  They were helpful then, and once while it was under warranty the plug-in part malfunctioned and they figured out what the problem was and shipped me a new one.  Since then the camera has been on for 24 hours a day and works fine.  My only complaint is that you must have good light to be able to see the picture and I would prefer to have a much smaller camera.
