Since this was not my first camera setup was simple.  Typical plug in the cable and setup the camera then downloaded and installed the latest firmware.  That part was ok.Once setup the camera picture did not contain true colors of what is being seen.  There was also a constant clicking noise when listening.Support informed me the color was because of the infared feature.  The noise was explained as a sensitive microphone.  No fix was forthcoming.On the up side the infared and motion detection work well.  If you hook up speakers for two way conversation place them well away from the camera.
