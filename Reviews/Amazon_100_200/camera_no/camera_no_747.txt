The C-3020 was my very first digital camera. I loved it from day one. I was taking pictures as soon as I loaded the batteries practically and I was looking at them on my computer only minutes later. My husband who proudly owns and operates a disposable with free film for life was absolutely wowed by this too. It's simple and does it's job well. Pictures never looked so crisp and clear. I've been using various shots for wallpaper and such on my computer screen and they look beautiful. I did want more zoom and in my ignorance didn't realize I would need more than I was getting. So if zoom is really an important factor to you keep looking. But if not this one will do any job you'd like.
