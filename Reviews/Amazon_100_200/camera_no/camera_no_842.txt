Really 4.5 stars.  The only bad thing is that some of the pictures have looked blurry  or soft (but you can just delete them and take them again.)and the LCD screen has looked fuzzy a few times.All the good stuff overshadows that, though.  The camera has preformed very well in the inside(bright and dark rooms.  Dark are excellent.), outside, and in dark outside scenes.  I took 6 pictures the lunar eclipse last night and they are all crystal clear.  It powers up very quickly and the menus are easy to navigate. The digital zoom is very useful in far away subjects.  There is no delay if you focus first by pushing the 'shoot button' halfway down.I spent 3 months comparing and looking at digital cameras and I finally chose this one.  I am extremely pleased.  I hope you will choose this one too- you won't be dissapointed!
