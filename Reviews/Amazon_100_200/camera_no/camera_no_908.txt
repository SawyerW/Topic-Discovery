Ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one as a gift.  Coming out of the package they looked good and felt pretty hefty.  But both units had problems with the ball joint, which is about the most important component.  It appears as though the manufacturing tolerances are way off spec.  There's no way that one can get a smooth and easy way to align or re-align your camera.  It feels like the ball is pivoting against rough and uneven surfaces.  I put a little oil on the joint but that didn't help.  I suppose this is a classic case of getting what you pay for,  I will return these and fork over a bit more for replacements.  Don't waste your money on these.
