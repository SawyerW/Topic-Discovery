I really like this camera.  Although it is only 2MP, I find the photos are excellent quality and still print out on a photo printer as clear and good as a normal photo.  It is also very easy to use, very much a point and click camera.  The menus on the camera are easy to find and adjust anything if you need to.  That is takes short videos is great too, this feature has saved me from spending hundreds on a video camera then having to lug that and this one around.  The docking station is by far my favourite feature though -just plonk it on the cradle, press a button and all the photos download -easy!This is highly recommended, I don't see any point spending more when you get this excellent camera for such a good price.
