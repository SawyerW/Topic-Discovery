It's been along time.  I bought this camera new 7 or 8 years ago and still have it and use it.  At that time it was a high end camera, I believe, the retail price was around $999.00.  How things have changed!  Now I can only compare it to a classic old black and white movie, silly and dated, but in it's time wonderful.  It does what it does well, but with only 0.8MP it can't do much.  A 14x optical zoom?  Unheard of now!  Takeing a picture at the full telephoto setting and then passing it off as anything other then abstract art would be absurd.  Still, you've got to love them for thinking it was possible.  This camera is a wonderful artifact (why I gave it 4 stars) of a not so far off distant time in digital photography.
