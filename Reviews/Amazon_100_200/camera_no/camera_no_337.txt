I bought this as a xmas gift for my wife as we were expecting our second child, and she had moved from her film slr to a canon powershot.  This camera has all the features you could want, but at the same time is a simple point and shoot camera that even I can use to take photo's of our newborn son.If you aren't super serious you might want to check out the d40x, but everything I read online said to pay the few extra hundred to the d80 line, and I'm happy we did.Battery life is amazing, and with a 4 gig card (purchased at Frys) it can hold over 500 pictures'We love it
