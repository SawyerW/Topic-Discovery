This is my first digital camera, and I am most pleased.  It was purchased to replace a middle grade 35mm point and shoot, but it appears that it will be able to do far more than that.  Everyone comments on the battery usage, and the advice to buy two sets of rechargables is good.  One must learn to remove the lens cap or suffer the noise, although so far no apparent damage.  I do miss having a UV filter and am waiting for Olympus to offer one so I can dispense with the lens cap.  Some of the bells and whistles like panorama, macro,  and bracket shooting are in reality quite valuable. Red eye prevention is good, but the delay is more than I would like. The manual can be printed from disc, but if you do that, get a good 3-ring notebook to hold it and make yourself a little index everytime you look something up. It's a good value !
