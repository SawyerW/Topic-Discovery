I switched to digital a few years ago, and my little Olympus was fine for outdoor shots, but I missed my old Pentax Spotmatic, especially indoors without a flash.  I got this camera because of the recent lowered price.  I am very pleased that with the Nikon it's like having my old camara back, but with digital. It does everything extremely well, and learning the operation was simple.  I especilly like the P mode. I was worried that the steep discount in price meant something was wrong with the camera, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  Comparing it to similarly priced digitals, this is a great buy!People seem to be going for the big telephotos, but the wide angle lens is very handy. And I always wanted a Nikon...
