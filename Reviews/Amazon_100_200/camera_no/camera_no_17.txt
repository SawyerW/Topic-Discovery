It is better than the NPS park map but when it comes to navigating a place like Nine Mile Pond, trust your GPS and carry a compass. It has the numbers totally inaccurate and that could cause some serious problems. They claim it is up to date, but it is not! The thing that annoys me about the folks who publish this map and field guides is they get it vetted by some knuckle head who poses as an authority but is clueless. It never occurs to them to try to use their product or watch their target market use them. So, the product is mediocre and they could care less. At one time National Geographic stood for some level of integrity but that seems to be a thing of the past.
