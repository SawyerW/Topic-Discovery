I have been very happy with the D80 body.  Over the years I have owned 4 film cameras from Nikon and always been thrilled with their performance and reliability.  The quality of their new lenses is nothing short of embarrassing.  The lens that came in the kit has stopped focusing after only 9 months.  I have chosen not to even send it back to Nikon based on the poor customer service and results reported from other users.  This is a well documented problem and almost never gets fixed by sending the lens back to Nikon.  Based on the extensive lenses I have for my older Nikon bodies, I am faced with a tough decision to abandon Nikon.  For anyone thinking about starting out fresh, I would take a serious look at what you want to base your system on.  Nikon is trying to compete at lower price points and their quality has obviously been allowed to fall significantly.  Can not tell you how disappointed I am to be writing this after all the photographers I have steered to Nikon over the years. Buyer beware because Nikon no longer stands behind their products!!
