The camera performs well.  Good quality video, very good field of motion.  The downsides are that the infrared lights that provide the nightvision cannot be manually controlled.  i.e. you can't force them on or off which would be helpful in many situations.  And you can't control all the functions, such as setting the motion detection windows and sensitivity from a Mac.  The software only works on internet explorer.  I ended up trying a few models before settling on this one.  All of these cameras have motion detection, but in all of them it is of limited value because it works by analyzing changes in the image and can be triggered by changes in lighting.
