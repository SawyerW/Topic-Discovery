Very nice price only $199 for such functionality/quality of pictures. Optical zoom 5x more than standard 3x. Nice built-in functionality of editting pictures. The scene choosing and guide for making photos are really helpful when you don't want to think how to adjust the settings to make the best picture in the certain conditions. A cool surprising feature is that camera can be in mode when it records 4 secs of audio just after the picture was taken. So later you can view the photo and listen what was going around. Seems a bit weird, but I like it. :) All-weather design is also good. Super-macro mode as close as 3cm/1.1inch was also making me happy.Other than that some major cons I've experienced - impossible to change the zoom level after the camera starts to record a movie, no viewfinder, you can't set the flash to the slow mode manually (it automatically sets to this mode when you choose night portrait scene as I've understood), dual-image stabilization sound really impressive, but I'm not using it very often.But obviously there are more pros than cons. I would recommend this camera. Especially for a such price :)
