I was just venturing in to the world of digital photography, the new computer was packaged with a digital camera, but I was not able to take decent picutres.  Agonizing with a friend, I was telling him, I just didn't think digital photography was for me.  He recommended this camera to me, and I would in turn, highly recommend it to anyone else with basic photography needs.  It takes great pictures, they are easy to download, print and edit.  I would recommend the dock, the cost savings in batteries will make up for itself in short time.  Using the dock, there is only one button to push to upload your pictures directly to your hard drive.The camera is small and light weight.  It easily fits into your pocket  The internal memory does not hold a lot of picures, but with a 64mb card, I have capability of taking close to 200 picures using a lower resolution.  Even using the lower resolution, the pictures are very good.
