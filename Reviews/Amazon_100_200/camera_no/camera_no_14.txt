I am a big fan of reading the manual.  But the manual that came with my D5100 was rather lackluster.  This book (on the kindle) is really a great guide to your camera.  Its is very in depth covering all the features of the camera and how to use them.  The author also shares what settings or configurations he recommends based on his experience.  The book covers everything starting with broad aspects of the camera and then drilling down more in depth for each feature or aspect of the camera, such as the auto focusing system or the light metering system.
