Let me start with the picture quality. It is great! Movie has bigger size than the other cameras (with sound too!). Wider variety of white balance, a lot of features like Canon SLR cameras, and the most important thing is the manual capability. It has AF focusing light, and it uses AA battery so we can use AA rechargeable (cheap in the long run, and you can always use regular one when you really need fresh battery). I hate proprietary batteries, so AA battery is a big plus. The size is perfect. It is smaller than Canon A40, but bigger than S-series or Elph. Smallish camera looks fun and easy to bring, but you will hate to use it. This one is just perfect. Macro capability gives high quality pictures, and night scene features is also great. One more thing, it accept 52mm filter with additional adapter. I have a lot of filters for my SLR, so this feature will give you unlimited opportunity to explore photography world. I did my research for weeks before I chose this camera, and I am very grateful to finally choose this.
