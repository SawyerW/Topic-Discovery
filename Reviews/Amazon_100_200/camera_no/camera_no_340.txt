This is a really great camera and I have had it for the last 4 years. I have now upgraded to the d7000 and the difference is awesome. HOWEVER if you want to buy a digital Nikon SLR you have two better options: 1) at this price look around for a Nikon D90 which is already like 4 year old but it's a more advanced model; 2) buy this camera used or refurbished for half the price or less of what you find here (now above $700); with what you save you can buy a nice, good lens.(again: nothing against this camera, but really buying it new in 2012, when it's already out of production, doesn't make any sense)
