I just bought this camera recently and it is incredible. It takes superior quality pictures inside and out, and is so small you can easily carry it in the smallest purse or your pocket. I love how it has the "BESTSHOT" feature where you can choose many preset photo option such as a coupling shot where you can combine two pictures into one and create 'twins' and two headed people. Also, it has 3 settings for the quality of the pictures and even the "economy" setting takes incredible shots. I have gotten so many compliments on this camera its not even funny. people come up to me all the time and ask where i got that kind of money to buy an $800. camera and they are in shock when i tell them it was only about $300. or so. This camera is worth  every single penny...don't even bother to compare to other cameras because i'm telling you now, this camera is the best you'll ever find, anywhere!!
