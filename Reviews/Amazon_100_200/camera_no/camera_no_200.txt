This camera is great! I really researched before I bought, and wound up with the EX-Z700 for many reasons; the price was great for the product, and I really wanted something small.This camera does so many things! The "best shot" menu is awesome; you can pick from a list of 38 different settings tailored to what you're trying to capture. Everything from scenery to candlelight tonight scene portraits...pretty much anything you can think of. The menu's are very easy to maneuver, and with very few buttons, it's not confusing. It takes FANTASTIC pictures! They're not at all grainy or blurry, the "anti shake" feature really helps when you're riding in a car or anything really that makes for some hand-shaking.I am not all that "camera savvy" but I have had a few digital cameras so far, including a few Canon's, and this one is much more user friendly.All-in-all, it's a great camera!!
