This camera is a great choice for the do it yourselfer that wants pan and tilt features without the big price.  I imagine the price on this type of technology will continue to drop but for now this seems to be a great value.  Setup and Installation was easy and it has been working well for the last 2 months.  Web user interface is friendly and easy to navigate. This camera is a great choice for a small business owner or vacation home owner that wants to check in remotely from time to time and see 330 degrees with one camera.  If you need a camera that zooms, I would look for a higher end camera.  All zoom features here are digital rather than optic to keep the price where it needs to be.  Overall great buy 4 out of 5 stars!
