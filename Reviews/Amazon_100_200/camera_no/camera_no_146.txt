My first three digital cameras were Canon.  I still own a Canon G3, but when the ist DS came out I was interested.I did my research on the Canon Rebel and the Nikon D70 and the Pentax and after all was said and done I chose the Pentax!  I am very happy with the camera.It is much smaller size than the others and seems very solid.  Pentax lenses are also cheaper than similar Canon and Nikon lenses (You are paying for their marketing efforts).  Also Pentax lenses from 30 years ago can be used with this camera.Pictures thus far are excellent and I work with it each day.  I enter many photo contests and this camera holds it own!
