I bought this camera as my first digital camera.  its simplistic design and 5mp are what turned me on to this product.  when i got it home and started to play with is i realized it had an abundance of features that i didn't notice at the store.  it can take point and shoot pictures easily, it has a manual focus override, and you are able to take black and white or my personal favorite black, white and red!  these are just a few of the features on this relatively inexpensive camera.  to top it all off it takes really really good high resolution pictures that you'll think were taken by a professional.
