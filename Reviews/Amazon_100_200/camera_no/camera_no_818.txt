I owned this camera for maybe a year before the battery compartment cover broke.After that I used a piece of electrical tape to secure the compartment since it wouldn't stay shut and kept dropping the batteries out from the bottom.After about another year and a half,the whole camera became useless.Everytime I go to take a picture,it shows nothing but black on the display.I have tried changing every setting I possibly could and went to the Kodak troubleshooting info. on their site and it told me there was nothing else I could do but send it in for repair.For a 2 Mega pixel camera with 2x zoom it's not even worth paying for the repair because nowadays you can get much more for less money.It's now useless.I'm very disappointed and won't buy a Kodak camera again.
