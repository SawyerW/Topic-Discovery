My husband is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's here in Illinois; his children and grandchildren live all over the country and don't get to see him. (One daughter lives in Italy). I bought the Kodak EZ 200 so I could send pictures of him to them and I just love it!  It takes GREAT shots - high quality, clear, great colours - and adjustable when printing if it's too dark or too light; good control of cropping.  The only negative is the instructions - sometimes they're confusing and inconsistent;  I'm still having trouble keeping it simple to download, select, and print the pictures...but the camera, which is ALWAYS in my purse, is terrific: tiny, lightweight, and a super buy!
