I just returned this camcorder this afternoon to Circuit City.  The picture quality indoors was a major, major disappointment!  Under normal lighting conditions the picture was grainy at best.  I used this camcorder for one week and in three different households all with the same dull, griany results.  My old 8mm camcorder has a much crisper, brighter and cleaner picture!  In additon to poor picture quality, the camcorder had focusing problems when panning the room at a normal pace.  I slowed my panning down and the focusing problems were still evident.  It would take a half a second for the image to come into focus.  At first I though it may be just the picture on the 2.5" LCD screen, but when I played the tape back on my big screen, the focus problems were caught on the tape.  The sound quality wasn't impressive either.  I'd give it a 3 at best.  It almost makes me wonder if this particlar camcorder was defective?  Who knows, I did not get a replacement and plan to do much more research on mini-dv's before I purchase another brand.
