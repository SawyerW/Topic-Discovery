I have the silver 98379 which isn't on Amazon.com anywhere otherwise I would leave my review there.I bought this product somewhere other than Amazon.com and have had problems with it right out of the packaging. The software isn't working at all. The LCD screen is kinda dark and the pictures from what I can see on the screen are horribly pixelated and off color. You would think that in this day and age where we can get gigs of storage on flash drives that are cheaper than this camera that the camera would be better built and would have a nicer picture quality.
