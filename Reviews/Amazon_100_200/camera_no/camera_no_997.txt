This camera is alright, its low price makes up for the quality, The buttons are very basic and somewhat annoying, and the lcd is a pain to see at in the sun. The picture quality in the day and proper lighting is great, but as soon as it becomes a bit dark the picture quality greatly decreases. The flash is not bad, and i would recommend having it on in doors or in the shade, because seriously this takes horrible pictures in low light. The camera does not have to many functions and is very basic, but what do you expect for the price. The video quality is actually not to bad, and so is the sound quality. This camera is good for the occasional user, but not for the person who is planning to take it out for the night and post photos online. If you need a camera to take pictures for your online company and products, this is a good option because of its high MP and ability to enlarge photos without getting pix-elated, and really low price.
