All I have to say is I have never taken so many pictures. This camera is smaller than my mobile phone and is always with me. The fact that it is also a great camera with a number of cool features is almost a bonus. Minus a star for the lack of autofocus assist light but you have to give up something to get everything else crammed into this tiny package. Prior to purchase I tested out the Canon SD110 and SD410 along with the Minolta Xi. This was by far the best of those models in speed and menu systems.
