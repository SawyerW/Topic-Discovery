This is my second Olympus Camedia.  The first one I bought 4 or 5 years ago.  I wanted one that took better close-ups for online auction pictures and this one is great!  I see some complaints about batteries, but this one is a lot better than the older model.  I am very pleased with the quality and the price of this camera.  My first one still works perfectly, just does not take good close-ups and really "eats" batteries.  I also purchased the AC adapter for this camera and use it indoors to save batteries.  I went through several Polaroid digital cameras before getting an Olympus.  The only complaint that I have with this camera is that when taking pictures on Easter, the auto focus knob on the back accidentally got turned and the pictures were fuzzy.  It is a little difficult for me to tell if the pictures are clear on the screen when shot.  I have to upload them to my computer to verify their sharpness.  Of course, my eyes aren't what they used to be.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.
