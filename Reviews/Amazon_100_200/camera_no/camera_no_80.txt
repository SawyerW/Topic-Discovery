Wow! Casio really did a great job in designing this camera. It's very small; when I got it out of the box I was a bit shocked at its size. It feels solid in my hand. The on/off button is nice and discreet; a cinch to turn on, but it wont turn on inside your pocket, thats for sure. The rechargable battery is just icing on the cake; it fully charges in less than two hours!This is a camera for a person who wants great quality pictures, but doesn't want to spend all their money on a 5 megapixel, 2.5 inch screen monster. I turn the size to 1 megapixel size anyway so the pictures don't take up a ton of space on my hard drive. 3.2 megapixels is more than enough. Highly recommended for a first time camera buyer.
