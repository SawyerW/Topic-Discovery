I bought the X31 to replace a dimage X that I had used real hard over the last couple years.  Great sized-camera, and it took amazing photos!  The dimage X was awesome, but couldn't handle the rough usage I put it through, with the lens cover finally wearing out.  The lithium battery life was also lame.  I finally had to replace it and made the mistake of buying the dimage X31.The only good thing about the dimage X31 is the use of standard AA batteries, although the batteries don't last long.  The exposure/focus is just horrible as compared to the dimage X.  The silly toggle switch is lame.  The menu is just plain difficult compared to the dimage X.  Also, the toggle switch between the video mode and still mode is placed in a stupid location.DONT BOTHER!
