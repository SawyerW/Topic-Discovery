Several points to take warning about this Camera:(1). Most serious: In one year since I owned the camera, theimage already shows two "Bright Spots" like the cell that felloff your retina of your eyeball, and every picture has thesespots in bright red color. I wonder if they are result of"PIXEL" that fell due to normal "were and tear"?Anyway, now I have to doctor every single picture I take bythis camera.(2). Second: the camera body feels delicate, almost ready tofall apart, maybe due to poor craftsmanship, maybe justplanned obsolescence!! (3). The setting up routing is too complicated, for collegemechanic department graduates only, definitely not forartistic type of person. (4). Poor manual, almost totally unintelligible! (5). I think this camera has serious flaws, both indesign and in craftsmanship. Olympus is too big a companyto suffer from bad reputation brought by this camera.But maybe it really doesn't care, thinking people willjust continue to buy their camera when one is out ofcommission within 1 year!!
