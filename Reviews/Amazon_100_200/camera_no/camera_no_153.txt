I owe alot to this little camera.  I just bought the nikon D80 and I am keeping it because it has never let me down.  It got me a job as a photographer with it's clear images and high resolution my clients were always stunned (i do architecture photography)...I now have a very succsessful freelance business and I am a PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER!I can't say enough on how much I appreciate the opportunity this camera gave me.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!Also I may add its a trooper...I have used and abused and never has it gotten wierd...People look at it and always tell me"wow big camera it looks very professional...and i would laugh and say nope its a pro-sumer camera...but its feels like a pro![............]***WARNING***This is not a camera for portraits or for action***BUT ITS GREAT FOR OUTDOORS, NATURE, ARCHITECTURE, ECT...
