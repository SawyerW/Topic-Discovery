This probably would have been a great camera if I'd been able to use it.  If you're interested in how well some of its features work, the other reviews will probably be more helpful.  However, if you want to know what to expect from Fuji technical support (which is an often overlooked feature of a product), I can tell you: Absolutely nothing.The camera I got was missing the SmartMedia card needed to store the pictures you take.  When I called Fuji's technical support and navigated through a labyrinthine phone-menu system, I was told ... was apparently not an "authorized dealer" or some stupid thing, and I would have to return the item.  They refused to simply ship me a replacement SmartMedia, instead forcing ME to go through the hassle of returning an item because of THEIR mistake.Are there any COMPETENT digital camera manufacturers out there?  This is the second camera I have bought in the past 6 months that I've ended up returning because it either didn't have the features it claimed, or was missing parts.  In both cases the technical support was utterly useless.  I don't think I'll ever purchase another digital camera again.
