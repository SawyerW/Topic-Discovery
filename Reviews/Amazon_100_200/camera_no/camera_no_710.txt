The two features that really stand out to me with the Mavica FD91 are the 14x optical zoom and the manual focus.  Those features make it into a very high quality camera.  I bought this camera thinking that it was an  advantage that it uses 3.5" disks instead of memory cards but I now  think I would rather it use memory cards just because it would hold more  pictures and I wouldn't have to carry around stacks of disks.  That's not  too big of a problem though because the quality of the pictures are  fantastic.  I use this camera all the time and would recommend it to others  that don't mind that it uses 3.5" disks.  If possible I would rate  this camera as about 4.7 stars but since its either a 4 or a 5 I gave it a  5 because it really is an excellent camera that deserves more than a 4.
