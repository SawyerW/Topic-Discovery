I need a system to manage multiple IP cameras to capture and record video and sound.  The included software works very well.  I give this camera a five star for outdoor and indoor image quality day or night.  The device needs a filter to settle air noise.  The night vision works really well.  I am running the camera wireless with WPA2 on a DIR625 router about 30ft away.  Wired and wireless image quality are equally good.  The camera responds to remote control within 1 second wired or wireless.  The only downside is you need to run electrical wiring or an outlet to the device.  If this device were power over ether and had an integrated speaker then it would be a truly great device.
