I was especially excited about receiving this camera.  I had looked for a digital camera for some time and loved the compact size and large screen that this one provided.  I had it for about 8 months when I went on my honeymoon in Hawaii.  I had not used it for that amount of consecutive time prior to this trip but of course was taking many shots of the scenery.  The camera started malfunctioning and locking up and not saving the picture that it locked up on.  This of course happened at very inopportune times and had to be reset many times as well, sometimes effectively and sometimes not.  I would say buyer be scared, especially if you are planning to use it a lot for one type of important event.  It probably was worth spending more money and getting a better name brand. The size of the lcd screen is great, however the quality of the pictures could be better.  Although you can change the picture quality size, a size for normal pictures that you would get is not included such as 4x6 and 8x10.  It does have a 5x7 size though.
