I had owned a non digital olympus camera for 8 years and never had any problems with it and now i have purchased the olympus stylus 750 which is my very first digital camera that i have owned now for 3 weeks and i love my new camera and could not have made a better choise.It is small and compact and very nice looking. I like that the olympus is weather proof. You get 45 minutes of video on one xd picture card or 586 pictures on one xd picture card. The picture quality and movie quality is sharp and excellent. It is very easy to get blurry free pictures. The camera was easy to learn and the buttons are easy to maneuver. I love all the functions on it like editing write from the camera. I love the Macro and super Macro and I did close up pictures of the 17 year cicadas with the Super Macro and the pictures came out so good and sharp the first time and i am so proud of those pictures. Again this is my first digital camera and i am very impressed with the camera.
