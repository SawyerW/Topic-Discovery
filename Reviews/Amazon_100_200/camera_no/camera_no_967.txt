I got this camera primarily for shooting outside and it's been exactly what I expected. I've owned 35 mm Nikons and two previous Coolpix. I love the foldable screen, image stabilization and long optical zoom. I recently took some photos inside our capitol rotunda in open shade. I was across the rotunda from the speaker [probably 40 - 50 yards or more] and on the 3rd floor, holding the camera against the balcony rail. I could still see the texture in cloth in the raw images.Camera is built like a tank. There's a lot of glass in the lens so one has to be aware of where the sun is -- but one should always do that anyway. Buy one, buy two!
