i have owned this camera for well over a year now. and it has served me great!this camera has so much less noise than my original 1d, and has a great responce time. everything is near instantanious. and image quality is outstanding!however, stacked against the 1d mk IIn, it pales in comparison. but thats what you get in comparing a flagship camera to a prosumer camera. however, the battery in the 20d is much suppieor, and the camera itself is smaller and lighter. the images from the 20d acually show more detail, but they are also more likely to be off in some way, just by the nature of the camera. the 5fps is great for sports or fast action. however, it could use a larger burst rate for raw images, like the 10d precursor.
