I've used my 750 for a month now and love it except for one thing. No viewfinder. Most ultra compacts don't have one but in bright sun it's tricky to see the display. I "reshopped" today and found a Canon Elph 800si but - it was only 3x optical zoom not 5x, it weighed more, cost $100 more, had fewer features and scenes (which I really use), wasn't weather resistant and was harder to "figure out". I decided to keep my 750 and just learn how to shield the display better. It takes great shots and the automatic scenes are easy to use and easy to switch among. Much easier than my old Olympus.
