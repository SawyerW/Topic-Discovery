I had this for a good few months now. While it did work OK initially, it started to act up about two months ago, then completely quit some 3 weeks ago. I've been communicating with their customer service since but at the speed they are moving, nothing will happen for the next 5 years...While it worked, it was OK. The picture quality was acceptable, worse than my Panasonic but usable. Not very easy to install.Every time the computer reboots, the cameras go offline and do not restart automatically so it becomes useless if a storm turns your power off for even a few seconds.The remote viewing was alright, too. But you cannot pan or tilt the camera so you are limited to whatever field of view you start with.Overall, it seems I just wasted close to $1000 on this system and it definitely does not deliver as advertised.Sorry, Logitech, it's pure junk.
