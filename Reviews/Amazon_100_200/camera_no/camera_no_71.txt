I bought this camera based on the looks and features and the good reviews on amazon, boy was i dissappointed.  Never believe everything ppl say on here.  The biggest dissapoinment is the picture quality.  I have 3 different digital cameras to compare side by side and this is the worst i've ever seen.  the pictures taken indoor turn out grainy and the colors are not as vibrant as the coolpix 4600 or the kodak easyshare.  on a bright sunny day it does take good pictures but not as good as the kodak easyshare or the olympus stylus i've used in the past. on a positive note, this camera is one of the best looking and i love the large lcd screen as well as the long battery life but what good does it do if it doesn't take good pictures.  i will have to put this one up for sale on the classifieds.
