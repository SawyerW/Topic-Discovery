I have a Macbook running a virtual machine on Parallels 5 and tried to set up the IP address with the provided CD.  After a half-hour or so I gave up and called tech support.  Call was answered promptly and soon I was speaking with a knowledgeable support person.  We tried a number of things, none of which worked.Finally, we connected the camera direct to the Macbook, changed the ip address of the Mac to 192.168.10.50 and the camera showed up immediately. Once I changed the address of the camera, it worked great in IE (Parallels 5); the CD installation program just would not recognize the camera under Parallels.I now have the camera set up in my lake home at it works great -- sends emails based on detection, decent night viewing, etc.  (Have no need for sound and thus have not tried it.)  I couldn't be happier.  Would have given it a 5 had there been a virtual machine warning.
