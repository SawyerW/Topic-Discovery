This is my 2nd digital camera after doing 35mm (Olympus OM-10) for about 20 years. I started with an Olympus D-510, but after getting used to it, I realized that I needed to upgrade to a camera with better resolution and more manual settings. The C-3020 was just what I needed, and my 35mm is now for sale. I love the special effects (try a few shots using "white board" and see what people think.)I think the biggest factor for me in choosing digital, besides the much lighter weight, is the ability to edit and alter my own pictures without being at the mercy of photo services.About the lens cap. I may be able to offer a tip to make it stay on a little better. When you put the cap on, start with the "Olympus" logo upside down as you face the lens. Put the cap on. Then, while applying light pressure to the cap, turn it clockwise until it is snug and the logo is upright. The pressure will allow one side of the cap to seat itself one groove farther in, making for a tighter fit.
