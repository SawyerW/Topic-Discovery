This is my first dSLR and I absolutely love it.  The camera fits really well into my hard -- others i looked at were a little smaller and didn't fit my hand (even though they are fairly small) as comfortably.  The default menu is great -- everything you need access to is right at your fingertips.  I bought the body only and upgraded the lens and I'm really glad that I did.  I knew I was going to want to upgrade to a lower fstop and saved money by just buying the body & upgrading right away.I would highly recommend this camera!
