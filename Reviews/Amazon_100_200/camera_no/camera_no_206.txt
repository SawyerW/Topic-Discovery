It doesn't get any better at this price point. Excellent build quality, very easy to use, and intuitive. The optics are simply brilliant for a kit lense (135MM).Went from a Canon Rebel film SLR which I loved, but when I tried to move into the XTi, there was just no comparison between the XTi and the D80. You could immediately feel the difference in quality and functionality. And the auto-clean feature is absolute marketing crap from Canon. THe CMOS shakes off the dust, but then where does the dust go? Bologna feature, not to mention the Flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up on the Canon XTi.The D80 blows it away, and for it's price there is nothing out there better. If your in the market at this price point, or relatively close, just go for it. You WILL NOT regret this purchase.
