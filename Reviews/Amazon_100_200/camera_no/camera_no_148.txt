Being a Pentax fan from the SF-10 film days, I was delighted to see the Pentax *ist DS body at an affordable price.  Being into recycling from the early 70's, I was thrilled to be able to use  my Pentax 28-80 and 70-210 lenses, as well as my flash attachments and remote control.  Going from film to digital, the old lenses actually convert to about 45-100 and about 125-310.  Only sacrifice is a smaller wide angle, but makes up in the closeups!Easy to use both in automatic and manual modes, good color and depth of field.  For both the newbie and advanced phototgrapher, this camera offers it all.  Only 1 disadvantage would be the size if you are used to a small pocket digital camera - peronally, I love the size and balance.First photo (uploaded on this site) is of a hummingbird and a honeybee making a beeline for the hummer!  Amazed the camera caught the split second action!Other reviews go into detail on the specs - I just simply love this camera!
