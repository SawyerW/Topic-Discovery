I have been exceptionally successful taking some beautiful outdoor shots with this camera.  Well-lit indoor shots also turn out well, but I've had some trouble getting darker photos to look good.  I don't know whether the flash is weaker than other comparable cameras, but I feel as if the indoor photos some of my friends take are more impressive than mine.  As nice as it is to have all of the available pre-set "scenes", I don't feel that the night settings work without a tripod to hold the camera absolutely still.The sound recorded by this camera is of understandably-mediocre quality, and the same can probably be said for the video.  One other potential issue:  the documentation that comes with the camera is pretty poor, so you may feel the need to look online for instructions on how to use more advanced features (especially if you haven't had another modern digital camera).  All told, the camera was probably a bit overpriced when I bought it 1-1/2 years ago, but it's been fun.  I've taken ~1200 pictures with it (although not nearly all of them were good), and I expect to take thousands more.
