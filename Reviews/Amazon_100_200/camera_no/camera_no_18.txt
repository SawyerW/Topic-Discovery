This map is useful for planning while sitting in the comfort of your home, or perhaps navigating the road system from your car, but is not, repeat not, a backcountry paddling map. We brought this map on a week-long kayak trip. The detail is insufficient to navigate the everglades. Entire islands are missing from the map, some of which are substantial in size (10s of acres) and other island are misshapen. If your compass skills are  solid you can get by usually if sticking to the outer islands, but one should certainly buy the nautical chart for Everglades. No where on the map does it say "not intended for navigational use." It should say this in big red letters on the front. This is the first time a trails illustrated map has failed us.
