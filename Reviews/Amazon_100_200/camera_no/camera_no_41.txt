I have this camera about 4 months now, and I'm still in awe. It is just brilliant.  The body is very robust. It isn't light, but feels solid in your hands. It's well balanced and easy to grip.The battery life is just great.  I've taken about 1200 photos on a single battery charge.  I have not yet even considered the need to buy the extension battery grip with an extra battery.All the functions are within easy finger reach. It is so easy to adjust the settings as you go. I am still learning how to use things.  I guess so far I've taken in excess of 20,000 photos.One little gripe would be sensor dust. I've a small speck of dust somewhere (on the sensor I assume), and I can't seem to get rid of it.  Nothing to ruin my photos though.  It's not an uncommon thing with any dSLR.  A cleaning kit is essential with this camera.I already have a small collection of Canon lenses. The combination gives me excellent quality photos.Bottom line - if you're thinking of buying a Digital SLR, this one should come very high on your list of options. I would recommend it to everyone.
