I have had this camera for about 3 weeks now and am very happy with it. The image quality is very good with good color and contrast and sharp images. They are not as good as my father's Canon Digital Rebel, but then his camera also cost 3 times as much. I have printed the photos on my Epson Stylus C84 (also available at Amazon, and highly recommended) and the results have been truly great. I got the printer because of the camera, and the 2 are a perfect team!It is a nice size to hold, not too big and not too small. The features are many and it has many manual controls, including flash level, focus, and many other things you would not expect on a camera like this. The only real feature that I have found sometimes not that great is the AiAf (artificial intelligence auto focus), sometimes it is not artificially intelligent but instead genuinely stupid. It is possibly to manualy control the focus on the camera though. Pros:Good picturesLots of control when wantedLots of featuresSolid build qualityCons:AiAf can sometimes be just plain stupid
