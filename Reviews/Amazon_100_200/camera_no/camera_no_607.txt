If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I purchased this for a simple, 1-camera surveillance system to keep an eye on my pets. The instructions make it sound like it can be done in less than an hour, but over 12 hours later I still cannot get the software to recognize my USB port no matter how many times I moved it, restarted the software, and started completely over. The program also could not be removed from my computer since it was always "on," and there was no way it would let me turn it off. I had to do a complete system restore to get it off my computer. Take my advice, unless you like to work through impossible-to-solve computer hassles, leave the surveillance systems to the pros. I'm calling Best Buy today to have them come out to install one of theirs for a little more money than what I paid for this junky product. It would have been worth it for me to go with Best Buy initially rather than lose an entire day trying to figure out how to get this junk to work.
