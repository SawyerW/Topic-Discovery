I was upgrading from point-and-shoot digital.  The choice was between the Canon Rebel XT, Nikon D70, and the Canon 20D.  I am glad that I footed the extra cash for the 20D and even the IS 17-85 lens.  It's well worth the investment for budding enthusiasts/amateurs like myself.  Like playing a violin, you can't really be inspired to do better and do more if you don't have the right instrument.PRO: FAST system in turning on and triggering, 5 shots/sec bursting (for great children pictures), 1/8000th second shutter speed (fun water pictures), 9-point auto-focusing system, solid feel of the body, ease of menu and yet plenty of options.IMPROVEMENT: The door for the memory card is a bit loose as it is on the back side of the right hand grip.  The shutter is a bit loud if you don't want the turning heads in a quiet setting (but even then it's not so unacceptable as you do have a nice camera to show off!).17-85 IS LENS: Way better than the cheap stock lens!  Image stabilization is great especially if you don't like shooting with a flash.
