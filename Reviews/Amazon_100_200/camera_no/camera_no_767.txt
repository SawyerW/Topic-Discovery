I've had one of these for about 18 months...after a year of ownership it started eating DV tapes. I've had three destroyed when rewinding...you get an error message and the next thing you know your tape is in ribbons. Fortunately, I found a place that will repair them but it is expensive ($30 per tape).I contacted JVC about the problem...they were aware that their camcorders have this kind of issue but because mine was outside the warranty period they declined to do anything for me. If you do buy this camcorder (or already have it) try getting a separate miniDV rewinder for around $20. I've only had the tapes get eaten while rewinding.If you're still in the market for a camcorder...don't buy this one!
