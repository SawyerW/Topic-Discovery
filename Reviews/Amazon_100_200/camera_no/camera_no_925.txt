Fantastic camera. This camera is probably the smallest one in the market today (I consider it smaller than the new slim Sony T1, which is only thinner (just a bit) but much wider). Pentax loaded this small machine with more functionalities that you can even imagine: B&W, sepia, green photos without the need to use a photo editor. Shoot in museums, snow, portrait, landscapes, sun, night, etc, by just selecting the appropriate occasion on the display and the camera will automatically adjust the exposure and speed. Good battery, won't die on you in the middle of the day.The only cons until now is that it may be too small! Watch out not to leave it on a restaurant table!Suggestion: Buy the pentax case PTX-L40. You'll pay a little premium on this case but it fits the camera well so that you do not buy a small camera and put it on a huge case (buy a huge camera then!).If you are looking for portability, without lacking functionalities (optical zoom, 4 megapixels, good battery life) this is the way to go. Buy with confidence, Pentax has been specializing in the camera market for decades!Hope this helps,JC
