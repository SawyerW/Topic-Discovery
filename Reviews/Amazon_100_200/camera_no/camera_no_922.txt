...and I really mean it!!My brother gave me this camera as a belated Christmas gift last year and I love him for it.  He searched high and low for this particular camera and after going to 8 different stores, he ended up ordering it from Amazon.  I have gotten so many compliments on my pictures.  The clarity is just over the top!!  Some pictures (the Magic Kindom castle, the cruise ship and the Washington Monument) look like postcards; they're so crystal clear.  I love taking pictures and being able to go home and print as many copies as I want the same day.  And I love making little videos and slide presentations to view on my widescreen tv.I've directed atleast 4 other people to Amazon to order this camera.  I can't say enough about it.My recommendation, BUY IT, USE IT, ENJOY IT!!! And don't forget to get the printing dock too!!
