If you're a complete beginner to the world of SLR photography, you should probably pick up a different book first to get a better understanding of aperture, ISO, focal length, etc. However, if you have a basic knowledge of photography, own a T3 and want to get the most out of it, this book is a must have. This book covers nearly every feature of the camera in great detail and offers good examples of when to use certain features, along with explanations and suggestions for making necessary compromises to achieve the results you want from any type of shot you're trying to capture.
