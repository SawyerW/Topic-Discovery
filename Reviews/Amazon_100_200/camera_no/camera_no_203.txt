The EXILIM-Z700 7MP is the handiest digital camera I've used yet.  The large viewing screen is bright enough that I've never "blacked out" on a sunny day.  This is especially important because there is no optical view finder.  The controls are well placed and easy to operate, even with large hands (like mine).  The 7.2 MP make for a great picture.  Another nice feature is the recharging stand/viewer/downloader.  Instead of laying the camera down while wires come out of it, this stand holds the camera at a convenient viewing angle for looking through the contents.  The battery has a nice capacity so it does not need repeated charges.The only downside is one of shape.  It's so small, thin and light it's easy to lose out of a pocket.  That's more the fault of the operator than the camera.
