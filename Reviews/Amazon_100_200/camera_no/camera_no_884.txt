This is my first digital camera and I absolutely love it.  I am a computer guy myself, so the basic come a little easier to me than others but even my wife (not so much the computer person) is able to use it without reserve and she prefers it better than our still camera.The shooting modes are easily accessible on the top dial.  You can switch from AUTO, to camcorder, to action shots within seconds.  I can get 137 pix out of one 128mb card.  The battery life is great.  I DEFINITELY recommend rechargables!There are a couple little *quirks* about it like the fact that there are two menus which can be a pain if you know you saw a feature somewhere but don't remember exactly which menu had it.  Plus I can't figure out a way to get a date on the print.  It may be there but then I'd have to read the manual :-)Otherwise, you simply can't beat this camera for the price.  Get it now before Canon phases it out.  There are two newer models out there now so the clock is ticking!
