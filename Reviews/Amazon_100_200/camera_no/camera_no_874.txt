Bought this camera along with the accessory pack for my daughter as a college graduation present in May 2004.It recently dropped out of her purse into a puddle, it was in its case.  It worked initially, then stopped working.The company offers nothing to replace or fix this camera other than she can spend 150.00 to get a refurbished one or she can send it in to be repaired which would cost over 200.00.That seems out of line for a camera which cost 219.00 originally and you can get now for 175.00.They didn't even offer to look at it for no fee and give options for repair or credit for purchase of another canon camera.She was very happy with the performance of this camera and is devistated that all is now lost. I will be hesitant to purchase another canon product.
