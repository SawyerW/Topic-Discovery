I bought this camera because I'm a "tweaker," and I like to have as many controls as possible.  This camera has full manual control, which is unequaled in the price range.  I also have to take pictures under stage lighting conditions, which can be difficult.  This camera gets it done, most of the time on the automatic setting.That said, here are my problems:1. The optical viewfinder is pretty much useless.  In the manual, it says that it only represents about 85% of what the picture will actually be.  I'm not sure why they did this, or why they haven't fixed it, as I'm led to believe it's common to all of the powershot series.  Luckily, the battery life (even with standard alkalines) is good enough to use the LCD screen as the viewfinder, and you can turn the LCD off between shots if you want.2. There is no battery meter.  Right before the camera is about to shut off, a little icon flashes on the screen.  This is very annoying, and you have to carry extra batteries in case it shuts off with the lenscap open.
