My 12 year old daughter came to me with some money she had saved and asked to buy a camera. I looked and looked trying to find a pink camera at a good price, with all the features she wanted, and would last her for years to come. I am pleased to say this camera fit the bill. I was tickled to find out she needed very little instruction from me on its use and she was able to follow the directions for the install with no troubles. I had to help her with some trouble she had removing pictures a couple of times otherwise no issues with the camera itself.
