I have been using the A70 for 9 months now with over 10000 photos taken.  Not even a single problem with the camera. I use a 256 Mb memory cart and standard bty.  I often take over 150 photos on a single set of bty.  When buying them in lots of 48 per pack at $20 you cannot go wrong.  I just return from a month vacation in France where I took over 600 photos.  All of them turned out picture perfect.  I would recommend buying this camera to anyone particulary new commers in the digital field as it is very easy to use.  Sorry no E18 errors.
