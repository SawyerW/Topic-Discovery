I bought this for unknown reasons. I guess on a whim. But this is a dummy proof camera, it has a dial that you turn for all kinds of backrounds. I also have the Olympus 410 stylus. The photos are equal in quality only I feel this one to me is more durable. Takes 2 batteries and I put in a spare 32 memory card. I take the card out and use the HP Photosmart 375 and it prints fantastic photos! I notice there was another review downing the camera but for $140.00 I think it is a great deal. We just retired our first Olympus which I purchased years ago for $700. And it still takes great photos! I guess I will give it to my 8 year old. I am very pleased with this item, highly recommended. It's a basic camera and just a closing note there is no viewfinder you shoot through the monitor so you get what you see. I gave it to my 21 year old who is returning to new zealand in a month.
