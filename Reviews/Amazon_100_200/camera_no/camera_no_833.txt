Basically my headline says it all.  I love this camera's ability to set f stops, shutter speeds,  ASA/ISO speeds,  under/over- exposure etc etc.  Particularly useful to me is the ISO 400 setting -- set the camera there you can take lots of pics indoors without a flash (like film cameras usibg hi speed film,  the images will be grainy,  but useable).The main problem is the lens.  It performs overall less well than my 2 previous digital cameras (Fuji 2400 and 2800,  which regularly gave me tack sharp pictures).  This lens gives you OK shots,  but often without that extra edge of definition,  despite the high number of pixels.  There is a fair amount of flare at large apertures,  and the program modes like to keep the lens wide open and aim for higher shutter speeds. One workaround to this problem is to use the aperture proiority mode and to stop the lens down to f 4.5 or so.I am keeping this camera because of all the creative control it gives me,  but I still have a Fuji 2400 in my desk drawer when I need to take a really sharp product photo for ebay.
