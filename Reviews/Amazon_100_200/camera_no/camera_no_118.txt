This is an okay digital camera, but I was expecting better quality, especially with it being a Sony.  I was disappointed with the flash- it does not illuminate as well as my other Sony cybershot (DSC-U20), which was surprising.  Some of the pictures also come out more blurry as well- the reason I purchased it was for the zoom and was expecting it to be at least of the quality that I get with my U20 (which does not have a zoom feature).  The accessories are nice- I also purchased the waterproof case and it works well with it, but it was almost half the price of the camera itself.
