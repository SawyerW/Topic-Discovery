I spent quite a bit of time researching digital cameras in the 300 dollar or less range before purchasing this camera.  I am pleased that I picked the Canon A70 camera.  Uses AA batteries, rechargeable or alkaline.  So if the rechargeable batteries go dead on you, just slap some standard AA batteries in and continue shooting.  Uses relatively inexpensive CompactFlash cards.  Has manual overide capability if you want, so you can take total control of your shots.  The 15 fps movie mode with sound is awesome.  The camera can take a 640X480 movie clip of 3 minutes in length and produces about a 20MB file.  Of course you can take many of these 3 minute clips as long as you have space on your CompactFlash card.  320X240 movie clip lengths are only limited by the amount of free space on your memory card.  Definitely a good buy.
