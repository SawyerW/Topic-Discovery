Fantastic, amazing camera. It becomes an extension of your mind. Easy to hold, fast response, fast and accurate focusing, great features, great lens. I love the LCD status screen on the top of the camera -- it's much easier than using the color LCD on the back for basic functions.Quibbles:1) No sensor cleaner. I do get dust on the sensor. Lots of it. If you change your lenses at all, think hard about this.2) No image stabilization in the camera body, or on the kit lens.3) The flash wants to pop up in situations where I'd prefer not to use it, and shutting it off constantly is a minor annoyance.
