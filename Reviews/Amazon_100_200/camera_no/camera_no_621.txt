I purchased this and went down to Costa Rica to snap pictures. I think it took excellent pictures, and a friend there begged me to sell it to them, so I did. But, I want to say, it was a great camera while I had it. I really liked the fact that I could put 2 AA batteries in it and not some battery pack that I had to charge. Just a matter of convenience, battery packs always die when you are somewhere without a spare or a way to recharge quickly. I travel quite frequently to third world countries and batteries are sometimes easier to locate than an electrical outlet.
