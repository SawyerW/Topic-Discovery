I purchased the A70 after some intensive reviewing of the current cameras in this low to mid-range price catagory.I had narrowed my choices down to two canidates the A70 and the Nikon 3100. With the Nikon I really liked the sample pictures I saw taken with it and its recessed LCD screen, but it lacked the plethora of features the Canon came with.Post Purchase...I could not be more happy with it! It takes super clear/sharp pictures (Just as good as the Nikon samples I saw).The non-recessed LCD screen is not that serious a problem with normal/thoughtful handling.The extra features and the complete manual control the canon offers really makes for a fun camera someone can grow with.Its size is perfect-fits right in the palm of your hand.And the images download easily via the USB port into the computer.Oh, did mention it takes great pictures?I had debated a long time on which camera to purchase, and need not have worried. The Canon A70 is a bargain.
