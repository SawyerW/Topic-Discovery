I bought this camera for my wife and she loves it.  The main reason I considered it was because of the easy to navigate menus.  Compared to Sony, Canon and Nikon, the menus on this camera make it easy.  This camera is very simple to use and takes great pictures.  Turns on a less that a second and has a super fast button-to-shutter release.  The battery also lasts for a very long time.  We took the camera to Mexico for 9 days and using the camera everyday we never had to recharge it.  We actually used it for a few days after we got back as well.  The only reason we even recharged it is because we were going away for a few days again and wanted a full charge. Excellent buy...
