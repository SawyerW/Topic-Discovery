This camera is worth every penny! The price is VERY right for this high quality camera.The build quality of it is above average, though the hinges of the smart media door have some wiggle room, its not alot (less than a millimeter). Overall, its got a hefty solid feeling to it.The veiwfinder is very hard to use for people with glasses though.battery life is average from what you'd expect from a digicam.Image quality is pretty good, not great...Great camera for the money, if you're looking for a simple point and shoot camera to easily store all your memories, THIS IS IT!
