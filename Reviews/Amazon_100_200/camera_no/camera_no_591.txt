I bought this system after repeated vandalization of my workspace.  The set-up was super easy, even for a techno challenged person like me.  Everything recorded to my office computer with motion activation of the camera, and the evidence was easy to email to my supervisor.  It worked slick... catching a coworker in the act.  I highly recommend this system.I did purchase the subscription to enable alerts to my cell phone and remote access from home.  Not really necessary, but I was able to log in from home to see what was happening in my office... which I found convenient.I HIGHLY recommend this system!!
