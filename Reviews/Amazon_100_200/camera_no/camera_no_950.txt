Very good camera but I feel one needs to be a little bit pro in operating this camera. Auto mode doesn't always work good. The SCENE-> Indoor/party mode was good when taking pictures indoors and under light.Few photographs still had some red eye. I think Nikon claims that this is the first camera with inbuilt red-eye reduction. Though red-eye is not eliminated in all the snaps, most of the snaps didn't had any red-eye and they really look great. Also, most of the snaps are shaken probably due to the manual movements while taking the picture. But all the photographs taken using a tripod weren't shaken and are really good.The camera performed very good in pitch dark.Except for the automode which was not working well (when compared to SCENE->INDOOR mode)everything in this small package is great. I really like this camera very much. I had a Kodak DX series before in which the auto mode was very decent and works well indoors and outdoors. And thats probably why I feel the auto mode is bad.Finally, I would say this is a great camera. I would have given 5*'s but due to auto mode, I will have to cut one.
