I bought this camera a few months back and I have been testing it to it's limits! This camera by far is the best digital I ever own, and for the price it really is great!! I know there are better cameras out there, but I can take pro-shots without paying the pro-prices. I do suggest however, no matter how much of a pro you think you are, you should take time to fiddle with all of the features...I found some to be great shortcuts, and great for some artsy shots.I am a graphic designer, and this camera is great for anyone! My main reason to purchase this was to take away from photoshop time, and actually get great pictures without using a bunch of filters...Buy this camera, you won't be disappointed!
