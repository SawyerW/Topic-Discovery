The Coolpix 2000 is a easy-to-use digital camera with two important features: 3x optical zoom and great picture quality.  However, it lacks a viewfinder, so you must use the LCD screen to shoot pictures, which is awkward and annoying.  I thought this problem was gone on all but the cheapest DCs.  Guess not.  Another problem is that the path to deleting photos is a little confusing at first.  This is the perfect camera to keep in the car for emergencies or to use for work.  If you're serious about digital photograpy, though, spend a little extra on a [more expensive camera].  You'll be happy you did.
