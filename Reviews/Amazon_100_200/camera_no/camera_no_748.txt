I've enjoyed the camera quite a bit, it's a lot more then a begginer point and shoot camera. It offers all manual modes also you can control either the apreture and the exposure will be automatically calculated or you can control the shutter and the apreture will be automatically calculated, or you can go all manual where you will your self set everything up shutter/apreture and even manual focus if so desired!It's a bit complex to figure it out at first but it's well worth it. The picture quality i've recived from this camera is excellent.In addition the 40 second movie mode is also quite a bit of fun.
