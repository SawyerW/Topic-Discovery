This is an OK entry level digital camera.  It's small and well built, not a cheesy piece of junk.  When it manages to focus on the subject, it takes pretty decent photos.  There lies the rub.  The focusing system is worthless.  It picks random points within the field of view to focus on and I have not found a way to make it consistantly focus on the center of the frame.  The small lens picks up no light, so every indooor shot is a flash photo, which leads to red eye and flash bounce from everything.  The time between finger press to shutter release in agonizingly long.  Half the time, you'll move the camera thinking something is wrong just as it's releasing the shutter.If you can deal with these problems, then it's not a bad system.  I would go the next level higher and get one that you can actually pick what gets focused on.My 2 cents.
