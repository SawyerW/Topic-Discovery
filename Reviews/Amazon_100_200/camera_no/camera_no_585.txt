I purchased the WiLife Digital Video Security system to nab "Goldilocks."  The system was extremely easy to set up and install.  I've attempted to activate the mobile alerts, but have not been successful.  I need to read the directions in more detail.  The video saves to an external hard drive that is hidden.The color and clarity of the video is excellent.  The sensitivity to movement is amazing.  The camera starts recording when faint shadows or reflective light passes through the recording area or when someone is standing at the door (behind the curtain).The system has other benefits as well.  The kids don't know we have it.  It has come in handy resolving sibling rivalries and who started what and how...  ;o)  also captured some interesting dance moves by the five year old when he was supposed to be eating his lunch.It's a great system that I highly recommend for any home or small office.
