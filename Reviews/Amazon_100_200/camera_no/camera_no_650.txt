For some reason I was under the assumption the camera was compatible with Macintosh. I could have sworn I read a review from a person that was using it with a Mac. After reading the manual though, I thought,"No big deal I'll just use it through Boot Camp Window on the Mac". After messing with it for hours trying to get all of the settings to work I finally determined it did not want to play with my Airport Wireless router. What a disappointment.This may be a fine camera for those in the Windows environment, but I will never know as I had to return it.
