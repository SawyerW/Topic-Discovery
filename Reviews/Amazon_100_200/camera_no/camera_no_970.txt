I finally found the solution to the problems created by pocket-size cameras I can't use because they look the same on the front, back, top and bottom. The Nikon Coolpix brings the feel of a real camera back in my hands. Now, with the Coolpix, I can grab it and know which end to point at my sub just. As a former professional photographer,  The Coolpix matches the quality of my medium formate Pentax 645 and is a great backup or replacement in situations where ease of use is a must. It's fast and reliable and in most situations is all you;ll need to get any job done in a professional manner. The cost should never be a deterrent when peace of mind is at the highest level with this point and shoot.
