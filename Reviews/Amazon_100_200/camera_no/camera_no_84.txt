I had done a lot of research prior to buying this camera. I previously had owned an Olympus Camedia C-2020 (2.1 megapixels) with which I had not had any problems, but I was ready for the next generation of digital cameras. I needed a smaller size, but more capabilities, especially more zoom. I had narrowed by choices to the Canon S1 IS, the Olympus c-765 or C-770 or the Fuji S-5000.A local photo shop hosted a manufacturers rep day and I went and had some great conversation. When I first saw this camera I was amazed at all it could do, despite it's small size. 5x optical zoom, 20x total zoom, 7.1 megalpixels and a size that allows it to be carried in your pocket. You can read all the fancy specs at a lot of good review sites, checkout [...] but before you buy a camera in the $400-$550 range, check out the Olympus S-7000.
