I have been in contact with the company who produces this device (in Hong Kong).  I sent a detailed explanation (with graphics) showing how the software failed to work as advertised.  I found others who wrote reviews complaining of the same problem: it won't send emails when motion is detected.  They send me new drivers (didn't help) and send me of new CD (of the SAME version of the software).  the last time I asked if they were going to update the software, they apologized for the faulty hardware and suggested I return it to them for replacement.  It's clear they don't understand nor have they tested the software properly.If you want to monitor 4 video cameras, it works.  If you want the software to do everything as advertised, forget it.Kent
