I am a digital camera newbie.  I've had my camera for about a year (shame on me), and have only used it for point and shoot.  I finally decided I should learn to use it, so I purchased this book.  It is very easy to follow for beginners like me, but he makes recommendations for you more advanced users to move on to the next page in order to skip the basics that would probably bore you. In the short time I've had this book, I've learned so much!  His writing style is engaging and easy to read.  He doesn't get caught up in a lot of technical jargon, but explains things very clearly.  I had bought another book to help me and had to toss it.  This book has been very beneficial since it is specifically about my 5100 and not going back and forth about the Canon and the Nikon like so many others. I am excited to play with my camera again in fun new ways.  This book has been a major help!
