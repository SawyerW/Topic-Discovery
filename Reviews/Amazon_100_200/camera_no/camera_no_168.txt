This camera is pretty fast and is small enough to be kept in your pocket to be used if a photo opportunity occurs.  It also offers wide screen modes for taking videos (704x384) in addition to an excellent standard resolution (640x480).My one concern was it looked like all the pictures I took were blurry in the review screen on the back of the camera; after I take a shot, the image appears for a few seconds for review and then goes back to capture mode- and all of the review shots looked out of focus.  I uploaded the images to my computer and they looked fine.  I also went back to the camera and put it in play mode and they also looked great- so I think that the scaling of the review image (from 7.2MP t0 230K) after taking a picture is to blame for this; and (perhaps) will be fixed with a future firmware update.All in all, this is a great camera.  I keep it with me as much as possible and it has given me some awesome pictures.
