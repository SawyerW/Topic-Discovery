This camera takes unique pictures people search far and wide for cameras  with this character of pictures and still don't find them. Lomo comes to mind.With the exception of the lousy battery life this is a winner. There are battery off mods found on the internet. I intend to build an external batterybox for mine. Use rechargeables and carry extras. Don't put the battery in until you are ready to shoot.update October 2013 I've just discovered the Eneloop batteries work better in the camera and NIMH batteries. Still adviseusing a battery off mod since the internal memory will run down the battery otherwise.
