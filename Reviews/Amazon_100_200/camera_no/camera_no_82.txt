This camera is very nice!!  Considering that I was a little skeptical due to reading a few (not many) negative reviews.  The camera is very small and stylish!!  I tried to take a picture in the dark, and this camera made the photo capture look like I had all the lights on!!  For those of you considering to buy this camera, it's a good buy for those that want a point and shoot camera.  The controls are very easy to use, and I like the fact that I can customize camera startup to display my most favorite photo selection on the 2.0" lcd screen!!
