I was very interested in purchasing this item but information on the software needed to actually make use of it was not included here *or* on the manufacturer's product information on their web site.  I had to actually DOWNLOAD the software for this product to finally see that IT IS A MICROSOFT WINDOWS-ONLY PRODUCT.  It won't work on Mac OS X, Linux, or any other OS.  I wish they would be clear about that upfront.Unless I'm missing something, for a Mac or iPhone user, it's just an expensive paperweight.Also, it seems to only support 802.11b/g, not n, so it won't have nearly the range of the Cisco Linksys WVC80N camera that has the same basic video specs (but no IR LEDs or panning/tilting/zooming).
