I already had a K20D (which was my first dSLR) when I came up on this one in the used market for an excellent deal. I bought it primarily for two reason, for its TTL compatibility and as a second, walk-around camera body.After updating the camera with the latest firmware, I mated it with a used Pentax-FA 28-70mm f4 and Pentax-DA 50-200 f4-5.6 (excellent Pentax lenses that offer awesome value for the money, btw) as a back-up walk-around system. This setup follows me most places and contributes to about 70% of what I shoot.For a camera without SR (Shake Reduction), this camera does a superb job, and I have a lot of keepers to prove it. Among the other things I love about this camera is its powerful pop-up flash and compatibility with AA (I use Sanyo Eneloops) batteries.For the money (in the used market), I think the Pentax *ist DS offers one of the best values among dSLRs.
