this camera is good for most amateur snap shots, but when it comes to sports shots, it lacks. the reason for this is that it does not allow for manual adjustment of shutter speed. this is not a very advanced skill for photographers. in fact, it is impossible to take mation shots with this camera. sure, there is a 4 shot burst mode, but that makes you take 4 shots and takes up memory. just so you know what the limitations are on this camera. also, with 4.1 megapixels, you will want to upgrade the memory card. as opposed to another review posted.
