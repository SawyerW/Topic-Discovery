While I am a very experienced photographer who has a Master's Degree in Fine Arts Photography and has owned Nikon cameras since 1969, I needed something beyond the Nikon supplied Owner's Manual for this camera. I looked at David Busch's larger guide to this camera and felt it was overkill for my needs. That being said, this book is just right. I bought the camera as a supplement to my D200 because I was intrigued with it's versatile, movable LCD screen.  I wanted to find out quickly how to use all the whizz bang features. This book does all I wanted and more.Because the D5100 is an entry level camera it contains some information that is much more fundamental than I need. The book is still a great resource. I recommend it to anyone who purchases this fascinating new camera from Nikon.
