This was a decent little camera for it's time.  By today's standards it's a bit bulky for the megapixils it offers.  There is a design problem with the battery cover / door.  It's on the bottom corner of the camera and spring-tensioned.  It is pushed down and slid it into a locked position, held by little plastic tabs.  These tabs break off easly, leaving the battery door hanging partially open.  The camera still works, though you may have to use your pinky to tension the battery door.  When travelling we've bumped into a number of people at tourist spots with the same camera.  Most have broken battery doors.  I like the photos it takes, but this flaw that would prevent me from buying it again.
