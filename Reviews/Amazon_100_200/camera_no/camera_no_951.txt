This is a replacement for a product that I have used to death in my travels to Europe and Japan.  It's an excellent camera that I purchased for taking photos of artifacts in museums up close... and flowers... not to mention the usual scenery shots.  Great lens, easy to understand settings.  I do recommend that you NOT drop the camera in Trafalgar Square or spill Coke on the lens cover (the old one used to stick because of it).  Despite all my abuse, the old version still worked but the battery door no longer closes and the battery falls out, so when I saw this deal, I just HAD to get it.  It's like my love affair with the 1980 Honda Accord Hatchback- I bought 3 because I loved that particular model so much.  The new camera is perfect. This will make a great gift for my relatives who are gadget-averse but want a digital camera.
