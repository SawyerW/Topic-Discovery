1.  I know it really doesn't make much sense to write a review on a camera that has been discontinued for many years, but I just wanted to document that this camera is still one of the best cameras I've ever owned / used.  I continue to use it as my primary camera (mainly for snap shots)--> and it just produces excellent shots; both in JPEG and RAW (I mainly shoot RAW).  The wide angle and macro lens are also excellent.2.  The main cons are that of:  a.  very very very slow RAW write times.  b.  ... I think that's my only beef.3.  It's sad that essentially most camera companies have abandoned RAW in their compact cameras (current exception Panasonic and Olympus... and I guess Fuji E900).  However, I have renewed hope with the recent announcement that the Canon G9 will again have RAW capabilities.  It would be even greater news if Sony came out with a "V4".4.  Main point:  if you want a semi-compact camera that'll deliver amazing results and can actually find one of these, you definitely will not be dissapointed.  Kudos to Sony for producing this gem.
