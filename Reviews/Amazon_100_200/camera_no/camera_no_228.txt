I consider myself an amateur, but this camera makes me look like a pro.  If you are new to digital SLR, than this can be great camera to start and grow with; The D80 allows you to pretty much use it like a point and shoot (using the auto mode), but has many of the advance functions like the D200.  Also, if you are changing up from the proverbial "point and shoot," this camera can make you look like a pro!  You will soon be finding yourself looking for two or three great Nikkor lenses to go with it.  Though a little a on the expensive side, I recommend the Nikkor 12-24mm and/or the 70-200mm 2.8 VR.  Enjoy!
