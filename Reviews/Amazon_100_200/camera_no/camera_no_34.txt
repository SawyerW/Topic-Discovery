The add stated the camera was in good condition and used very little.  When I opened the box I found everything sealed in its original packaging.  This camera had never been out of the box.  I couldn't believe it.  It was a state of the art camera when it was first sold and I feel it still is.  There are so many bells and whistles on it, it will take me years to learn how to use them all.  I use it only for astrophotography through a telescope.  What took me one hour to time expose an object on film, in the past, can now be caught in 15 seconds on its digital chip.  Great camera.
