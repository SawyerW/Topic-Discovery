I have been very pleased with this camera. Its ease of use, navigation guides and quality of picture. Being able to take movie clips is a nice feature,something my previous camera did not have.A sunset picture off my deck came out quite nice using the guide, something I was never able to achieve with my previous camera.I would suggest getting a one gig card if you want to do movies.The quality of movies is not great but of  sufficient use.Lack of a viewfinder is a negative in sunny conditions but I suspect that would add greatly to the size of the camera.Its a shirt pocket fit as is.
