I recently just took a college trip across Europe and brought this camera. I used it in low light settings, with the flash off in museums, out the window on a bus tour, at night, in the day time, while walking.. anything you can thing of I did. It worked out perfectly. I thought that the picture quality was amazing and it is extremely simple to use. If you want a small compact flashy camera where you do not have to constantly adjust the settings, this is the perfect camera.I do not have much experience with camera knowledge, but the picture quality to me seemed perfect. I do not use it for making pictures large, but just to have my own personal pictures and send to others, as well as print out 3x5's.I actually dropped my camera off of a cliff, climbed down to get my memory card (of course the camera was broken) and I just bought the exact same one today.) I love it!!No complaints on this one!
