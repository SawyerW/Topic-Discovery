I loved this camera for its size and features. Used it for a year now. Takes some great pictures but indoors night pictures with lights was terrible most of the time, anti-shake doe snot work that well. Now 13 months later this camera stopped working. When I turn on the camera, the lens comes out all the way and no display appears on the LCD, the LED light flickers and lens goes back in 3/4th of the way. I called Olympus support and they charge $140/- to fix it. Better to buy a new camera. Some of the pictures had this weird droplets of color that messed up great shots. Watch out, if you buy this camera make sure you get extended warranty.
