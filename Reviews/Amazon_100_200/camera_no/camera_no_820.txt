The good:  No learning curve; solid image quality; light and compactThe bad:  No optical zoom; no scene modes; no manual controls except exposure compensation; no movie mode; hard-to-use buttons; small LCD; relatively short battery life; slow recycle time; shutter lag; included software uses lots of RAM; now discontinuedWho's it for:  Novices who want the simplest to use camera available with pleasing photos in a compact package.What's it for:  Everyday snapshooting.The bottom line:  Novices will love this camera's extreme simplicity, low price tag and vivid photos. But since the only manually controllable part is exposure compensation, if this isn't your first digital camera you should definetely look elsewhere.
