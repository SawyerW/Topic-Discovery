Inside our construction storage area great image and easy to hide. The fact of having to leave it connected to a pc and leaving the pc is a con but for the price I have no complaints. Great product the online $80 a year service seems worth it. Yet to make that commitment. Motion sensor and recording program are super easy to use. Had to upload newer program than disk provided. But it was free and customer service was very helpful. I recommend this product for home or office security where a pc is available 24/7. It's a cheap and easy sense of security that without the online service is great for rewind and catching tool and copper thieves after the crime is committed. Online service describes mobile alert and emails so I may take the dive and leave feedback further down the line.
