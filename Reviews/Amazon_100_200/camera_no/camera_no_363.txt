I ordered this product because my father-in-law owns one and I fell in love after using it.  The picture quality is great and when set to auto even the worst picture taker (me) can get a good photo.  At first I was a little weary about buying a used camera when in the description it said minor wear and tear.  This camera is in pristine condition.  The only wear and tear to be found are surface scratches on the screen cover on the back.  The seller got this package to me really fast and extremely well packaged. Thank you for the great camera and fast shipping.
