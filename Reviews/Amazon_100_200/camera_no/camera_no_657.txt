My client wanted a webcam which could continuously stream images to her web page. All the documentation claims that this camera can do that. No, it can't.I contacted TrendNet about this issue, as follows;"The instructions provided are working well - the camera is now visible on a webpage.The problem now is that the camera won't display on that page *unless* someone access the admin section. Once I access the admin section, the camera images appear on that webpage. But if I leave it for a day or so, the images stop appearing and we're left with a black screen or the Java circles."Their reply..."Dear Customer,Unfortunately we do not support putting the cameras live feed into a web site in any fashion. This is considered custom programming and is beyond the scope of our support."We are now returning the camera, and we'll find a supplier that believes in supporting their product and giving customer support. We gave this camera one star only because zero or negative ratings aren't possible.
