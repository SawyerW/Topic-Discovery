This is my second digicam..the first was an excellent 1.3 megapixel.However, I wanted to be able to do more "stuff" and enlarge pics up to at least 8x10..so I read a lot of reviews and input from the consumers here, and gave it a shot. I am so glad I did. This is an excellent, easy to use, good-looking,feels-good-in-the-hand camera,and I couldn't be happier. The software installed quickly to my new XP OS computer, and I was sending out photos over the internet in a few minutes. I did buy the battery charger, however, because no matter what camera I am using, I do not like to go through batteries and worry about disposing of them properly.I am using a fairly inexpensive printer, with glossy photo paper, and the pics are superb! I haven't gone beyond 8x10 yet, but from the looks of it,  larger prints shouldn't be too much trouble.There are so many features and capabilities with this camera..too many to list.I have used Olympus 35mm film cameras for years, and loved them all. And I love this new digicam already. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this camera.
