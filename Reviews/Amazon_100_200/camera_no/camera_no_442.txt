I bought this over a month ago. I was a happy owner of the great D40 but I like using prime lenses and the D40 did not support auto focus on the 50mm 1.8 and 35mm f2. I could have spent money on third party lenses instead but decided to just get a new body. Well, I am glad I made the move. The D80 takes slightly better pictures anyway but in terms of usability, it's way better than the D40. Fully loaded. I love it. The D90 is out now and is gonna be a better machine but the D80 should be a definite consideration if you are looking for a cheap DSLR that will never let you down. The design and quality are top notch. The only minor gripe is that it slightly over-exposes. However, this is a common fault on digital sensors and is easy to fix before or after. Still a winner.Bottom line. If you are looking at a D40/60 then you will be happy with the results. However, if like me you are the type of person that really likes to get into a hobby go for the more functional D80.
