I ordered this camera for my 6 year old's Santa gift.  I did not want her using my expensive camera.  It would not take any pictures unless in bright natural light.  When I went to install it on my computer it had the wrong software.  I downloaded the software to find out that this camera was defective.  Etoys replaced it at no cost, but the next one still wouldn't work with my computer or my neighbor's computer (and he's a computer tech.)This purchase was nothing but frustrating.  Spend the extra $[...]bucks and get a better camera.  This one isn't worth $[...].
