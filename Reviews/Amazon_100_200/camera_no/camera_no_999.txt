This camera was very promising to begin with. The pictures were of good quality and that was good enough for me. However, after about six months, the camera would not take a picture. I could turn the camera on and all it said was "zoom error". I looked it up on line to find out if there was some way to fix it. I was able to get the camera to work for a little while longer by grabing the lens as soon as the camera was turned on and turning it to the left to unjam it. A few more times I got the "zoom error" and was able to fix it. The last time I was unable to fix it. When I did get it unjammed the picture quality was so blurry, I new it was already time for a new camera.I paid $120 for the camera. I didn't expect an awesome camera for that money, but I wish it had lasted longer than it did. Dissapointed.
