This camera is awesome. There isn't a thing about it that I don't like. It's extremely versatile. I've gotten fantastic shots of everything from flowers only a few inches away to horse races. I've heard complaints about its ability to photograph fast moving objects, but I've gotten great shots of both agility dogs and racehorses moving at 35 mph. Most of the shots come out crystal-clear, and if they don't, it's usually my fault. The shutter speed is a tad bit slow at times, but 90% of the time it's quick enough for what I want to photograph. Highly recommend this camera.
