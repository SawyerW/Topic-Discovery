I'm starting my Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language so I wanted something to help me with studying the phonetic alphabet.  These cards are ok, but I wish for the price they would have a little more information.  They give you the mere basics you would expect from flash cards and do not give much more explanation.  That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all.  SO not a bad set, but I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth than they are.  Other than that they are made well and have a good organization system.
