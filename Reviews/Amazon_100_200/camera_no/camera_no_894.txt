Dec. 10, 2004: My first digital camera and I found it very easy to use. Great high-quality pictures. Easy downloads to my computer. I would suggest using rechargeable batteries to save money in the long run - keep a spare set handy so you won't miss that great shot! I received great customer service with the Canon 800#: I damaged one of the prongs while reinserting the flash card the first week I had the camera. I called the 800# and they were very pleasant and patient, walking me through steps to hopefully resolve the problem while I was on the phone, but I ended up having to send the camera in to be repaired. The camera was returned to me within about 10 days good as new and I wasn't charged for the repair. ******Comment added 9-19-2005: Still loving this camera!
