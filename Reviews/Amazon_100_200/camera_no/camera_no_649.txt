I have flash to the latest firmware 1.0.0 build: 71I am using a Linksys WRT54GL with a 3rd party software called Tomato.I just could not get it to work with WPA2-PSK if I put in more than 8 characters!  And it can only take 8 numbers. No alpha or other special characters!  So now my wireless network is less secure.  If I put in more than 8 char it just will not work.  I had open a ticket with Trendnet already and they say its my problem.  I am using a wireless D-link DCS-920 and I had put in more than 8 char and not a problem. I have used IE7 and IE8.The camera gets warm.  Why is that?  I have turn off the infrared lights.I had to put it at 30% angle so that I can tilt down more and get rid of the heat at the bottom.There is serious lag when doing audio.  Doing on intranet its fine with the audio.This camera has good video.  Night time viewing is a cool feature but only at a short distance.Good camera unless they fix the WPA2-PSK with more than 8 characters!
