If you're wanting to step-up from a point and shoot digital camera, but on the fence about a DSLR versus SLR-like camera, then you can purchase the Olympus E-520 with confidence.  There is absolutely no other entry or mid-priced system on the market that has the feature set for the price that you can get the Olympus E-520 for.  I carefully researched and compared systems that possessed the features important to my family: live view, image stabilization, optical/sensor quality, and finally, PRICE.Buy it now and you won't regret it.  I'm using this camera in Iraq and am amazed at the quality of materials, the brightness of the rear LCD, and the ease of use.  I replaced a destroyed Canon point and shoot and felt right at home with this system.  The myriad of auto function and shooting modes ensures virtually idiot-proof quality photographs that you will be proud to share with family and friends.If you can't already tell, I highly recommend this camera.  I'm even thinking of purchasing an Olympus E-420 for my wife to replace her aging point and shoot when I return from Iraq.
