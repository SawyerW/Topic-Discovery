I really thought I was the only one. I really loved this camera, felt it was my best purchase in a while, thought it was value for money, but alas! I got the purple haze and now black screen. I won't even contact Cannon cause my warrranty is up. But really, what's up with that purple haze black screen? I thought it was my batteries, went to buy new ones. then figured it was the memory card...was about to change that too, till I came here and saw that most people had that same problem. So Cannon taking us for a ride?
