I purchased this camera this afternoon and I am very impressed with it.  I found a great deal on this camera so I bought it for my 12 year-old daughter.  It stores 64 photos at it's highest resolution (640X480) and 128 at it's lowest.  We shot a bunch of pictures in all of it's formats on the way home and around the house in all sorts of lighting conditions.  I was surprised by how well it worked in low light.  The shots outside were more than acceptable in color quality, depth of field and exposure.  It is very light weight and fits easily into a shirt pocket.  If you need a decent snapshot digital camera you should definitely check this one out.
