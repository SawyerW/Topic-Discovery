I usually shop eBay for used camera gear but came to Amazon from a link on Ken Rockwell's web site. I was interested in my first DSLR. I thought to buy cheap the first time so used would be my option, while my daughter suggested  Cosco for a Camera and Lens kit for about $500.00, I instead chose the used Nikon D80 for $189.00 that I would use my current selection of lenses with. I chose the cheapest  one of about 30 cameras that averaged about $450.00 used with no lens, and the seller had no rating. I was real worried buying from this seller but was thrilled to find a like new camera in the original box with warranty card and all original accessories still wrapped in plastic wrap. I think I was sold a demo model from a camera store. So I am a happy customer that will shop Amazon a lot more from now on. Thank you, jp96025
