Recently purchased the SONY DSC V3 and am very happy with it.  Best feature is the large LCD and 7.2 megapixel.  Only con is that some controls, particularly the knob on top and the shutter button, feel kind of cheap.  Some have complained of the flash, but I think it works great indoors and not so great outdoors more then a few feet away... but that is expected from a small flash on any camera.  Definitely the best camera for the money as it includes some great features including the ability to use compactflash and memory sticks at the same time.
