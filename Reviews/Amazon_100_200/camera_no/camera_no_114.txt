Many times what determines whether you will use the technology alot is whether you have it readily available when you need it. This is particularly true for cameras, especially if you want to capture all those spontaneous moments in life. Size therefore plays a major factor.In this camera, Sony proves that size doesn't mean less capability. To be able to pack a 4M pixel camera with 3X optical zoom, and NTSC resolution full motion audio/video capture (with no time limit) in a form factor the size of a candy bar is pure genius.The interface is easy to use. I picked up the camera and started using it without having to read the manual.There are only 3 weaknesses with the camera:1. the microphone is positioned on the top left hand side of the unit so it is easy to cover it up when you are holding the camera to take videos.2. when in video shooting mode, zoom is fixed but autofocus continues to operate.3. flash pictures in dark environments can sometimes yield lens flaring.
