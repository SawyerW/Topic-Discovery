We've had this camera for 3 months now and we find it very easy to use and not too hard on the batteries. I find that the displays on the back of the camera are quite easy to manipulate. In fact, I played with one at a store before I bought it here at Amazon.com (saved $15!) and I picked this one because it is so easy to operate that I haven't even been forced to consult the manual!There is a problem, though. The flash is seriously underpowered. If you plan on doing a lot of interior photography in dark environments, you will be disappointed.
