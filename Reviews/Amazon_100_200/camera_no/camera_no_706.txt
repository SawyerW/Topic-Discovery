This camcorder is reliable and really easy to use! There are some problems with it though, like the fact you can't see what you are taking a picture of or making a video of. It's really light in weight, but that make it really hard to keep it still. the microphone is not very sensitive, so quiet sounds will not pick up so it will make your video sound silent. for a little more money you could get a camcorder that has a viewing screen and far more memory. it has  only 16MB of memory, and it's flash memory so if the battery dies or you chance the batterys before you load the your picture or videos to the computer it will disappear.  Overall this is a great camera if you can overlook the drawbacks and quirks.
