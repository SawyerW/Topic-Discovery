Recently my daughter purchased the Casio Exilim Z1000 for me. After putting the camera thru its paces I was completely disappointed. The majority of pictures were noisy/grainy even after adjusting the various ISO setting. Low light situations were a total loss with or without flash. Other customer reviewers on line had similar experiences. I returned the camera to Amazon with no difficulty. Subsequently, I ordered the Casio Z700...and voila!!There is no graininess/noise at any setting. I shot scenes in most modes and varying "quality" settings. All photos were sharp and clear. And contrary to other reviews in the video mode, I observed no blurriness/graininess. I am using the 1.0 GB, San Disk Ultra 11 SD card. At the 5.0 megapixel(fine) setting I can shoot 320 pictures; at the (normal) setting I get 470 pix. I highly recommend this camera. As with others, the only downside is the docking station. Since the camera is rather small and slick (feeling) it can readily slip out of your hand if not careful.
