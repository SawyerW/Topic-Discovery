I bought this camera for a trip to Brazil with my daughter.. I bought a 1gb card for it.  We had  the ability to take 500 photos.  We actually did take almost 400 and I never had to re-charge the battery--not once.  My daughter used three sets of batteries for her own camera and only took 98 photos.  I used it under all lighting conditions and the photos are beautiful.  Everyone is commenting on how beautiful the photos are-clear and the good color.  It is so small and light that I took it everywhere with me and this is something new for me.  I never enjoyed carting a camera around before. This is my first digital and it was easy to learn how to use it.I highly recommend this camera.
