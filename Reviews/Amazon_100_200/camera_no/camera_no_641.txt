Where to begin... This thing is a disaster. For the bare minimum of letting you view a live feed of low quality video, it works. I'm guessing that's pretty much all the people with glowing reviews tried. But that's about all that works. I've got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from a supposedly reputable engineering school, and yet I couldn't get this thing to connect to a Samba server. The SMTP (e-mail) "feature" won't work with SSL (encrypted) e-mail servers, and yet most mail servers these days seem to require SSL.By far, the worst thing about this unit is that the sound is unusable due to static sounds. It appears to be interference from the unit itself. This has happened on two 422s, now, so I'm quite certain it's a design issue, and not a manufacturing defect.It's true that, if everything worked, this would be quite a bargain. Unfortunately, all this device proves is that you get what you pay for. This is, all around, a very shoddy product. I give it two stars only because it does function as a barebones, audio-free camera.
