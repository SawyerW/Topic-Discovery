The D70, especially since the d70s came out, is a bargain. I bought the D70 and upgraded the firmware (easy - see nikon website) and now have a D70s sans the .2 inch larger screen on the back.I used to do freelance work and have boxes of nikon accessories to play with so I just bought the body. Only complaint? These new D-series cameras don't seem to like the old flash units. Oh, and when will Nikon go full frame so we don't have to deal with these small-sensor lens (or the conversion factor) and use our old proper film ones. Alas.Otherwise the D70 is perfect...Light weight. Depth of field preview. Grid in the viewfinder. Instant on. Fast processing. The new built-in wireless "commander-mode" with the new flashes.This camera is a joy to use.
