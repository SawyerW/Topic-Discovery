I didn't want a fancy digital camera with a bunch of bells and whistles that would be utterly wasted on me and just mean more things to break.  But I was also kind of camera snob.  A Kodak digital camera?  I thought I wanted something with more snob appeal.  After reading everything I could and going to every store imaginable, I settled on this one.  I liked the size, the weight, and the battery situation. I travel overseas a lot and the charger is a lot more reasonable in size than the other cameras I looked at.  And it's a simple use camera which is exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. My pictures are great, the color and clarity outstanding. I liked it so much I bought my mother a different Kodak model with the "grip" shape and she won't put it down.  If you want an easy, uncomplicated digital camera without a lot of frou-frou, I recommend this one!!
