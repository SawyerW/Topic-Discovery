If have installed the software for this camera on three different Windows XP computers. The software did not work at all two out of three of the computers. I get the splash screen and nothing more. I have to kill the program with ctl-alt-delete. The software did work once an a third windows XP program. It got far enough for it to down load one video. The software never worked again on that computer. It did the same thing as the other two computers. It would show the splash screen but never get to the select task screen.This camera is junk without functional software.
