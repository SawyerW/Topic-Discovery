I purchased this camera as a birthday present.  Once I got it, I found out that I had to spend even more money in order to even get the thing on and working- I had to buy a battery, charger, memory card, and USB cord.  I purchased and waited for the additional items only to find that the camera didn't work.  After a little online research, I found that the red dot that came up instead of taking a picture was a common problem for this camera and costs between $150-$200 to fix.  I contact the seller OVER A MONTH ago to arrange a refund and I am still waiting on a response.  I use amazon a lot and this is my first bad experience.
