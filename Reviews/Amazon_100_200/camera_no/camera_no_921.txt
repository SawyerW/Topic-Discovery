This is a good camera. I like it because it has a metal case versus the plastic ones of most. It takes good pictures from about 7-20 ft if the flash is on. The flash doesn't go that far. Also it takes good close ups if the flash is off. Sometimes it is to dark to not use the flash, but the flash makes everything overexposed at close range. Everything else is fine. The pictures are very good quality and there are tons of features. The videos are large, and they are pretty good quality too. Overall, it's a very good product.
