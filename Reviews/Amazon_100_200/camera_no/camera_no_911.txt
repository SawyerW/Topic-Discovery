I bought this simple camera/receiver setup over NINE years ago for my parents. They have a large piece of property and wanted to see who was coming to their house before they got there. I installed one X-10 camera and one receiver. They have both been in constant use since 2001. It never, ever gets turned off! My parents love it and wouldn't want to be without it. The only issue that's less than desirable is that at about 20 degrees or less, the video image darkens. It always comes back to full brightness when the temp rises. Yes, it's not ultra hi-tech or the latest technology, but it does what it was designed to do and has been rock solid for almost one full decade.
