I wanted this camera badly because of the size & the features (love the soft focus & love the ability to edit after you've taken the picture using the camera itself).  I've had it for a little less than a month and used it at a couple family parties.  I'd have to say that I'm not very pleased with the quality of the pictures.  I keep it on the highest resolution setting and I always make sure the AutoFocus lamp is lit before shooting, but my pictures still come out blurry and grainy when I hook it up to view them my computer.  Maybe I haven't quite figured out the best setting to get the best pictures, but I'd have to say I'm quite disappointed for the amount I paid ($350).  For some reason only objects that are fairly close (from my experience, approximately 6 feet - that would be a guess) to the camera come out clear.  If I'm going to pay that much for a camera, it better work well!!!  I can't return it to Circuit City anymore since it's been more than 14 days, so I'm stuck with it.
