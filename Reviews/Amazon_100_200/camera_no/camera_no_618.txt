We bought this system because the b/w video display for an older Samsung system failed after several years. We have not yet installed the cameras that came with this system, but the cameras we had already installed plugged into the replacement unit and came up without a hitch. Only complaint is that some controls are only on the remote and because different people occupy the workspace at various times, we fear the remote could disappear too easily, so we keep it secured. Old system did not record, this system does, but we have not yet used recording features. We watch it periodically during the day, but it does not get activity at night.
