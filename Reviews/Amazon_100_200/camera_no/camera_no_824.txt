Nikon's line of digital cameras has been good, and the 2000 is a great bang for the buck. The camera is not the sleekest around, nor the lightest, but it gives you a lot of features and control for not too much money. You can point and shoot, or take more control over the photos you take. Right out of the box, you can start taking pictures, and then expand to higher capacity memory cards and longer life batteries. The optical zoom is superior to the digital zoom that you find on many cameras in this range. Most of the controls are on the right hand side of the camera, with a large open grip space in the front so pictures can be taken with one hand. And the picture quality is exceptional for a camera at this price point. Overall this is a very good bargain for the hobbyist who wants to record the family vacation or experiment in the world of digital images. A solid leader.
