I am new to dslr photography and was looking for a book that would walk me through all of the functions on my new camera; not only how to use them, but when and why I want to. I started reading "Understanding "Exposure" to learn some of the basics about photography and then turned to this book to show me how to apply those techniques to my own camera. This book is great, really easy to follow and very thorough. I really appreciate how the author structured the walk through from basic to advanced techniques, and the extra info about lenses and software.  This is a great guide to help you get familiar with the d5100, don't be intimidated by the size! Highly recommend.
