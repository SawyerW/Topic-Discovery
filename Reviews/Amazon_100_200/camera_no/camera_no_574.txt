Ok, i'll try to help, got it yesterday. All the picture features are awesome the dual image stabilization really works...but at night the video funtion really deserve 2 star... i changed from a sony cybershot 6.0MP, i don't have any complain of the video quality. I did the change just for the Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery, image stabilization and all weather features of the stylus, i didn't see in any review about the video of the stylus...for the truth in places with bright light is fair, but at night is very poor the quality, i have changed the image quality the ISO 1600 and in low light the case is loss. Over all the all weather i really liked, haven't tested but i'll do it. Besides, i'll remain with the camera...Now i have almos one month with it, biside the video quality i have learned lot of thing and i would increase the scale to 4 stars, i tested the all weather feature in a place all my friend had to put the cameras away, my camera got very wet, every thing is fine...
