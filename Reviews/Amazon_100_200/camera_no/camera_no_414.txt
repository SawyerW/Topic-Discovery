Very good choice for your first camera in the Nikon line. Auto focus a little slow, Kit lens to "slow" to allow you to make a photograph in your kitchen without camera movement, or use of a flash. Your kitchen is usually the brightest room in your house. Smartest choice, is to buy the camera body only and than buy the Nikon 50 mm f1.8 D lens here, < http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=pd_bbs_3/105-0107392-3918020?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1191098706&sr;=8-3  > , this lens is the best value of a lens in the world. There is always time to spend your money on a zoom lens, use your feet. Any digital camera you buy today you will replace in 3-5 years, this is a smart start.
