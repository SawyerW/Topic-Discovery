I got this camera for Christmas and I haven't put it down since then. It is one of the easiest things to learn how to use and is very user friendly. Downloading and emailing pictures is even easier than learning to use the camera. I recommend buying a set of Kodak rechargable batteries and a charger. It's not very expensive and it will pay off. So far I've had a lot of luck with this camera and have found that almost anyone can use it... even if you have no experience with this type of thing. The Kodak Easyshare software is great. Especially to enhance photos and completely get rid of red eye. I am very satisfied with this prduct and I hope that future buyers will take this into consideration. ~213
