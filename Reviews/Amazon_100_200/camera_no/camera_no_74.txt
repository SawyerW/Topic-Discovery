I have owned several digital cameras... 3 Fuji's (all wonderful) and 2 canons (1 great, 1 not so great) to name a few.  This is the first Casio I've owned and it takes stunning photos!  Ideally I thought I wanted a digital SLR but their large size scared me away.  After much research, I decided on the Casio and found that it takes just as good if not better photos than my friends SLR's.The auto mode is fine, but this camera really shines when you start using the manual modes.  If this will be your first experience with manual modes, do not worry, Casio makes it fairly easy.You will not be disappointed with this camera.
