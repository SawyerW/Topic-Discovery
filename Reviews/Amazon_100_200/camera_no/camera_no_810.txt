I received this camera as a gift.  I wanted a new digital camera since my last one had 640x480 res. and the pictures were not that great to say the least.  I have a new son and we were taking lots of pictures to email to family members.  I just love this camera.  The docking cradle is a must.  This camera has rechargeable batteries that charge in the docking cradle.  And the pictures tranfer at the touch of a button.  This is so much easier than the last camera I had.  The quality of the pictures is great, good exposure, the flash set to auto works well, not too bright.  The only negative thing I would have to say is the LCD screen does not work well in low light, but I have no problem dealing with that.  This is a good 2MP camera at a good price.  Definitely invest in the docking cradle to go with it.
