I shoot western Colorado landscapes for microstock sites. I need a camera with low image noise, smooth focus, long battery life, and durability.I love Nikon. I have had Nikon SLRs since I started shooting stock in the late 70s. They are dependable, quality instruments. The D80 is no exception. No point-and-shoot, it feels like my old F2. It takes beautiful pictures in all kinds of weather.You will need at least one extra battery. The battery life is long--three or four 2 gig cards worth of RAW pictures, for me--but you will want this baby with you all the time.I bought the body only, because I had the lens from my D70, but you will want a VR zoom or a fixed lens for maximum sharpness. I don't like tripods and don't use them as often as I should. The remote is useful for closeups. It helps you avoid camera shake, especially in low light.
