I brought the camera as a gift for the wife (per her wishlist) so I didn't know anything about the cam when I brought it....but now that I have it for awhile I love it.PROS:-Built like a tank (ie. I accidentally drop it from about 5 feet and it landed on gravel with rocks).  The camera now has a big dent on it but still works great.-takes decent/normal video.-I came from a 3.2 Mpixel camera from this so the pictures blew me away. I liked the picture quality that I now use it instead of my DSLR when I want good pictures during informal events.-took the exilim on a tropical beach for vacation and the pictures that came out are beautiful.  Turned me into a shutterbug during that trip...I was taking 100 to 300 shots per day...LOVE it!CONS:-make sure you have the cam's cradle to charge the camera!-flash sucks (but same goes to other point and shoot cameras) so, just try not to use the flash or just accept washout pics at night when using flash. Not a big issue for me!
