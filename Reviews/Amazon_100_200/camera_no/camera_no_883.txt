The camera has worked effectively for 1 year and 7 months.However it has now stopping working, and the message givenon the screen reads E18. Apparently this is common problemthat has to do with lens misalignment or something. Canon'scan fix it for 100 - 200, or replace it with a refurbishedmodel for 150. In any case this seems very frustrating forcamera to only function for about a year and a half.Another issue is that if you purchase the wide angle adapterlens it will not work with the flash. I believe this is a designflaw. The lens is so wide it blocks the flash, and creats acurved dark area on the images.One last issue is that the view screen cover is plastic orsomething and is very easily scratched. I also somehow gotdust or dirt underneath this screen which was under warrantyand was repaired.Otherwise its a pretty decent camera. Not a true pocket sizecamera. When its working it takes great pictures.
