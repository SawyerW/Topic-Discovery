This camera takes excellent photos in the daylight.  Indoors, the flash over compensates and your pictures are washed out.  I still would recommend it just for outdoor shots that my kids can take on their own.  They have used it on school field trips and trips to many carnivals and fairs.  It's very easy to use.  Having said that, the camera is not as durable as I thought.  We've only had it for 5 months and already the power switch and joystick have stopped working.  It comes with a one year warranty so I am contacting the manufacturer for a repair/replacement. I didn't expect it to break so fast.  I have heard that Argus wants the customer to pay at least $10 for shipping.  I'm not to happy if that is true.  It's not my fault their product broke after only a few months of use.  Considering what I'd spend buying and sending disposable cameras on field trips with my kids, it's still worth it.  It takes a SD card so you can download your photos in an instant.
