I found it to be wonderful to use. Such good quality. I use it all the time. This is my first digital camera so when I found out what It could do I was thrilled. I love being able to erase badly taken pictures it's  amazing and now you can't really mess up taking pictures and the camera  won't either. I love photography, but now I love it even more. I love what  I can do with pictures on my computer.I hope everyone enjoys it as much as  I do. I want to learn more on the mavica photo printer fvp-1 $500.00 and  how to buy it. I can't find it on line. I got a paper on it that came with  my camera but the phone #'s busy. help!I really want it.Thank you. Tabitha  Gilling Bones26@earthlink.com
