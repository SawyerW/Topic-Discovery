Bought one for my wife a little more than a year ago. I liked it so much for the nice large screen to view and to take shots and also ease of use for tech savvy people like myself that I decided to buy one for myself. It took me a few hours of shopping around due to the camera being last years model but I found it at less than half of what I paid for hers and its new,never been refurbished or opened for any reason.  Using a "large memory card" SD HC sim card meant that I could take a ridiculous amount of pictures and even take surprisingly good quality video and allot of it from such a small camera.Its thin, light and not a battery beast like digi cams of the past.
