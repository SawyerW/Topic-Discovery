I have a Sony Mavica (which I love), but I needed something compact and fairly weatherproof to bring to an archaeological field school. This camera survived lots of blowing sand and dust, some light rain, being banged around in a daypack, and in the process acquired some dents and scratches, yet it still performs like a champ. The photos are fantastic. Yes, the LED screen is VERY difficult to see in bright sunlight--under those conditions you have to feel fairly confident about your ability to compose the shot, and for this reason alone I didn't give it five stars--but thanks to the autofocus and stabilization feature, the photos aren't blurry at all. Please note that although this camera is water-resistant, it is most assuredly NOT WATERPROOF. It will not withstand submersion.Purchase an extra battery because the battery can't be charged while it's in the camera.Overall, this is an excellent little compact camera. I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat.
