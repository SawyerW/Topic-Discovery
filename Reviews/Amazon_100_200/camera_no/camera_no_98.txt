I bought this camera to enhance the audio baby monitor we already have. This camera started out OK, we then noticed that the signal would fade in and out at times as well as flicker on the monitor screen. In all fairness to the product, the infrared/nightvision part of the camera works well, the hardware in package was a little shabby for installing the camera on a wall, was forced to purchase my own hardware. As if the flickering was not enough we also noticed that there were times when the entire picture would vanish for a long while. After some slight detective work we figured out that the camera transmits on 2.4 Ghz band and so does the cordless phone in our house, which interfered with the signal. I also get a lot of interference when the microwave is running as well. For what I paid for this camera I will live with the inconveniences that this thing offers. I also looked into purchasing an agcam, but its quite pricey. If you can deal with the flickering from time to time this is not a bad purchase, otherwise KEEP LOOKING!!!!
