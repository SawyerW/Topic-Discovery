I have to admit that Sony, one of my favorite eletronics brand, really had a great idea to launch this model. It's small, quick and it has a Carl Zeiss lens, but I really think Sony will change this model.I bougth two of those, and both are broken within less than a month of very small and carefull use. The first broke the small command lever located on the back of the camera, and the second the lens got stuck into the camera when I was going the take the 29th picture with the camera !!?! Impressive!Those were my third Sony digicam model, having owned previewisly a F717 and a P9, never had problems, but this model may have been launched in a hurry for the 2004 Xmas sales and might have not been kept for testing for the necessary period of time.I hope I can save some of you from having trouble.
