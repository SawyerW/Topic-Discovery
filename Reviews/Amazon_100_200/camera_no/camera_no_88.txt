bought this camera to replace a DX series Kodak.My thoughts:- I was excited, at first, by the manual controls, but disappointed by the difficulty of using the pre-set modes when in a hurry (who wants manual all the time?). The option for pre-setting 4 "my mode" settings is great, though.-  The color results are not impressive, I frequently find myself changing saturation and reshooting.- Battery life is not great and the battery is very expensive. You will need at least one extra at $35 a shot.  Also inconventient for international travel.- Finally, On two trips I have lost pictures when the camera has malfunctioned. Refuses to turn on and/or erases the XD card.- Did I mention the good picture quality? When the camera works and the saturation is controlled, the pictures are great.I have had the camera for 2 months now and it is on its way back to the store.  Good thing membership warehouses have generous return policies.
