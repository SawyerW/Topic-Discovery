After reading glorious reviews, I ran out and paid top dollar for a Camedia. After using the camera for six months, all the pictures produced a red splotch in the upper left corner. Fixed under warranty but repair person said this was a common problem. Could happen again. After repairs pictures now washed out. Lens cap is easy to loose and you must remember to take it off before turning on the camera or lens motor will grind. Camera has many bells and whistles. Unfortunately, they are not intuitive to use so one is constantly reading the manual to operate this camera. I take most of my pictures outdoors and this camera is just not as rugged as some cheaper models. Not recommended for rugged outdoor use. Many features may appeal to expert indoor photographer.
