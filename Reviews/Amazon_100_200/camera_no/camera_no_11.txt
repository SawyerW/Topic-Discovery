What I loved about this book was that Busch presents everything you need to know about the Nikon D5100 is easy to digest chunks.  He starts with several quick start chapters that help you hit the ground running, saving the in depth information for later chapters when you really need it.  For example, he first shows you how to set the various autofocus options so you'll get sharp focus just about every time.  After you've shot a bunch, you'll be ready for the clear explanations of exactly how autofocus works in Chapter 5, so you can vary your settings according to Busch's recommendations to give you sharp focus in problematic situations.  There are separate chapters on shooting movies, working with electronic flash (both built in and external flash), and descriptions of all your lens options.  The Nikon D5100 is an intermediate camera, suitable for both beginners and more enthusiastic photographers and Busch does an excellent job of helping both groups discover the possibilities of their camera.  Recommended.
