I've had this unit for about 3 years and about 1 year ago all the capacitors blew out in the power source, looking on youtube for a fix I found out that there is a class action lawsuit against samsung over this very same problem whith a large number of their tv's.I took my smt-190 to my local tv repair shop where they replaced the 5 capacitors that had blown and they told me that the cap's were not large enough for the load and put in the next size up in. So everything is working good until the screen goes black about 1 year after the first fix.I contacted samsung to look for a possible solution to the black screen.This was their reply to me.Your SMT-190DN's inverter (back light that displays the screen) is in the process of going out and will need to be replaced. Please contact live support for repair setup 877.349.3149. Thank you.I think a 600+ dollar 19" screen should last longer than three years!I DON'T PLAN ON EVER BUYING ANOTER SAMSUNG PRODUCT EVER AGAIN!It's over $100 for the inverter plus labour plus shipping both ways.
