I bought this camera in 2005 and liked it so much that I purchased an additional camera for my husband for his business. I like the larger screen, it was easy to learn to use and the pictures come out great. My only complaint is that if its dark its hard to see the screen when taking the picture. You do have to use a docking station but if we travel we can both bring our cameras and just one docking station.Make sure you buy a Sandisk digital card for storage- 256 should be fine holds 80-100 pictures.  Overall I am thrilled with the camera.
