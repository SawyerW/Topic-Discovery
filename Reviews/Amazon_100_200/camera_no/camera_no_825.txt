This camera has many good features I have used so far and many I haven't learned yet.  The camera is easy to use if you don't want to spend a lot of time with the CD's and included manual.  But the extra features are there if you want to get a little deeper, which I plan to do when I have the time.Sharp pictures, ease of use, TV out, and enough extra settings and features to keep you going for a while.  The only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because the batteries that came with the camera lasted about an hour.  I bought a charger and some NiMH batteries and they seem to do the trick.
