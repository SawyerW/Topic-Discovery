Don't get me wrong, this IS a spectacular camera. If you've read the reviews on this camera, you will notice that the most common quirks of the D80 is the matrix metering, the overexposure of highlights, and the tendency to underexpose shots when using the built-in flash and/or a speedlight. Other than that, the image quality is superb and is definitely a step up from the D50 and D70s. The LCD is nice and big while the status LCD has a green backlight for night viewing that the D50 lacked. The autofocus feature is definitely a step up. I am very satisfied with the D80. However, you may need to tinker with the EV settings (usually -0.7 or less) when shooting pics since the metering of the D80 tends to overexpose highlights.
