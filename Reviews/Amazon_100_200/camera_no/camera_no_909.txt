As a computer and Audio Video Tech with over 10 years of experience. I tell you go read the Forums in x10 even though the forum has been mostly deleted . You will know the hard hidden facts about this junk.I had paid nearly $300- for a x10 camera kit for a client to install. The software is incompatible to all platforms. Has major glitches. Hardware , the cams are third class quality and so is the support. If you have nothing to do in life and want to sit and waste time on trying to figure out defective products then this is it.Don't buy anything wireless from x10. Go Wired if you must. But then the software will not support its own hardware. So go figure ! or just stay away from it anyway.
