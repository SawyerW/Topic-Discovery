I have using the six camera system, with 3 indoor and 3 hidden cameras, did not buy any outside cameras, due to the poor reviews of them. Overall, I am totally happen with how the system works, and the ease of setting up.the hidden camera plugs were not design too well, because if you move the clock/camera the power cable comes out.I knew this was a issue from reading other review, just wanted to mention it, aslong as you leave it alone, once on then they work great. since the camera's do not work with surge protection/battery back up attached to them, all I was able to do, was to put the computer the software on battery back-up, since the camera's will turn back on after a power outage. to solve my outdoor area, I placed the indoor camera's using the suction cup on the inside of a window. I have tried a few other cheaper systems, and I am totally happy with the system...and I have used the remote access software, and it does work, but not on my work's internet, and I have been thinking of getting a laptop to solve that issue. I hope that helps.
