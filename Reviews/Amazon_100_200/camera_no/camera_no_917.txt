I brought this camera this year at a thrift store. Don't remember the exact price,but, between $20.00 and $25.00.Included the mfg's box and all items listed as in the box. It's a good camera, but, DON'T pay the full price for onethis old. Hit the thrift stores, lot's of old but good stuff around. IE: A Pentax K1000 with a f:1.1/4 mfg prime lens,50 mm for 48.00 and change. One of the Made in Japan models, not China. Built like a truck.PS: Digital cameras, point and shoot usually come out with new models twice a year. No need to ever pay full price.
