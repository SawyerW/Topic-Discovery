My father has a Nikon Coolpix 5000 (5 megapixels), my mom an Olympus C-4040 (4 megapixels).  Both of those take awesome, awesome pictures but are very pricey. After reading reviews and searching the internet I settled for this one.  According to Megapixel.net it had the best image quality.It certainly is rather easy to use and figure out.  The manuals for the camera and software,however, are painfully inadequate.  I ended up going to Olympus's website to get better detailed instructions after having problems installing the software into my computer.The different modes all take really nice photos.  The sound of the lense as you power on and off is really grating, really sounds like it's sick or something.  Batteries don't last too long when you use the LCD.  But overall very nice camera that takes beautiful pics.
