I bought this camera over a year ago.  The picture quality is fantastic, set up is a bit complex, the signal is hard to get through walls (or my older wiring), and I've had nothing but problems with the software. My computer can not handle this program and often crashes. I have only manged to get my two cameras to work at the same time for a few weeks at a time before I've had to re-set it, etc...  It is not worth the time or money.  I found my cameras were just as effective as a crime deterent when they were not functioning.  I wish I bought "dummy" cameras instead.  It would have saved me the money, hassle and been just as effective.  Perhaps if you have newer wiring in your home you may have better luck with this product.
