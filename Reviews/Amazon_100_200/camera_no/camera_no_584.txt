Poorly manufactured cameras, cheap material, money thrown down the drain.I bought this over a year ago, first I had problem with USB power line adapter didn't send signal then of sudden camera didn't turn on, found out it was the power outlet cord, I called Logitech tech support they've told me "we out of stock, you'll have to buy a universal one at RadioShack or Best Buy " meaning I have to spend no less than $20.00 but that's not the point here, it's the fact this things are made out of cheap material not even worth the $239.00 I paid for, not even worth $80 bucks!!!  It kills me that spend that much money for a poorly manufactured cameras. plus customer services sux  or maybe they pick who they can be nice to. Definitely will not buy from this company again.
