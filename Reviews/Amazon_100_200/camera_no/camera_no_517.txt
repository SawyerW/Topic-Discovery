I am a techie-lover who never had a digital camera before now.  Even with the screen you cannot see in the sun (merely annoying), this is a great camera.  I took it on vacation to Toronto and Niagara Falls.  The variety of settings were fun to play with and test.  I took hundreds of shots in museums and tested all the settings.  They were a great help!  I cannot compare this to anything else, but I have really enjoyed using it.  The video recording didn't want to work the first time I tried it, but I was in a hurry trying to use it.  The second (and subsequent) times it worked fine.  Take your time and get used to the settings before trying to do something!  Anyway, I really like the camera and would recommend it.  It fit nicely in my purse and pocket.  Zoom is good.  I shake a bit, so the stabilization gets a workout.  I only had to discard 3 of 175 shots taken.  - which I think it a good average.
