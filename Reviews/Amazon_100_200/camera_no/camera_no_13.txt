For a general all-around guide to the D5100, I don't think you'll find a better book. However, be forewarned that the first section of the book explores Nikon technology that allows for this camera's ability to grab images in low light, capture color, use 3D Matrix focusing, more accurately record the light spectrum. This is interesting stuff, but it won't necessarily teach you how to use the camera optimally.  The rest contains great advice and is clearly written, and he author is able to complement the technical information with recommendations based on personal experience.  The Nikon D 5100 has a number of bells and whistles that I don't think most photographers will hvae much use for In the latter case, i.e.,the author spends a lot of time describing features you may not ever use. The only other non-Nikon consumer guidebook I've had was a "PIP" publication, and if the comparison between this manual and the "PIP" manual can be generalizable to both series, I'd say there's no contest. This one is far, far better.
