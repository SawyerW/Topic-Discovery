A great take with you type of camera.  I own bigger more robust digital camera's, but not every occasion is it appropriate to sling out a big intrusive camera for.  This little guy is perfect for the spur of the moment, gotta have that picture, camera!  I found it really easy to install on all of my computers, from my W2K unit to my XP unit.  Software drivers loaded easily.  I like all the little tweaks you can get the camera to do for you. Take a picture in B&W or Purple tones!!  The 3D feature is cool.  I also loved that as soon as I opened the box I was able to turn it on an use it.  Had 3 bars of battery life in it, started up fine and was able to fool around with it immediatly.  Picture resolution is what I expect.  This camera will never be a SLR, so my expectations are resonable for what I intend to use it for.  FUN!!!The only things I can think of to say are Con's - no memory card or camera case.
