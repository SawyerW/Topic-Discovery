...the batteries don't last at all!!Ni-MH batts are a little hard to find here, and it says on the user's guide "do not use alkaline batteries". and so i did, only i had to replace them 3 times before i could get the camera to take one single picture - and then that was it.i tried using alkaline batteries instead, and funnily enough, they lasted way longer. the Ni-MH batts really do last even longer than regular alkalines, but still not long enough. so i HAD to buy a set of rechargeable batts, and a recharger.on a brighter note, the camera takes great quality pics and is very easy to use.
