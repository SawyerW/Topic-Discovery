After a going thru a lot of reviews I finally brought Fuji finepix 1300. The camera is very tiny and can be carried very easily. This is the best camera for the beginners with little knowledge about digital cameras. Compared to other digital cameras coping the images to the computer is made easy through USB. If you are using a XP operating system the computer automatically detects the camera. The camera comes with a 8MB smart media card (Not enough if you take picturs at high resloution --16 photos). The camera is compatible upto 128MB smart media (around 200 pictures)I am using this camera for the past one year. I have tested in all conditions and it worked great. Its a point and shoot camera and comes handy when you are on vecations. Need to have spare chargable baterries at all times. I will give a A+ to this camera at 1.3 megapixel category.
