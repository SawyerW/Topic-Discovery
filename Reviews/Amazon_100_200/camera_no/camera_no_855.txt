After much research and testing, I decided upon the A70 because of the quality of the pictures and the look and feel of the camera. I upgraded the memory to 256MB and got the rechargeable batteries (a must) and also purchased a card reader. I took the camera on a trip to London and Paris and I got the most incredible photo's! I'm not at all a photographer but when I showed the pictures to family and friends they thought that some of them were postcards. One picture of Big Ben had activists and police at the top of the tower. By zooming in on the photo (taken at least .10 miles away and the tower is quite high), I can actually see them and read the signs they were holding in protest. Just amazing. I took over 175 pictures and never worried about running out of space.The card reader works just like another drive on your PC and I easily drag and drop the pictures to my hard drive or to write onto a CD.Best Christmas present I ever bought for myself!
