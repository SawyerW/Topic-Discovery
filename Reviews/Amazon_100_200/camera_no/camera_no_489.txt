With only two buttons to contend with and a miniature display screen, you better have good eyesight and good with a multifunction button.  The unit will fit in any small shirt pocket and yet is rugged.There is no preview display but I still have fun with it!!  I Like-Love it!For $20+ (US Dollars) you can't go wrong.  I happen to have a spare 128 meg SDRAM card and the unit works great with it!I use Linux and could not use the enclosed software that comes on a 3 inch CD but Linux detected and open the Camera with no effort at all! Mandriva 2007 detected the USB Camera and automatically opened the Camera as a Flash Drive Folder would open!It's a toy but a lot of fun and it REALLY works and works well!  For the price, it's great!
