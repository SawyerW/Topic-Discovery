The wide angle lens is great for taking closeups and fitting everything in the shot. The auto mode is good for outdoor shots, not so good for indoor. I am learning how to control the camera manually for taking indoor shots with low lighting situations. There are too many setup choices on this camera for the beginner. The 8400 definitely has a learning curve to the controls. It would have been a big plus to include a custom case with this camera. I hope to master the controls and user setups on the Coolpix, I feel it has a lot of potential.
