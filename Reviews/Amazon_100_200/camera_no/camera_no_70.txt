I bought this camera based on the reviews on Amazon, and overall I am quite pleased with it.  I bought it to replace my Olympus C3040 zoom, which took beautiful pictures until it died.  This camera is so much smaller, lightweight, and so much easier to use than my Olympus was.  The battery power is amazing.  It seems like it never needs charging.  My Olympus took four AA rechargeables, and I had to charge it every time I used it.  This one, in contrast, plugs into its own little charging dock, and I really believe them when they say it will take 400 pictures on one charge.  I have never run out of power yet.  My only complaint is that the flash is a little weak, which makes my indoor photos less than perfect.  But that truly is my ONLY complaint.  My outdoor photos are beautiful.  I was able to use it right out of the box, without even reading the manual, because the menus are so easy to navigate and use.  It's just a great little camera.
