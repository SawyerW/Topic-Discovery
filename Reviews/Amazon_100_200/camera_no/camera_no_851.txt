Just like the other review, my canon powershot A70 became non-functional, just beyond the warranty period. Instead of the picture, it produced orange and black stripes. The Canon Service Center determined it to be a non-functional imaging unit and indicated it would take a minimum of $100 to repair. My options were either to junk the camera and lost $300 investment in it or agree to their demand. I would have expected Canon to repair it for free because the camera was discovered to be non-functional within 13 months of the purchase and at the time of discovery had not been used for over a month. I have reluctantly ponied up $100 for the repair but would warn any one considering a canon powershot to be aware of the reliability problem with their imaging unit.
