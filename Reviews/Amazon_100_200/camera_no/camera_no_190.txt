I had this camera for about a month before I unplugged the dock (which the camera was sitting in) from my computer and the camera's LCD screen instantly cracked and burnt a giant hole in the middle making it all unusable. I sent the camera for repair but the lady who talked to me said that they thought it was my fault, that I had caused damage to the screen by putting pressure on it. The truth is, I did not touch the camera until a minute after it destroyed the screen. They're not putting the repair under warranty even though the camera is new and I did NOT damage the camera!!Other than that, the movie function is beautiful, amazing even. Battery life is superb. Screen brightness is amazing. The camera does take a tiny bit of a lag when shooting photos, unlike the Exilim I had before. It's tiny, stylish, and picture quality can be beautiful.
