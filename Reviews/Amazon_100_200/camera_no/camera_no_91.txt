There are a lot of great digital cameras on the market, and when comparing features and functions they all start to look pretty much the same. Unless you're a hardcore photographer you probably won't even use half of the functions on your camera anyway. As far as technical specs, the Verve is comparable to a lot of other cameras in it's price range, but what makes it so cool is the way it feels in your hand. I know that sounds silly, but it's true. You have to actually see and touch this camera to get the full effect. It's about the size of a cell phone, so I can fit it in my jeans pocket (which makes such a big difference in terms of how often I actually USE a camera), yet it doesn't have the chintzy plastic feel of so many other cameras. It feels really solid and has lots of nifty dials and buttons. Okay, so these probably aren't the qualities you buy a digital camera for, but they are the qualities that make you LOVE your digital camera. Because it also takes great pictures, and it's extremely easy to use. I highly recommend the Verve.
