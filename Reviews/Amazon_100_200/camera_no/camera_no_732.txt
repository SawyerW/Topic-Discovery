Chances are, if your reading this, your looking for an inexpensive digital camera. And believe me, there are some bad ones out there. Kodak arguably makes the best digital cameras on the market. Only Sony has as high a quality-to-price ratio. With that said, the Kodak EZ 200 is one of Kodak's best products.I bought the Kodak EZ200 expecting an "adaquete" camera, that I could just use to get a vague image of myself on the web. Color me very suprised when I discovered it took pictures that were slightly better than a $150 35mm camera. Even more impressive was the fact that this little camera, which was smaller than my wallet, not only could hold 64 of them, but take three shot bursts, 10 second video clips, and was capable of streaming video over the web. All of which it did flawlessly.Digital photography lives. And for $90, this camera is worth every dime, which is something you can't say for a lot of electronics, especially digital cameras.- Louis
