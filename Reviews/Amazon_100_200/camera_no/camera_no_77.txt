I have had this camera for almost 3 years and at first I just loved it.  It's very easy to use - very intuitive and all the buttons, etc. are located in an easy-to-use way.  The BIG problem I've had with this camera is that the shutter speed has become slower and slower.  Now I miss all the good shots because after pressing the button it takes almost SIX seconds to actually capture the shot.  With kids, dogs, or any kind of event, really, it's just impossible to capture a moment as it happens.  My poor kids are tired of hearing me say "Smile and hold it..... hold it.... hold it... hold it... wait....okay there's the picture"  I loved the camera until this happened so I'm upgrading to a new Canon, the IS870.
