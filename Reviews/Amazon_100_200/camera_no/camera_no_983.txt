I ordered a Superheadz Wide and Slim Blue Ribbon camera. I received a Black Slim Devil. Which was fine since I didn't really want a blue one (I only got it because it was cheaper).But the thing that wasn't really acceptable was that mine was tampered with. The stickers that held the packaging together was obviously opened and covered with lint. I nearly panicked when I noticed that the strap that was supposed to come with it was missing. (I found it IN the camera when I checked to see if the inside was damaged).But the camera itself is good. It's light and easy. Although I wasn't able to use it yet, I'm very excited to.Although the handling was not as great, everything came in one piece. Nothing was missing.
