I have had this camera (along with the underwater case) for a 3 years.  When I first bought it, I noted that display is pretty much useless in sunlight. Fortunately, this is not a big deal underwater. I did complain to Olympus about this and their response was to put an some anti-glare film, something I had already done with little improvement. Based on their poor response, I decided never it ever buy a olympus product again. And as I have bought 5 cameras in these past 3 years (2 panasonics and 3 canons), Olympus has lost some business.  Add in the idiotic xd proprietary camera card, and that kind of some it up as to just how lame a company Olympus is. They care more about short term profits, than long term customer satisfaction. Thus, I would be suprised if I am not the only customer that they have lost for good.  Pardon my rant.
