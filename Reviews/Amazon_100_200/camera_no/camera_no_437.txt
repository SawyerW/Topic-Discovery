I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the D90 and the newer D5000 series with video recording, because I really wanted something cheaper to get started with a DSLR. Bought the standard lens and a 105mm lens to go with it. So far I really like this camera. It has a lot more features than I can handle as a novice but there are several forums that are immensely helpful. I still have ways to go before I can consider myself conversant with these features, but so far so good. Picture quality with both lenses is amazing, battery life is good, does feel bulky but then they all are.
