I purchased this camera as a gift for my wife. We had another digital camera but it was so big and bulky that we found we never carried it with us. This camera is so slim it fits into a shirt pocket and you hardly know it's there. We absolutly love it. The pictures are very clear and it is easy to chose different settings to fit every situuation.There are two problems I find that keep this camera from being the greatest thing since sliced bread. First, it does not have a USB port on the camera. To get pictures to the computer you must use the docking station which is connected via USB or have a card reader to read the flash memory card. Second, if you don't have a flash momory card in the camera you can only store two pictures at the highest resolution.We love this camera!
