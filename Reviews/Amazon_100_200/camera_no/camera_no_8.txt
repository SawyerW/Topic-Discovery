David Busche hits a home run with this book.  The information is written in such a way that even the most beginning camera buff can understand the concepts and the step-by-step approach makes learning how to use a very complex camera simple.  The color photos are clear, the instructions and menu descriptions are accurate and easy to follow.  I was looking for an informative manual since the user's manual that comes with the camera explains what everything is and or does, but it falls short on telling the user "WHY" to use certain settings or features for certain results.  David Busche is a fantastic teacher and no-nonsense expert in photography and the use of Nikon Cameras.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.. If you have recently purchased the Nikon D5100 or any Nikon product, this book is a MUST HAVE companion and an absolute bargain for the price.
