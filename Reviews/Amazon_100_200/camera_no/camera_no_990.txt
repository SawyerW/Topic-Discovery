I just ordered this camera for $89 with free shipping and here are some pros and consPros:  Small, Very Portable, Good picture quality, Looks nice, decent amount of features, easy to useCons:  No case, why did they not include a case?  Or even a pouch would be nice.  Switching from Picture mode to Movie mode can get tedious.And for anyone who says you can't zoom while recording you are WRONG.  You CAN zoom while recording, in your settings there should be something that says "Digital Zoom" turn it from off to on and there you go, you can zoom while recording.
