A few of the problems we've had with this complicated camera:1.  The instruction booklet on disk is almost useless to use.  Who carries a computer around when they're trying to figure out their camera?  We finally printed out the tome-->300 pages, but found it marginally useful and poorly organized.2.  The menu buttons on the camera stopped working properly after 5 months (required pushing with a pencil with just the right pressure and angle) --unfortunately we didn't get it sent in for repair within the one year warranty.3.  Now at 16 months into ownership the camera is not useable because the zoom lens stopped working--after one too many times grinding against the lens cap that we forgot to remove before turning on the camera.  This is a result of very poor design--inadvertant pressure can turn the camera on at any time and the lens cap prevents the zoom from expanding--instead it 'grinds' against the lens cap.4.  We've researched repair and find that Olympus will charge between $214-$260 to fix this 16 month old camera.When it works, it's a decent camera.  Nice pictures.  But for the reasons above, I don't recommend this camera to anyone.
