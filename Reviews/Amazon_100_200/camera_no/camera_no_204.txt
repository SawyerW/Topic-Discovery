i have not owned this camera long i just got it today but it takes super fast pictures and without zooming in too close none of the pictures came out blurry. You definitly need a digital card, because it only takes 4 pictures without one. Also the picture look great not only on the camera but on the computer also. I havent dropped it yet so i dont know how tough it is but it doesnt seem flimsy to from my view only small. GREAT CAMERA!! I also took pictures with a child moving around and not one blurry pic. I'll say it again GREAT CAMERA!
