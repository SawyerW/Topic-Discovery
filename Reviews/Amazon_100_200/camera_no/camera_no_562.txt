The compact size and 5X zoom make this a great camera to carry with you every where you go.  The pictures are clear, the camera is easy to use, the battery life is much longer than other cameras I have had, and the multiple shooting modes pretty much guaranty that you will get the shot you want.  My only complaint is that there is no view finder - you have to preview your shot on the screen which is difficult when you are in very sunny conditions.  Even with the lack of view finder, I love this camera & am very, very happy with it!
