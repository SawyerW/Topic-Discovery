I purchased this camera for personal use for my kids and I. I've been very pleased with this camera. I got to really test it out recently when my children and I went to the zoo. It's so easy to use and I love the image stabilization feature because with two kids in tow, it can be hard to take pictures that are not fuzzy. With this feature it's so much easier to get clear pictures. Also, when I purchased the camera it came with Kodak batteries, I was surprised how long they lasted. Mind you, I had been using the camera off and on to take pictures before we went to the zoo for six and a half hours and the batteries finally died after four hours of being there. After taking a ridiculous amount of pictures, 350 to be exact, the camera was on a lot. I did find turning it off whenever possible helps seemed to help with the life of the batteries. I'm very happy with my decision to get this camera.
