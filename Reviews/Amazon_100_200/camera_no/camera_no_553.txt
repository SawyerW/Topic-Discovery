I decided to get one of the new Stylus cameras as my old camera was dying and the new ones are water resistant (supposedly waterproof to ten feet). I do a lot of canoeing and I believe that dampness hastened the demise of my previous camera.The camera takes excellent pictures and the 4 power optic zoom works quite well. I have used it for indoor and outdoor pictures. While it is not as versatile as the SLR types, it is good for quick pictures which is mostly what I take these days. It does have a fair amount of versatility, but it takes a bit of time to adjust.The only downside I have found on the camera is that it does not have a viewfinder, only the screen which tends to wash out in bright light. This has not posed a serious obstacle to any pictures I have taken to date, but it does restrict the ability to finely compose a picture. If this issue could be resolved, I would have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this unit.
