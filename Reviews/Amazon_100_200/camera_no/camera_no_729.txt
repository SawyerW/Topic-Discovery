I did a lot of research to determine what camera I wanted to start with.  This is my first digital camera.  I purchased the Fuji because I wanted an easy to use, simple, starter digital camera for a reasonalbe price.  The camera itself is great.  Very simple to figure out and use.  THEN-I loaded the USB and editing software into my WIN98, pentium 2 Dell computer.  Everytime I connected the USB cable to the camera to download images, my computer gave me fatal exception errors and crashed.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the software several times and went to Fuji website and downloaded the software from them.  Still, same results.  I contacted Dell, in case something was wrong with my computer, they said I needed to talk with the camera manufacturer.  I tried to email Fuji tech service through their web site, it gave me a message "no host found".  Well, after days of this, I am fed up.  No starter camera is worth this.  I'm am returning this camera and going with a Kodak.
