I bought my FD91 shortly after they first came out. While the camera does have some limitations, the benefits far outweigh them. Great for pictures in almost all lighting conditions. The 14x lens was the biggest selling point. It's great for everything from wildlife photography to sporting events. The limited resolution can be a problem. Don't plan on enlarging any of the photo's, the pixels become apparent quickly. It was a great purchase at (this price) and at the current price a steal. I hope they put they 14x lens back in in some of the higher resolution models. That would be a killer combination.
