There are plenty of digital cameras that are smaller, lighter, more portable than this, but I wouldn't trade this camera for any of the newer models I've seen.  This one is really easy to use (especially for basic functions such as still photos, use of zoom, photo viewing, and file transfer) and the manual is well-written and easy to understand.  The picture quality is excellent, and to be honest is usually a lot better than I need.  I generally end up saving the files at much lower resolution than possible, and still get clear quality images.  Also an extremely durable camera in my experience...I have gone through many, but have been using this one for several years now, with no troubles beyond having to change the batteries once in a while.  Highly recommended.
