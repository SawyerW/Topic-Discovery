I initially had a kguard dvr and camera set and the quality was pretty bad on the recorded and streaming video.  I took those cameras and put them on this dvr and it was night and day.  Crank up all the quality settings and bask in the glory of this thing.  It's got all kinds of great configuration options and the motion masking tool is easy to use.  My only complaint is that the hard drive was not well secured inside the unit.  Other than that it's an incredible deal.  I'm going to pair it with some even better cameras and really go nuts.
