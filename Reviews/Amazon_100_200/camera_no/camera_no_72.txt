Well, I can not hide the good features in the Z55- Big LCD- Fast playback- Fast start up- MMC/SD (You will enjoy this feature if you have a card reader instead of using the USB base)But I found two bad things in this camera:1. Indoor images are bad (opposite of the great images taken outdoor) I mean if you depend on a bulb light you will get bad images, otherwise it is perfect under the sun.2. Once I make a zoom (after transfering the images to my laptop not in the camera) for the images I dont get the same quality (bad sharpness) - opposite of the SONY T1 models .. everytime you enlarge you get higher qualityFinally, I recommend SONY.
