For someone who wants a basic standalone DVR system this is the one for you.  I bought this DVR to tryout so that I can evaluate the quality of the systems from Q-see. This DVR is fairly straight forward to setup and I noticed that the board also had an IDE port which was not on the specs (not that it matters much since SATA is cheaper). It is constructed quite well and does not "feel" flimsy.I did not test the networking functions yet but so far my only disappointment was the motion detection. It DOES NOT work well. Don't even bother trying all the different settings. I left mines on record all the time :(A better buy would be the Q-See QSDR008RTC which is an 8-channel DVR and it is not that much more expensive.Beware that this DVR DOES NOT have a VGA port so good luck trying to connect it to a computer monitor. Buy this product if you want to output to a TV alone (2 outputs are supported).
