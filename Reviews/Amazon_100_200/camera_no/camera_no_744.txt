This is my first digital camera.  I don't have previous experience to compare it to.  I did consider the Canon S-30 as well.  I liked the fact that Olympus would take AA batteries...I can just imagine running out of my rechargables on a once-in-a-lifetime photo situation.  At least I can get AA from a supermarket.Pros:* easy to point and shoot out of the box* preset modes for portrait, action, nighttime, etc. work well* uses AA battery, not proprietary cells* EASY to load pics onto computer. It recognizes the camera if you simply plug the USB in...no drivers needed!* Photoshop Elements software that it comes with is pretty powerful* pictures are clear and colors are sharp* has optional manual modes to set shutter speed, aperature size, or full manual* easy to preview and delete unwanted picsCons:* bigger than Canon S-30* lens cap issue--if you take it off you'll think you broke your camera!* only comes with 16MB card for about 15 pics* you need to buy rechargable batteries---the one's that come with it are disposable and only last 30 minutesOverall, it was the best of all worlds vs. the competition.  Price good.  Features great.  Take great shots.
