I must say, I am severely disappointed with the D80.  I "upgraded" from the Kodak 14n, sacrificing megapixels for speed, shadow detail, and ease of use.  Yes, the D80 is better in these capacities, but it lacks in one area that is critical- focusing.  I have tried this camera with four lenses, both pro and amateur, including the new 18-200 VR, and still have yet to produce consistently sharp images.  I have tried these lenses on two different D80s, and still run into the same problem.  It's not motion blur, as the images are frozen, but still have an unacceptable soft-focus to them, almost as if the focal plane is out of alignment.  My wife uses the D40 with kit lenses, and doesn't run into this.  Now, maybe I'm doing something wrong, and I'm willing to listen, but when a subject is out of focus, shooting in daylight at f16, there's something wrong.  I got better focus from my original D1.
