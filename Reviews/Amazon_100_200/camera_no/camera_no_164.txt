I bought this camera because it was the smallest cam for the price on the market. It was worth every penny! The LCD is amazing. I bought some Palm Univseral Screen protectors just to make sure I keep it nice and clean because its going to be spending a lot of time in my pocket. The menus are perfect, everything made perfect sense. The button layout is perfect as well. Pictures come out really good, I did have to adjust some settings to get the best quality. I wouldnt say that these are the best pictures ive ever seen, but they get the job done. The video mode on this camera is also pretty nice. I almost find myself taking more videos than pictures. This camera is packed full of features, you can even use it as a document/data viewer. I bought a high speed 2gb Sd card and threw it in without an problems. Basically, if you want an ultra slim stylish camera, this is the one to get!
