I got this TRENDnet TV-IP422W when it was greatly on sale, despite all the reviews concerning the wireless problems staying connected and other cons people here have written about.The camera was easy to setup, works well, and for the price cannot be beat.  But as was suggested buried way down in these reviews: get the Blue Iris software.  For $50 the Blue Iris software fixes all of these problems (i.e. you can schedule a reboot of the camera every few days ... since I started doing this my wireless connection is flawless).It would be nice if the camera came with decent software, but given the price it is a great buy.
