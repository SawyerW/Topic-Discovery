I use this camera to monitor the back alley behind my home. I am using it and I must say I am very impressed w/ this purchase. This camera ships with secureview software which is pretty straight forward and easy to use. I don't like the ipcongig application it ships with and it is somewhat slow. This camera was easy to use but I am also somewhat network savvy and forwarded a port within minutes. I have purchased another 2 of these cameras that I will use with one of trendnets wireless routers. i will share my feedback when it is all setup. PTZ is easy to use and so is the e-mail detection feature. This is a good buy overall if you can get it around $199.99 which is what I did.
