I tested the cam for about two weeks. Overall this cam has many features but the performance in low light without flash is not good.I will mention only specific things that are not in the other reviews:pros:-- good outdoor daylight pics [all digital cams above $150 are good enough in this area]-- good pics with flash-- can use digital zoom during movie-- can use continuous focus during movie but the sound of the moving lens will be recorded also-- has an alignment grid that helps a lot if you frequently shoot text (can be turned on and off). It helps to check if the cam is exactly parallel to the text.-- lack of barrell distortion when shooting text in macro mode (a rectangle doesn't look 'swallen')cons:-- noisy pics indoors in incandescent light without flash-- noisy videos indoors in incandescent light-- too dark videos indoors in incandescent light (exposure compensation doesnt help)-- problems focusing indoors without flash even during the day
