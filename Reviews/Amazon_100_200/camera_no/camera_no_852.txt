I'd been waiting to get this camera for a while and got it about a month ago when it finally went on sale for under $225.00. I love it. It doesn't eat batteries as bad as most of the other digital cameras out there. The aluminum case is super sturdy. Picture quality is great. I got the viking 512 flash card on sale and it will take around 300 pictures at highest quality and highest resolution. Pictures print out well at 8 x 10. With the standard viking card at the highest resolution and size it will shoot about one frame per second. I would suggest getting the Ultra II compact flash card with the 9mb write speed if you plan on doing a lot of action sequence shots. I'll be getting it soon. Also having all the manual features available is great. Plus the camera is nice and compact and very ergonomic. Over-all I give this camera a 5 outta 5 as a great point and shoot camera. Plus you can get the other lense attachments from Canon if you want or the waterproof case.
