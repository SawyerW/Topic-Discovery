Very versatile little camera. Compact, light, nice looking. Feels sturdy and is sturdy. My little daughter knocked it out of the car when I first got it. The body split apart a little, but I snapped it back together and it hasn't missed a beat.3.2 megapixels is plenty to take nice pictures. Couple this camera with a Canon i860 printer and Photoshop Essentials (plus a Photoshop Essentials tutorial book - I recommend Photoshop Essentials for the Digital Photographer by Scott Kelby) to correct and touch up your pictures and you've got a nice photo studio right in your house.Don't be afraid to buy this camera.
