I purchased a new interior starter system, plus a used interior starter system on ebay, plus two used "spy" clock/cameras on ebay.The 4 camera system was up & running in 30 minutes or less, and my wife was observing our remodeling contractors from work.The picture is good, the recorded files are easy to access, and they seem to be made well {I dropped the "clock" off the mantle & it still works).The biggest problem I have with the system is that the last camera (farthest away from the PC) drops off now & then, & I have to "reboot" it.It appears that new starter systems can be found for less than the price of a new add-on camera (If you shop around).  So save some bucks & have a spare receiver to boot.I am happy with the system, & it gets an A- grade from me.
