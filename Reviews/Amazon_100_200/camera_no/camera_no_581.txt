I was expecting delivery in 7 days and was surprised to receive it in 3 days. That was astounding. It took about a good 15 minutes to install the software. After that I was up and running in a few minutes. The clock camera replay gives excellent quality for such a small camera and the motion detector is excellent. Replay is easy as 1,2,3. Dont forget to turn your camera sound off if any of your cameras are inside.Monitoring my camera from work is so simple I couldnt believe it. I took advantage of a special discount to save selected recordings to the WiLife website.For the money is one of the best buys I have ever taken advantage of.
