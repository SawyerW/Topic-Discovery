I've been considering a digital camera for almost a year, and my in-laws have a Kodak 6330 that they like a lot.  Kodak's general ease-of-use was a definite draw to me.I bought the LS743 yesterday, and it was very easy to set up and begin using.  Battery life is excellent, and the battery is rechargeable (I bought a 2nd battery for only $20 to have a spare, too).  The camera is compact but seems very well-put-together.  My in-laws have a 6000 dock, and this camera will work on it, too.The lens is an upscale lens that is supposed to be a bit better than Kodak's lower-end models - I haven't taken enough pictures yet to notice the difference.I'd say the camera is excellent for beginners, but also there are plenty of features in the system for someone who wants to be able to adjust the shots on their own for a more-customized photo.  (At least it seems that way from reading the user guide.)  :-)All in all, great little camera!
