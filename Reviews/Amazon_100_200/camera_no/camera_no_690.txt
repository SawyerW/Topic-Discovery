I have a E410, E500 and now the E520 body. All of these are great cameras. The E520 has a very fast recycle rate on both the images and the flash. It is very easily used as point-and-shoot in auto mode and I can still get all of the effects that I could with a manual film camera. One point I will make very clear. If you buy this as a "kit" with lenses don't expect this performance. The lenses that come in most kits are cheap. Don't get me wrong, they work great in full sunlight... anything other though you will likely have slow responses and blurry photos. Many times the camera focus just will not acquire from low lighting. Buy good quality lenses and you will not be disappointed!
