It is very nice camera just like a lot of people wrote. Here I only want to point out cons. in this camera as follow:1. No wide angle option like canon s60, pro 1.2. No good marco option ( minimum distance is 10cm, it is  hard to shoot small object. but canon pro 1 has super marco so that you can shoot object as close as 2.4 cm).3. Built-in flash is not very effective ( effective range is only less than 3 meters), fortunately, this has hot shoe but external flash is very pricy.4. you need memory stick pro to use high qulity vedio. it is very costy.
