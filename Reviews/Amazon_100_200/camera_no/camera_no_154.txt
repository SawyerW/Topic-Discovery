I collect older Cameras , in this case a Nikon Coolpix 8400 ! 24-85mm , 8MP and in LN- Condition from KEH ! Amazing Detailed Images from an older ( 2004/05 ) Camera ! I put a Tube addition and a UV filter on it , and it is really a Nice Nikon ! No match for Today's Current Models , but quite a package in it's Time ! New Batteries are Difficult to Find , but Amazon had One for Me !  A Magnesium Body and nice and small to hold and to use , which I fully intend to use with great enjoyment ! R E Keay
