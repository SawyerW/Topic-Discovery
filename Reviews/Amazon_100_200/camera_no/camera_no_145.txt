I own the FUJI S7000 and E550 both are 6.3 MEGs. I also just purchased the SONY DSC-P150 (7.2 MEGs) I took 20 pictures using each camera using the settings all set to AUTO. The pictures were from close up to max zoom. I then had the best of each camera enlarged to 12 in. by 18 in. at COSTCO high end FUJI processor. The FUJI colors were rich and not actual colors.The SONY P-150 was more true to actual color. Both SONY and FUJI were about the same in detail of the subject and were intuitive to operate plus fast to start up. I was looking for a smaller compact camera and the SONY is the best small and yet very good quality pictures. The FUJI has a 6 optical and excellent body shape. when I viewed the DSCV3 7.2 I was disapointed at how slow  the start up was. For that reason I decided not to buy the DSCV3. My NIKON 35MM is still way ahead in detail quality/color for enlagements!
