I recently faced the "System 2 Error" many other users.  Luckily, I have a three year warranty and it was fully covered and came back within 3wks of mailing (I sent it just before Christmas so it took longer).The Pros:Excellent featuresLightweight (I have small hands and cannot hold much weight)Came with a Remote controlLarge LCDetc...The Cons:Expensive (I paid $700 plus $135 3yr warrantly)Slow shutter speedSlow writing to flashHas a tendency to over/undercompensate EV (so you need to play with the function quite a bit)Dreaded LENS ERROR!!!!Overall, I am happy with my camera.  I never owned and SLR and this camera is a great stepping stone for someone like me who wants something like an SLR but can't afford/doesn't know how to use one.After owning the camera two years, I will definitely keep it as my, "throw in the handbag and go" camera but if you can afford an SLR, definitely buy one.
