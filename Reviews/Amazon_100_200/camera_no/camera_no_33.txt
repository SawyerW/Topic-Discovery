The new Canon 20D raises the bar for digital photography at a reasonable price.  At 5fps and 8.2 megapixels it obviously puts Canon in a somewhat of a quandry, in my opinion.  With this speed and memory, the company should re-think its pricing of the Mark II which entered the market at a high price.Additionally, the competition is hurrying to introduce a quality product in a modest price range.  Frankly, I'm not reading much from the others!  Since Canon has introduced the 20D, this marks the third digital they've introduced in 18+ months.  It seems to me the other manufacturers are still trying to get out of turn three, while Canon already has crossed the finish line.
