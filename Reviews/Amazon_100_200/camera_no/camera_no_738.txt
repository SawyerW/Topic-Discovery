Mid-range digicams are all over the place, and selecting one over another may be as much a question of personal taste as one of true competitive advantages. Having said that, I have always been an Olympus fan, and my satisfaction with them dates back many years. This model has 3+ meg resolution to allow for great enlargements, a capable a 3:1 optical zoom, very good optics and a nice flash. The battery arrangement is okay (AAs), and connectivity to your PC is through a nice USB (at least until you get a separate card reader). At this price point however, I might be more tempted to get the Minolta S304 and pick up a better zoom lens.
