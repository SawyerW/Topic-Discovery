- Battery life is excellent - I hav used camera for two weeks with flash photos and battery is only at 1/2.- Flash photos are very good color and image.- Flash adjusts very well to almost all photo situations.- Zoom is very powerful. I am able to get close-up shots from far away.- The wide angle is wide enough for almost every wide shot needed.- I have the camera set to 10.2 m and fine. I can still take over 500 photos with 4GB HCSD memory.- The color seems to always be true.- Flash recovery is fast.-Automatic flash pop up when needed.- The camera set-up on most defaults make taking photos easy and very sharp.I recommend this to everyone.
