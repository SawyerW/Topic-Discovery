The best part I like about this camera is that it is very easy to use. Taking photographs is fun with user friendly menu. I did not even pen the manual. I have taken several good photographs using this camera. Thge pictures were crystal clear at highest resolution. But if you are lookign for a camera which can zoom, then this camera is not for you. I take only point and shoot pictures most of the time and so its perfect for me.Okay now I want to tell something about the part after you take the snaps. That is downloading. The software is so easy to use and when you plug in this camera the software automatically downloads all the pictures. Actually on my computer I can see the camera as a drive in windows explorer.Things I dont like are low memory and low battery life. I recommend buying rechargeable batteries and 256 Mb compact flash card which is right now on sale in amazon.com.
