Pretty awesome - this is compact digital camera #4, and of those I've had, it's also my favourite.Positives:- Small enough to take everywhere- 5x zoom is significantly better than 3x- Image stabilization really does work - it won't solve all camera shake every time, but if I take the same picture with stabilizer on and off, you can usually see a significant difference- Weather resistance is awesome - I take it places I would have been afraid to take my last one, so I get more pictures I would have missed otherwise!- Screen brightens up very well in low light, with my last one, shooting at night was more of a blind guess.- 1600 ISO is nice - a grainy picture is still way better than a blurry one.Negatives:- I wish it had some sort of semi-manual mode, maybe shutter priority or something- Manual focus is not needed, but being able to set focus to infinity is sometimes handy- I wish the lens was a 2.8- Auto white balance indoors with no flash is not very goodHope that is helpful to somebody
