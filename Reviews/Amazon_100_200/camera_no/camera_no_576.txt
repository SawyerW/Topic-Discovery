Two months ago, I bought the Stylus 750 to replace an aging Kodak digital. Unlike the Kodak, the Olympus has no "delete all phots" feature, so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera's LCD display, push the delete button on the back of the camera, confirm that I really want to delete it, then it's gone. One photo gone and 235 to go. It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos (each deletion requires 3 button pushes, one picture at a time). I've now bought a replacement camera (a Canon) that has a "delete all photos" option. I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos. It's a flaw that makes the camera functionally so clunky that I'd advise looking to another manufacturer for your digital camera purchase.
