I bought my V3 in February of 2005 so this is a long term report.  I've shot at least 5000 photos with it over the years and I'm still happy with it and it hasn't broke or gave me trouble.  I came to this from years of using a Canon F1 and EF.  Outside of the cool factor, I can't say I miss my old film cameras.  Don't miss the weight on my neck either.Just ordered the Sony HVL-F32X flash unit for this since I have confidence that I'm not ready to move on to another camera until I forced to by circumstance.  Hope I don't drop it ;)WesNot so happy now (2012).  I learned a few months ago that the shutter button has a habit of breaking off.  On a fairly expensive camera, a tiny piece of under engineered plastic that is critical failing is not acceptable.  Lowered rating from 5 to 3  It was a great camera for its time.
