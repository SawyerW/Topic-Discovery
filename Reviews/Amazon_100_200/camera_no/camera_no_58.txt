I saw this new camera and fell in love with the large screen. I mean how many times can you look at a 1 inch screen and figure out if you want to keep the pic? The large screen is the best I've seen. It's a bit pricey but worth the money. It's thin enough to keep in my pocket. Only problem is that they don't sell anything to protect your camera if it's bouncing around in your pocket. Get a 1 Gig  card and you can keep on shooting. It makes  a very nice picture, even on the fly. The playback of the flies are FAST, FAST, FAST!!!
