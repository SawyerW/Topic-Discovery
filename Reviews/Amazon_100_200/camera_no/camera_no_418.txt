I bought the D80 a week ago and have been experimenting with all the features the camera has to offer. I went to my local store and tried Rebel XTi, A100, and D80 and hands down the D80 was the best. From the menu layout to the feel of the camera in my hands it just seemed like a solid piece of equipment. It was a little more expensive then the competition but If I am going to spend a lot of money on a camera lenses etc.. It should be what I wanted and the D80 by far hands down took the best pictures and was the most pleasing to use. Although I am not a pro photographer by any means I am technically savy and I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants consistently great results with relative ease of use.
