The Nikon Coolpix 8800 is an excellent upgrade from the 8700.  The image resolution, vibration reduction, zoom range, lens quality and build quality alone make this camera worth five stars. Sure, it is not perfect, but no camera is. People who whine that this camera doesn't have good manual focusing, should be aware that no prosumer cameras have good manual focusing.  I know because I have tried nearly all of them at Camera World in Portland, Oregon, when deciding to buy the 8800.I own a Canon DSLR for my bread and butter camera, but could not find a better backpacking/mountain biking camera than the 8800.  It is light, strong and I can make gorgeous reproductions up to 16x20, even larger with some careful interpolation.This is the prosumer camera to beat, an excellent second camera, with much better battery life than previous Nikon Coolpix.
