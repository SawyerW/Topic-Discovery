The Canon A70 Digital Cam is just Amazing. It's easy to use and has so many shooting modes and features. 3 min video time and endless shots once you've got the right Compact Flash.It comes with a 16MB card but i recently bought the 256 MB and now I'm able to take about 530 pix at the highest resolution. I just love this camera and would recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!!!There lots of Pros about the cam and i suppose some Cons, like blurred images once in a while,  but truth is ; i'm still reading the manual so its a lot of stuff to play around with.Overall , this is a damn good Digi Cam and trust me, Once you buy it and you see what it can do, you'll see how every dollar you spent on it is Soooooooooooo worth it.I now have so many pictures on my PC  and i use it daily to catch all the great moments i've been missing in the past.SHOUT OUT TO CANON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love My Canon A70 just love itttttttttttttttttYou should get one too!!!!!!!!!!
