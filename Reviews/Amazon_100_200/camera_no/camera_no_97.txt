I would agree with other reviews on this site that the camera takes good outdoor shots. It took some tuning to get indoor flash shots that were in focus but I figured it out - I have used non digital cameras for years. I was pleased with the features, though thought it a bit smaller than I needed. I bought it used from a friend. It did not have a mark on it. I took it on vacation.After using the camera productively for several days, routinely swapping in recharged batteries or fresh memory cards, the following error message appeared on the screen  - Card Cover Not Closed. But the card cover door was closed; the memory card and the battery were properly seated - and reseated, replaced, recharged, etc. I didn't solve the problem and could take no more pictures with it.When I returned home, I sent it back to Olympus. It was out of warranty. They asked about $125 to repair it. Since there was no physical damage, the price seemed high - I am walking away from it unconsoled. Perhaps I will inspire one of you to buy  something different. I am looking at a midpriced Cannon.
