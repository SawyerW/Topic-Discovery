I went to the store to buy the highly rated Nikon 2200, but then saw how good a value this camera was, and ended up by buying both. I later returned the Nikon.The camera takes very good photos and the quality of LCD is excellent. I compared the photos with those taken by the similarly priced Nikon 2200, and photos from this camera had better color, more detail etc.But one thing I am not impressed about is the flash. A lot of time, the flash leaves the image too dark. Sometimes though the image is perfect, so I am not sure if it is something I am doing.The camera is light, but a little difficult to hold on to. Next shot delay is almost non-existent for non-flash photos. For flash photos, the dealy is about 5 seconds mainly due to the flash charging. But compared to the Nikon 2200, flash charging was faster.The camera starts up quickly, and the zoom works well.The camera is small enough to carry in your pocket.In all, a very good value for the money.
