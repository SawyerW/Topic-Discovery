I just downloaded my 3000th picture off my camera and I really like it.  In hindsight I wish I had paid some extra and got the optical zoom but that is just me.  The pictures are clear the color is bright in all but the most extreme conditions.  It was easy to use and with the purchase of a $5 camera bag, it has stood up well.  I recommend some Nickel Hydrate batteries to go with it.  It takes around 300 pictures on a pair of freshly recharged batteries for me.  I haven't printed much off as I prefer to post them online on one of the many free photo sites but the few I have, I have been happy with their performance.
