My son was 3.5yo when he wanted a camera, so we talked to him about how they were not toys and you have to take care of them.We found the Bean.. It is great for him. he can take great photos and clip it to his belt, it is rugged and sturdy. We have not gotten prints yet but were told that it will do up to a 5x7. I know that it has been dropped about 3ft from the ground and still keeps working. If you have a young photographer in the making this is a buy you will be happy with!
