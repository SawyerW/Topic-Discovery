I purchased the 20d in Feb 2011, around 7 years after it was first introduced. The camera was so good built that it looked like new and seemed like it will last another 5 years. I bought it for less than $300 which was completely worthy of every bucks spent. This one is probably the cheapest used dslr you can find. However, remember that it was designed for semi-pro level photographers. It may lack some basic features found in modern cameras like live-view, recording video... The screen is also way too small but it's better than having no screen at all anyways. It is heavier compared to newer models but it is sturdy like a rock. If you are a beginner and looking for something to play with. Don't hesitate. It is the one for you. Spend less on the body so that you can invest more in lenses. Maybe in the next 2 years, when your skill is ripe, buy a better and more advanced body to go beyond the limitation.
