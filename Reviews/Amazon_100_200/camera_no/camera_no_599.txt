Thus far I'm pretty impressed with this security system.  The cost is relatively low, setup is easy and the software offers many options for recording, viewing and notifications.  The video signal travels through the electrical wiring in your house so there is no need to run additional cables for the video.  You just need a standard electrical outlet.  Also, you can't connect the camera to a surge protector due to the filters built into those devices.  I haven't had to contact support so I can't comment on that part.Pros:- Fairly low cost- Easy setup with good well written instructions.- Good software with many options but still easy to use.- Able to monitor from any computer with an Internet connection.- Good video quality in good light.Cons:- Poor low light performance.  Hard to ID even cars that pass under a bright street light by our home.- Frame frame drops in low light.  The normal frame rate I set is 15fps.  This seems to drop to about 5fps in low light.This could be a great system but they need to improve the low light capabilities
