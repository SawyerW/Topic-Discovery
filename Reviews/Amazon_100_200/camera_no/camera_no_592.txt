Setup was easy. From that point on, forget the rest. The software reports that the camera reception is poor. NEWSFLASH To WiLIFE: Both the camera and reciever were plugged into wall sockets less than 4 feet apart and they're on the same circuit!?! I get a better connection using my Wireless-G Webcam. And talk about picture quality?!? The webcam (MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE) also provides 2-3x better pic quality! And then there's the $80.00 PER-YEAR charge just to get the BUILT-IN PTZ functions to work!!! I won't be buying any further add-ons to this system, and you should learn from my experience.
