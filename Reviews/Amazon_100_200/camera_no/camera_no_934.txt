Hi, I just tried out the S4i and have to say I'm disappointed with it.  I was really excited due to the size and small lag time.  I did a comparison of the s4i and my existing Canon S400 and the Canon wins with no question.  The image quality of my Canon is much brighter and sharper than any of the images on the S4i.Couple of other things I don't like about the S4i.  The USB Cable isn't a standard size.  Why?  Also, you need to load the specific USB software to get XP to "See the USB Storage Device".  It should show up as a camera.  I didn't have this problem with the Canon s400.  This is Pentax's way to get the consumer from returning it once they've tried it.  All stores say that you can't return it once the software's open.  When I opened my camera the software was already opened so I'm sure I'll have fun returning this.  I would go the the S400 or better for brighter and sharper pictures without the fuss and software.Good Luck
