I like logitech products. I installed the software, usb port and camera very quickly.  I did not read the manuals. I was able to see the camera contents quickly, both through the desktop tool and online web page.I was surprised and very disappointed to learn that I cannot control the camera's zoom, pan, etc. function from the desktop.  You have to upgrade to premium plan at $80 year to get that basic function. I found that ridiculous.I could not get email alerts to go to my own domain mail server.  I finally managed to get it to work with gmail.The alerts mechanism is odd.  I cannot figure out how to get it to send video clips over email during a motion sense.Overall, easy to setup, but the remote control and email config are very bad.  I may send this back after a few unsuccessful more attempts.
