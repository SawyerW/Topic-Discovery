I recently purchased the Nikon D80 with the 18-135mm kit lens and I am quite pleased with the quality and performance of both the camera and lens. It is my first digital SLR, though I have had film SLRs and three digital "point and shoots."I bought the Nikon after weeks of research and indecision during which I read countless reviews and forum messages comparing the Nikon and Canon systems, and I also handled the actual cameras in stores. I finally decided on the Nikon because, among many other desirable features:1. It has a very fine and solid feel. It is built well and fits my hands perfectly.2. The viewfinder is large and very bright, by far the best.3. It has spot metering.4. The battery life is great.5. It uses SD cards, which I already had.6. There is a top LCD status panel.7. Grid lines are available to help with composition and camera leveling.Image quality is superb. My pictures so far are surprisingly good, considering my inexperience and the complexity of the camera. I realize that any available DSLR is probably more than good enough to supply my needs but I am delighted with this one.
