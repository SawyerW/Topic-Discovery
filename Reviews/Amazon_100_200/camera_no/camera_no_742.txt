Well, after reading lots and lots of various digital camera reviews, and trying the C-2040Z, I went for this one. And, I cannot tell you how glad I am for doing so! It's a great camera, automatic modes are peachy, but the real treat are all the manual options you can set by yourself, and experiment, in order to take some of the coolest photos around. Fenomenal!As far as other remarks go, I see a lot of people minding it has no audio in jack. Well, after all, this is a digital photo camera, designed to take stills right? Filming movement is only a bonus, but if you need movement and sound, think for a moment. You need a movie camera, not a photo one. So, I realy don't have any bad words for this one. The price is affordable, the quality is superb, and it has most of the features you'll likely need.
