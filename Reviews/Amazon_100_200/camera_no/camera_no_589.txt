I bought it as nanny cam.It was easy to install and use. However, it doesn't record sound which is important function to me as a nanny cam. When you set it to motion mode (only record when there is motion detected), it doesn't pick up fine motions. Therefore, I have to set it to continuous recording.I only bought one camera (because it's so expensive) and I set it up in the living room. Since it doesn't record sound, I can't tell what kind of tone she is using when she is interacting with my baby and I can't tell what the nanny is doing when she goes to the kitchen or my bedrooms.I returned the product mainly because it doesn't record sound. If you need a cam for Surveillance purple, sound recording might not be important. Yet, you can find a cheaper one for that purpose.
