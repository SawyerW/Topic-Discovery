I have owned this camera for approx. 18 month and I still love it.  It is one of the easiest digital cameras to get to know and use.  From the first day I got it I had it out of the box and shooting right away.  It's that simple.  The only negative factor of the camera is the lack of a Hot Shoe Flash option.  The C3020Z has several flash options for various lighting conditions; however, I have grown in my photography and require more advanced lighting options.  As a starter camera this is a perfect introduction to digital photography.  It has certainly helped me to expand in my Digital skills and knowledge, but as I move towards being a Professional Amateur I have out grown this model.  That's my $0.02.
