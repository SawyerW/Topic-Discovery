I got this camera as a supplimentary camera to my nicer Fuji.  What I wanted was something that could easily and confortably fit in my pocket, instead of having to have a camera around my neck all the time.  The size and form factor is excellent for this; it feels no bigger then a cell phone in your pocket.Picture quality is great.  Pictures are crisp and clear.  Macro mode takes very detailed close-ups.It would be nice to have more then 2X zoom, but that is what my bigger camera is for, so no big deal.A note the date being retained when the battery is removed.  The date is only lost if the battery is out for a period of time.  I got an extra battery off eBay (way cheaper then what is offered on Amazon) and on a swap out, the time and date stays.  There is probably a capacitor on the memory that keeps this setting.  This cap can only provide power to the memory for so long before needing a recharge.  Get an extra battery off eBay for $10, problem solved.For the money, this is an excellent sidekick to your primary camera.
