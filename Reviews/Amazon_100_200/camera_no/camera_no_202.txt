I'm not a pro and like the point and shoot cameras.  Everyone has commented on how well my photos have turned out.  Outdoor shots turn out particularly well.  I also really enjoy the video option.  The high quality creates files too large to email and I'm still working on how to convert them to smaller files.  The lowest quality video is decent for e-mail but you can't use the zoom or the picture completely degrades.  I love the small size, best shot options and large, bright lcd screen.  This camera would be great for someone looking to get more interested in and learn more about photography and uploading/emailing to web sites and friends.  There are a number of manual settings to play with too.  So far, no real complaints.  I'm your average Joe photographer but I've been very happy with the quality/colors of photos and videos with this camera.  And it's really cute!
