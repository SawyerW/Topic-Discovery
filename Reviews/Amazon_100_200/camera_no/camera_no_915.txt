I've owned this camera for a year now, and it is my first digital camera. I'm pleased with it. You can carry it anywhere and it's surprisingly good at wide-range photos of landscapes and buildings as well as group photos at parties and other gatherings.My only problem with it is the flash: it's not very good for inside scenes, unless you are very close to your subject. However, if the room is brightly lit, the photo should be OK. If there is dark furniture or walls, you'll get a black background.It's definitely not good for concerts or stage performances.There is also a half-second latency which could present problems when trying to photograph sports, races, etc.Nonetheless, I've had a lot of fun with this little box. It was especially good at the beach this summer, as well as on some recent road trips through autumn scenery.
