I got this toy camera for something fun to have in my photography bag.  It's very simple to use, insert film, wind it up, and start shooting.  There is no changing of the aperture or anything else for that matter. It is NOT a true-color film camera.  The contrast from each picture is different from reality.  Now this is why I bought this camera.  Depending on the film used and light conditions, colors can become extremely vivid, washed out, or just right.  It's hard to tell what kind of color you'll get unless your an advanced or professional photographer.  I myself am neither, however I'm not a beginner.  I use more digital.  Another thing this camera produces is the vignetting (the darkening in the corners).  Again, depending on the film and light conditions, vignetting may appear.  This camera can be purchased in a variety of colors such as blue (the one shown), white, black, gold, yellow, pink, etc).  I am giving it five stars because it has done what I wanted it to do.
