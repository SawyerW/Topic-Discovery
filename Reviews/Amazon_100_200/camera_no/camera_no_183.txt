Great camera! It's the smallest 7.2MP on the market.  It's smaller than my wallet, I can carry it with me all the time, I get to use it a lot more.  It's a fun camera, the picture quality is good.  Unless you are a professional and take action shots or need a lot more zoom, this camera will serve every purpose.  The size, again, is a major advantage, you don't have to walk around with a camera bag, so you don't look like a tourist, and can have it with you all the time.Shipping was quick, and the goods were in excellent condition.
