This camera has mechanisms in it to allow panning and zooming.  You pay for them when you buy the camera.  The dirty trick is that, after you set everything up, you find out panning/zooming don't work without a subscription.  Also,  if you are interested in remote viewing, your streams need to go through their servers before they come back to you. It may resolve connectivity issues to some extent but is like having a peep hole to view all their customers.This would be one great little camera if it was not for these things.  The software is well organized and relatively easier to set up than some other cameras I've had.
