I love Olympus cameras, that being said the E-520 is my second Olympus DSLR.. In 2008 I returned to college to obtain my degree in photograhy and Olympus was sponsering a contest for college students. I was intrigued and borrwed the E-3 from the school and let's just say it has benn love ever since :)  In fact I had the camera for two weeks when the school called me to remind me to return it!  I was only supposed to have it three day.The E-3 ws out of my budget, so I  bought this beauty and today even after 4 years and once Olympus sent me a brand new E-520,, which was totally unexpected, I still love this amazing little camera. She is fully customizable, the colors are absolutely amazing and I've been able to use Olympus prime film lenses on it, so nice.  No regrets on the purchase or shooting Olympus they make amazing cameras.  I also owned the E-420, curranlty own E-PL1 snf the VR-340 point and shoot and I've nenver been dissapointed with any of these cameras.
