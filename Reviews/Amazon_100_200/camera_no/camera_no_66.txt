I love this camera and it takes terrific pictures. Have an intermitent problem with lens jamming when extended.  Camera 2 months old, problem from beginning.  My problem is with Casio. They will only replace the new 2 month old camera with a reconditioned product.  I find this unacceptable and would never buy another Casio product because of their customer service and warranty.  When you pay a lot of money for a new camera you expect it replaced with a new camera, not a reconditioned camera I never would have bought to begin with.  Fortunately for me I was able to have the camera replaced at point of purchase.  It is a terrific, easy to use camera with excellent photos, my only complaint is with Casio's cusomter service/warranty, and it will keep me from buying another Casio product.
