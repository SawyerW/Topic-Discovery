I just want to educate you on a topic you may not think about.This topic is the fact that some people write reviews that are from the company to make you buy it.  Take the one written on this product, the one that is first, and decide for yourself.I am not denying Casio's product, I am merely informing you on this issue.I would have to say overall the camera was good, some features I would take off.Casio is a reliable brand, though, because my camera fell in the water and it still works perfectly (was it luck or the camera?)Thank you for reading my informative review.
