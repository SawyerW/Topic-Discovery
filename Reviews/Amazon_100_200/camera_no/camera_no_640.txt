Had a defective one at first and had to send it back to Amazon. Returned it for a replacement without any problems. Fast, efficient return system. The replacement unit is fine.The product does as they claim but it can use a few upgrades such as;1. Give the user the capability to turn off the IR lighting. By not being able to turn the IR lighting off it limits the usefulness of the camera. If you're trying to view the outside world through a window at night the IR blinds the camera with a white reflective glare from the IR preventing any possibility of seeing something outside.2. It's nice that Trendnet gives the end user their SecurView software included in the box but there is no instructions on how to setup and use it. I'm still trying to learn it.3. Could use a real zoom lens; not the digital zoom. Too pixelated when zooming in. Basically useless zoom feature.
