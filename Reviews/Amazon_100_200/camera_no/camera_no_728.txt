This camera is easy to use and to take pictures BUT I think it would have been better if it had a lens cover!!  The camera does not come with a camera case and there is really no place to get one that truly fits this camera.  Since the back screen and front lens are exposed it poses the danger of getting scratched or banged up.I also found that this camera uses up batteries quite quickly althought some of the reviews I've read in the PC Magazines said that this camera lasted a long time...weird.Overall the pictures are quite clear and the colors are good but I think I would have paid a little more for a tad more features.
