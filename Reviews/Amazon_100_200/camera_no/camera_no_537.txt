I love the MP on this camera and especially the color.  I did buy it for the color too.  This is my first digital camera and I was new at it so one day I accidentally deleted all my pictures that were on the memory card.  That was my silly mistake, not the camera's.  I was hoping there was an automatic backup to the memory card but there wasn't.  There's a backup but you'd have to run it yourself and I hadn't been doing that.  Which now that I know is good to have because it can back up over 300 pictures or more.It's not so good to use indoors unless I just don't know how to set it because I tried different settings and still couldn't take good pictures, which led to me pressing all kinds of buttons and deleting my pictures.Other than that I like it.  It's not superslim if you need a slim camera but it's not bulky too.
