When I bought my Canon EOS Rebel T3 I was overwhelmed with all the bells and whistles.  I started in reading the manual and was really worried I wasn't getting clear enough information to use everything the camera offers.  Then I bought David Busch's book and my worries were put to rest.  Everything is explained in a clear way with lots of pictures to show you exactly what to do.  This is a must have book if you own this camera and are just learning photography with DSLR cameras. It even has a companion book with the same name but in a spiral bound field guide.  Buy it too and take it with you when you are away from your big book and need quick answers.
