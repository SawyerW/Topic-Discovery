What a nice camara!!! I think this is my most satisfied digital product! Honestly, I used to be a SONY bigot because of my SONY laptop and SONY P9 camara. However, today, the amazing Z55 changes everything. It was hard to make a choice between Z55 and Sony T1, but it will be much easier to choose when you have this little boy in your hand.I can not believe that Casio could ever be able to produce a stuff like this. I don't need any system installation to support USB link. I just plug the usb to my computer, then it's done.Except the size and weight, I was impressed by its 2560*1920 output picture. People who own this bad boy should know what I'm talking about, right? Everybody who take this bad boy home will be shocked like me.
