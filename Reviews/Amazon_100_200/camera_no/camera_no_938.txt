I really like this camera. The best thing about it is the speed, which operates as fast as you can press buttons. The picture quality is wonderful and the size and handling are exemplary. The only negative I could say is that it is Nikon's least expensive DSLR and feels that way. Not exactly "cheap" feeling, but more like "well made in Thailand" rather than "well made in Japan".  The best way to sum up this camera is that if offers all the speed, flexibility, customization, and picture quality of cameras costing 2 or 3 times more, but wraps it in a package that feels like a budget camera. The plus side of this though is that you don't feel so bad traveling around with it, being paranoid about it getting stolen, damaged, etc. - it's not a huge cost to replace it compared to more expensive cameras that offer the same performance and picture quality. I used the money I saved on the body to buy quality Nikon lenses and am exrtemely pleased with the quality of pictures I'm getting. I would buy it again in a second.(...)
