My wife purchased this camera after much research and comparison with the Canon DSLR products. She has used Nikons for decades and had some lens that would fit so we went with this camera. The one major disapointment with the Nikon product is that you can not compose a picture using the LCD screen on the back of the camera. Nowhere does Nikon tell you that this LCD is for playback ONLY. All of the Canon products have real time use of the LCD to compose pictures. Heck, even cell phones let you use their screens for real time photo composition. The lack of this function and the lack of any reference to the lack of this function by Nikon make this product unacceptable. Shame on you Nikon.
