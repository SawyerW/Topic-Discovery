Got this camera for Christmas (am I lucky or what).  Great camera and pretty good resolution. The ability to use floppies is very convenient (and Apple thinks floppies are dead).  Easy to send an entire disc of pics to  relatives after copying them on my home computer.  And even easier to send  slideshows of pics as attachments to email.  Can also print out nice photos  on color printer without a problem. This is a great camera for taking  photos that you can do so many things with. Just wish floppy held more  data.... Now when Sony finally comes out with their high volume storage  disc (100MB), hope they will update this camera to hold THAT...I would buy  it in a second.
