I bought this IP camera based on the reviews, although it had it's share of negative feedback.  However, overall, it looked promising.  Well.... after 3 hours of dinking with it, it got returned to Amazon.  I AM technically inclined, but getting this camera to work smoothly with my setup( Cradlepoint MBR1000 router and computer wih Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit) was beyond my ability.  I never got it to work wirelessly.  The webpage would just hang after changing the wireless configurations to work with my router.  The router would give it an IP address by the way and the camera would blip in and and out existence on the router's wireless devices list.  Even when wired, it was SOOOOO laggy that is was unusable.  Anyway, maybe it didn't like Cradlepoint, maybe it didn't like Vista 64 (although I would think this wouldn't be a problem since it works by IP access through Internet Explorer), but after 3 hours of wasted time, I didn't like it!  Just my experience for your consideration.
