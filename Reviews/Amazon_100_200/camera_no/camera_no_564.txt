This camera is too complex for my first digital. Actuallyits my first camera since my army days 30 years ago. Its a bit too small, for my large hands and if not for the low price I would have sent it back. I will give it to my good friend and let her deal with it. She has more experience and I can always borrow it from her. Other than my personal problems with the new age techno digital minaturized devices this camera takes very good pictures and if you take the time to figure it out you'll be very pleased. Thank you Richard
