I bought the camera to take pictures of students in my high school classes for an end of the year slide show. I did some research and did not find any cameras that matched this one for the price (USB interface, LCD, 8 MB smartmedia card along with a 16 MB bonus disk upon purchase). I had some difficulty getting everything set up. I had to buy a Scandisk to download pictures into Windows NT, for example. Once I got it all figured out, however, it was an extremely simple camera to operate, and the pictures are extremely high quality. It will chew through batteries, but only if you use the LCD panel extensively. I use it sparingly, preferring to take pictures the old fashioned way: through the viewfinder. My LCD went out just this last week and it is currently being repaired (under warranty). The problem with the LCD is that you can't program the camera or change settings without it. I also worry a little about the camera's durability.
