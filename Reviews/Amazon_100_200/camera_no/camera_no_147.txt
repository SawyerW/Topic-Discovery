As an enthusiastic early adopter of digital photography, there were simply some aspects of SLR photography that I missed, especially for situations when I wanted specific control of exposure or focus via shutter speed or aperature size. This camera is loaded with functionality and features that return such control, yet most of its functions can be learned in one sitting with its fantastically written user manual.If you are an old-school SLR shooter who wants to return to mastery of composition through control of aperature or shutter speed, this will get the job done.. It also offers typical autofocus/auto exposure/autoflash when you are just making snapshots.It's surprisingly lighweight. The controls and data information displays/interface are extremely user freindly. Some retailers are offering an additional aftermarket 70-300mm zoom lens in a bundle. Whether you purchase through them or this single lens offering via Amazon, you'll be doing high quality digital SLR shooting for about the cost of other DSLR bodies alone.The included software has some terrific features, including dual monitor support for slideshows. For the serious amateur or professional looking for a cost effective "working" tool...this is a great deal.
