While I have had the camera for multiple years as of this writing, it was purchased to take on a multiple week trip through the US (FL to CA), then over to Hawaii, then sail back to San Diego via a Navy aircraft carrier (USS Stinson).  Camera faired quite well in all matter of carrying methods, from motorcycle trunks, various pockets, altitudes, cities and weather.  However, seems somewhere in the Hawaii-carrier period, one half of the auto opening/closing lens protective cover got stuck in the open position.  Other than that, the thing has been spot on and over 2 yrs later still going strong. Go figure. Get a bigger memory card, an extra battery and these little Olympus camera's will take a beating and keep producing on and off the beaten paths.
