After many months of research, decided to purchase the Canon A70.  The camera has provided an excellent entry into digital photography.  The features on this camera are excellent.  Can't believe how much flexibility in picture taking can be included in such a small package.  I was concerned about the small camera size due to my arthritic fingers, but it has been easy to handle and control.  Battery life has been excellent. The stitch picture feature is exceptional. Really happy with the camera with one exception - the shutter does not respond as fast as my Nikon N6006.  Will try the recommended method of partially depressing the shutter to allow camera to make adjustments before taking the picture.  Picture quality has been great and processing the digital pictures thru a flash card reader easy.
