If you are looking for an EASY to use camera to carry in your purse - this little Fuji doesn't disappoint.Not sure why others have commented about poor quality pics, perhaps they need to tweak their settings. This little gem is a great casual point and shoot camera for stills, closeups and videos. Takes good low light pictures, too. Great sound on the videos, .. when I post my videos to YouTube, I can hear that my sounds are better than others who have been to the same event and recorded the same thing. We have used this camera for two months now, took it on vacation, and I wouldn't have wanted any other camera with me. Easy, intuitive, and with its long lasting battery, I have no complaints.(If you are going to be constantly shooting little videos for more than several hours, just buy a second battery -I use my camera everyday! and have only needed to charge it twice in two months.)Some of my better shots are worth framing. I get alot of ooohs and ahhhs and have had several family members who are buying one of these.My big expensive digital camera is gathering dust right now...
