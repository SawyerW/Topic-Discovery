I bought this splendid camera when it was released last november in Hong Kong. Previously I had a Canon A 80, but there is no way to compare both. This Nikon is the pinacle of easy to use digital camera, but offers features only availlable to professional cameras. Starting buy the brand, the best camera maker, going tru the 10x zoom and VR steady system,'you will have a powerfull camera with a bat pack that stands decently (even tough I bought a second battery pack EN-EL7). The pictures quality is gorgeous. I hope it last enought to worth is price, HK$7280.00= some US$936.00. But it's much much cheaper the bauying in Brazil, where I live and I'm from (R$8000,00)= some US$2,900.00.I do recommend this camera if you can afford it.
