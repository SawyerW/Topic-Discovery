I bought a DSC-L1 after a few hours of comparison shopping in Tokyo this summer.Pros: The size is right. You can take this camera anywhere in your pocket or (more realistically) in just about any kind of bag. The zoom lens is decent and the automatic lens cap looks cool.Cons: I never managed to get a photo out of this camera that wasn't somewhat blurry. Granted, at 4 megapixels you can size the image down and it looks pretty good. Even with a tripod, though, it was hard to get anything really clear.Then, three months into its life, the camera was splashed with water, and now it refuses to turn on. Not the most robust electronic device I've ever owned... and once you're out of warranty, it costs $171 to get the thing fixed, at which point you might as well buy a new camera.So it's all right, while it lasts. Now I find myself wishing I had bought something cheaper. If you choose this camera, be aware that the extra megapixel doesn't mean much, and that you'd better handle it with care.
