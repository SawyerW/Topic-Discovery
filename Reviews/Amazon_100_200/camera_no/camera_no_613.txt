This item comes at a great price but it's usability is horrible! First, the software doesn't do what it says, and if it does, good luck figuring out how! Second, if you think you can just bypass using the supplied (horrible) software written by a non-english speaking person, you're wrong (I was too). Windows DOES recognize this as a video device, just like a webcam - BUT, you will only get one channel and there are no other options available. I could go into more detail about what it does/doesn't do but to sum it up quickly, if you want a decent DVR system, this is not it. In fact, I'm surprised Amazon allows an item like this to be sold here.
