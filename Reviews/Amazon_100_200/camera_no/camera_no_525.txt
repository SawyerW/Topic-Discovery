I like Olympus products, but am not extrememly impressed with this particular camera. For a point and shoot and someone who doesn't want to do anything manually, this camera is great.  It has all the functions you want on a point and shoot (small, compact, large LCD screen, 5x zoom, IS, 7 MP, etc.) but does not have any manual controls whatsoever.  It takes good pictures, as long as you have the right scene selection.  Also, the LCD screen is great indoors and at night, but during the day with any sunlight, it is almost impossible to see.  I didn't think this would be such a problem (after being warned about this issue by other consumers) but it is, especially if I want to hand over the camera to someone else to take a shot.
