Be warned...when Olympus replaced the 3000 with the 3020 they left out some key features.  The 3020 has no video out, no audio on the video, and no external flash.  the 3000 had all these features plus everything else the 3020 has...minus the new sports, night, portrait quick buttons that are on the 3020 ..and a string that attaches to the lens cap...but its not exactly an even trade off....I was lucky enough to trade my 3020 in for a 3000 and im now a happy camper.  But If you dont care about the features I mentioned then you should be satisfied with the 3020 because it does take great shots.
