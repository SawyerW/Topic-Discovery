I have owned this camera for over 2 years now, and absolutely love this camera.  It takes great pictures.  I normally use the 640x480 pixel option.  I normally get about 23 pictures to the floppy on this setting.  There is an exposure modifier, which will allow you to darken bright pictures, and brighten dark pictures, by modifying the apeture, and shutter speed.  They are both controlled automatically, but they are adjustable up to +1.5 to -1.5.  There is also auto, or manual white balance, for use in compensation for incandescent, and florescent lighting.  There is a 14x optical zoom, one of the best in the industry.  There is a 52mm ring, for attaching filters.
