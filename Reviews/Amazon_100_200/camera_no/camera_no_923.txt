This is my first digital camera. Although i am a beginner i wanted some manual features to play with so i could learn, this camera has alot of manual features for a entry level camera. If manual features just confuse you, it has lots of auto modes so you dont have to think about it. I snagged this thing at Fry's Electronics on sale for $99, yes you read that right. That sale has passed but it might come back again. Anyways the pictures are fantastic, i will post one on this page if you want to look, it will be a flower. The pictures are great, it has video with sound, i love it and recommend it to anyone, especially at my price.I also bought an extra battery for $20, and a 512mb SD card for $25. (if your not already in love with Fry's you should be).
