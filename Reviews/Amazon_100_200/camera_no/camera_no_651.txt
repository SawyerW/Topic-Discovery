I purchased this camera to install at our vacation home as part of a security system.  In particular, I wanted to check in and view the premises when we were back home in Florida.  I installed the camera, UPS and a router with a cellular backup link.Camera video quality is very poor under day or night conditions.  After a little over a month, the camera locked up and became unreachable and unpingable.  Of course, by that time I was back in Florida, 700 miles away from the camera.The computer I left there continues to work fine, I guess I should have used one or more web cams instead. I will be replacing the camera with a better, more reliable solution in the Spring.
