I thought I would be the exception from experiencing the Black Screen problem.  However, I wasn't.  13 months after I bought it my camera occasionally had blurry purple come up on the LCD screen and that's exactly how the picture looked.  I literally bang it against my hand and then the screen comes up clear.  However, since I'm past the warranty, I don't feel like getting it repaired.  I'm tempted to look into other Canons like the SD400, but I'm reading how that has a LCD cracking problem.  If someone has a good suggestion for a $300 digital, I'm all ears.
