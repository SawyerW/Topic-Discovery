I happened to see all of the "not so good reviews" on the Canon A70 and thought I needed to send in my bad luck story also.  I'm in Iraq right now and my wife was using our camera the other day taking pictures of the kids and it stopped working.  After going through all the troubleshooting, she still can't get it to work (won't turn on at all).  My initial thought is that it will cost well over $100 to fix and the camera really isn't worth much more than that now.  The camera is about two and a half years old and I figured for what I paid for it it should have lasted a lot longer.  So, I went from having a great camera to not having one at all.  My next thought is my next camera probably won't be a Canon.  Sorry Canon, but after all the recent reviews here you might want to look into this.
