This camera is amazing!  YOu can choose the quality and size of your pictures from the LCD  screen, with Superfine quality mode you can take a decent amount of pics but in normal you can take at least 2 to 3x as many.I reccomend buying a 512 mb compact flash card.  This way you can do some video to.The video quality is good at the highest resolution but it doesn't replace a *real* video camera.  However if you are someone who likes to just have some video in a small device and doesn't want the most incredible quality this camera is for you.  I originally bought this for skiing so I could video during ski trips. I really like the pictures quality as well.  The camera is very user friendly.  The only thing I am a little angry with is the red eye reduction lense.  It isn't as reliable as I would like it to be, but once you get it set to the different modes it works fine I guess, but still it is confusing.  Very small efficient and cool!  A+ Camera, buy it!
