I bought this camera because I had a great experience with my prior Casio, the EXP-700. That camera is still around and I've now gone back to it. Here's why: In spite of its very nice features, ease of use and compactness, the EX-S770 simply does not take good images. My guess is the tiny lens just can't do what it needs to. I have a fair amount of experience with digital cameras and this one has the worse image quality of any I've owned or used. It's very disappointing. I thought this would be the perfect camera to carry around in my pocket to take spontaneous pictures of whatever. That idea is out the window. Back to the old drawing board.
