This camera has been my workhorse since 2008 till present and like my D40 it has no sign of slowing down. Build quality is tougher than it looks but the rubber on the side warps (Is it because live in the tropical area ?) It feels solid even without the optional mb-d80 grip. Most functions and dials that are commonly used are easily accessed via dedicated button. Image quality is great! You can easily make nice crispy images and the 10.1MP makes printing images large without problems. It has almost everything a photographer needs. I have to say one thing though about the 'ERR' error, It is common... I used to work at a camera store and this problem pops out once in a while but don't worry just take it to the nearest Nikon service centre. My camera experience this 2 years after I got it, after it has been serviced I could say so far so good. :) overall totally enjoyable. With technology's rapid expansion, As awesome as this camera is it's not practical to get this unless you are collecting cameras. A better choice now(2012) is the D90(at least) or the D7000.
