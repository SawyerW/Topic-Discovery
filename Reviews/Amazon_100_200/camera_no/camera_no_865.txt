I've had this camera for a little over a year.  Initially, i thought it was a great camera.  It worked fine and even though it was only 3.2 megapixels, the picture were great for what i used it for.However, currently my camera is in a repair shop.  When you turn it on, all you get is a black fuzzy screen.  After reading several of these posts, i understand this is a common problem.  In fact around the same time this happened to my camera, one of my colleagues had the same exact problem with his canon.  His camera is also at the repair shop.Unfortunately, my experience with this camera impacts my decision on other products, and i would probably never consider buying anything canon makes ever again, be it cameras or printers etc.
