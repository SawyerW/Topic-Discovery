I am a student Photographer and I recently upgraded to the D80 from a D50 and have been very impressed.  This camera was purchased refurbished from Adorama for $600 (Body) and paired with a Nikon 18-55dx lens.Wonderful Updates1) This camera can shoot in RAW + JPG Fine2) This camera supports SDHC Cards3) The Image quality is much better than the D50 or new D404) No lens limitations and works well with my sunpak flash.5) On camera flash works great.  A huge improvement over the D50.6) Very good auto focus!Nice Extras1) Big screen and onboard editing capability2) High ISODownsides1) Cost (the D40x can be purchased refurbished for $400 with less features)Overall I am pleased that I went with the D80 over the D40x and it is miles more advanced than the D50.  The auto focus system in the D80 is great and with one wedding the camera will more than pay for itself.
