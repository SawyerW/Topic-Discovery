I purchased my A70 4 months ago and it works great! I bought the NIMH battery pack with charger and rechargeable batteries. I had read reviews on this camera draining batteries quickly but this is not the case at all. The batteries don't need charging for quite a while. As far as features, I am a beginner at using them and haven't quite figured them all out. I have found that when using the P mode and changing the focus to spot metering, the camera takes better pictures particularly of a single person. I love having the movie mode. This camera was a great price and I do not regret my purchase at all.
