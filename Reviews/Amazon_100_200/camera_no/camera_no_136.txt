After 3 years of backpacking in South America, Central America and the Rocky Mountains (plus some urban tourism also) and ~15,000 great pictures taken in 14 countries, our DSCV3 is still going strong.  Heat and humidity in jungles and subzero temperatures at several summits up to 18,000 feet haven't kept it from taking pro-quality shots.  I love its numerous features like similar SLRs, but without the bulk, plus the video and night-shot capabilities that SLRs don't have.  Because of it's size, I carry the camera discreetly in one pocket and the zoom and wide-angle lenses on the other, and can go into crowded markets without fear of getting mugged.  About 8,000 pictures ago, it went into a river in the Ecuador jungle and the Sony dealer in Quito serviced it and it was as good as new.
