We got this security system to keep an eye on our nannies, and the number one thing I was really worried about was the set up. Surprisingly, I was able to get the camera up and running literally right out of the box.  Although you need a somewhat powerful computer to set up more than one camera, as I had to upgrade my computer when we had 2 cameras. And since it was running on windows 7, I had a bit of issue with firewall blocking my cameras. Other than the minor set backs, I'd say the system is pretty easy to set up and easy to use.
