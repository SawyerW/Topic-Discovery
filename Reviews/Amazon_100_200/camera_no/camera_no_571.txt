I bought this for under $170 and it is a great camera. The screen is large and the menu options I have learned so far (there are many) seem intuitive. I have not loaded the Olympus software onto my PC in order to manage the photos - its just as easy to just plug in the USB cable and let the Windows PC Operating system do the rest. I bought a 1mB memory card which, according to the literature will allow me to store over 500 HD photos - more than I would ever need before downloading to my PC. I am not an expert photographer and just needed a simple, easy-to-use digital camera that is small & light, and takes clear photos - this fits the bill.
