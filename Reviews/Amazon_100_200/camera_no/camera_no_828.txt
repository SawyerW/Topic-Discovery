To get the most out of the camera, learn about the EV-setting. I take several shots of a sceene with different EV-settings which helps me get the ultimate version of the sceene. I always use in camera sharpening set to high or the images are soft. The best shot selector (the camera takes several shots and picks the less blurry of them automaticly) is always on too. The landscape mode is used often (focus on infinity) with my camera. I've grown to dislike the auto color/contrast option in the software. Better adjust the image with the brightness and color control for wider contrast range. If I can, I put the camera on a fence, a book shelf or some thing and use the timer for less blurry pictures. The in camera auto color is best with sunlight and the manual white setting is used indoors if possible, otherwise incadescent. A great camera at that price.
