I've owned the 5700, then the 8700, and now the 8800. I've also owned a half-dozen high-level 35 mm film cameras over the years, beginning with the Nikon S2 in the 1950s ^|^. The 8800 is a fine upgrade and the 10X zoom and VR is FABULOUS! I do a lot of macro work, and tripods are not really always necessary these new days.Best of all is the image quality: vibrant, plenty of "snap," and when recorded at 8Fine Jpeg, easily enlargeable/croppable to really big prints, with resolution to spare. AF works well, controls are more logically placed than its predecessors, still with far more bells and whistles than I'll ever use but they're not in the way. One TERRIFIC digicam. Complaints: ALL accessories are unique and available only at great price from Nikon. Bah!
