I am quite happy with this camera, but if you are looking to get your first professional camera go a step higher to the D200 AT LEAST. The function buttons on the D80 are extremely useful when you are trying to change settings on the fly. This is helpful if you are a photographer that shoots on different locations (outdoors, indoors, different lighting) during a single shoot. The camera is quite light and the battery consumptions is fantastic. The camera has quite a number of settings that allow you to choose the metering system (center weight with different diameters, matrix), focus area (if not in the center, thank God), sharpness, tonal differences, etc. It can be a point and shoot camera, but it would not be used to its full potential. Great starter camera for the future professional.The D80 uses a SD memory card. I use a professional SD 4GB by Lexar and it renders me about 300+ RAW images. If that is not enough get the 8GB Professional SD also by Lexar.
