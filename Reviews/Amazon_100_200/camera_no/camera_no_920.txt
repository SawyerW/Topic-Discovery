I purchased this camera when it came out in 2004. I love it! The only complaint (or minor annoyance) is that it is sometimes temperamental when I first turn it on and snaps a shot on its own. Besides for that it's been a great camera. We have 3 children and we really use this camera ALL the time. It has been to the beach with us several times, dropped in the sand, dropped on hard floors by the kids, etc., and still no problems. I got my first ever error code yesterday because the lens would not fully retract when I turned the camera off so I simply manually pushed the lens back flush with the front of the camera and when I turned it on again it extracted perfectly and the error code disappeared. If this camera dies tomorrow I will still have no complaints because I know I've gotten my money's worth and I have hundreds of beautiful photos to prove it.
