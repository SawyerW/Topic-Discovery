I won't repeat all the stuff in the other reviews.  Let me just say that I bought this camera to replace the D100, a fine Nikon DSLR.  I was tired of the "lens fever" that is never ending.  Also, the bulk and weight of all the equipment was tiring.The 8800 has some lag, just like all non-slr cameras.  But, I've learned to live with it. I just pace myself.  The continuous shooting modes give you ample opportunity to shoot action sports.The quality of the pictures is awesome.  The zoom lens gives me all that I had with my 5 pound lens.Speed isn't everything and maybe this camera isn't for everyone, but it's meeting my needs.  I'm not going back to my DSLR.
