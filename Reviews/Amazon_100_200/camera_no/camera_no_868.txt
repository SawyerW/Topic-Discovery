I have owned this product for almost a year now. It is still in good condition and I love it a lot. The image quality is excellent. The good part about this camera is that it gives you a lot of control - for a non-professional camera, contrary to other camera which really on gives you ability to POINT and SHOOT. It gives you control over shuttle speed, focus length, ISO speed, various image sizes, flash intensity, just to name a few.The con about this product is that it needs 4 AA batteries, which makes it quite bulky and heavy. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a camera which is easy to use and still does not want to lose too much of control, pick Canon A70.
