I have owned a few other digital cameras, and Fuji is the best so far.  For the money, Fuji cameras offer the most features and the easiest to use menus.  The J38 has auto scene selection, auto face detection, among many other shooting modes.  While the 3x optical zoom is a little weak, it is fitting for the sub-$100 price.  Panorama mode is amazing, you take 3 pictures (left to right, or right to left) and the camera stitches them together for one long panoramic shot.  You can charge the battery with the included AC adapter, and it charges quick.  Camera only uses SD cards, and this might be the first Fuji that DOES NOT use XD cards, or at least accept both SD/XD.  No big deal, as SD cards are cheaper.  Anyway, I would recommend this camera for anyone, the menus are easy to follow, but provide controls for even an advanced user.
