This was the first digital camera I every bought and I still love it. I just bought my second more high tech digital but nothing beats the simple easy pictures these take. I took pictures at a wedding this summer and got better pictures than the professional with this LS743!!This camera takes the fastest pictures, everyone is always so amazed! I love the battery also, it is way better than having to recharge AA, lithium last way longer.Also a great party camera, this was dropped plenty of times in my highschool days and is still taking great pictures to this day!Highly recommended!
