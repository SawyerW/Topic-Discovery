Im more than satisfied with this camera, not only is it reasonably priced, it exceeds my expections, and here are the reasons why:1.  User Friendly -  very easy to use, no complicated functionalities, outstanding point and click features.  Easy to figure out because features are simple and convenient.2.  Photo Quality -  photo quality is very impressive for what it is.  Best Shot feature is very useful and zooming in and out is easy to do.3.  Battery life - this is perhaps the best feature because it is very long.  I was able to take five 10 second long video clips and 45 still pictures in one event and the battery life was still in good standing.4.  View screen  - is very clear, nice and wide which makes photo playback much easier and more fun.6.  Shutter reaction time - is about a second its easy to take  candid photos.7.  Camera size - small and compact, easy to carry around in a small purse or pocket.8  Download - very easy to download and picture quality is nice and clean.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for those of you who like taking pictures of anything.
