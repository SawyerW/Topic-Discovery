I finally got the "card cover open" error that so many other users have gotten (see various web forums). That means I can no longer use the camera.No great loss. I was getting pretty marginal results with it anyway. As a former E100RS owner, I was looking forward to excellent photos from the Olympus lens and CCD. But it was not to be, the lens/electronics combo is so slow that you need some sort of camera support or bracing for indoor, non-flash shots. Granted, this is just a simple pocket camera, but as such, it's a disappointment. Not up to the Olympus standard, IMO.
