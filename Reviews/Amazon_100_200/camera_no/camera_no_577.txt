I am the type of person who actually reads all the reviews before I make a purchase, especially, on line.I have been just delighted with my new 810 and the performance.One of the reviews I read talked about the upgrade from the 800 to the 810 and the person was sorry that they did not wait for this new model to be released. I am sure glad that I read this review and acted on it. I am totally delighted with my camera in EVERY way. I love the large viewing screen and the feature where if my hand shakes the camera automatically compensates. This feature is great especially because I have taken many pictures in the past where this has been a problem.I hope that others will read this review a enjoy the experience for themselves.All the best!
