This camera is absolutely wonderful.  I tried the Z40 and the it was very similar, took great AVI and features were the same, however the quality of the actual digital photo seemed a bit-sub par in my opinion.  THis Z55 has a much better picture and really delivers.  It takes great AVI footage and clear crisp pictures for such a tiny little camera.  It also comes with a cool dock that plugs right into my iMac(or any usb port).I like the 2" LCD ad the long battery life along with the ZOOM and 5 megapixels.We take pictures and movies all the time now.  Invest in a nice photo printer and say goodbye to the photolab![...]
