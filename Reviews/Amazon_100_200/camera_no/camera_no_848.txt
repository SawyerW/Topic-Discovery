I bought this camera a couple of months ago despite some reviews I've read online about battery life, etc. The battery life was certainly not a problem with NimH batteries. I took dozens among dozens of pictures before I had to change the batteries. If you leave the camera on for hours and are taking pictures all day long then maybe the battery will not last for more than two days. But if you are like me and take a few pictures here, turn the camera off, then say an 30 minutes later take another few pictures here and there, etc. Then the battery should last for weeks. It did for me! It also takes great pictures in the dark. I had a digital camera years ago and in low light it was terrible. With the canon I turned off all the lights and had only the TV on and it still took great shots.  It even takes short movie stills. Not bad.  All in all, I cannot complain about this camera and I'm quite happy with it.
