I just got my a week ago and have been played with it a little.  For me, I just need a digital camera that's easy to carry around; shots relatively good pictures; easy to use.  I mostly just use it to take day to day pictures, so nothing fancy.The camera itself is pretty slick; all metal body, the keys are pretty intuitive, large LCD screen, turn on time is fast.Some concerns:1) No SD card included, so you really need to buy one, the 10M internal memory aren't gonan hold much. I bought the panasonic 256M SD card here also at amazon and it worked wonderfully.2) No protective case at all, so the LCD is exposed all the time which maybe dangerous. I haven't found a good case for it yet.3) The battery charge is easy to use, just plug the camera in; you can also charge the battery seperately.  But it takes a while to recharge.  Also, the charger is made of white plastic and just looked cheap.
