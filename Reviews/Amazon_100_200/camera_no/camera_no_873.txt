If you want to spend the money for a great 1-year camera, the Canon PowerShot A70 is the one for you.I agree with all the great reviews of the A70 digital camera.  It takes wonderful pictures and is easy to use.  I have used the video function numerous times and it works great.  When I bought the camera, Consumer Reports recommended this camera.HOWEVER, this camera is apparently designed to "fail" between 1 and 2 years of use, depending on how often you use it. After exactly 2 years of use (4,217 pictures), my camera also now gives me the black/purple screen that numerous other consumers have complained about.  When the camera decides to be operational, the majority of the pictures now come out blurry.  This camera has turned from the best camera I have ever used to an unreliable piece of junk.
