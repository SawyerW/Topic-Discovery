Had the camera 2 weeks when the battery retainer clip failed (fell off). Mailed it back to Olympus for a warranty fix. After a few weeks of waiting for a promised call that never came, I got an e-mail telling me that the failure was my fault and the fix would cost $146. The camera was used for 2 weeks and cost $227!! I called them back and pled my case to no avail. I am now awaiting the return of my Olympus reject. If I can't find a local shop to repair it reasonably I will toss it and start over. Expensive lesson learned: AVOID OLYMPUS. LOUSY PRODUCT, WORSE PR
