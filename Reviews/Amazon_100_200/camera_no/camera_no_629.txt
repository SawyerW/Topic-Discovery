There is a good reason the price is dropping on this camera. The firmware that is current has broken the ability to send out email alerts for motion detection. There is no ability to send out .avi instead of still photo's.The lens constantly needs to be adjusted and I have to power off and on the camera at least every other day. If you use the wireless feature the performance drops quite a bit so plan on hard-wiring it with ethernet. Your better of sticking with a Cisco product (which by the way is really a linksys product) since the support is very good and the monitor software (recorder/monitor) works and the is capable of up to 16 camera's.This camera is suppose to have night vision but it also is broken and is worthless. My advice is to go with a true night vision camera for that portion of your security and stick with a day camea like a Cisco that has a true optical zoom. The digital software zoom is not worth much. These camera's are becoming cheaper so be sure to shop around.
