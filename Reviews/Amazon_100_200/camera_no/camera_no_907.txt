It's a cute little thing that fits in a small purse or in your jeans' pockets. That's what I was looking for. I needed to replace an old one that broke and used it each time I went out and a good photo posibility existed. Really light and easy to carry.I like that you can tilt the head for vertical pictures.But the one I received is a bit different than advertized. It said Operational height range: 5 5/8" to 12", Extended Height: 9.75-inch, Minimum Height: 2.75-inch. But really the range goes from 5.50" to 7.50" when legs are closed, when opened it's a little bit shorter. In the picture you can see the legs spread wide open, but in reality it doesn't. I haven't use it yet, but gives you the feeling it won't be stable once you put the weight of you camera on, specially on different types of surfaces or terrain if it's windy outside.
