This camera prodcues incredible pictures, and is a great compact size.  The wide selection of available manual settings is almost unheard of for a camera in this price range, and the preset picture modes provide for a wide range of shooting options.  The movie mode adds some extra fun into those special moments.Two comments in response to a previous reviewer:ALL digital cameras less than eleven megapixels are lower resolution than 35mm cameras.  However, unless you make prints over 8x10 inches, you'll never notice the difference with a 3.2mp camera.  Finally, the lag time is due to the autofocus.  An inexpensive point-and-shoot uses fixed focus (which produces a blurrier image, especially at close range), and therefore has no lag time.  In fact, the lag time on this camera is much quicker (and therefore better) than other digital cameras I have used.
