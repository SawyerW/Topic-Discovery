I've had this system for about 2.5 years. Overall, I'd have to say its hit and miss. Somedays it works, some days it does not. Meaning the cams go offline a lot and you have to reset the cams, reboot your computer, or restart the command center. This happens about once a week at least. And of course, this seems to happen when you really need it (traveling, etc).I've also had to replace two cameras after a year. WARRANTY is only good for a year on these and they are expense! I have 5 cams in total. The customer service staff is very helpful but they only have a handful of tricks up their sleeves (reboot, restart, unplug). So few, I know them by heart. My newest camera hasn't worked right since I bought it here 3 weeks ago and now I'm thinking about junking the entire set up. That stinks since I've invested so much time and money.Word of advice--just don't think it will be maintenance free. It's a lot of work to keep it working, and you'll sometimes have to live with not every cam working properly (especially the spy cams--they give me the most trouble).
