I too agree,the photo quality is awesome but it is kinda a let down. My family being very pale people it would pale us out even more. My sister has bright red hair and it would pick up her hair and make it goregous but pale her out. It is a great camera for outside photos. Just don't introduce it to extreme weather. For example the camera got use to humid weather(LA) and then it decided to snow,it threw the camera for a loop. Plus I dropped it twice and it just died.I know what you are saying...YOU DROPPED IT, of course it is going to die. I dropped my Kodak camera multiple times and it didn't die. My LCD screen doesn't work anymore,but it still takes photos. Seeing how there is no view finder I am just kinda guessing at photos until I can get a better camera. I wouldn't pay the full price,but a refurb at 70 is decent.
