While I have a pretty limited knowledge of phonetics/linguistics as a formal discipline, I entered a drawing to win a set of  these cards, because although I have rudimentary knowledge about the IPA, I have always been very interested in it.  These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating.  The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name.  This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate.  The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely!  I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!
