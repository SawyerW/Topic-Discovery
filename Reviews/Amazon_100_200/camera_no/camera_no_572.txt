Purchased the camera since I needed a camera that is small and will fit in my pocket, has at least a 5X optical zoom and not too expensive. I still own a 3.1 mega pixel Olympus that is still in excellent working condition despite the fact that it has been soaked by rain. The stylus 750 is beyond my expectation. Despite its size it takes excellent pictures, and on the highest resolution with a 2GB xD card it indicated about 600 pictures that I can shoot. I think the number of pictures will exceed the battery life.Pictures came out excellent with beautiful color balance, however at full optical and digital zoom it is somewhat pixelated. I did not quite like the idea that you have to take the battery out to charge it, or buy a separate battery adapter if you want to charge it on the camera. They should have included the adapter with the camera.Another negative comment is the fact that it does not have a normal viewfinder. In bright outdoor light it is impossible to view the scene through the LCD viewfinder.All in all it is an excellent buy..
