Ordered the item on November 13. The item was available in 24 hours.My e-mail said that I would receive it on December 24th. Looking around the internet, I found a Olympus 4040 which was about 36 dollars more. On Amazon.com, the same camera is [a lot] more. So I ordered the other, it's in transit, and I CXLed the Amazon.com order for this camera. It's a shame. I really like getting my product from Amazon.com but if it's not in stock I wish they would say that up front. They sent the memory disk that I ordered. Meanwhile it sits on a table with no camera to use it in.
