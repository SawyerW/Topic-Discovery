I have been very pleased with the A70.  I used to do a lot of photography in college, but afterwards found that without access to a darkroom, point-and-shoot (Rollei 35S) was the easy way to make photos.  About three months ago, I made the switch to digital and decided to invest in a camera with the capability of manual controls.  The learning curve for the A70 was not trivial, and it took awhile for what was obvious thirty years ago to come back.  The biggest challenge has been focusing using the macro mode.  In general, I find this camera a hoot and am enjoying photography again.  I feel liberated by being able to pick the 10% of the photos that really stand out.  The amount of info in the 3.2 meg image seems adequate for 4x6 or 8x10 prints.  As I said in the title, I'm very pleased.
