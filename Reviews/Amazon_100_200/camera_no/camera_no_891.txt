I received this without a CF card so I emailed the seller and they said they did not get one so that's how it comes. I must admit I assumed it would and should have asked before purchasing. Yes it was cheap but it was also used. I purchased this for an older person and thought it would be easy enough for them to use. I still can't get it to work! I downloaded the manual and went through all the steps but it still doesn't take pics or show them on the screen. Shipping will cost me more than it's worth to send back so I will find a different camera and keep working on this one.
