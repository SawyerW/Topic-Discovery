This camera is a true pleasure; it exceeds expectations in every category. The images are sharp; their size is adequate for almost every application (I've blown them up to 30x30"); it's viewing area is large and bright; the controls are simple and easy to master but what really makes it stand out from the crowd of shirt-pocket cameras is its speed. Nothing is more aggravating than pressing the shutter only to helplessly watch the scene change while your camera delays taking the picture. The speed of S770 is unmatched by any other point and shoot camera I've tested. For the price and the kind of camera it is, the S770 is unrivaled in my estimate.
