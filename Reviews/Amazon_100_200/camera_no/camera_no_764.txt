I purchased this unit through Amazon, though J&R; Music World handled the actual sale and delivery. The JVC GRDVL120U was defective out of the box. The motor made a high pitched whining noise whenever it was powered up, loud enough to be audible on test recordings. After speaking with three J&R; Customer Service representatives about the problem, they assured me that the unit was defective and suggested that I return it for a refund, which I did. Unfortunately, the net cost to me is the shipping charges for product delivery and return, plus some wasted time.I was weary of purchasing this product in the first place, being that the JVC unit was dramatically underpriced in comparison with other products sharing the same feature set. It seems I got what I paid for! My recommendation is to spend a little more money to buy a higher-quality product. I've heard great things about Sony MiniDV camcorders....
