I haven't used a lot of digital camera but this one is, by far, the best I've used. The Casio Exilim has 5.0 megapixels of power mated to a 3X optical zoom that appears far more enhanced than that. It has a large viewfinder that gives an excellent idea of your subject, framed for easy reference.I don't generally like these little bitty new cameras but this one blew me away when I used it. The ease of operation and ease of transferring outstanding 5.0 images to PC or other media sold me on this.If you can buy this camera for less than $400 you will be very happy with it for a long time.
