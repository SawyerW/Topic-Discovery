I got this camera after researching for a month what camera I thought was the best. This camera has so many features that I fell in love with. The size of it for starters is increadible. It takes such clear beautiful pictures. The docking cradle is an added bonus becuase it elimniates the hard work of downloading pictures. The camera is also light wieght and I was looking for a camera that I could fit in an evening bag. I look forward to taking this camera every with me. I definetly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a camera.
