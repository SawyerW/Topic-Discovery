I've had this camera for 4 years now and its definately showing its age. Many cell phone cameras on the market now have a higher resolution than this thing. But for a simple point and shoot camera it does its job pretty well if you don't plan on printing anything larger than a 4x6 or cropping at all.The build quality is pretty good... I've dropped this thing numerous times, and while the plastic casing has cracked because of the fall the interior still funtions like it's  new. Listen to other reviewers when they say this thing eats batteries. The most I can take with newly recharged batteries is probably about 30 pictures without flash. Another con is that it takes very poor pictures in low light. The picture becomes pretty grainy.This was a good buy at $99 in 2003, but is probably barely worth half that now.
