I own a d-rebel, and I have owned an olympus 3000 before. I was looking for pocket size camera.  This camera certainly has a nice solid constructions and is very portable.  Also shoots movies which is only limited by the size of he memory.  It allows for some manual control, in ISO setting and white balance.  it also has some preset functions, where it adjusts contrast, saturation and exposure as well as flash assis for a particular shooting situation, although to set that involves going potentially 16 shooting modes.  Other than that, ther eis no manual setting of aperture or shutter speed. Battery life is good. also macro function is good.The big draw back is hepicture quality.  The noise level is very high.  The 5 MP rating is of limited utility, since the noise is so much, that large prints are out of question.  at times it has difficulty with focousing.  my 4 year old 3 mp olympus certainly takes better pictures.  I feel that the portability of the camera does not compensate for the poo quality of the pictures, if you are at all serious about your pictures.
