This was purchased for use as an evidence camera for the police department. All I can say is AWESOME!  I also purchased the Nikkor 18-200mm VR lens and this is the best camera system I have ever seen.  The focal range of the lens coupled with the abilities of the camera are amazing.  The colors are superb, prints are super, even when printed on a plotter.  The only drawback I could find with this camera is the exposure sometimes is a little too light.  But, adjusting the exposure compensation to -.3 seems to work great in most situations. Great deal on an even greater camera!
