I just bought it recently and found it is really an easy to use camera! Most of the features of it were already listed by other users. I only want to tell another one which might be omitted by the English speakers. I found there are more than 10 choices of languages for the menu on the LDC display. So it is more easier for the people who is not an English speaker to use this camera.The 3x optical zoom may not be enough for the experienced users.But it is enough for a beginner. And you can use the digital zoom to compensate this shortcoming.Anyway,considering the price, it is a good one.The quality of the pictures took by this camera is quite good. And it doesn't use up the batteries quickly.
