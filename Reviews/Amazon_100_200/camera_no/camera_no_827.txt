I chose the CP2000 over the 2500 at the time because of the AA batteries and the fact that the macro function was controlled from an external button rather than within the menu. I am glad I did on both counts.  Its been to New Guinea with me and on a 6 day bushwalk in Tasmania.  One set of NiMH batteries lasted five days of picture taking on the walk-then I popped in the second set and we were off again.  Infinity focus  (landscape) mode was really useful in taking pictures out of windows.  Macro is superb-changes the way I look at  of the world around me. I am constantly switching in and out of macro mode and value that macro button.Cons include minimal buffer memory, so slow image processing and poor low light capability.  Its been a great introduction to digital photography and is leading me on to want more!!!!
