I bought this little (6"x1" collapsed) tripod for my digital audio recorder that has a photo tripod screw hole?  the head can tilt about 20 degrees in most directions and in one direction it can tilt about 95 degrees.  the tripods standard footprint is about 3 or 4" diameter.  if you extend the legs fully (three 3" sections) you get about a 10" diameter footprint and about 8" head from the ground to the mount.  you can adjust the footprint width and get a really low and stable stance for the tripod.  about 14" diameter and about a 4" height to the mount.the tripod does not look heavy duty.  I doubt you could put a heavy video camera or spotting scope on it, especially with the extensions extended.  Its probably best for digital cameras and small digital web cams etc.
