I reviewed this camera on the other s410 listing. This camera is a piece of crap. E18 errors which means your lens extends and wont go back in or the reverse. Canon is ignoring the problem and thier customers. This usually happens when out of warranty, 2.5 years. They say it is due to it being droped, sand in the lens, the moon in retrograde, whatever. My camera was well cared for never dropped looks like new and the problem occured. If you buy this camera its like a throw of the dice that it will happen to you so prepare for another 150 bucks to fix the problem, or buy a brand that stands behind thier product. I heard that there are a couple of class actions in the works over this issue, I hope they succeed, I am going to see if I can join the class and get my money back. And if you think it is random, my friend had the same problem with one of the A models. Its not, it hapens to most canon cameras. do a google search for E18 before you buy this hunk of junk
