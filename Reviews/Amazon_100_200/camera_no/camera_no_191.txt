I've had this camera for a while and I'm still impressed with the quality of it. I like the big LCD display and find the menu very easy to use. The battery life could be a bit longer, and it would be nice if it powererd on a little quicker but other than that I like this camera. The photo quality is very good for a mid-range point and shoot camera. The colors come out vivid and crisp. And there are also quite a few settings that the user can adjust to get just the right picture. Overall, a nice starter camera.
