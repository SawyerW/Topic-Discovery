I was so excited about this camara.  I followed the set up instructions to a T.  The camara worked while wired but not when I went wireless.  Hmmm, I thought something was wrong with my router.  I rebooted the router.  Still didn't work.  I called in an IT pro.  Then another.  After 6+ hours and 2 professionals, concluded the camara was defective.  It lost signal once unplugged so I was unable to move it from the initial set up spot.I just sent it back to Amazon yesterday and am waiting my refund.I went to Best Buy and bought the Panasonic wireless pan/tilt and set the whole thing up in 10 minutes, works like a charm.This camara did seem cool when it worked while wired but it was not worth the headache it caused me trying to get it to work wirelessly.Also, the pricing is whacked.  When shopping for the camara it was around $275.  When I went to finalize my purchase it was $312 but now it shows it is back to $275 - what's up with that?
