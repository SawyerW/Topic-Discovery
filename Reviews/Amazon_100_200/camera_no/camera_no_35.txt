The new canon "upgrades for Rebels (xti series & up) were very disappointing. Incredible you can purchase good used 20d for 150 bucks. The secondary LCD screen is a critical aid to quickly adjust EV values among other adjustments... Something the new rebel series does not offer. The old XT was far better in many respects. Craming more pixels on an APS-C sensor is not my idea of an upgrade but a marketing ploy.Anyway, i'm real happy with my 20d. 5fps for action shots, a secondary LCD screen all for far less than the 50/60d which is the starting point for pro features buying new. Its ashame canon downgraded the Rebel..In many ways the old series was a pro model in disguise.Well worth it if you locate one in decent shape.
