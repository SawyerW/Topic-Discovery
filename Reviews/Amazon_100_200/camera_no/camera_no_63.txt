My husband and I have been wanting a digital camera for some time now.  We would love a digital SLR, but can't afford it right now.  This one is nice because it is so compact and can be taken anywhere without having to lug a big camera bag around.  We love the big screen and the buttons that make it very easy to switch between camera mode and playback mode.We haven't had this camera for very long (a couple of weeks only), so we haven't had any printed out on photo paper, but on the computer the pictures look very good and sharp, especially with a little help from photo editing software.  We really like the different macro functions.The battery life is great!  We took about 250 pictures our first time out with it, all with the screen on and some with the flash on, and the battery meter didn't go down at all.So far it seems like this camera will be great for us and so far, I would highly recommend it as a great take everywhere digital camera!
