Awsome wide angle camera that is serving my purposes just fine.  I needed a wide angle camera because I did not want to have to change lenses all of the time.  Also needed something that is light weight too because I have MS and can't handle heavy cameras.The pictures are better than film!  I am very pleased with this camera.  I have no idea why Nikon stopped production of such a fine camera but they need to bring it back as far as I'm concerned.  The price is right and my experience with the seller was excellant!  Shipping was super fast too.  I highly reccomend the seller....pcmonde via Amazon.com
