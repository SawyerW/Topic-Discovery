I bought this camera for my 6-year-old nephew.  He had a kiddie camera before, but it turned out to be a piece of garbage and he quickly lost interest.  I chose this camera based on the reviews here, and have been very pleased.  My nephew can easily operate all the camera functions by himself, including changing the camera modes, taking pictures, and navigating through his pictures.  It is just the right size for him to handle comfortably, and rugged enough for a little boy.  The caribiner is great, and makes it easy to carry the camera on his backpack or belt loop.  He brought it to school the other day, and I hear this little camera was the hit of the class!  Overall, this camera has exceeded my expectations and was a much better bargain than any kid-specific camera we've tried.
