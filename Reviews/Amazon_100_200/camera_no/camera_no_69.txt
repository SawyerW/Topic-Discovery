I really like this camera even though by now it is pretty old. It has some cool features like manual focus and a fairly clear picture, but what I really like is that it still works after taking a serious pounding; mine has big dents all over the left side from various drops and impacts (getting hit by a cab skateboarding, crashing all kinds of ways) but still keeps on working.I recently thought it was going to die because it would reset constantly and wouldnt turn on every time. I cleaned the battery terminals with a little sandpaper and it was fine. I dont know if it appreciated being taken to the desert for a month when I thought it was on its way out.If you can get one cheap used, it should last a while longer. Also you have to charge it on the stand, which is really annoying for traveling.
