The picture quality is ok given its price. There is a focus ring that you can adjust to make the picture clear. However, the wireless is very buggy and does not work as it disconnects from the router after a few hours making the wireless feature useless. I am using the latest firmware as of 7/10/10.Pros: Good for price. Tilt, rotating camera. Android app to view live feed on your phone. Iphone app probably exists too. I use "IP cam viewer lite" for android.Cons: Wireless does not work reliably. Picture quality not the greatest but not as bad as some reviews say it is (maybe they dont know about the focus ring?!).Overall I would recommend this camera if you have a hard wired ethernet connection.Edit: July 2011: The new firmware update has fixed the wireless connectivity issue. Bumping rating to 4 stars from 3.
