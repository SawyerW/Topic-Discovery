I ordered this digital camera from Amazon, and there was no photo available.  So I purchased it based on comparisons with other cameras in the same price range.  When I first received it, I thought, "What a dinky little camera! It looks like a toy."  But I did not want to spend too much money on a digital camera that I don't know if I would use much.  The first day, I started taking pictures in all kinds of light - in a room with a single light, in the closet with the single bulb, in the family room, and outside, and in public libraries.  And when I transferred the pictures to my computer, I was amazed at the quality.  All of the pictures came out with perfect lighting.  Also, the camera is small enough to fit in my palm.  It has self timer, and can also be used as a PC camera to video-chat.  Best of all, because it is so ordinary looking, no one is going to steal it.
