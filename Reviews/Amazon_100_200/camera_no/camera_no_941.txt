I bought this camera a few weeks ago with the intention of using it as my backup/"uh-oh" camera, one that I could break and not really care too much about. The quality is decent, it does appear grainy depending on the light conditions outside. I did a small shoot recently when there was about half a foot of snow on the ground and a slight overcast and there was still a noticeable amount of grain (at least to me, friends can't tell).As I said in the title, it's great for beginners. It offers a lot for new photographers, all the manual settings, the auto-focus motor in the camera makes it great for lenses that don't have it built in. The 6.1 or whatever MP gets outdone by newer point and shoots, but for what it is it's a great camera.I'd recommend this as a backup or a starter camera.
