I've had this camera for about a week now, and I love it. So what that it didn't come with rechargeable batteries and a charger. I bought this separate myself using energizer rechargeable batteries and it cost less than the set offered by Canon. I've tried all the effects and settings on this camera and they all work great. It's also nice to be able to print directly to my printer and not having to plug the camera into my computer. I highly recommend this camera. It's the best for under $500. I got mine for $289. Need a camera without having to worry about film. Get this one.
