Really forgot this beauty for shooting a wedding-but try as I might with 3 other slurs-the 520 with the better 14 -54 lens and the 36r flash just would not be denied. I put an umbrella on the stand with with the flash on remote and after setting it up, and shooting several shots to get the right aper. and s speed etc. just shot away. Beautiful Olympus color. None of my slrs match the color and easily shoot portraits as well. It was sooo easy. People were quite impressed with the professional quality-my first real wedding! Wish I could show some shots-the lights being off camera made a real difference! I almost missed what the camera could do-it was born for studio shots and portraits.
