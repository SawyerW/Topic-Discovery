You'll need to have a working knowledge on F/stop, shutter speed, and ISO. But this book is excellent and very helpful. It's very comprehensive and explains every little function of the camera. You learn to realize that you can set the camera maybe 3 different ways and still come up with the same outcome... and that's comforting as a photographer when you have to think-quick and your subjects are moving all over the place. (it's good to know you have options to get a good photo!).Excellent book. Worth the $ and if you spend the time reading every page (sometimes twice), you'll have as much knowledge as a seasoned photographer.
