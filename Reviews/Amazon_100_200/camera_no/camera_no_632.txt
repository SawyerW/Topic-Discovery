The manual is technically in English but you can tell a non English speaking person wrote it, lots of interpreting needed throughout this technical manual.  The wireless range on this device is SO small it negates the purpose of having a camera in the first place.  We got it as a fancy baby monitor, but since our WiFi router was two rooms away connection was non existent.  Testing it within our house it would only work within 10-12' of the router.  I could just as easily leave a door open for that kind of monitoring range.  I asked TRENDnet tech-support for a little more basic explanation of the ability to monitor this from an out side source and the answer was just as confusingly technical that I am now returning it.  THIS IS NOT A CONSUMER PRODUCT, though it is made of less than consumer quality components.  I have not been this unhappy with a product ever.  AVOID!!!
