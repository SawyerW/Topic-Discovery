Even with the little screen on the back of this camera you can't tell that a picture you've taken is blury.  Not to mention it is particularly confusing having a switch on the side to determine whether its in focus for close ups or distance photos.  The low megapixels make it impossible to enlarge anything  you've cropped to any extent.  Finally and probably the worst problem has to do with light.  If you are unfortunate enough to have to use the flash, it only lights up the center of the picture often washing out the middle and leaving a circle of darkness around the edge.  I was almost broken hearted when I realized there was nothing I could do about this.  I imagine that for as much as the gift giver paid...it was probably still too much.
