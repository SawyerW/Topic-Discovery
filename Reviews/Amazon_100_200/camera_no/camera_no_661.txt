I am still think this is a nice device but be carefull where do you buy it. I bought it on Amazon and it was defective. I saw somebody else's review with the same problem and after I got a defective replacement I do not think this was just bad luck. It took me a long time to set them up wireless as I expected because I am not a IT guy but that this happened because the cameras were defective make me mad. Now (just a couple of months later since I got the camera from Amazon and hardly use of it) I will have to pay shipping again to get the manufacturer replace it due that the guarantee with Amazon is expired. Well, maybe I wouldn't want to get another one from Amazon anyway.
