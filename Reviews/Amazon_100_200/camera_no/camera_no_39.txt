This camera has many benefits that just blow the competition away and makes it a great "prosumer" digital camera.The 8 megapixel resolution allows for pictures to be printed up to 11 x 14 at 300 dpi (larger if you use 72 dpi).  And the boot up time is almost instanteous!Unfortunately it does pain me to mention that the camera does lack true spot metering and also it has a rather loud mirror slap (not something I would like to use in quiet settings).The lens bundled with it is quite adaquate, but I would seriously urge you to consider the 17-85mm EFS IS lens for a larger degree of flexibility.
