We bought this for my 10 year old daughter, since she showed an interest in taking pictures. We did a lot of research and after this camera went on sale for $25, we decided to give it a shot. Software was very easy for me to install, and downloading pics was a snap. No, the pictures aren't top quality, some come out blurry and dark, but it takes fairly good pictures outside (no flash). Once we set up our old computer for the kids, I'm sure she is going to love taking pictures and dowloading them herself. And if it is something she sticks with, there will definitely be an upgrade next Christmas (something w/ a flash and lcd screen). But after researching and looking around, this seems to be the best digital camera for kids for the price. Not to mention how cute it is for girls :)
