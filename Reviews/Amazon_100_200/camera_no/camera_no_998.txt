I'm no photography expert.  I just wanted a nice camera that didn't cost me too much with good resolution and video capability to capture those personal moments that only mean anything to myself and perhaps those close to me.  This camera fit that perfectly.  Nice and small, but sturdy.  I've recorded hours upon hours of video footage chronicling the first year of my nephew's life, and other things that have meaning to me.  Only two things about this were slightly disappointing.  One, there's no AV output for hooking this thing up to a TV and viewing stuff that way, which I thought was a standard with digital cameras.  Second is the speaker volume on the camera is really low so between those two things I really have to transfer my videos to my computer before I can really enjoy them.  But these are minor issues and for what I paid for this camera I'm not complaining.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants an affordable but worth every penny camera.  Truly the best deal for my budget.
