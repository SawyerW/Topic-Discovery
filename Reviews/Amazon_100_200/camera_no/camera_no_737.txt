i've had this camera for approx. 3 years. very simple to use! can hand it over to a friend and give min. instructions on how to use it. it's tough as nails; have dropped it off cliffs, in the pool, off the top of the barn and even lost it in the snow, in a lake, the goat chewed on it...:) still going great. never any troubles. replaced batteries once the whole time; (use it many times a week).  sure wish they still made it. how many cameras can live thru all that this one has gone thru and still survive?
