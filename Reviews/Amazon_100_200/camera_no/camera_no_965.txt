the VR feature is good. i always want a camera with a telephoto lens that has VR that is affordable. It greatly reduces blurred shots for telephoto shots.when the camera writes the buffer memory to card even on single shot mode. the whole camera is useless. it simply locks up. very very irritating as it prevents the second shot till a couple of seconds later. Lesser cameras do not do that and it causes a lot missed shots. nikon needs to fix that . the buffer is big enough what wrong with the software or hardware in that part of the camera.
