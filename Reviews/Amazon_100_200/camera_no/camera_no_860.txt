About eight months after I bought the camera from Amazon USA I have noticed a white spot on all pictures I took with my A70. First I thought it is a piece of dirt on lens so I ignore it. Soon I realized it is a "dead" pixel. I contacted Canon USA and they told me to contact a service facility in my country. I called the Canon service in my country and, to my great surprise, they told me I must pay 25$, the cost of repair, which actually implies not changing the sensor but downloading new interpolation data so as to hide the white spot. Since I have already paid the warranty, as embedded cost, I do not understand why I should pay extra money.5 stars for Canon engineers.0 stars for Canon warranty.
