First of all, WOW! I bought this camera for my girlfriend for her birthday. She and her family are really into taking pictures of everything: their pets, each other, anything! Never having even seen the camera in real life I bought it off Amazon at a great price.I'm giving it to her with all the extras (a usb card reader so you don't have to plug in your camera, rechargeable batteries w/ charger and a 256 mb CF card.) I will be giving it to her in a couple of weeks, so I decided to make sure everything works ok. BAD MOVE!!!! I love it so much! I am not much of a picture guy and I've used it for a couple of days and have already taken nearly a hundred pictures! It is a great piece of work. It's great to be able to see a picture on your computer within 5 minutes of taking it! I'm going to have to get me one.The quality is great! When you get the focus right, which isn;t TOO hard, the pictures look professional!This camera is great and I recommend it very highly!
