If your going to buy a camera, the Olympus Camedia is the camera for you! It has great close-ups on it, and enough onboard memory. I was deciding which i should get, an Olympus Camedia, a piece of junk Hewlett-Packard, or a Sony. I went with the Olympus Camedia right away. It almost used up all my money, but it was worth it, totally! Also, if your gonna buy one of these, you might want to buy some rechargable batteries and a charger, it just uses the batteries right up! I already took a load of pictures, and it takes the pictures so nice and clear, it makes all the other digital cameras look bad! This is a great little device, it does not record sound, but on the program it comes with a special thing, so you can add sound to your movies, you took, with the microphone on your computer. Pete
