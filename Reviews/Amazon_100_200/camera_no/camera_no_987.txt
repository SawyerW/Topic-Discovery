I have this camera's big brother, the Fujifilm Finepix S1000fd, and BOTH have nearly the same features.  We are going to France this year and I will be buying another one for my wife.  As a point and shoot camera, this is one of the best I have owned.  Start up is fast. Saving to the SD card is quick.  And the flash is adequate for most indoor shots.There are only two drawbacks: It would be great to have a 5x or 10x zoom, but in most situations, the 3x optical is fine.  And, the 2.7" screen has problems with reflective sunlight - I plan on using a cellphone UV film to correct that.It fits in your pocket and is lightweight.  Overall, a great camera for the price.
