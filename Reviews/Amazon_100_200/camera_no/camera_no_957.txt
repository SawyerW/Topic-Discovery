It's an ok camera if you don't compare it with pther camera's but when you do you realize you could get as good for cheaper and better for the same priceHere's why I don't like this camera:The pictures can look a little pixelated at times I'd prefer if it was a bit smootherIt uses alkline batteries which can get expensive since the battery life it not great.It takes too long to warm up to take the shotThe indoor setting gives you alot of light streaks and its really useless and that's no exageration, I almost never use itMy roomate has a 5megapixel canon for  less $20 more I always take the photos from her camera to put on facebook instead of from mines cause it would be the same shot but hers just looked better, smoother, cleaner.
