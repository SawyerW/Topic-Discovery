I bought this camera for my fiance for Christmas so we could take it on our honeymoon in January.  The pictures turned out pretty well.  They aren't the sharpest pictures but they are at least as good as (if not sharper) than 35mm pictures.The viewing screen is impossible to see in the dark, you just have to point and shoot and hope for the best.  Most people don't know how to use digital cameras yet so when asking someone to take a pic of us, we got our heads chopped off many times.This wouldn't be a bad camera for a beginner or a casual picture taker.
