I researched for quite a while before selecting this camera and have been extremely pleased by its performance and options.The camera works perfectly as a "point and Shoot" or allows for manual overide for many settings. A good place to see technical specs is at ....  I highly recommend that you also purchase the 128MB memory card that allows up to 1330 JPEG images at a 640 x 480 resolution and the Olympus CLA-1 41mm - 43mm lens tube adapter and an additional step up ring to accomodate a protective UV filter (otherwise the lens at full telephoto will bump into the filter) and a larger lens cap.  The USB feature makes downloading the pictures a cinch.  If you can afford it, consider moving up (in price)to the discontinued model 3000 (I think) that includes a built in microphone that allows up to 4 sec of audio with each picture!  Its the only feature I believe that would make this camera better.
