This is NOT a very good camera for the price.  If you leave the batteries in the camera, they are drained in a day.  I finally figured out that the best way to go about it was to keep a separate bag with the batteries in it and put them in the camera before I use it.  This is very annoying because then it wants you to re-set the time when you start it back up again.  Not good for close-ups or low light.  (I tried to use it to photograph my jewelry but got poor results.)  Also, it does not have a zooming lens.  For everyday shots of my family and friends outdoors or indoor with a flash, this is an OK camera.  Still, I have found that you can get a much better product at a comparable price in the 35mm format, which you can now get "developed" and put on disc at most major film development outlets.  And for only $50 - $100 more you can get a good quality digital Canon, Nikon, or Olympus that zooms and they might not have the battery problems.
