Ok, Let me just say, that when looking at, or buying these cameras, keep in mind that they are a TOY-camera. Aside from that, this little guy or gal is a doozie. It is super light, super slim, and the lens is super wide. I have found my best results to be with 200,400,and 800 speed films, 100 is ok too, but make sure it is a bright one outside. DO NOT take indoor pictures with this camera, unless you are in a sun room, you will not be happy with the results, there is no flash or hotshoe for this camera, that is why I do not suggest indoor pics. Anywho, the colors and sharpness of the photos you get back are AMAZING! I have taken this hiking and camping, and got tons of great photos! Plus the light weight and compact size make it easy to travel with this camera. I bought this one for my girlfriend, and a Slim Black Devil for myself! Get one! Tons of Fun!
