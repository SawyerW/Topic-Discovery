I bought this used, not realizing it was an older model.  Works fine, just took me a trip to six or seven stores before finding a replacement memory card that came with it and was faulty (at least I know where to get more).  Not a problem.  Needed one with more memory anyway.  The camera arrived 3-4 days earlier than I anticipated, which I appreciate, in it's original box with all attachments and instructions.  There isn't a scratch or knick on this expertly cared for camera.  I bought it so I could take action photos at baseball games, etc., and the one time i tried it, i found i have a lot to learn, but that the camera, when used properly takes amazing photos.When I informed the seller the memory card was defective, he offered to send me a replacement.  He was very helpful and I appreciate his efforts to ensure I was happy with the camera.  Considering how much I paid (about 1/3 of the price of a new one), i can run and buy my own new memory card, but the offer of a replacement was telling, and I thank him for that.
