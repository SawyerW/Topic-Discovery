My windows 7 computer has stop working so i went to buy another one as a busy person i still take the time to buy the best computerNow i want to use my Logitech Wildlife Digital Video Security--Indoor Master System Camera on my new computer, the CD software will never download when i called the company I was told it does not work with windows 8 and they had stop selling these cam for 3 years now. I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT THROUGH AMAZON.. I am sooooooooo mad because Now i either have to through the Product away or find another computer money which i cannot afford because I had recently purchase this computer 6/4/13.Example my printer software could not install on windows 8 either but the company has a solution for windows 8 and now my printer is up and running....Why sell a product if it is no good and why not label important information on the label saying works with only windows 7.......I will never order this product nor will i recommend it....
