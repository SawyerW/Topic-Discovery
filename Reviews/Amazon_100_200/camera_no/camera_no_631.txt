I purchased 4 TrendNet cameras.  I also had issues hooking them up all to the wireless - the reason is simple - it overloads the wireless network so the cameras drop out and die.  I hard wired 2 of them and then had 2 on wireless and I had no further issues.  All in all a great buy - we use them to watch our kids as they sleep when they are with the babysitter !  It all works great and amazes our friends when used with the iPhone to watch the live video streams.  Pic quality at night is its within 10 ft and daytime no problem.  Only issue is the recording - I get a lot of image ghoasting making it difficult to see whats being recorded.  On the whole I would recommend if you take the wireless ability with a pinch of salt.
