- Excellent amount of customization and shooting modes- intuitive interface, super user friendly- displays a lot of useful information on a display and allows to changes settings easily from there- anti dust ultrasonic wave function to clean sensor (never cleaned mine so far)- functions found only in higher end DSLRs from other brands- excellent jpeg colors straight from the camera- double memory card slot CF  and XD- in body image stabilization IS, also can be adjusted manually for manual non-chip lens- high quality kit lens- not so great in low light resulting in grainy pictures- 2x crop factor great for reach when shooting wildlife- small sensor- autofocus in low light uses flash bursts which is quite annoying unless you get FL-50R flash that has infrared beams AFall in all is a great camera, that surprises me after so many years with ability for customization for every shooting situation, just recently I looked up Bremizer method and it discussed about assigning and locking your exposure and autofocus to another button. I checked my E-520 and it had that function.
