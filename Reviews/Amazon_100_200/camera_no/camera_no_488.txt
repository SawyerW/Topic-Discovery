If you aren't aware of the type of picture this camera takes search on flickr and you will see the beautiful colors and effects this camera produces. I'd like to give itfive stars but it has a drawback. You have to do one of the numerous mods tokeep it from eating batteries or take the battery out when not in use.I keep one in my pocket at all times and an extra rechargeable battery. Use only rechargeable batteries. My only other criticism is it's so tiny that I like more inmy hand when taking pictures but it is designed to be a small camera. I'm planningon making a bigger frame for it that will also hold more batteries.It's not a child's camera, it's for serious photography. You'd have to pay a lot ofmoney to buy an expensive camera that would give you the same effects as a Vistaquest.
