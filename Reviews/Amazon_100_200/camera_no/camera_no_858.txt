After reading some other reviews before me, I guess that the Quality control at Canon (Malasia) is very bad. Most of our friends who rated 1 star seem to have similar QC complaints.[For the cost], A70 clearly has best features than any other 3 MP DC in the market. Also, professional reviews have been the best for this camera. I got mine after a long wait and I started learning the operation of the camera. I even took a few snaps of my Kitchen (photo had lot of shades, they were just experimental shots though). Next day when I switched the camera on, nothing shows up in the LCD except for some default menus. This happened in both shoot as well as play modes. I spent about 4 hours reading the manual to get it right but had no luck. I just returned it and order a new one. Lets hope this one works.
