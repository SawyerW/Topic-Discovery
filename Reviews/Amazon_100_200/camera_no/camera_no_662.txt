I bought this bundle from Walmart(where it was originally offered) for my wife for Christmas, and it works awesome, yeah it not as detailed as the higher mega pixel cameras , but for the price of $99 it is an awesome set. The printer will go anywhere and print right from the camera no PC needed. My wife took a trip right after Christmas and took  her set with her. She was printing and taking pictures of the family and of the kids for the family to have the whole time. It is exceptionally user friendly, there is even some basic editing options built into the camera. If your looking for a Very Good Quality camera printer set , you cannot go wrong with this one for the money. 5 Megapixels isn't as high as most cameras out there but it makes incredibly detailed 3x5 or 4x6 photos
