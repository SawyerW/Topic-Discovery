This is an excellent choice in a mid-range compact camera.  The camera works flawlessly, with auto focus, menu negotiation, and picture quality all excellent.  Uploading images to the computer is easy.  The widest angle isn't all that wide though, and the 3X zoom is somewhat limiting; for example if you want to zoom in on your child playing at the playground at a bit of a distance.  Video quality is also excellent; only problem is again the zoom: it's set - and won't move - once you start shooting.  In conclusion, this is a very good mid-range camera: it takes excellent quality pictures and video.  However, the zoom's limitations also limit the camera somewhat; but then again, a more versatile zoom could only be found on a more expensive camera, and if this isn't that important considering your needs, then this would be an excellent reliable camera, and an excellent value.
