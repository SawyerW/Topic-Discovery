Canon is really making a BIG MISTAKE by not improving on its low light autofocus ability.  This is another Canon that takes GREAT daytime shots but is incapable of focusing in low light (even with the assist beam).  Even my puny Sony U30 can focus in low light, and its only a 2.0 mp (though not a very good resolution).  Sometimes it even lies and double beeps that its focused but its not!  Don't get this camera (A60/70/80) or most Canons if you take dark indoor or a lot of night shots, they CANNOT FOCUS in low light!The images are also a little soft.  They require a bit of sharpening to make them decent to view.  Nice that there is enough resolution to make it sharp but you "have to" sharpen.
