Don't be fooled by the insanely high megapixels.  Image quality is not the best.  Images come out noisy even at low ISO.  Also, I've noticed some lens distortion at the wide angle zoom.  Autofocus has trouble finding a subject if it's not directly in the middle of the frame.  Still, it's a good deal for the price, just don't expect to take anything other than snapshots with friends.The camera is small and very lightweight.The menu can be a bit cumbersome to navigate.Zooming in preview mode is slow.There are a lot of interesting features such as face recognition if that sort of thing interests you.Would I recommend this?  Yes because for a good price, it takes decent photos with a multitude of features.
