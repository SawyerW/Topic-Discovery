I received my 20D last week and have been finding excuses to take out the camera to take great pictures.  Start up on the camera is indeed almost instantaneous - as quickly as you can get the viewfinder to your eye, it's ready for you. Being able to use my existing EF lenses was the primary consideration for me and because it costed $5K less than its big brother. One minor quibble that I have with this camera is its lack of spot metering.  In some circumstances this would come in very handy but 99% of the time, center weighted would be fine.I would strongly recommend the extension grip for this camera.  Partly because it has the dedicated portrait shutter button and the shutter speed dial but more importantly it extends the grip in landscape mode just a tad bit more.  The added height and other features that the extension grip adds more than justifies for the added weight. The grip can also accomodate a second battery.
