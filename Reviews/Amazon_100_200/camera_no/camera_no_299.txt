I recently test drove a D200 and was impressed with the useabiity of the camera. It is almost perfect. When buying I opted for the D80 because it has a very similar feature-set for less cash. Which meant additional money for lenses. OK, it doesn't shoot 5fps or have the alloy body with weather seals, but it does have the sensor and useability. It is light, quick and a joy to use. Changing settings such as ISO, WB and flash is almost as easy as the D200. This is a fine camera. And it uses SD cards - much more preferable than CF in my opinion. Worth every penny.
