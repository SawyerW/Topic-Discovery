This is my second Casio camera I have purchased. I previously had the EX s700 and my girlfriend destroyed it in her bag with hair products. I am 100% completely satisfied with this item. I am a tech person so buying this camera I knew had to meet my standards and it did. The pixel count is incredible in bright light the quality easily rivaled those of more expensive cameras. Low light situations posed no problem. The flash was bright in the dark and shed light on the subject with even distribution. The movie quality proves easily that one does not need a seperate camcorder. I easily recommend this camera and the s700 for everyday practical use and the outcome is professional looking or should I say professional quality pictures.Casio Exilim EX-S770RD 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Red)
