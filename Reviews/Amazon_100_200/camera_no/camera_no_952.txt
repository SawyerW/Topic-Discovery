I love this camera, I have owned it for about two years when it first came out. The pictures are of great quality, and have used some of the special modes and have obtained professional photography results, even though I am just an amateur. The red-eye fix is very helpful.  The external metal casing has been durable and scratch resistant.My only drawback is the battery door.  A little tab broke off and I have had to tape the lid to the bottom of the camera.  The  camera works fine, but it just does not feel or look fine now.  Which has me now looking for a new one!
