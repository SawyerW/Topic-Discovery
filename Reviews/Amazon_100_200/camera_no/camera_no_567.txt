I bought this for traveling because of its durability.  I also bought the underwater case for scuba diving.  This is a great little travel camera, the stabilization works well when you are taking photos from a moving vehicle.  For underwater macro stuff it is adequate.  I have external lighting which helps.  It is a good all around camera, durable and takes good--not great photos. I think I paid 249. 4 years ago. I would not buy this camera for Amazon's 399. price.Pro: compact, underwater adaptable, rugged, decent photosCons: hard to take photos in bright sun (LED screen), current price is way too much for what the camera is.
