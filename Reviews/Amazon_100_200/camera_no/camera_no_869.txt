This is the third Canon (we have one Sony) in the family.  I bought Canon because the other two provided good pictures, good software, easy and user friendly operation, all at a good price.  My A70 has been a joy to operate.  This is my first digital camera to call my own.  I have two Minolta 35mm camera, and although this digital won't replace them, it can be carried a lot easier than my two film cameras, and all their lenses.  I also like the instant color-to-B&W; (and other special features) rather than switching out film.  The batteries last for a long while, but even longer since I bought (free with rebate) a card reader.  The local retail store prints copies of the digital pics that you want to put in the album or in a frame.  Good camera with no problems.  The 3MP at just over $200 has served me well.
