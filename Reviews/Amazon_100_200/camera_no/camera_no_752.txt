I've had this camera for almost five years now and never once have I had any problems. It takes great pictures and is easy to use. It does eat up regular AA batteries but if you get rechargable they last for a long time. It's nothing fancy but still works wonders. Coming from someone who has had loads of experience with this particular camera I would say it is definately a good buy for someone looking for something basic but still good. The picture quality is amazing, I just uploaded three of my favorites taken on a trip to England that you can check out if you need to see for yourself.
