I reluctantly bought a display model of the GR-DVL120U about a year ago.  I choose this model because of price, shape/size and the fact it was digital.  Price was the biggest concern because the soul purpose was for shooting underwater video (if my housing flooded, I would be out less money).  The camera is still going strong despite use in some rough environments.  The video quality is very good and if works great for connecting to a computer (something my girlfriends Sony doesn't do well).  The manual setting on the camera is great because I can lock the focus and everything for shooting underwater.  That way it doesn't search for focus in low light conditions.  There's lots of different settings you can tweak in the manual mode to work in your environment (I can get good footage 119 ft underwater!)  The negative would be the camera isn't very common so it isn't always easy to find batteries or other accessories (like a good fisheye lens)
