I've owned the Canon PowerShot A70 for about 18 months and loved - LOVED! - it.  Simple to use, plenty of options for full auto or manual operation, a ton of extras, efficient battery usage, great companion software for easy uploading - all in a compact, attractive, sturdy package.  Then the lens retraction mechanism failed and I got the dreaded "E18" error message.  I emailed Canon's support desk and got a speedy and thorough reply.  But since the one year warranty had expired, I was told my only options were that I could send in the camera to its service center (average cost of repair: $100 - $200) or I could pay $150 and they'd send me a factory refurbished A70.  Considering the expense, I'll just spend a little more to get a brand new camera.  Unless somebody from Canon is monitoring these posts and wants to cut me a deal on repair costs for my beloved but broken PowerShot A70...
