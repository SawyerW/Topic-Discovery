I bought this for my mom who has a basic tech familiarity but isn't the kind of person who is going to want to hit 1000 buttons to take one picture. She took it on her trip and loved it! It can take short (soundless) movies and the photo quality was excellent.I would suggest buying rechargeable batteries though, since it can go through the batteries pretty quickly. But for a basic camera that is easy to use and takes great high quality pictures, get it! It is worth it. If you need giant photos or whatever for pro use, get a 5+ megapixel camera. For most people this is an easy and good camera for the money!
