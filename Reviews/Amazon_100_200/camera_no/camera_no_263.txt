I used this with the 18-200mm VR lens and found the combo heavy.  So I sent it back and got the D40 which I prefer (because it is lighter).  After trying various menu interfaces, I prefer the type used by Panasonic - a four way circular button which give you direct access to Exposure Compensation, flash exposure compensation, ISO, WB, etc.  But this is a matter of personal preference, and so some people might prefer the Nikon approach.Some of settings could be better designed.  For instance the ISO settings are placed in Custom settings and in other menus.  You need to make changes to both to get the settings you want.  It would make more sense if they were in the same place.  I also found that some of the custom selections were things that should be available in the shooting menu.Other than these minor quibbles, this is a great camera.
