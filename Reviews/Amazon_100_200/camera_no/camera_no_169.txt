To be honest, I haven't used the camera a ton, but here's what I can tell you about it, compared with the older non-zoom model (I had the EX-S3).The interface is pretty similar, and easy to work with.  There are of course more bells and whistles, but at the end of the day, it's the same.The optical zoom is nice (the S3 didn't even have one), but it comes at a price of additional thickness.  Granted, this camera is still very thin, but it is definitely noticeably bigger than its predecessor.The flash is actually very powerful...maybe too powerful.  I found that when someone is close up to the flash, say indoors, they become white as a ghost.  Sometimes I'll cover the flash a little with my finger to balance it out.The screen is very big and bright - that's a plus.  Battery life is decent.  Pictures come out good as well.That's about it.  To conclude, I wish they could've added the zoom while still keeping the camera ultra thin.  Still, it's not too bad and fits in my pocket, which is actually my biggest concern.
