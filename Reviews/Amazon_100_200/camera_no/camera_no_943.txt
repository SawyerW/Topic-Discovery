What is up Nikon?  How do I know what mode I am in when it is dark?  Sure there is a backlite LCD panel but it doesn't tell you what mode you are in.  And since the program dial just spins around you can't count back what mode you are in either.  I guess I will have to carry around a pocket light.  Why did Nikon take away such a basic feature.  Also the AF illumin. light doesn't stay on long enough and takes too long for it to light up again.  Oh and fix the dust on the CCD issue.  Come on camera guys we are forking over thousands of dollars for this stuff and still dealing with dust?  Even the cheaper digitals have solved the problem.  Overall not a bad camera.  WB is too warm on A with flash.  Nikon still has some homework to finish.
