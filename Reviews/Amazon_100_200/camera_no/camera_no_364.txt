This is my first DSLR and I love it! All the goodies that came with the camera were great. The spare battery that came with my camera is defective as it will not charge but when I contacted Ace regarding the issue they got right back to me saying a replacement was in the mail. I will definitely check out Ace again for my photo needs.I would say the only disappointing part of the purchase is the lens package or lack of one. I researched DSLR's for weeks before purchasing this one and most D80 packages came with 2 lenses instead of the one. Unfortunately, by the time I had made the decision to purchase the D80, the packages with 2 lenses were sold out.This is a great camera and very easy to use.
