I love this camera! It takes amazing clear pictures and is great for begining photographers! It's so complex, if you want to take even better pictures and use all the options that this camera comes equiped with you'll need to have the manual. For a point-and-shoot camera, leave it on auto, or for a pro you can also have it on full manual mode. If you're in between there's modes for that. The flash is great, but if you want to take long range pictures in the dark, upgrade to the amazing Nikon 800 speedlight. Over all, this is a high quality camera for everybody, from pros, to the first camera, and in-between!
