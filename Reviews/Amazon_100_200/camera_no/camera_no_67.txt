Great camera, took great pics, everyone loved it. Then one day I went to turn it on and half the screen was black and distorted. The unit was kept in a case and experienced no abuse. I called Casio who said to send it in to an authorized dealer for repair. Six calls and a month later, no repair and a bill for $200 to repair a camera that cost $300 only 6 months from purchase. Neither Casio or the authorized dealer are any help. The LCD display (one of the main reasons for buying) is not covered.  As much as I love this camera, I would never buy a Casio again. Terrible customer service and a practically non-existent warranty.
