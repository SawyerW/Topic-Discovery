The LCD screen is almost impossible to view in certain outdoor circumstances like previously mentioned.  I haven't toyed with it long enough to find a solution.  I love the fact that it is waterproof.  We have the underwater housing for scuba diving but if that ever leaked just a little, the camera would survive (unlike its predecessor).  We also handed it (minus the underwater housing) someone standing in the water to take pictures.  The smile on my face was from knowing that if the camera was dropped in the water by accident, it wouldn't matter.  I also enjoy the size, having brought it into venues where "no cameras allowed" is stated but not thoroughly enforced. :)
