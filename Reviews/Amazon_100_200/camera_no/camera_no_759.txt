I would recommend this product for beginning/amateur video enthusiasts for the ease of use.  Although because it is limited by its price range, some features are cut out or needed, which is obviously placed in JVC's higher models.  I use it to edit simple home movies using the IEEE Firewire output to my PC and it runs great on most software.  I have only one problem with it though: I actually DO a lot of editing and I have to plug the AC adapter to the camera everytime, but the problem is, the plug in the camera is in the wrong place forcing the AC wire to be in this obtuse position bending the wires out of shape. It's not in a real bad condition yet, but i'm predicting in a couple of months or so after use, it will probably be damaged to a higher degree.  JVC needs to place the AC outlet somewhere on the side in order to get rid of this problem.  But other than that, its a good camera.
