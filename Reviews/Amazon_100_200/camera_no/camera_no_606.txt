I purchased Logitech's camera system years ago and it was great.  I added cameras over the years and now have 6 cameras.  Problem is, now I'm having issues viewing the cameras online because Logitech has quit supporting them and moving on to the HD system.  Well I have over $1,000 invested in my system and can't just throw it out to buy a whole new system that they want us to have.  They offer a pityful 20% trade in on your old system for a new one.  HA!  I don't think so.  I'll be buying a different brand to replace it with.  One who's company backs them and doesn't leave you high and dry with no support.  Please, don't waste your money with Logitech!
