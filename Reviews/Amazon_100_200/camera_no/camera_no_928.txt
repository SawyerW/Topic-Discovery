I was first attracted to this camera because of its size and light weight; the Pentax marketing materials will tell you that it fits in an Altoids tin. Not only can you easily carry this camera anywhere, but the number of functions it has is just amazing. I like the option of composing my photo using a viewfinder or the screen. Instant review, various flash options, and a number of other color and light adjustments that can be made assure that you never take a bad picture. The video and sound recording options are also fun. As an added bonus, the super lightweight battery is rechargeable. I like that I can easily fill the memory card with one battery charge and then quickly recharge the battery for more use. At the end of the day when you go to download your pictures onto a computer, the software and USB cable connection could not be easier to use. After initial installation, it's simply a plug-and-play operation.
