While this reference card doesn't contain all info essential to the camera, it has the basics covered very well.  The card is high quality, laminated and is very handy for those shoots on the go.  The card stows away very nicely.  I would recommend this card to any D90 owner, especially for novice to intermediate photographers.  I'm an experienced shutterbug, but new to digital photography and this card has come in handy several times.  Many tidbits of info are stored on this card and the layout is simple to understand.  A very brilliant idea for the architect of this product.  Sure beats carrying around a book or manual when traveling light!
