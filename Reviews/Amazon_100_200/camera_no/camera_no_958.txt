While the camera worked, I had very few complaints about it (short battery life, but it took good high quality pix). However, this camera definitely comes with hidden charges. The most expensive and most fragile part in the camera - the LCD screen - is not covered by warranty. In my case, the LCD cracked without being bumped or dropped, (and the clear plastic protective cover didn't crack). This has led to THREE MONTHS of dealing with service centers, paying an additional approximately $150 for parts and labor, and I still haven't received the camera back fixed. It seems the part is in such high demand from people with the same problem that I am still far down on the list for replacement.
