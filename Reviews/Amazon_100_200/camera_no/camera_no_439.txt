This camera is amazing.  I have a Nikon D40 also and I like the D80 better.  The D40 did amazing things, but I like the slightly larger camera body of the D80, the top-mounted LCD display, and more direct access feature buttons on the D80.  You can access more settings faster on the D80 with more buttons on the exterior, instead of having to scroll through so many menus in the D40.  The LCD display is wonderful.  You had to look through the viewfinder to adjust any setting in the D40, but you can just look on the top-mounted LCD to see what shutter speed you will get when you have it on aperature priority mode, or when you are adjusting the ISO.  Of course, I like having 10 MP over 6 MP, not that it makes much of a difference if you are making smaller prints.  I have printed flawless 12x18 posters with the 6MP D40.  The D80 does better with the built-in flash when using larger diameter lenses, such as the 18-200mm lens.  If you weren't sure which digital SLR to get, this is the one.
