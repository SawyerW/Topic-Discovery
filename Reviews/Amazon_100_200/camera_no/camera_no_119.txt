i've had this camera for about a year, and had no problems at all until recently when the control knob broke.  that one button basically renders the whole camera useless because you cant control any of the functions whatsoever.  and since sony only covers the product for a year, i cant get it fixed.  the battery is drained even though its not on too.  and you have to buy larger memory card otherwise its useless to buy a 4.1 megapixel camera since the one they give you only holds 9 pictures.  night pictures come out in a blur too.  and the lcd screen could be a bit bigger, but its good if you just want to see how the picture came out without any crazy zooming.
