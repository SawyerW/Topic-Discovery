The camera didn't arrive when expected. Tracking showed it hadn't left seller. Seller responded to emails promptly but didn't answer questions I asked - just always promised it would be shipped tomorrow - and then didn't follow through. We had bought the new camera to take on a vacation and eventually were worried that we would leave before it arrived. Finally asked them to overnight - at their expense. They agreed. Then (since I mistakenly told them when we were leaving) 2 day shipped instead so I was waiting for fed ex instead of leaving on vacation. The camera came. No warranty or registration cards. No Nikon markings on any boxes or packing material. Only instruction books included were in Spanish. USB cable and photo cd that were supposed to be included weren't in the box. Then...the camera didn't seem to work properly. Called NIkon customer service. It took them several minutes to recognize the serial number on the camera but they did eventually recognize it as a legitimate Nikon product although we couldn't get it to work and they gave me instructions to send it for repair.  Needless to say - I returned to seller.
