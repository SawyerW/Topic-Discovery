Camera was easy to install, very good documentation, picture quality was excellent for one day. On the 2nd day after installation the camera picture went dead. I could get sound from the camera but could not get a picture. I contacted TrendNet who spent about 90 minutes with me to determine that the camera was defective. The TrnedNet support team was very good to work with. The only complain I have is that I bought a defective camera, spent a lot of time figuring out it was defective and TrandNet wanted me to pay to ship it to them and they would replace it and pay the shipping back to me. I have a dLink camera that was defective. dLink paid the shipping both ways.I would recommend the product. The camera image for the first day was excellent, but the quality is suspect .
