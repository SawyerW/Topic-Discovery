I was a bit surprised at first that the camera was so small, the pictures on the sales site give an impression of something larger.  It is an easy camera to use and the menu selection process, especially the delete function, is very understandable, very friendly and right there to be used rather than behind a series of menu buttons/screens.  I have not taken that many pictures but most have come out very well.  Some close ups of tropical flowers were excellent.  I like that I can download directly to my computer through the USB port without needing a secondary device.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
