I've had this beauty since December 2005 and amidst all the hoopla over newer and better(?) cameras, I still say that this Sony V3 is just about one of the best I've ever used and I've gone through a wide range from the  (also classic) Minolta SRT-101 to the Nikon F3 to the new DSLRs like the Nikon D60.So unassuming and yet, packed with capabilities only DSLRs have, this pro-sumer V3 allows me to exploit full manual capabilities that you wouldn't normally use if you were just a hobby shooter. It even beats some DSLRs with fast continuous shooting or bracketing or good low-light capabilities.I've only one limitation to this camera: its flash (but then again, camera-mounted flashes, even for DSLRs, are usually very weak and practically not recommended for natural-looking lighting in your photos, which I've countered by getting the Sony HVLF32X).I wish that Sony did not stop production of this legendary camera but rather built on it, especially for the accessories. If anyone from Sony is listening, PLEASE KEEP THE V3 ALIVE! I think, in fact, I'll be the first to form the SONY V3 ENTHUSIASTS CLUB OF THE PHILIPPINES.
