I bought this camera about a momth ago on newegg for under $80, and for the price it's not bad.  It's small, stylish, has a large lcd and in general takes good photos.  It uses AA batteries which in general I dislike because they tend to have a worse lifespan compared to proprietary camera batteries but I was impressed with the lifespan of two cheap NIMH rechargeables.  I could easily take 150 photos with flash before thinking about recharging.  The biggest problem I had with the camera was picture quality.  Outdoors in sunlight it takes ok photos but in low lights pictures can turn out blurry even with the flash turned on.  In addition there really isn't a macro mode.  I tried to use it to take photos of food dishes during a recent trip to a restaurant but the photos didn't turn out well.  I think that if you're not willing to spring the extra $20-$40 for a Canon (which I've had excellent success with) then this is a decent alternative.
