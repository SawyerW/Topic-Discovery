I purchased this camera last week and love it. My wife and I have not stop using it. We take pictures of everything. I read the reviews before I made my decisions and I have to agree with the rest. This is a good camera... Of course I am not a professional but the shots I take are very nice. The quality of the pictures are great! I love the zoom. optical is 3x and then you can zoom in even closer digitally... At close range or far the picture is very clear. no purple problem... The download to our PC was very easy. The use of the camera seems tricky with all the buttons; it's just intimidating; read the manual and after awhile you will be a pro at it. We deffinately recommed this to anyone interested in going digital. I have to agree, the auto lens cover is a nice feature among all the others.
