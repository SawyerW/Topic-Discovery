I wanted a nice small digital camera just to have to take pictures. My grandma bought me this one. I was pleased with it for awhile, it's small, portable, light and easy to take pictures with that the quality are pretty good, all things considered.Although, only about 5-6 months after receiving it, it broke. It started making this annoying clicking sound and the lens wouldn't emerge, the only thing it did was display pictures...Since it was still under warranty, I  sent it in and had it repaired for free. Then it was great...It broke a few months later, the same problem, only this time it wasn't under the one year warranty and it'd cost over a hundred to repair it... and I could just get a different camera with that money...So this isn't the best choice... though maybe I just got a defective camera.
