I took the A70 to Argentina last summer along with 3 sets (12) of recharchable batteries, a Rayovac quick recharger (really nice here, and necessary there) and a power transformer.  The transformer cycled things down from 220 to 110 but it took a while to charge, nevertheless the battery life from 3 sets was enough that I could go on a side trip from Buenos Aires through central and northern Argentina without my charger and not worry about running out of juice for a week.  All in all I took about 600 pictures, and manyof them are really quite stunning post-card quality - the others are MISTAKES on my part.  I'm disappointed that the A80 has that flip out LCD which looks like a potential battery hog, I think they should have kept it simple.  This is a great model, and for this price you will definitely not be disappointed.For the record I had a little case that I carried the camera and the two extra sets of batteries in at all times.  They all fit very compactly, and I never needed more than the one 256mb card I brought down with me.
