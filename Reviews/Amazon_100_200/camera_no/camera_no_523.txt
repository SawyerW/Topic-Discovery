I lost my Olympus Stylus 500 camera that I had bought 2 years ago, and got this one to replace it. It (1)is lighter, (2), cheaper, and (3) has enhanced additional features like image stabilization and a better optical zoom. I LOVE this camera, and I was pretty fond of the 500. It has all the features I loved about the 500 (large digital viewfinder/viewing screen, weatherproof gaskets), plus more. The photos are terrific. I originally bought the 500 because it was more than a "point and shoot" (i.e. you could take it off of "automatic" and play with the ISO, etc. if you wanted to), but I have to admit I have NEVER done that because the photos on the auto setting are so good. If you are looking for an excellent, light, durable all-round use camera of the (mostly) point-and-shoot variety, this one is for you.
