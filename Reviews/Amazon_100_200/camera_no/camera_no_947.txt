I have used a professional quality 35mm camera for the last 20 years.  Was in no hurry to buy a digital camera.  Either the quality was not good enough or it required a mortgage.  My equipment was fine for making art quality pictures, but too cumbersome for parties and trips.  This camera is the size of a credit card and still feels good in your hand.  You don't worry about dropping it.  The print quality is excellent.  Easy to use.  I highly recommend it.  Would suggest buying the extra battery and camera case.  There is very little warning when your battery is low.  Looked at the Cannon cameras and found them too bulky for my shirt pocket and not easy to use.  The zoom control on Canon's cameras is terrible.
