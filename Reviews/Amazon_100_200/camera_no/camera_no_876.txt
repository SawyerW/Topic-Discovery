This was the first digital camera I bought and did so after a good amount of research and playing with a variety of other ones through my friends.  I've owned it almost two years now and it has served me pretty well.  The batteries don't drain too quickly, even when shooting video and the picture quality is good enough for almost anything you need to do.  Most of my pictures end up on-line and this camera serves that purpose well.  The features are standard, nothing too out of the ordinary now.  It's a little larger than I would have liked, but it's not a pain to fit in most places.  Overall, for the price I think it's a good deal and worth it if you are just looking for a recreational camera.
