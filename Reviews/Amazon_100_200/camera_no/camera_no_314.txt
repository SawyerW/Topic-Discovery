I won't go into the individual specs because every other review does that.  Ever wonder why it is compared to the professional Nikon D200?  Most people don't know this but the D80 and D200 are brothers!  The little brother, D80, has most of the same functions, CPU programs and CCD image sensor (10.2 mega-pixel) but the D80 must be preprogrammed to set up your shot (unless using AUTO), a time consuming process, and the main frame is made of plastic.The metal D200, however is for the pro who has the camera to their eye everyday and knows the settings like the back of their hand, thus it can be programmed on the fly by rubber finger knobs and settings can be read in the viewfinder so they don't have to take the camera from their face.  That's a lot of itty-bitty info for an amateur and although it can be used in AUTO, what self-righteous photographer wants that?In short, the D80 is meant for the semi-pro while its big brother, D200, is the D80 on steroids!
