I became the proud owner of an Olympus Stylus 710 and I absolutely loved that little camera.  Someone had an accident with my camera and I had to replace it.  I did research and I found this 750 and I loved the fact that it s a 5x Optical zoom.  i figured that being an upgraded product that it would be a better camera.I went to Vegas with the camara and it worked beautifully outdoors.  The colors were crisp and clear, but night photography was awful.  If I used the flash the pictures were to dark, used the night scene even with a tripod and pics were blurry, used the outdoor available light feature pictures came out but were on the yellow side.  Made all the necessary adjustments and would switch back and forth on features and would even take several pictures of the same item looking for that "good" picture. Shooting into backligght was an issue. None of these were issues I had with my 710.Unfortunately, I did return the 750 and was able to replace my 710, which I am absolutely happy with.
