I've stayed with Olympus cameras ever since my first digital one.  Of of the 5 different models used, I prefer this one over the others.  I owe a blue one and a black one.Pros:-it's compact-uses rechargeable battery-lightweight-takes very decent pics for the megapixelsCons:-there are times when the shutter slides back and forth as though it's seizing.  I have to turn it off and on several times before it works.  Not an always problem but it crops up frequently-rechargeable battery (I travel out of the US often and it can be difficult and time consuming waiting for the batteries to charge)I definitely recommend the camera.  It's been good for all the pictures I've taken on my various travels.
