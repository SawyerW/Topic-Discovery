Abysmal bit of engineering. I returned the first one because I thought it must be defective. No camera at this price could have bad focusing and snail-like write times and lag, right? Wrong! This camera has a sharp lens, but do your homework. It's a VERY slow chunk of glass and the contrast based AF module ruins shot after shot. Lag and write times mean you can't catch a special moment unless everyone agrees on a time and place for it. It's almost funny, unless you can't get your money back. You could make all kinds of excuses for this dog if it cost 279.00, but it's current price of close to 700 dollars just buy a DSLR. Cameras are about being able to shoot focused shots when you hit the shutter button, without DELAY. The 8800 is incapable of that by a long mile.
