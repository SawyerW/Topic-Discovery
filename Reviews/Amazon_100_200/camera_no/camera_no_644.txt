I almost didn't buy this camera because the description says it requires IE6+ and it doesn't mention the RTSP or 3GPP interfaces, or that it works great with firefox & safari.  You don't get some of the zoom buttons unless you are running IE, but the digital zoom on these cameras is never very good.  The range of motion on this is great in the horizontal axis (320 degrees) and pretty good on the vertical axis (would be nice to go down more) and the night vision works pretty well.  The response over the net if fast and the picture quality is good.  I replaced a d-link and this is compatible in every way except you are not forced into using IE like you are with d-link, and it is a lot cheaper.  I wold recommend this camera.
