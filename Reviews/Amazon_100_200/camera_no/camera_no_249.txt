I ordered bought this camera as an upgrade from an Olympus prosumer camera. I used to own several 35mm film cameras in the past and was always partial to Olympus, but when the digital camera revolution rolled around, I thought I would check out the Nikon range and I settled on this one which I got for a great price. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to use, and how great the pictures look. I went to college for Art and had my share of photography courses, so I was familiar with operating a 35mm to begin with. I also shoot product photography at work and have had an Olympus, and a Canon, and neither of them have lasted like this one has.This camera has stood the test of time, and although it lacks some of the features that newer ones have these days, if you can pick one up for a great deal, I highly recommend doing so. My pictures look as good or better than any I've seen from any newer camera. For my money, Nikon ROCKS.
