well I got this camera a few days ago and ,I am really impressed with all the features of this little thing. I would say its downright perfect for pretty much everything other than professional print photos or something like that. I mean I bought it cause it was cheap , if I wanted soopa doopa picture quality I would have bought one of those 2000 dollar nikon jobs. you cant beat the price! picture quality is better than you would think too. Like all the other reviews say its great in low light, no flash needed. ok I'll stop rambling.
