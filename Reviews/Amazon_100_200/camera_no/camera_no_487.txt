This is not worth buying unless you have very specific need for a tiny camera that takes mediocre photos of items at EXACTLY 6'!  Seriously, the focus is fixed at 6' and it has no depth of field (look it up) so only things at that distance are in focus.  The rest are blurry.I also found it very hard to open up, it sticks terribly.But this next problem was what made me want to toss it out.  The battery only lasts a couple days sitting in the camera with it OFF.  So you have to plan when you're going to take photos with it, so you can install/recharge a fresh battery.  I bought this to have a camera in my coat pocket all the time, which won't work because of this battery problem.Video?  Seriously???  NOT!  It takes up to 8 seconds of very low quality, with only the stuff at 6' in focus, and some SERIOUS color problems.Don't bother buying it, you'll only be disappointed.
