Once I got the hang of taking pictures with this camera, I loved it. It took great pictures with amazing quality. A few months back though the camera started blacking out or it would have purple lines. I thought it might be the LCD screen but it wasn't. My pictures were coming out black or with these lines. I would hit it a couple of times and that would do the trick and the pictures would be fine. Now the camera gets hit so hard my hand would start hurting.  I gave up and moved on to a Minolta. Apparently Canon cameras, according the negative reviews has this type of problem with their cameras. It's sad because the pictures came out awesome.
