I had doubts before i bought this camera as i was all over the place asking and trying to find the perfect yet affordable camera......this camera has been able to do everything i've wanted a camera to do...i have not been disappointed....it fits easily into my handbag or anything i am taking out with me, it's really cute and stylish and takes GREAT pictures....and i got it in three days..a day before the estimated time of arrival even started.....if you are looking for something slick, stylish, affordable and takes great pictures then this is the way to go! Oh and by the way i am now in Jamiaca but i bought it when i was in the US...
