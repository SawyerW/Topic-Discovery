I won't write much about this digital camera, as so much has been said already and I simply echo those sentiments.I have never owned a camera and I have many, which so clearly captures action far afield!  If you're a nature photographer and don't like hauling a tri-pod, this kit is it for you.  The image clarity and functions are not matched by any other camera I've used.I teach Art and Design for Business and my students walk in with many different makes and models of digital camera.... the Nikon D80 is hands down, the best tool if you can have only one!That's it... I have no reserves about recommending this kit.
