The camera works well. With the 1 GB card you get about 45 minutes of video or 550 pictures. The stabilization feature works well even in the 5x mode.  Unfortunately the view screen is almost impossible to see in full light so you end up shooting by just pointing the camera in the general direction.I used the camera this past week to shoot a group of dancers under normal room light using the shoot movies mode and with the image zoomed to some extent. As long as the clip is viewed in default format (or 2x the size) the picture looks quite good and the sound is quite reasonable.
