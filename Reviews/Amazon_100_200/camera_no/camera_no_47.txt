I chose this camera (after a rather intensive stint of web research) as a replacement for my bulky, sluggish Nikon Coolpix 775. I've had it for a little over a month now and I'm thrilled with it. It's fast - powers up and snaps in seconds. The pics are (to my eye) great quality; the intuitive interface and controls and "Best Shot" feature makes it easy to use right out of the box. The battery life is impressive as well; I used it for days snapping pics on a recent vacation without recharging it.The enormous LCD display makes it easy to review your pics before d'loading them. The convenience of the cradle is one the I'd originally underestimated, as well. All in all, a great shutterbuggin' experience.
