O.K I purchased 2 WiLife master system indoor camera Sold by Deals on Wheels. Took the first one out of the box camera damaged, and software broken. I was very excited about this system and have been severely disappointed. I bought 2 cameras and they were easy to install. So far I have not been able to view the cameras other than inside my home. I purchased these cameras specifically to use their remote viewing service when I am away from my home. The service is not stable and most of the time does not work. You cannot get a response from Logitech support. Logitech requires you to purchase an additional 79.95 for remote viewing, as opposed to the so called free web interface viewing, falsely advertised by Logitech. For a highly visible industry like Logitech to promote such a product as a quality device to protect your home and business at a cost of well it not perfect. is shameful greedy business practices.
