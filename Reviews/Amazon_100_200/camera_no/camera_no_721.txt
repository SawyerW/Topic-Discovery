The easy to use intuitive controls which allow total flexibility in how you set up your shots, whilst also having auto functions if you haven't the time are just fabulous.  I am impressed with its weight (it's featherweight and palm sized) the range of different settings for the flash, & the easy to use zooms.  The speed with which it takes a shot and is ready for the next, the continuous shooting (sequence for web animation) and the impressive battery usage (+ 250 shots, 50% with flash, on one set of 4AA) and the ability to use rechargable batteries makes it an absolutely brilliant camera.  A great optional accessory is the floppy disk adaptor for the flash card, if travelling it's a must - allowing you to upload pictures to the web from any floppy drive wherever in the world you may be.  I highly recommend this camera!
