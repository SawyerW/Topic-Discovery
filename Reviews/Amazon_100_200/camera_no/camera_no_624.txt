I got this camera for a trip to Asia. It worked beautifully. The pictures were clear, the response was quick. Buying a memory card is necessary because you would otherwise only have space for about 10 pictures. Unfortunately, I cannot give this camera more stars because it stopped working for no apparent reason after 1.5 years. Got new batteries several times, attempted to reset it but to no avail. Even contacted Kodak and they could offer no assistance. If you search online you could see that quite a few people had the same issue. The only explanation I could gather is that its just shoddily manufactured. I used to be pretty loyal to Kodak but now I dont trust their products anymore.
