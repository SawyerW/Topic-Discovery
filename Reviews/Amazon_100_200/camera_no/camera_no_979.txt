Well, I knew it was a cheapie, so I wasn't expecting much, but this product still managed to disappoint even my low expectations.  I purchased this for my granddaughter's 10th birthday and was almost embarassed to give it to her.  I took some shots to make sure it was in working order and it was just pitiful.  It's only a 5 mp, but I figured my phone is on 3.2 mp and takes very clear pics.  Not this one, though.  The close up shots were lack-luster and the zoom shots were worse.  The components were very fragile and cheap.  I actually would have returned it, but it specifies that the packaging has to be in tact.  Since it's one of those fully enclosed plastic cases, that's not possible to open it and have it in tact, and I really didn't want to hassle with it any further.  Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars and get yourself a camera with a name you can rely on.
