I think this is a decent camera for the money, except for one annoying design that will probably cause me to return it. The switch to turn the camera on is EXTREMELY difficult to move with your thumb. The design is for your right hand to go through the hand strap, and your thumb to be able to rotate the On/Off switch. Unfortunately, the switch is circular with no protruding edges to facilitate turning it (which my Sony Hi-8 has). Hence, it requires a significant amount of thumb pressure and friction to move, and often I find myself going right past the Off state into the Play state. Since I have to use this feature everytime I use the camera, poor design here is unacceptable.
