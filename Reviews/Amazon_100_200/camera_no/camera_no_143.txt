I just had a baby girl in January and of course want to take a million pictures of her growing up just as I did with my son.  I still have the digital camera I bought before he was born and have been using it until my husband began pressuring me to buy a new camera.  I didn't want to let go of my camera let me tell you!  It is a Fuji FinePix 1.3 megapixel digital camera!  Yeah, I know it is time to put it away.  Anyway, we have been shopping for a new digital camera and I just loved the look and feel of the Sony V3.  We actually went to a few stores and went back to look at the V3 about 3 times.  Well, needless to say we just had to take it home.  I've only had it a couple of days but the picture quality is great.  I'm really excited to learn all of the functions on it and hopefully will take awesome pictures of my children.  I know if I've had my Fuji for 5 years, this one should definitely last longer!
