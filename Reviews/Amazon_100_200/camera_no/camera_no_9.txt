I bought this book, after having seen the D5100 in a camera store, to help me decide if I wanted to spend the money (about $1,000.00 for the camera body and two lenses) to buy the camera. After skimming through the parts of the book that covered the kind of close-up studio photography of miniatures that I hoped to do, I was convinced I should buy the camera. After I had bought the camera, the book was indispensible for using the camera effectively, being much more comprehensive than the Owner's Manual that came with the camera. When I had questions about how to improve my photography, the book's well organized Table of Contents and Index led me to great solutions. If you are thinking about buying the Nikon D5100, I think this book is essential.
