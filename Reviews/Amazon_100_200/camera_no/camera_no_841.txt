This is my second digital camera and probably my last. I had a Kodak Easy Share camera just to see if I would like a digital camera, I am a photographer and thought I would really miss having everything on film. With a new baby, I am constantly taking photos and the digital camera has saved me tons of money. Though I still shoot black and white on film, I have switched over to mostly digital. The Kodak was easier to download the photos to the desktop but the Canon is a much better camera. I takes great photos and the short video clip option is really nice to have. If you plan to take any videos you will definately need to get a larger card, the one included will only take about 15 seconds at the high resolution. I am very pleased with this camera. It is all you need unless you are planning on shooting poster size images. Beautiful quality images and quicker shutter speed than other digital cameras I've tried. Its a great buy. I highly recomend this camera.
