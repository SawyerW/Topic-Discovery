I bought two of these cameras and printer docks because it was so easy to learn --  this was my first digital camera.  It takes nice pictures without red-eye. The only issue with it is that it takes so long to reset between pictures that the subjects start to walk away after the first shot. Because of that, I am switching to a new camera soon. The Kodak software is good for uploading images to the Kodak website for sharing pictures easily and ordering photos. But, the software tends to be very buggy and takes forever to install and update.  The Kodak printer dock makes very nice prints -- when it works. I had to send one of the docks back for repair within the first year.  Frequently, the docks are not recognized by my computers.
