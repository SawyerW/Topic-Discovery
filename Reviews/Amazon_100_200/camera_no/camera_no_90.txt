I did not buy this camera but used it for vacation after my parents bought it.  [...]To begin with - i am definetly not a digital camera savvy person but i can tell you when a picture is good or not and that is what i expect from a camera.This one is very sleek looking & is amazing in its simplicity.  It has the basic functions you need to take pics, review them and take make small movies.  You don't need to be a techie or open a manual for this.  I have to say that outdoor pics are GREAT.  I have to underline this b/c i saw people complaining in reviews about picture quality.  My pics were mostly outside so i am not quite sure about pic quality in dimly lit rooms or at night but day pics are amazing.Summary:Good things: sleek looking, easy to use, sturdy, excellent pic quality (at least outside pics)Cons:  you have to buy a memory card b/c w/o one you can only take around 30 pics.
