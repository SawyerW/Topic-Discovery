I was excited to receive this camera - very small, light, attractive, good features.  However, I tried about every combination of shooting mode and flash mode - and there are quite a few - and found it impossible to get a good photo of my kids indoors.  Not one!  Every single photo was extremely noisy, almost all had fairly severe redeye even with the redeye reduction flash, and most of them were either blurry or dark.  Viewing the photos on the camera LCD they look fine.  Put them on the computer zoomed out to fit the screen and they look sort of OK.  Zoom to 1:1 and they look terrible.Maybe it would take great outdoor photos, I don't know, but if you're going to do a lot of indoor photography like I do, I don't recommend this one.  I'll be figuring out how to do a return on it.  No idea how the positive reviewers got good photos out of this.
