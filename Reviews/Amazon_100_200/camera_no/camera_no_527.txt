I bought this camera a while back, and am still using it.  I don't think  one can go wrong with Olympus, - I have had three Olympus cameras.This camera is slim, small, easy to use, accepts more than one kind of digital card, has easy-to-find-and-use controls (including extreme close-up), and it's easy to dim, or turn the flash on and off.  What more could you want?  Well, a little more, - in bright sunshine, the screen is virtually  impossible to view because of the glare.However, this camera is a snap to carry everywhere, and I did, until my phone delivered more megapixels.  But, the camera is more stable and easier to control than the phone camera, so now  I use both.  I will probably always carry it with me, especially for casual occasions when my big camera is too bulky to lug around.This is a little workhorse that is  versatile and very easy to use.  A good buy.
