Just purchased this master system and an additonal spy camera. Set up and running in 10 minutes, so far no issues. I set up trigger zones with the software so my two cats wont activate the recording and alert features and so far so good. Wish the extra cameras were a bit cheaper but looking at other security systems I think it's worth it. There is a Platinum service which enables extra features on the command center for an extra yearly fee. If you are looking at basic monitoring the free online viewing will suffice. There are many reviews on this product out there. Some have had nightmares with set up but the majority of users like myself had no trouble.
