The main purpose of purchasing this camera was to photograph movement in my apartment. Fail.I was able to setup the camera and connect it to my FTP site. I configured the camera so it would take a photo if motion was detected and save the photos to my FTP site. I left work and by the time I returned I had 6000+ new files on my FTP server.I adjusted the camera's sensitivity, points of motion detection, and tried several angles. Note: The apartment had very few windows and the amount of light changed very little during the day.No matter what I did it would always take photos every couple seconds. This leaves me to think there were two possible scenarios for this problem:1. The camera's motion detector sucked2. I had not configured it correctlyConsidering I have a solid technical background, if scenario #2 is true then the user interface is very confusion. Either scenario called for the camera to be returned.At least I got my money back!
