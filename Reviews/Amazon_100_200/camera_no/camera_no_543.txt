I bought Olympus 750 just a few days ago for my wife to replace our old Cannon power shot S400. Reading all these comments regarding the Olympus 750 LCD unusable under bright light I almost did not buy the 750, but then given all the other good features it had to offer and only for $169 on Amazon, I decided to buy it any way. I tried the camera in full California sun and did observe the washout of the LCD, but just today I found the solution. The solution to the LCD screen problem is very simple and I am very surprised no one had discovered it yet. Just go to setup and increase the LCD brightness to maximum (see page 32 of the Manual). I just took the camera outside in full California sun, and I was able to see my subjects fine in the LCD and it was not any worst that my old Canon digital camera.
