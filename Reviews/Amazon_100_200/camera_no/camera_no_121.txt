I've had my DSC-L1 for about a year and a half. It's a nice little camera, the size is good, and it's easy to use. The zoom is pretty dang good for a camera its size. It does have a few problems, though- it doesn't take pictures very well in poor lighting- and also...Mine has broken twice- the first time its knob broke and its warrenty had just run out. When the knob breaks, the camera becomes virtually useless. I sent it in and got it repaired for 110 bucks.Now, it broke again yesterday. The lens got stuck, once again rendering the camera completely useless. Once again I can repair it for the flat rate of 110 dollars.. but I'm not going to invest the money this time, instead I'm buying another one. It'll be a sony camera, just not this particular model. I would recommend this camera, however, just handle it carefully. I tend to abuse my cameras slightly so that is probably the reason why it broke twice. Still- be aware that this camera does have potential problems.
