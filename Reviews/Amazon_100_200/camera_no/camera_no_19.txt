If you are not an academic photographer who reads the manual studiously,and then obediently practises what you have read to reinforce what you have learnt, then these cards are the way to go, because it's when you are out there actually taking photos that you need prompts. These cards are light and portable, so they don't contribute more bulk and weight to your camera bag. I used them with my D70s and will continue to do so with any new SLR I acquire. There is a similar product which is not as convenient to carry but which is also helpful so I use both. After spending thousands of dollars on equipment, the cost of these is small change.
