This was a great camera until it was out of warranty. Then at the most inopportune times "Card Cover Not Closed" would appear on the LCD screen preventing any further picture taking. I tried all types of tricks like removing the card and putting it back in until the message disappeared.Eventually, my frustration sent me to the Eastern USA Olympus headquarters at Hauppauge, NY for service. Well, the flat rate was $80. I decided that it wasn't worth spending this much for a 4MP camera when for just a few more dollars I could get another camera with better features. Too bad I hadn't checked the Web before buying this camera as this card cover problem seems prevalent in any discussion I found concerning Olympus.
