I've owned this camera since it first came out and it was definitely worth the expenditure.  I am an electronics junkie and have all the new "toys" but this is most assuredly my prized possession.  Takes fantastic pictures, both close-up and telephoto.  The floppies are inexpensive, easy to get, easy to transport.  You can take pictures to your heart's content, deleting the ones that you don't like, on the spot.  No more waiting for pictures to be developed, no more wasted film.  In a world that values instant gratification, this is the perfect answer.  The camera itself, while bigger than some, is almost perfectly balanced so is quite comfortable to hold and to use.  I have acquired other cameras since my FD-91 but none has managed to take over the No. 1 spot from this beauty!  Go for it!
