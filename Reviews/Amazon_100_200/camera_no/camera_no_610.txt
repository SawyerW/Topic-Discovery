I've had this system for several years.  The cameras black out just when you need them the most.  The outdoor cameras don't work most of the time, even when you use them inside to test them out.  I've requested tech help many many many times and they pretend to help but don't answer you, and then close the issue "resolved" without even contacting you back.Don't buy this system unless you want to waste a lot of money. OH and they have a buy back program.  YUP, they take your camera and then tell you can get a discount on future purchases.  I requesteD my $200 camera back.  They told me  - no, and said I could get a 10% discount on future purchases.  That means I'll have to buy over $2000 worth of useless cameras.DON'T BUY THIS SYSTEM!!!!!
