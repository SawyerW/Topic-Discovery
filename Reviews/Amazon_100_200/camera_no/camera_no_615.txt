I have this and also used it to replace an older Samsung Tube monitoring system I had, because I could plug in the existing cameras.  I since replaced it with a Samsung 4 channel DVR box which does a much better job, and is not as slow as this unit, but the DVR box requires an external VGA monitor.  This system can double as a 1024 x 768 VGA monitor, which is handy, but you cannot view the CCTV using a MAC or an iPhone.  The DVR I bought has a much more granular setting for the motion detection and this system uses very large "blocks" of the screen.  For about $500.00 I guess it's a good deal given that each camera would cost about $100.00 or more even from eBay.
