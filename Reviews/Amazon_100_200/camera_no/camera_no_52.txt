The Z50 has an instantaneous startup time and the docking station is kinda cool.  It's pocket-sized with a nice size LCD, though not as big as the cybershot T1.  The snapshot feature seems to work the best because it doesn't manipulate/distort the image as much as the "best shot" feature, an ironic name for such BS camera modes.The categories for "best shot" are way too specific: Children, Fireworks, Flowers, Collection, Food, ect.  I don't take enough picture of food to have a specific setting on my camera for that.  The categories should have been like: indoor, outdoor, action, slow shutter-speed and stuff like that - keep it general.  I find myself taking multiple pictures of the same thing in different camera modes because I don't know which ones will turn out crappy.  Portraits and coupling shots are actually designed to blur the background, but the camera rarely distinguishes the foreground from the background correctly.If you can find the right picture mode for your shots, the camera can be worth the price.I probably wouldn't buy this camera again.  But I wouldn't discourage others from trying it.
