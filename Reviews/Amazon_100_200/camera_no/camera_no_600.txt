I have unsuccessfully tried 5 (FIVE) times to install it!!!! - -that is, uninstall it 4 times --, and I am thinking seriously to return it. Logitech has always been a brand that was incompatible with either my computer or my phone (talking about bluetooth) for unknown reasons to me. I am from Earth, by the way.I tried to install it, but I got the message: Error installing USB driver. I am very frustrated, as I have to pull out cables, uninstall, and whatnot; the paper that comes with it contains info that is NOT helping in any way. I will give one more chance and that is: look for a download tutorial/ call tech support...before I ship out the life of it!!!  So, the word [install it in 15 min] Breeze is more like a tornado for me.It should not be so complicated and impossible.I am computer and computer software knowledgeable, by the way.I called the tech support, they could not help me.I AM RETURNING IT.
