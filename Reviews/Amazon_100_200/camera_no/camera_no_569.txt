The view screen is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight.  All you can do is guess and hope that you framed the subject well.It has a very hard time focusing under normal conditions, (daytime, outdoors.)  Sometimes after the second or third try on the same subject the focus will improve, but not always.  It does quite well in macro mode, though...After I had been using the camera six months or so it developed a new problem where anything dark would come out a weird green and lack detail.  Makes most pictures worthless.I had an Olympus before that I liked a lot, but this one is awful.
