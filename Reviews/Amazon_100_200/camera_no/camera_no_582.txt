This camera is a piece of crap.  It has terrible picture quality.  I got it to set up finally but it won't find the indoor add on camera i also purchased and i've tried everything. I was up til 2 in the morning trying to get it to 'find' the add-on and it just won't.  It will only 'find' the hidden clock cam that came with the master system.  Also, the range on it is pitiful.  It has to be in the same room as the computer or it won't find the camera.  I tried plugging the clock cam into the bedroom across the hall from the room with the computer where the adapter is plugged in via usb and it won't pick it up.  When it is moved into the same room where the adapter is, it will work again.  Also, I expected to be able to see the camera online via my android phone but it is not possible.  It will ONLY work with windows phones.  No support by Logitech.
