Bought the camera to take on a 9 day canoe trip. Bought mainly for the weatherproofing, optical zoom and size. As noted in other posts, the screen is hard to see in bright conditions. Ran with image stabilzation and power-saving and the one battery lasted the entire 9 days. The power save mode can become irritating if you don't get the picture taken quickly enough. Took around 250 photos and 4 30-45 second movies. Camera was completely submerged several time for a few seconds each time and dropped once and came though with flying colors. Loved the different scene modes for the landscape and sunset pictures I got. Would give the camera a 5 star rating if the screen were visible in all conditions or a view finder was included. Overall a very good camera. This will replace my older and heavier Kodak as my everyday camera.
