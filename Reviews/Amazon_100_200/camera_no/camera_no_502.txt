Got it yesterday. In green. Actually it's a shiney yellowish-green. Nice feel. Fits well in shirt pocket. Very light; particullarly compared to my Pentax Optio 550. Good, nice size LCD. Easy to use yet with nice availability of choices for customization. Well written manual (you can find online thru google) and onboard help menu. Photos come out fairly nice. Tried indoors in low light with several scene settings, outdoors, macro, and supermacro. Colors look true, fairly sharp without noticable artifact. Used in South Florida morning daylight outside without any trouble with LCD viewing (camera has no classic viewfinder). Have read reviews of washout in bright sun: have not tried that yet. Overall, I'm happy with the camera thus far.*Next Day follow-up:  LCD does wash out in bright sunlight. Also it's reflective, making it quite difficut to use. Cupping or baseball hat helps enough to be able to use. I'll definetly order shade screen when Delkin comes out with custom shade for camera. Would lower overall rating to 3 stars if using out in bright sun much.
