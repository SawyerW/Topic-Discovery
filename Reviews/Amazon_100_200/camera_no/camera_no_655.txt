Had several problems with this product, and ended up returning it.  First, I had some issues getting the activex control to work correctly.  I had to upgrade the device to the latest firmware and then reset to factory defaults several times before the activex control in IE would work (would receive a blank screen instead of camera view and controls).  The java applet for Firefox worked OK, but it's features are limited as compared to the activex version.The second problem, for which I returned the device, was that everything that was supposed to be red was a washed out pinkish white color, and colors that have red in them  (e.g. orange) didn't look right either.  I didn't get the chance to try the night vision or any of the other stuff.  I may try to buy another one just in case I got a dud with a bad CCD chip.  If so, I'll amend this review with what I find.
