I did a lot of research before buying this camera and I sought a lot of advice.  The camera is very easy to use and gives great results.  The manual is not however very good. It is confusing and brief.  The good news is that you are able to purchase a DVD on How to use the D80 and there is also a 700 page detailed instruction guide written by Thom Hogan "The complete guide to the D80"I recommend that you get these books and DVDs as well an extra battery and memory card.Overall I am delighted with the camera and the results are amazing! I already feel like a pro.
