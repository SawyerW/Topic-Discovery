Took me long enough to get this one. In fact I went ahead and ordered the A60. But then the A70 finally came. Gave the A60 to my sister. I have mine set on medium resolution (which is what the A60 is) and my pictures come out just fine. Instructions were simple enough. Too many steps have to be taken to set it on auto shutter release, but what the heck. Don't use it that often anyway. Thrilled I had it when our grandson was born. Taken lots of pictures already. so far ir has performed flawlessly and the picture quality is great. I would and have recommended this camera to relatives and friends.
