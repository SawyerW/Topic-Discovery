I bought this camera for myself after hearing great reviews from friends and seeing it receive excellent marks in Consumer Reports. I have LOVED it. It has all the features I've ever needed, plus many manual functions that I haven't had time to play with yet. If you are averse to settings, you just need to keep it on "Auto" all the time. You'll get beautiful pictures. I don't even keep it on the highest resolution setting and I've never needed more resolution. Tip: I think using flash can make subjects too stark. When I turn it off, most pictures come out better. I have had the camera for 8 months.
