This camera is just great !It's very easy to understand and use the controls. Inserting media and retreving it is also easy.Image quality straight out of the camera without tweeking is great and people that don't use Photoshop or don't know how end up getting great pictures hassle free.Battery consumption is very good and while we've had the camera for over a month and picture taking averaging 4 to 5 pictures a day, it's still working fine with the original set of alkalines we bought.I bought this camera as a gift for my 18 year old son and now he carries it everywhere, he loves it!
