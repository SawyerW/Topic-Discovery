I bought this camera three months ago after having twins because I wanted a good camera to document their growth and that is just what I got.  I bought the camera, the case and a 4GB card from amazon, cheaper than anywhere else in town and the items arrived quickly and in great shape.  I love this camera and use it daily though I am still figuring out all of the functions.  It takes crisp, clear shots and is reminiscent to me of my old Nikon N6o, that I loved. If you are looking for a decent, digital SLR, I highly recommend this one.
