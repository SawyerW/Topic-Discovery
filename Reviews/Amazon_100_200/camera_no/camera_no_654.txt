With todays technology I think the camera and speaker and stuff should be alot more clearer.  My couch is brown and was showing up washed out and whitish.  Night vision seemed to work good though.  The color during the day was off and it just wasn't up to my standards.  The demo they have on there website can't be this model and is false advertising.  The built in web page to configure the cam was ok, it was pretty easy for the most part, but was a little buggy with motion detection and some things could have been worded a little differently so it was easier to understand what the option does.  If they can get the software less buggy, and a better cam and speaker and stuff it will be a nice little cam.  Again with todays technology and prices of things they should be able to keep the same price and get a heck of alot better cam installed.
