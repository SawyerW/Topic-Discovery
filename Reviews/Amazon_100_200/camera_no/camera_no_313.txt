I purchased my D80 a few months ago and was initially pleased with the camera.  After buying a Nikon 18-200 VR lens to use with it, I took it to Russia on a mission trip in late July.  I shot 2,000 or so pics with it, and the quality is fantastic!  Initially I was pleased with this camera, now I am thrilled with it.A few days after getting the camera and changing lenses quite often, I noticed dust spots on my shots.  Blowing the dust from the sensor was easy -- I just followed the instructions in the user's manual.  I haven't had a dust problem again, and if I do I know how to fix it.The camera interface is easy to follow.  A person unfamiliar with DSLRs will find the point-and-shoot capacity of the camera comforting. When that same person however wants to venture into manual settings, there is a full range of options available.If you want a streamlined DSLR only, the best value is the D40 or D60.  If you want a full-featured DSLR, then the best value is the D80.  The Nikon quality in this camera simply rocks!
