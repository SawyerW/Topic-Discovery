I bought this thinking that with the li-ion battery and a backup, plus rain-resistant construction, it would be an ideal backpacking camera.  Wrong.  Its glossy, glare-ridden display screen is virtually impossible to use in moderate sunlight--and in Arizona, moderate sunlight is about as good as it gets--all you can see is reflection, even with field-expedient shades.  Battery life is mediocre if you have to use flash for fill or to deal with backlight, and auto exposure control seems incapable of taking decent pictures under high contrast.  Only upside is that it is genuinely rain-resistant.  But it is less capable than my daughter's 5 megapixel Nikon Coolpix, which takes better photos and has the advantage of running forever on 2 easily replaced lithium AA batteries.  This is my first and last Olympus....
