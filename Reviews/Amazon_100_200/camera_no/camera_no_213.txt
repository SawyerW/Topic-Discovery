This is my first digital SLR, though I've been using a Nikon point-and-shoot for several years.  I chose the D80 because it includes a more versitile lense (18-135) than the Canon Rebel XTi (18-55), not because I think Nikon is vastly superior, or Canon's suck.  I just didn't want to have to buy a second lens right away to zoom in.The camera is very easy to use.  I love to take photographs, but am definately still an amateur.  With this camera my photos look great.  I can't wait to see how good they are after I learn how to actually use all of it's features.It is bigger and heavier than my old point-and-shoot Nikon, but that is true of any SLR.  It's a small price to pay for such great photographs.
