This camera is extremely easy to use! It has everything most people need to take good pictures--zoom, landscape mode, portrait mode, close up mode, super close up mode, self timer, tripod mount(I had a Sony that didn't even have a tripod mount). Anyway, so far it has taken great pictures, but if you're going to buy this camera, be sure to also buy some rechargeable batteries. I just put in the batteries that came with it last night, and they were dead by this morning! Rechargeables will probably save a lot of money. This camera is also the perfect size. It's small and light. The only thing that it doesn't have is a viewfinder eyepiece, but that's no big deal to me because it has the viewfinder screen that is clear and sharp. It also doesn't record sound in movie mode, but it's still has everything else and it's a great camera!
