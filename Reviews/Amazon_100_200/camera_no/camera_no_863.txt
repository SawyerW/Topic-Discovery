Just spent 3 weeks on vacation and after 237 pictures, I am still on my 2nd set of AA batteries.  I used the new Ultra Duracell batteries designed for this type of application.  I have been using disposable cameras prior to this purchase, and wanted a digital that was just as easy to use...and this camera is a great choice.  Software is also user friendly, I have not had to refer to the manual yet on sending the images to my computer and setting up slide shows and e-mailing photos.  Very satisfied all around...and there is so much more this camera does...if I ever decide to take advantage of all its features.
