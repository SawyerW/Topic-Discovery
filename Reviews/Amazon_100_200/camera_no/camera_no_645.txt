Color rendition is a problem with this device.  Its camera is overly senstive to the minimal amount of IR light in normal indoor incandescent light bulbs.  The result is certain textures of dark colors like black and brown end up being light purple under ALL light conditions.  For example, I bought this camera to keep an eye on my fawn (brown) boxer dog who looks light PURPLE under all light condtions (ie. with bright lights on in the room or in the dark).  I have not experienced this with at least two other brands of day/night cameras and a number of non IR cameras.  This is a fatal flaw of this camera.I must say that the tech support for the product has been superb.  They have sent me two replacement cameras and have worked with me extensively to arrive at the above conclusion.  I hope that they can change the camera sensitivity, so that under normal light conditions, it does not pick up enough IR light to distort colors as much.
