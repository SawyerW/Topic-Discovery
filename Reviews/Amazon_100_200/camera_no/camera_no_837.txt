I think this is a great camera for the reasons stated by many reviewers.However, after several years of continuous use, the LCD viewer stopped displaying images and, when I took photos, the images did not appear on the memory card.Because I couldn't find anything in the camera manual or on Canon's web site that addressed this problem, I called Canon technical support.  The Canon technical support representative I spoke to told me the problem was a defective image sensor, which he said Canon would replace for free (even though the  camera was way outside the warranty period).  He even said Canon would pay for shipping the camera to their factory service center.I haven't completed this process, but assuming Canon follows through (and I have no reason to think they won't), I thought this was extraordinary customer service -- yet another reason for purchasing this camera.
