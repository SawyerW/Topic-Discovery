These cameras are terrible as they interfere with your wireless internet router. The low light (night vision) is also a joke because you pretty much need external lighting. You can only view one camera at a time. The last reason you should not buy this camera is X10 itself. This company has the worst customer service you could imagine. Before making a purchase just call their customer service; you will be on hold for 45 minutes and they never do the right thing. I even filed a BBB complaint and they simply lied to the better business buereau. Save yourself from this company and it's cheap products.
