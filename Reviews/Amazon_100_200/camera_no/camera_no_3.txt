This book contains just about everything you will need to understand your camera. It is  much better than many other books I have gotten. This is written specifically for the Canon T3 which makes understanding the instructions  much easier. There are pictures of the camera to help explain the text. I got this because I was taking a class that required I use my owner's manual that came with the camera. After the first week I knew I was in trouble because the manual that was included did not have the information I needed. Purchasing this book made all the difference!
