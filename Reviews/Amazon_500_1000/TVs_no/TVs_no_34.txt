Dear Amazon Shoppers,Beware of ordering this Olevia LT30HV 30" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV.My experience was 180 degrees different from the November 4, 2004 review from MIMI'm a very big believer in buying through the Internet.  Unfortunately, after reading that review, I did order the Olevia for my Son's birthday.  The TV arrived defective.  The audio worked just fine, but the video would not work.Olevia packages the TV with a sheet directing you to call their toll free number in case there is a problem.  I called the 800 number and described the problem to them. Olevia's tech support advised that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Olevia offered to send me a new motherboard that would be installed by a local technician, BUT advised it would take 3 days from date of shipment to receive, and since it was now Friday, I would have to call back on Monday since all shipments were already picked up.  Compounding the issue was the fact that I couldn't schedule a tech until the motherboard arrived.Olevia suggested that I contact Amazon.  After an hour of searching Amazon's site, I realized that Amazon does not offer an option to call them.  There's no phone number on their site.  You must submit a form, explain the problem in writing, and request resolution.  I submitted the form and didn't hear back for 3 days.Here's the email response I received:==============================Greetings from Amazon.com.I realize that you have experienced a lot of inconvenience.

They advised via return email that the package would be picked up "usually within a day or two".To Amazon's credit, they did have the TV picked up the next day.I can't begin to describe the inconvenience.  Imagine the time involved in selecting the TV on Amazon's website.  Ordering, waiting at home for the delivery and the return.  Writing countless letters back and forth (I've not yet received any indication that they've credited my credit card for the returned item), and ultimately replacing the TV with a brand name (Panasonic) at a local merchant.Compare that to my experience purchasing the replacement.  The replacement was purchased from a local merchant.  The local merchant gave me a better price for the name brand merchandise than Amazon was charging for the identical unit.  The merchant delivered the set to my home with same day service (I tipped the salesman $100 to drop it off after work).  My son got his birthday present on his Birthday and it worked right out of the box.Bottom line: DON'T BUY this set from Olevia.Amazon is a great company.  But... I think they should have a toll free number for returns of defective merchandise and respond quicker (to be fair, Amazon's response may have been quicker if it hadn't been so close to the Xmas season)I've had very good experiences with Amazon, but I would NEVER buy anything with a critical time line (birthday, Xmas gifts, etc.) from Amazon again.  Perhaps they should stick with books and DVD's.  I would definitely think twice about ordering electronic equipment from them again.
