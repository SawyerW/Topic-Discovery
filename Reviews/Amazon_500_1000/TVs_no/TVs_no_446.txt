I am NOT happy with this purchase. I bought it as my 2 year old LCD started getting a shadow & my father owns a LED which was very nice and 3d like- I don't know if I got a faulty one but on a darker screen it illuminates brighter light of white around the edges of the tv making it annoying to watch any "dark" movie (I don't know if this is broken or just the way it is) also the tv is not 3d like at all, it has a pretty good picture but really no better then my LCD has shown. I was expecting more and like I said may have a faulty one, I plan on calling the company about this light issue, but am angry I have to do that on a new purchase & get worried this may just be a crappy tv. Guess you get what you you pay for. And finding the warranty from Coby, yeah not as easy, I also purchased the square trade 3 year warranty so we will see if this works! Anticipating a lot of headaches!***********UPDATE VERY IMPORTANT TO PAST & FUTURE PURCHASE*********** 5/31/12ok so I returned my old tv as the colby company wanted to repair it and the squaretrade warranty wasnt in effect till a year (arg) I was angry to get a repair on a new tv told amazon & they were awesome & just sent me a new one- now here is the thing- the new tv they sent the so called same replacement they sent was different, this new tv on the back mounting area only had small screw holes for mounting when my original one had these screw plugs then you can put in the screws and the new tv screen was a bit more matte then the original screen- THE NEW ONE IS 110% BETTER in every way!! This new tv picture is so much more crisp and clear then the other one and so far does not have the annoying bright light bleeding around the edges. It does seem to take some time to "warm up" but I do not mind that at all, and I can't comment on the sound other people do because I do have a sound system, but I think I could tolerate the original sound even though it is not that great nor that bad.So my findings show that if you own the 46"led that has the screw plug inserts instead of just a flat mount with screw holes is you got screwed too!!!! It must be an older model and I would return it, the difference is amazing and this is wrong for coby to do I don't get it but we got lucky on getting this other same different tv sent to us. If anything breaks I will update again. Good luck consumers.The fact is this TV is still not all that good- I would never ever buy it again and if I didnt spend so much time on the phone with coby, amazon & the warranty square trade and paid such a small amount for a 46" I would have thrown the damn thing out the window & let my dogs pee on it. spend the extra 100 or so- I am sure it will be worth it in the end, plus I am sure I will be going through the same thing in a few months when something breaks on it.
