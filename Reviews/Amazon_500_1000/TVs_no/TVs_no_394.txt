Let me just say that if you are not getting a good picture on this TV then most probably it has a defective component inside, and you should call Amazon (not LG) customer service to get a replacement. When I got my TV, the picture wasn't so good, and then sometimes, when using Netcast, or connecting my PC, it would start shaking vertically after an hour or so of usage. I tried several adjustments (like turning off Tru motion etc.) but nothing worked.I got a replacement TV soon, and like everyone has already talked about it, it is great!I will just mention about some other things:Amazon Customer Service:=======================I just used the "call me" feature, and I got the call the instant I clicked on that button. The customer service agent (probably in India) was very friendly and just asked me what was wrong with the TV etc, and arranged for a replacement right away. Overall, Amazon's customer service for getting a replacement TV went swimmingly.Netcast:==========There seems to be some confusion about what this feature has. Currently, this feature includes1. Yahoo widets - weather, sports, finance etc.2. Netflix - works great, even HD streaming. It can only access your instant queue.3. Vudu - didn't try it, rentals seem expensive.4. Youtube - don't use this much either.5. Picasa - you can watch random public images or even sign in to your picasa account and play slideshows etcThere is no Pandora, Skype etc.Connecting a PC through HDMI:==============================I have my desktop connected to this via HDMI and use the TV sometimes as an extended display. The display is very good. I don't see any pixels etc, e.g., when a PDF file is open - it's good for couch reading. I even use to watch my Windows Media Center stuff, or Skype video through my PC on this TV.Shipping-  PILOT Vs CEVA:==========================My first (bum) TV was shipped by Pilot. There was only one delivery man who struggled to carry the whole box inside. While assembling the TV etc he acted as if he was doing a favor to me. Didn't even have tools for the job. Though, later I found that the carrier is supposed to setup the TV for you, and also power it up to see the menu screen and check for any visible cracks.My replacement TV came via CEVA. And the service was awesome!! and very professional. Two people team lifted the TV and were very careful with its handling. Also, they told me upfront what they will do and what not (for e.g., they will not help you set up your cable connection etc). Overall, I was much impressed by CEVA's service.Both the carriers did call me in advance to let me know of a delivery time, and also an hour before actual delivery.Other features I like:==========================1. I like the "My Media" feature. It connects to your PC through the same LAN cable you have installed to use Netcast. You have to install the server software (included) on your PC. You can access your videos, music and pictures stored on your PC right on TV.2. Intellisensor is good. I like its adjustments based on the ambient conditions.3. Remote is easy to use.
