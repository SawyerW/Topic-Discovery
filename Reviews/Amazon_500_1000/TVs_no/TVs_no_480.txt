Before buying a TV, I did a bunch of research (literally hours), since it's a fairly big expense that will, hopefully, last a long time. I replaced a still-working LC-42SB45U 42" 1080p 1920 x 1080 2000:1 LCD TV so wanted a set that was larger and 55" seemed like a good size. I don't think I would want a bigger one at this point. One of my main reasons for buying a new TV was to get 3D. Since passive or natural 3D has lighter, cheaper glasses and less crosstalk and ghosting, I decided it was a must. Finally, because of the location of the windows and lights in my home, I wanted a TV with a matte screen. Most LED-LCD sets have glossy screens. I could only find two sets that met all three of my requirements, this one and the LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses.I initially opted for the LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses, however it only lasted a few hours before it stopped working. I wanted to simply have that one replaced, but it was permanently out of stock from Amazon.com itself. I toyed with the idea of buying from another seller, but a couple of things bothered me: LG's customer service was terrible and the screen on the LG, while matte, had an annoying rainbow reflection (I added a picture to that listing to illustrate this; the Toshiba does this, too, but to a less extent). So, I decided to buy the Toshiba 55TL515U 55-inch Natural 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Net TV, Black. I had read a couple of reviews from reputable sites which claimed that this Toshiba is good, but the LG is better overall. So, I prepared to console myself regarding the areas where this one didn't quite measure up to the LG. However, I was shocked at how much better the Toshiba 55TL515U is compared to the LG Infinia 55LW5600. I was surprised at how wrong those reviews got it. I was grateful that the LG broke right away, and that I chose to get this Toshiba to replace it.Toshiba 55TL515U versus the LG Infinia 55TL5600:* Toshiba has much better picture quality (color, deepness of black levels, contrast, clarity, and evenness of backlighting)* Toshiba has better aesthetics (TV is very thin, frame finish is nice, chrome accents are attractive, base of pedestal is glass)* Toshiba screen has less reflection/glare* Toshiba AutoView picture mode is much better than LG's default picture mode (LG's Intelligent Sensor dimmed the display too much when the room was dark)* Toshiba has built-in Wi-Fi (the LG has an included USB Wi-Fi dongle)* LG has a swivel pedestal* LG has more apps (apps on the Toshiba are okay, but there aren't as many)Because I have an Onkyo HT-S3400 5.1-Channel Home Theater System (mine is actually the HT-S3300), I have no reason to use the TV's sound so cannot comment on it, though other reviews mention that it's less than ideal. I have not yet used full 3D since I haven't connected a 3D Blu-ray player, but the 2D-to-3D conversion adds a nice amount of depth to the picture. I will say that the slow start-up time is annoying and is the primary reason I didn't give this TV 5 stars. Still, even though it doesn't fully power on quickly, it's so nice that the wait is worth it.
