Simple and intuitive, the nifty magic remote is a breeze to use especially when fully reclined or lying down. Only con is the buttons should be raised a bit to make them more tactile when operating, especially in the dark. I wish I could sync it to my cable box and "the Guide" and use it as a 2nd remote for channel selection.I was initially unable to connect wirelessly to my router, but after disconnecting then reconnecting power to the router it was then reset and able to "see" the tv (thanks LG support). Streaming was slow with buffering due to my 3 mbps DSL connection and knew that would be a problem at purchase. I'll be ordering Fios soon. Nice to have a web browser and built-in wifi at this price point. Other mfgs (like Pany) will force you to move up in models (3D) to get it.The firmware installed on my set at purchase didn't include Trumotion options in the settings menu. Trumotion was essentially off with my tv for a month until I got firmware version 03.21.40 via auto update in the middle of a Person of Interest episode. All of a sudden the dreaded "soap opera effect" comes alive and Jim Caviezel is auditioning for General Hospital. He'd be bankable in soaps but he's much more compelling at 24 fps; and oh that voice! Solution was simple: go to the Picture Options menu and turn Trumotion off, again. I honestly didn't miss it. I watch a lot of sports and have yet to see any motion issues with Trumotion turned off (it's there if I need it).LG's onboard Picture Wizard II does a nice job with basic calibration. Deep dark blacks, bright whites, vibrant accurate color, and excellent shadow detail. I may recalibrate with Disney's WOW disc but don't feel the need to at this time. Energy saving is turned off. Sound is optimized and pretty good. This set really delivers an astonishing hi def picture. No complaints here. It's so good that any vision acuity problems you may have, however small, become readily apparent with this tv. I need a new prescription!___________________________________________________________________________UPDATE: Software version 04.02.85 arrived on 7/25/12 with long awaited features. The MLB.TV app is now enabled and functional where it wasn't before. The Skype app is new along with keyboard & mouse support. The Magic Remote has become universal and I am now able to sync it to my Time Warner cable box. Only quirk is that once your channel selection is highlighted, a single click will not select it, it takes a double click or two quick presses of the select button (wheel button). Not a con, just a quirk.For people needing the latest Flash update, well, it didn't come with this version. Opening a Flash Player test page site in LG's web browser (Amazon won't allow links to external URLs) revealed it's running version 10.1.105.From LG's website: "2012 Smart TV Browser Supported Pages - There is not a list of compatible websites accessible by the TV, however, it should be able to display all websites that are not built with Flash 12 or above."That said,  LG owes us Flash Player 11 (Flash Player 12 has yet to be released). With the sites I've visited so far Flash hasn't been a problem for me.......yet. At least there's a PC connectivity option. YMMV. Keep in mind only the web browser has this limitation; dedicated apps work fine.
