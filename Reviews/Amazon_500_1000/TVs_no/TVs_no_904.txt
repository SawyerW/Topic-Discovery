UPDATE -- PLEASE READ -- : I previously said to name the input "PC DVI" but now I realized it's better to name it "PC". If you name it "PC DVI" then audio can't be passed via HDMI. I apologize for the confusion, and thank you to the commenter who made me aware of this. I've updated the review with this new info.```````````````````````````````````````````````Quick note to everyone giving this monitor/tv combo bad ratings due to the PC HDMI quality:The PC HDMI quality is perfect, but you have to make a quick change to get the optimal settings. If you don't do this, the resolution and size of the screen won't set properly and fonts will be blurry.Step 1: Plug the HDMI from the PC to HDMI port 1 of the monitor.Step 2: Press "source" on the remote.Step 3: Press "tools" on the remote, and change the name of the HDMI Input 1 to "PC"It would be nice if the monitor could auto-detect and configure itself, but the process takes less than a minute, so it's not a very big deal. Changing the name of the input configures the monitor to the optimal settings of a PC digital connection.`````````````````````````````````````````````I'm a college student and needed a very specific type of monitor. I needed a monitor to plug my laptop and PS3 into, as well as the cable TV in the dorm. This monitor also had to be fairly small in order to fit into the small dorm, be affordable, and have decent picture quality for movies and games. This product hits all my specifications right on the head and far surpassed my expectations with it's abundance of connections and phenomenal 1080P picture quality.=========The Good=========This monitor is awesome for the price. You get a great 5 million to 1 contrast ratio with a high quality LED screen. Movies and games look great on this screen. I have my PS3 and laptop hooked up to it and it works flawlessly. Perhaps the biggest selling point of this monitor, however, is the plethora of connections: 2 HDMI, VGA, D-sub, 3.5mm Headphone jack, optical audio out, Audio IN, Component (via included adapter), USB, and RF cable TV input! Unlike my reflective laptop screen, I haven't seen any glare or reflections in my monitor thanks to the bright, vivid LED screen.Also, the remote on the monitor is fantastic, responsive, and easy to use - it's very similar to the remote that came with my parents' Samsung Bluray player. Very few monitors come with a remote, much less such a good one. You may be thinking that having a remote is pointless (that's what I thought at first), but since this monitor has speakers and a TV tuner, a remote really helps! Let the laziness commence!=========The Bad=========There's no DVI cable input which is really the only other important connection this monitor lacks. However, this can be compensated with a little DVI to HDMI adapter you can buy for under $10 here on Amazon. The monitor has a 5ms response time which is fine, but for playing games, 2ms would have been nicer.EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: Originally I thought the audio couldn't be passed from computer to the monitor via HDMI, but this is because I named the input "PC DVI" instead of "PC". If you name the input "PC" then you can set the sound options on your computer (on Windows, right click the speaker sound icon on the bottom right and select playback devices). Sorry for the confusion.=========The... lolwhat?=========As with all TN panels, horizontal viewing angles are good, but the screen images distort when you view from different vertical angles. Luckily, Samsung threw in a random "Magic Angle" feature to fix this by putting in two modes that allows the screen to adjust if you're watching from a point above the screen or a point below the screen. It's still not as good a looking directly, head-on, but it definitely helps.The built in speakers aren't really that great; they aren't bad, but they're far from surround sound speakers. They can get surprisingly loud on max volume. Luckily, there's plenty of ways to output the volume to surround sound, or in my case a little 2.1 $50 sound system. We're lucky that this monitor even has speakers as most monitors don't.Also, I don't understand what other reviewers are saying about the picture in picture mode. You can use it easily to display TV in a small box in any corner of the screen. You can either be on one TV channel with a small TV show in the corner, or even use the monitor with your PC connected and watch a TV show in the corner. You can chose which corner, which channel, and whether to make the picture in picture small or large.=============Bottom Line: This monitor is serving me really well for the purpose I'm using it. 21.5 inches may be too small for a primary living room TV, but it's perfect for a dorm and possibly an office or work desk. For this price, there are really no other companies that offer this many connections and a TV tuner in a computer monitor. I recommend that you examine what you're looking for in a TV / monitor before buying this as it caters to a very small crowd. If you just want a good computer monitor, you can get something cheaper with a better response time. If you're looking for a TV, you probably want something bigger. Or, if you're like me and need something that's reasonably large for movie watching (when alone or with small groups), fits on a desk, and is capable of doubling as a TV and monitor, look no further.
