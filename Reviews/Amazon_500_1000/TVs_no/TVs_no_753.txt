Last fall, I purchased the precursor to this model, the PN58C8000 Plasma TV.  I loved the TV, but it had developed a burn in problem outside the 4:3 box.  The left and right margins of the screen were darker than the middle of the screen.  It was mild at first, but got progressively worse, to the point where it was noticeable and annoying.I called Pauls TV, where I had purchased it, and they told me it was slightly outside the one-year warranty period.  They gave me Samsung's number and I was told that they sometimes honor the warranty after expiration, depending on the problem and how far out of warranty the item is.I called Samsung fully expecting to pay for a service call.  Instead, they suggested the service call might still be free, even though the warranty had expired.  They asked me to send a copy of the receipt, which I did.  The next day, I got a call from Nisi, an authorized repair service, and they sent someone to my house free of charge soon after.The repairman showed me an option in the setup menu that can alleviate burn in problems.  It continuously sweeps a white bar across the screen.  He said to run it overnight and see if it helped.  After running it overnight two days in a row, the problem remained.I called Nisi back.  They indicated that they would need to order a new plasma panel, and that it would take as long as two weeks.  The next week they called to schedule a repair appt the following Monday.  The Friday before the appt. they called to cancel the appt.  Apparently, the panel was backordered and would take longer to deliver than they thought.  Because of the delay, they said Samsung would give me the option of a replacement TV!I called Samsung, and after some navigation through their call center system, I got the "executive" support group on the line.  They confirmed that they would issue a replacement through Paul's TV.  They give Paul's TV a credit equivalent to what I paid originally, and Paul's TV then provides as close a replacement as the credit allows.  In my case, it covered an upgrade to the PN59D8000.It took some back and forth to actually make this happen, but on Monday Paul's TV arrived at my house and swapped my PN58C8000 for a new PN59D8000, straight from the box!  This far exceeded my expectations and Samsung went over and above in my opinion.Suffice to say, Samsung has earned my loyalty. It will be my first choice of brand for a long time.*****************************All that said, the PN59D8000 is a terrific HDTV.  I love the PN58C7000, and the newer model is even better.Of course, the larger screen is a big bonus, but the best part is the improvement in the 3D technology.  With the older model, I rarely used the 3D because it had too much of a tendency to cut in and out.  It became more of a distraction than an enhancement.  With the newer model, I've found the 3D to work flawlessly so far. Now I need to go get another pair of glasses so our four person family can all watch at the same time.Another nice feature is the addition of a built in browser and the enhancement of the net applications.  Having a remote with a QWERTY keyboard make this an even more usable feature.The picture is just as nice as the older model, and maybe a bit better.  When I switch to the "Dynamic" picture mode, I can watch it in broad daylight with no problem. And it happens to be in a pretty sunny room.  The blacks are inky and the colors are vibrant.  Watching football games on this beast is a blast.  The picture is big and there is no hint of delays or artifacts. The players jump off the screen.I have no problems with buzzing.  This unit does run a little warmer than the last one, but the room tends to be chillier than other part of the house, so I don't mind.I can't comment on the sound, as we run that through an Onkyo TX-NR709 (excellent!) and surround speakers.When I purchased the original TV, I compared the Panny and Samsung models side by side, with a variety of source material. I found them to be pretty close, but I actually preferred the Samsung.*****************************A note about screen burn-in: If you read carefully, the manual warns against watching 4:3 content in a 16:9 picture size for long periods of time as that will lead to potential screen burn in.  I don't think that was the problem with my original unit, as I had hints of the problem right from the first day I plugged it in (I didn't find the problem sufficiently pronounced to return the TV at the time).  However, the default picture size is 16:9 and I began to notice that my kids don't bother tuning to the HD channels, resulting in letterboxing.  I imagine this exacerbated the problem.  I've since taught them to either watch HD or switch the picture size from "4:3" (which I believe was called "Wide Screen" on the PN58C8000).Knowing what I know now, I'd recommend anyone with kids (or a non-technically inclined spouse) to watch out for the same problem.
