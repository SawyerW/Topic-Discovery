Folks my review title says all you need to know about the Samsung PN58C8000 58-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV (Black). I bought mine 3 months ago from Amazon & have been extremely satisfied with the deep blacks, accurate colors & incredible detail from this HDTV. The 3-D has been an unexpected, welcome surprise as well.Like many of you I researched & researched & researched to find the best HDTV that fit my budget. We're remodeling our game room & wanted to move our 46" Sony XBR LCD in there. Since we were very happy with the performance of the Sony my bias was to buy another top notch LCD, only this time go with LED backlighting. Fortunately I took my time making up my mind.I really wanted to stay with Sony, but they seemed to drop the ball with LED. The XBR-8 was great but no longer in production. Their follow-up LED based models weren't as good & they were much more expensive. I looked seriously at Sony, Samsung, LG & Vizio but each had one or more things that kept me from taking the plunge. I just couldn't justify spending major $$$ & accepting one or more flaws. I was somewhat of an early adopter with my Sony XBR, but here in 2010 I expected HDTV's to be clearly superior & more reasonably priced.Yet the reviews by consumers & the pro's seemed to show that even though LCD's had come a long way, they still were far from perfect. Even models costing over $3,000 had flaws I couldn't look past for a TV that should be in my living room for 10+ years.Rather than continuing to pound square pegs into round holes I expanded my parameters. One thing that my favorite product review site [you know it - the round red ball with the name that sounds like sea net] noted time & time again in reviews of LCD's was that plasma HDTV's generally produce deeper blacks, making it easier to get better contrast & better color reproduction. And plasma's pictures are the same from all viewing angles.So I started researching plasmas. I finally narrowed it down to the Panasonic TC-P58VT25 58-inch 3D Ready 1080p VIERA Plasma HDTV & the Samsung PN58C8000 58-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV (Black).The Panasonic had issues with black-level loss with 2009 models [that is now showing up in the 2010's], so that gave me pause. Also the price point was so much higher for Panasonic TC-P58VT25. Although Sea Net had not yet reviewed the Smasung PN58C8000, they had reviewed the PN58C7000 & gave it very high marks.Right about that time Amazon had great pricing on the Samsung & they offered a free Samsung 3D Starter Kit SSG-P2100T & a free Samsung BD-C6900 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with a purchase of a Samsung 3-D HDTV. I decided to take the plunge.Amazon's White Glove delivery service was fast & flawless. Once I got the TV set up I used Sea Net's calibration settings for the Samsung PN58C7000 [the PN58C8000 still wasn't reviewed there yet]. The picture was stunning. HD programming was fantastic, SD programming was great & Blu-Ray movies were outstanding.An unexpected benefit was how awesome 3-D programming is. I never factored in 3-D since it's so new so I had very low expectations. All I can say is WOW! Lucky for me it turns out that plasma's outperform LCD's in 3-D capability.When Sea Net reviewed the Samsung PN58C8000 earlier this month I changed my picture settings to the calibration settings from the review for the PN58C8000. WOW!! I thought my picture was excellent before. It's even better now.I am extremely happy with my purchase. Thank you Amazon & Samsung!:-)
