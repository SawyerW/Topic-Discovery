I really did a lot of research before I made this purchase. But nothing beats actually seeing the sets in a side-by-side comparison. There was good, better, and best. The Sony is the latter. To me the 46xbr4 was so much bigger at home than in the store, seeing the 50-60+ inch sets make it seem a little small, it's not. From the outer edge of the bezel horizontally it measures almost 50 inches. It's quite hefty too, weighing in at 84lbs. or 71lbs. without the base. Just something to consider; you will need two people to hang this on the wall. Also if you go that route shoot for a tilting wall mount so you can get the perfect angle from your viewing position.Connections in the back are well placed and labeled, I personally would have liked all three of the HDMI connections to be on the back, (there is one on the side). I ran all of these cables through the wall, why plug something into the side? Maybe a camcorder...The good part is that the picture is beautiful. A nice matte finish that reflects zero light. I have a HD-DVR from Directv pluged into the HDMI. The images from the 50 or so HD channels I get is stunning, the detail and reality is second to none. No other LCD on the market will match this set. I'm rewatching my DVD's on a 1080p upscaling 400v Pioneer player. Why go to the movies? Video games are cool, but I feel a little guilty playing Xbox live, I can see and kill people from far greater distances now than on the old set.I've been watching this set for three weeks now and here are some of my observations.1) This TV will display what it is given, if there is distortion in the signal the TV will display it. I had a green line down the middle of the screen and panicked I thought the TV was a dud, it was in the SD signal. I put it in Picture-in-Picture and there was the line resized. I also recorded the effect with the DVR.2) Thanksgivings day - Cowboy's game is on and I see two bright white pixels on a close up of the Cowboy's coach, again panic... different camera the pixels come back, close up of coach, dead pixels.. It was the broadcast camera.3) The only issue with my set has been within the first two minutes of it being on I get the flashlight effect in the bottom left corner, mine goes away once the set has been on for at least two minutes - I'll live with it.The 46xbr4 has a ton of settings, I think I've got it set just right.
