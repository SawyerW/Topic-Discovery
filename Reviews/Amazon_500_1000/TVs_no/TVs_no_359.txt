I like this TV which has all the conceivable features and rich in technology.Samsung is offering a Bluray player and Shrek 3D Started Kit with every eligible purchase of 3D TV.The Bluray player  is also having features similar to this TV set like Internet applications and rich Technology stuff.So when you buy make sure your purchase includes this deal of Free Bluray Player and 3D Starter Kit.The Controls for the TV are all touch sensitive.The TV switches on and off with a cute chime.An interesting feature of these LED tv from Samsung is that you can use your high end Samsung phones like the Samsung Galaxy I9000/Vibrant as a remote for these TV via Pairing through a free application downloaded on your mobile from Samsung App store caled "QUERTY Remocon".The 3D Bluray content is outstanding and lifelike.Was watching Shrek movie and loved it.The 2D->3D Upscaled regular Tv content is not so exciting as a 3D Rendered Shrek movie.Some channels like CNN when watched in 3D will show up with the scroll popping out of the screen.The disadvantages of this item are:1.The back panel needs adapters to connect to all your inputs like Cable,Ethernet,PC etc.All these adapters are provided along with the TV in the box.There are also some plastic pieces provided to keep wires from getting tangled.2.Only one AVI input(Yellow, Red & White) option available.I have 2 devices that connect to the TV by the three way AVI cable which are the Ninetendo Wii & my DishTV set top box.Now i can connect only 1 of these at a moment.There is way to overcome this problem by purchasing "AV Audio Video RCA 3 Way Switch Switcher Splitter+Cable" on Amazon which will allow you to add 3 devices to your Samsung TV AVI input.You wonder why Samsung which has thought big tech like enabling this TV for Internet applications did not think of this single AVI input it was providing.Very strange.3.The TV remote is extremely glossy and silvery and there should have been a TV remote cover provided to keep the remote from getting damaged.Since it is not provided, i now have to go out to the market and shop for one.4.The entire TV unit easily takes up fingerprints.So if you actually touch the Screen or the border, you have to wipe your fingerprints off, or your TV will look smudgy.They actually provided cleaning cloth for the purpose.5.A High end TV like this should have been border-less with edge to edge screen.But it is not the case here with this TV.6.The 3D feature is great if you are watching a 3D Bluray movie.It is not great if you are watching 2d-->3d up tuned cable tv.The disadvantage of the 3d feature is that you cannot watch the Tv for long with the glasses on as it causes side effects like nausea, giddness and headache.7.No inbuilt Wifi facility and need to have a stick in the event that you do not want to plug in the Ethernet cable into the adapter that plugs into a socket on the back of the TV.The WIFI stub is an additional 50 US$.8.The contrast ratio of the 7000 Series LED 3D TV is 1:6000000 while the one for the 8000 Series 3D LED TV is 1:8000000.Strangely the contrast ratio for the Non3D3 6000 Series LED TV is 1:7000000.Precision dimming is the only advantage the 8000 Series has over the 7000 series.
