*************UPDATE 1/5/12*****************SW Version pre firmware update: V8-0RSC801-LF1V041SW Version post firmware update: V8-0RSC801-LF1V041After performing firmware update today the SW Version did not change (as listed in Menu>Setup>System Information)*************REVIEW 1/4/12*****************Before Christmas I woke up to an Amazon gold box deal for this TV for $260. My stomach tensed with excitement that I may be able to actually afford my first LCD TV. After an hour of model/brand research I clicked back to Amazon to purchase and it was sold out. Damn me and my lack of impulsiveness. On Christmas day, however, when this TV was back in stock and listed for $300 I decided not to pass on this again, even at $40 more, and ordered TV 12/25/11.TV arrived 12/28/11, setup was extremely easy: 4 screws in glass base, cable/sat channel scan (took about 8 minutes for scan), plug Xbox in via hdmi and cable in via coax and BOOM, up and running with my first HDTV. My jaw dropped when I tuned to the HD weather channel! Let me say again this is my first hdtv so I have no means of comparison but to a standard def Sanyo CRT, so I am no connoisseur, but 7 days later I am still in awe. Put in Enslaved Xbox 360 game and an audible "Whoooa!" was my first reaction to seeing a game in 1080p.Read the instruction manual cover to cover, tweaking settings as best I could, turning off the auto lighting and backlight functions, setting up a Personal picture setting to go along with the preset modes, adding 10 channels to the 'favorites' button on the remote. The remote is decent, but I do have a difficult time finding the circular +/- channel and +/- volume buttons in the dark as there are 2 circular buttons above the + volume + channel that, although slightly smaller, don't 'feel' much different. The 8-watt speakers work well for me as my living room is small and I'm only 11 feet from the TV. That said, I plan on buying Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602) 2.1 speakers to connect to the R/L audio out next month to enhance sound.My current concern is 'to update firmware or not to update firmware?'. Right now I have not updated, although I did go ahead and put the update on a FAT formatted flash drive. Do I update and risk the TV going black as some have stated in these reviews and requiring a return to Amazon, or do I just leave well enough alone since I have no problems with the TV auto-powering on or changing volume? Other reviews indicate successful firmware update. I am so torn, but if i'm going to try it I need to do it within the 30 day return window. Gah! I will update with result if I get brave and try it.The scariest thing about this TV is the reviews i've read about the TLC customer service nightmares. I have decided that on day 29 of my Amazon purchase I will definitely be buying a 3 year warranty from Square Trade for peace of mind.Pros:-Best deal on hdtv I found-Beautiful HD picture-Tons of inputs including 3xHDMI-Input Skip to hide inputs you don't use, Channel Skip to hide unwanted channels (you heard me home shopping channels)-Setup menu is extremely easy to use-Glass stand is sturdy and attractive (subjective of course)-Silver strip accent goes well with my black and silver entertainment center (subjective)-I can walk almost all the way to the side of the Tv and still see the image clearly-Samsung LCD panel-remote makes it extremely easy to adjust aspect ratio and access 10 favorite channels and just feels good on button pressCons:-Firmware update hassle-No optical audio out-Possible sketchy TLC customer service/warranty-Subpar remote design on the +/- channel & volume in my opinion (still make mistakes with those in the dark d/t similar feeling buttons above)-SD channels look very 'blah'-Light bleed in top left/right corners when screen is solid black; NOT noticeable at all when image on screen-I have to switch between picture settings (Eco/Sports/Cinematic/Vibrant/Natural/Personal) often for tv shows/sports/movies/xbox games. Being that this is my first hdtv maybe this is normal, although I still haven't found a great setting for very dark movies after trying to adjust Personal picture mode for this purpose.-With my PS2 plugged in via RCA, each time I make a selection on a DVD (play, skip forward, etc) there is an annoying 'pop' sound from the speakers. This does not occur on xbox via hdmi.-If you turn off an input and take too long to decide what you want to do/watch next, the TV will power off after a few minutes (it does warn you first). This could just as easily go in the Pro's category for some.TLDR: Love the TV, love the price, nervous about TLC warranty/customer svc, nervous about doing firmware update. Would definitely recommend this to friends with the stipulation that they purchase a Square Trade warranty.
