I've gone through quite the adventure over the last 5 months with purchasing my new TV. I thought it would be helpful to others if I shared. Long story short, I've gone through the UN55B6000, PN58B860, UN55C7000 and PN58C7000 and PN58C8000.We moved into a new apartment, and needed a new tv to go over our fire place. We were upgrading from a 5 year old Samsung 720p DLP TV.--UN55B6000--Loved the form factor of the TV. Got it home and after a few days I was just unhappy with the overall look of the LCD/LED. I really saw a lot of motion blur.--PN58B860--I returned the LED TV and went with this TV. I absolutely LOVED the picture quality of the TV. But it buzzed terribly. It sounded like a bug zapper. I could actually hear it over top of the regular tv volume at a 12 ft distance. Best Buy swapped it out for another one. The second PN58B860 buzzed even louder. I gave it about 3 weeks to see if it would get better but it didn't. So I returned it and waited for the 2010 models to come out.--UN55C7000--When I heard that the new 2010 models were out, I went down to my friendly Best Buy to hopefully pick up the new plasma. Unfortunately, they only had the new LED in. The sales person told me that all of the issues were fixed on this set that I was unhappy with previously with the UN55B6000. He convinced me to give it a try and that if I were unhappy with it that they would gladly take it back. Sure there was still lighting in the corners and some motion blur, but it was much better. I still wasn't sold on this set, as I LOVED the PQ on the plasma. I decided to go with the plasma and return this set.--PN58C7000--Awesome picture quality - however, it's stuck in the soap opera mode and can't be taken out. To me and everybody I know, it looks like a soap opera in fast forward. I can't stand to watch the tv in this mode. It's very odd to me that it's this way, as only the 8000 is supposed to have MJC, so why does the 7000 have it but not have a way to take it off? I found a work around that allows the user to turn the game mode on/off that then caused the MJC to turn off. As a result of this, I returned it to Crutchfield and upgraded to the 8000 series. By the way, can somebody explain to me who would want to buy the 7000 series plasma and be stuck with having MJC on? I just can't figure it out!--PN58C8000--I LOVE this TV. Seriously, it's amazing. I like the dark grey bezel better than the black of the 7000 series. Something about it looks more gadgety/elegant. This TV makes a sound when it's on. I can hear it 12+ feet away when sitting right in front of it. It's definitely not a buzz like the PN58B860 that I had before. It sounds more like a fan running. When the volume is at a regular volume I don't notice it at all. When you engage the 3D mode, it gets MUCH louder though. Still hardly notice it. In comparison to the Xbox 360 fan noise, it's much quieter.
