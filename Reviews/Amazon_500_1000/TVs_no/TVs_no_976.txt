One year later update 12.27.2012:Not a single, utter problem out of the unit a year later.  It was worth the investment.  Does it handle fast action, like football, spot on with no distortion? No--its an LCD, so that is to be expected.  But does it handle it outstandingly for the price I paid?  You bet.________________________I had initially decided to wait another year to buy my first HDTV to replace a conventional 32-inch Sanyo bulb set (which stills works fine, I was just ready to move up to flat screen HDTV).  I had even settled in on getting a plasma, probably an LG.  Then I saw this 40-inch TCL on sale as a special Holiday Deal ($259).  I was impressed by the features and the low price.  I ordered it that Thursday morning.  There is still a warm place in my heart for a good plasma, but the price here swayed me.Amazon shipped it so fast that they tried to deliver it two days later on a Saturday.  And that was the free shipping method!The TV came out of the box in good order.  Installation was pretty easy, as I am just using the stand.  And the base is a thick piece of glass, so very nice touch there.I have seen some well written reviews here advising of defective units out of the box, and some reviews from people who, well, let's be honest here, did not sound like they could turn on a toaster without some assistance.  Defective units do happen--read reviews on any product, especially TV's, and you will see more than a couple of valid cases.  I had my concerns.  But, I've had it hooked up for two days now, and have to say I am truly amazed at the picture quality for the price of the unit.  After tweaking the picture settings I can say that I have not seen as good as an image on some more expensive, non-LCD sets.  I really have to wonder if owners of the name brand LED sets don't bother to adjust the factory settings much.  Now, I am aware that if you put this TV next to a good Sony that you would be able to see the difference in picture quality.  But it won't set you back the $ that a good Sony LED or even LCD will.On the sound quality, with just about any flat screen TV, don't expect much out of the speakers.  You should plan on having a surround sound system or home stereo hooked up to the unit, or else the beauty of 40-inch HDTV will be marred by flat sound (though it does have an equalizer that can & should be adjusted to make the most out of the on-board speakers).So, after a few days of use, I am floored by the quality relative to the low price of the unit.  And I am comforted by Amazon's 30 day TV return shipping policy and also by TCL's Two Year warranty.  Hopefully I will not need either service.This 40-inch TCL is a great HDTV picture on a budget.
