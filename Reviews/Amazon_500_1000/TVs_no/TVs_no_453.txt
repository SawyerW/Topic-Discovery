EDIT 3/9/14 (these settings are working nicer for me.  Updated TV to 4 stars...will see if this can be a 5 star TV once these firmware issues get sorted out :)  I am very optimistic about this TV.#1 (use "Standard" picture with "Normal" color, this seems to be the most calibrated to my eye)#2 ( try this)Backlight: 85Brightness: 52Contrast: 78Color: 48Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Color Temp: NormalRed Gain: 488Green Gain: 460Blue Gain: 381Red Gain: 517Green Gain: 510Blue Gain: 515=========================EDIT 3/8/14E550i-b2 V 1.16.47.0758  Amazon app works (my firmware)E550i-b2 V 1.16.55.0803 Amazon app reportedly worksE550i-b2 V 1.25.24.0234 Amazon app reportedly is not functioningAs of now, you just get the firmware that your TV has pre-installed...there does not seem to be a way to upgrade or roll back your firmware...yetAgain, I'll update review once these kinks are worked out, but it seems that a lot of problems w/ this set could be targeted to firmware issues.  This includes the varying differences in menu options and picture settings.======================================I'm awaiting a detailed review from CNET at the moment and will update my review when that happens.  Should occur around April 2014.  CNET typically posts EXCELLENT calibrated settings which include colors/contrast/tint etc.Out of the box, I'm impressed with the style and design.  This thing is extremely light as well.The active LED dimming zones seem to produce a very uniform picture.  I really like the black levels here.The set seems to have a split personality, as calibrated by Vizio.  I either see an incredibly beautiful image, or an extremely mediocre one.  Any scene heavily dominated by lush reds, blues, and purples, looks strange.  Something my wife, who is NOT a videophile, even pointed out on her own.  It's, obviously, far worse on upscaled SD content.  This shouldn't be an issue some say, but when you stream Hulu/Netflix, think about how many times your content scaled DOWN to SD due to your internet connection.What the default features share, however, is an extremely high setting of Contrast and sharpness.  At the expense of color accuracy, this set will produce a sharp image with bright and washed out colors.  Some may say this produces a "clayface" like effect.The "Calibrated-Dark" and "Calibrated" setting is possibly the most reasonable when it comes to color...but even these ask for a high amount of Contrast.Outside of the picture quality (which is what's most important IMO)  this set features great apps to use natively, if you don't already have a console you use to watch them with.  The remote and menu system is also very snappy and responsive.  I had no issues getting the TV up and running, and also connected to the internet.The TV must be so easy to set up, it doesn't even come with a full manual.  You have to go onto the internet to find it.When you read the actual manual, you will find out that the features on this set differ significantly from what is listed...which is very strange.Again, I'll update my review if we can get a decent calibration setting.  As it stands now...I'd say hold on to your receipt and see if you like it before keeping it.  This set has the potential to be very very good.
