I purchased this TV in December 2010 after doing quite a bit of research on the 46" TV offerings at that time.The form factor of the TV itself is very nice, it is a good looking set and mounts easily to a wall or on top of an entertainment cabinet.The potential to be a great TV exists, however Samsung dropped the ball on their hardware.  I've had to completely reset all settings on the TV twice now due to HDMI problems with the main board.  This seems to be somewhat common from what I've read online, this is also where I found out how to reset the TV to fix the problems.For the first year of it's life the TV was hooked up to my router through a network cable and there were no network connectivity problems, in the house I'm in now the unit resides approximately 8 feet away from the wireless (G/N) router and now we have issues.  Once the Samsung wireless USB adapter connects it streams things like Netflix, Hulu, and even local TVersity media servers okay, however the TV requires more than a couple/few minutes to load up before the Wireless connection works, this I find unacceptable as you should not even be able to access the @InternetTV applications without a network connection.  Whenever I want to watch something streaming online or on my local network media share I have to consciously turn the TV on a few minutes before I want to actually browse to the movie/show/music so by the time the WiFi is connected, the fact that my wireless USB headphones for my computer work within seconds of plugging in my USB receiver for it leads me to believe that Samsung cheaped out on their USB WiFi adapter or the hardware that handles the USB peripherals.On the Internet TV subject, Samsung decides to arbitrarily install web apps for you seemingly at their own will, which really stinks since I've programmed my Logitech Harmony remote to perform certain steps to start up things like Netflix, Skype, etc.  So when Samsung installs these new apps it also feels compelled to re-arrange my internet app icons, thus messing with my Harmony remote macros requiring remote re-programming.  This is awful on many levels, first of all they install apps for no reason, second of all they don't give you control over placement of the app icons within the Internet Apps menu.The BIG issue I've had (that I've considered contacting Samsung about) is the HDMI problems.  Something happens where all of my HDMI components (stereo, XBOX 360, Zune HD, etc.) stop interacting with the TV, unplugging and plugging back in has no effect, it causes all HDMI components to fail, and as a result I have to do a hard reset of the TV (which means all of my menu customization is gone.)  This along with the poor Wireless USB adapter performance and awful internet app functionality is why I'm giving this 3 stars.Don't get me wrong, as long as the HDMI problem doesn't rear it's ugly head again I'm content with this TV, the picture quality is great, the technical capabilities (when working) are all that I could ask for, and quite frankly with the poor WiFi connectivity I don't even use my Harmony remote macros due to the lag in even being able to access the Internet functionality.If I were able to sell it and not lose too much money I probably would, but based on what I paid for it and the fact that I can install new internet apps and use Skype etc. it will work just fine.If you are looking for a cutting edge TV that can bridge the gap between traditional broadcast entertainment and the internet then this is not necessarily the TV you are looking for, if you don't mind some wireless speed shortcomings (even though the functionality is there once it finally loads up) and you want a TV with a great picture and fairly flexible settings then it might be worth a shot as long as you don't pay too much for it.I know it seems contradictory but if I were asked the question "would you buy it again?" I would probably answer "no," however it has served me well (all things considered) and coming from the TV I had before this was a significant upgrade.  I've been using computers for quite some time and maybe that is why I'm rather numb to this sort of shortcoming, it's sad that this is what it has come down to (knowing that rebooting an operating system to get it to work is "normal" for example.)
