First I will talk about this shipping rather quickly(audio & video center-I hope that's the right name?)from Cali. It shipped in the tv's original packaging,and opened it to see it was in perfect condition. I did have it shipped to my place of business(furniture warehouse)just because I knew the fed ex guy and was familiar with having to make claims if it was damaged. It was fine!Got tv home put 4 Phillips head screws into the base,make sure to make them tight and Do Not Strip the heads.The tv isn't very heavy if you move it alone, but since it is my new baby I had a friend help me carry it.The size is rather large because the frame of the tv.I am guessing this is one of the larger 42" tv's(size wise).I had to fit mine into an Armoire,It was very close to not fitting.So if you are tight on space measure well before you get this tv(it is also kind of a tall tv).I read there are issues with viewing angles,well I live in a one bed room apt. and have no problems at all.I sit center of tv about 8 ft. away on a larger sized sofa(looks fine from one end to the other).I also sat in my recliner about 9-10ft.away(sitting in chair tv is at my 2o'clock)Looks fine not perfect but unless you have an expert sitting there it is fine. It also sits up about half a ft. above eye level.Still no problems.As far as colors go,Whites can be blinding,Blacks are deep and can be too dark if not on the right setting.All others look crisp and beautiful.Ok, I am no picture quality expert,but I love tv and movies and games so, Testing my Playstation 3.Playstation 3- Tried watching Lost season 1 on Blu-Ray,OMG! It makes abc's hd channel(I think it is only 720p) look like standard definition.The opening scene when Jack wakes in the jungle and looks up into the bamboo is jaw dropping,the whole show looks incredible!I just played Heavy Rain(Video Game) and Dante's Inferno(Video Game), Again Jaw dropping. Colors are vivid,as close to perfection as one can get.Cable Box- I do have an HD cable box from time warner.I watch alot of sports and movies(HBO,Showtime)I recorded the superbowl in HD knowing I would get my Tv soon after the superbowl, Well the colts jerseys were as blue as can be and the white on the jerseys were great,the saints jersey looked unreal(in a good way) Gold and black looked really cool mixed with the beautiful green field.Looked like I could see almost every blade of grass.Well the big networks all look good however like I said Earlier, I watch Lost and abc's 720p showing of it is disappointing.The winter Olympics on nbc look great the white snow is very lovely and all the colors of the skiers and hockey players are wonderfully vivid and sharp.HBO and Showtime have great HD Images,I recorded Watchmen on HBO(well only 1hr of it,God it is so long)knowing I wanted to test my tv when it arrived.Looks the closest to blu-ray quality than any other channels. Oh and STANDARD def. viewing, people who say it is awful on this tv are crazy or get a weak signal.I do however get standard def.through my hdmi cable not the coax so maybe that has somthing to do with it.Standard def.is not great but it is watchable and wont upset you unless you are a stickler...I have an X-Box 360(through component cables) I haven't played it yet but i'm certain it will be good.Also I own an Lg surround sound system(simplink ready) so I can't say how well the speakers work,when I did turn the speakers up when first plugging in the tv(static was on the tv) I turned it up pretty loud, again it was only static but it sounded loud in my little apartment.The tv's remote is good not great but I do like the backlit buttons,there is also a button to turn on and of the backlit buttons(I thought that was cool).much easier menu's than previous lg tv's the quick menu option is rather neat and easy to use and switch between picture options.Finally- This T.V. was one of the cheaper LED's I found out there for it's size.It is always risky buying online and having electronics shipped long distances, My experience here was great so I'm 2 for 2 when buying tv's on amazon.someone on another review said it best, Most of the bad reviews come from the small percentage of people who did have issues and problems,who are looking for solutions and answers.Most others have no need to talk about how great there tv works(does that make sense)If you are seriously considering this tv then don't pass it up,If you have the funds to go bigger and better than yeah, you should...hope this helped some of you
