Thier Support ***CKS Literally.  I bought this tv  40EX400  towards the end of 2011.  It was fine  beautiful colour  really sharp vivid screen.  etc etc.  I was happy. Then within not even 4-5months they released the firmware version 1.514.  Saying it was to fix some HDMI  issues with video games and what not.  But after installing it the colour was so messed up it looked like a  the colour temp settings was way off. I always left everything as DEFAULT settings  but since this firmware was installed.. it was impossible to view with getting  a nausuous  feeling.  I tried changing the  COLOUR TEMP setting to  "COOL" and i could NOT SEE any difference at all from WARM to COOL..  and putting it on WARM 2  made it TOTALLY EVEN WORSE..  I also had to disable the  AMBIENT SENSOR  as that  ALSO made the TEMP colour  EVEN WORSE.I immediately contacted SONY  and they told me to reset the set.. WHICH i told them i Already did that many times.. and that it was THIER FIRMware that screwed it up.  I asked them if i could revert back to previous firmware. They  replied there was NO WAY.  I was upset that now i had a pukey colour tv  and i was getting nothing but a run around.  They told me i had to send it in to get it fixed  as long as i  had the  Original receipt.  They sent me to a link  that said i would be able to get a BACKUP tv until they fixed it. I just needed to fill out the form. which I DID!The original receipt was faded so they  were going to charge me full cost of fixing the set. That of course made me MORE upset and i told them i Just bought it NOT EVEN 4 months ago. BUT they DID said that i could get a copy of my receipt from the store where I purchased it and that WOULD work.  OK so i contacted the store , and within a few days they sent me in the mail a copy of the RECIEPT  they were nice enough to do that for me being i couldnt get to them in person (the store where I purchased the TV that is).  But SONY would NOT go good by it.  They insisted that it was NOT LEGIT. (YES EVEN AFTER TELLING ME TO GET A COPY in the first place! Go figure!I spent the next 3 months JUST trying to get them to go GOOD  on thier warrenty  as i SHOULDNT have to PAY for something THIER SOFTWARE messed up.. (FIRMWARE V1.514). They know the problem was there and THATS WhY they gave me a run around for three months. They never READ any of my emails.  They expected  me to cart the tv over to a place in vermont which i am IN NY  and vermont is the closest repair. Of course I couldnt as i am disabled and i have no transportation.  BUT the WORST part of it was that they insisted I PAY for the repair  which it was clearly thier FAULT. I have even contacted a friend who was a lawyer who requested  a copy of thier agreement to thier firmware in writing but SONY couldnt even provide that!!.. AGAIN GO figure!I WOULD NEVER recommend any SONY BRAND to anyone NOT even MY WORST ENEMY.  Sony does NOT know how to treat thier customers  and they try to find all sorts of ways to get out of of a situation they know thier at FAULT AT! Almost 600$ tv gone down the drain with in  NOT EVEN a year!
