I've been reading reviews and doing quite a bit of research on buying a new tv.  I've always been a fan of plasma's and so had my mind set on a higher end Panasonic. (either GT30 or VT30.)  I was considering a 55" Panasonic and then read some great reviews on the Samsung PN59D8000 and 7000.  I liked the look, went to the store to see both sets in person.  It was still tough to tell the differences in store due to the wacky settings they use.  Both looked really good to me and I knew either would be a major upgrade from a 6 year old DLP.  I ended up with the Samsung PN59D8000 on a Amazon lightning deal.  The price was $900 cheaper than the sale price at a Magnolia!  The 55" GT30 Panasonic on Amazon was slightly more so, for the money the top end Samsung was too good of a deal especially for the larger 59" screen. Delivery was painless.  I hear the PN59D7000 is almost the same and now can be had for a few hundred cheaper.  At the time I got the 8000 for the same price as the 7000 so it was an easy decision.When I first turned the TV the picture was just amazing, I knew I would be happy with this set. I noticed no screen peel or color pops as some other have seen on this set.I highly recommend going through and calibrating the set. When finished the picture is remarkably more even and lifelike.  Keep in mind that you may want to set the calibration in movie mode for each input.  I watch movies via both PS3 on Blu Ray and also via Netflix streaming on the xbox.  You may want to calibrate your HDTV feed as well.Overall this is a VERY excellent TV. Highly recommended.NOTES:  Silver color of the bezel in the pictures would be if you have a super bright white room.  Actual color is dark grey.  The Remote is surprisingly good.  I thought I would hate it..actually find the layout great and easy to use.Cons? Very few.  There is a minor buzz that you can hear in a dead quite room from 5ft away.  Sound covers this up immediately.Speaking of sound, it's bad.  Get a home theater system, this display deserves it.Below are some recommended calibrations from a CNET review for the set.- 150-hour calibration----Picture menuMode: MovieCell Light: 14Contrast: 95Brightness: 58Sharpness: 0Color: 50Tint: G50/R50Screen adjustment submenu:Picture Size: Screen FitPosition: [no change]Auto Adjustment submenu: [Grayed out]3D submenu: N/AAdvanced settings submenu:Black tone: OffDynamic contrast: OffGamma: 0Expert Pattern: OffRGB Only Mode: OffColor space: CustomWhite Balance: [see below]10p White Balance: OnFlesh tone: 0Edge enhancement: OffMotion Lighting: OffxvYCC: OffColor Space submenu:Color Space: CustomRed: Red 47, Green 5, Blue 4Green: Red 19, Green 58, Blue 3Blue: Red 3, Green 3, Blue 53Yellow: Red 51, Green 54, Blue 4Cyan: Red 20, Green 53, Blue 51Magenta: Red 42, Green 8, Blue 53White balance submenu:R-Offset: 30G-Offset: 14B-Offset: 12R-Gain: 7G-Gain: 21B-Gain: 1910p White Balance submenu:Interval 1: Red -7, Green -8, Blue -7Interval 2: Red -5, Green -4, Blue -4Interval 3: Red 3, Green 3, Blue 3Interval 4: Red 1, Green 2, Blue 3Interval 5: Red -1, Green 2, Blue 5Interval 6: Red -3, Green -2, Blue -1Interval 7: Red -5, Green -3, Blue -3Interval 8: Red -4, Green -2, Blue -3Interval 9: Red -2, Green 0, Blue -2Interval 10: Red -2, Green 0, Blue -7Picture options submenuColor tone: Warm2Digital Noise Filter: OffMPEG Noise Filter: OffHDMI black level: Normal [grayed out]Film mode: Off
