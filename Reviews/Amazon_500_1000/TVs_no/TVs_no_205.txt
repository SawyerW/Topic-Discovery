Samsung LN46A650 46-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of ColorIts been 2 weeks since I recieved this TV.  This Samsung LN46A650 replaced my 42" Westinghouse monitor which I took to my office. For its MAIN intended use as a TV . . .  its superb.  HDTV broadcast over cable is beautiful and Blue Ray play back is just STUNNING !  Compared to my Westinghouse, the black level performance is breathtakingly better.  I've only had this unit for 2 weeks so I have not explored everything to the n-th degree.  I use this TV for my work almost 50% of the time.  This TV is used as a computer monitor for CAD drafting (AutoCad).IF . . . your use is 95% as a TV for movies and cable/satellite broadcast, you can't ask for a better TV.  4-1/2 STAR RATiNG AS A TV !CONS (USING AS A TV) :--> ONLY 3 CUSTOM SETTING -  If you are picky about PICTURE SETTINGS for different INPUTS, this TV DOES NOT allow a specific setting for each input.  I am used to being able to have specific setting for Cable, DVD/Blue Ray, Game and PC inputs.  There are 3 PICTURE MODES, "Dynamic", "Standard" and "Movie".  You do your specific tweaking for each mode THEN apply the "Mode" of choice to each input.  So far I have my Blue Ray connected to "HDMI 1" and my HD cable to "Component" and I was able to tweak to my heart's desire for both inputs.  BUT . . .  (continued below in "used as computer monitor")--> PIP IS ONLY FOR THE STANDARD DEFINITION "ANTENNA/CABLE" INPUT :  Only the analog input can be over-layed on the main picture.  YOU CAN NOT DISPLAY ANY COMPONENT, HDMI OR PC INPUT AS PIP SOURCE . . .  AND  YOU CAN NOT SWAP  PIP AND MAIN SCREEN.  I spent how much? . . . and I can't have an HD PIP while working on my computer ??  DISAPPOINTED !!--> NO PIP BUTTON ON THE REMOTE :  The only way to turn on the PIP is to go through the MAIN MENU . . .  very cumbersome.--> WORST DESIGNED REMOTE I'VE EVER USED - I hate it and so does everyone else.-----------------------CONS  (USING TV AS A COMPUTER MONITOR) : MY REASON for a 1 STAR RATING OVERALL-->> NOT ALL ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS WORK WITH ALL "MODES" OR "INPUTS" -  I connected my laptop (DVI output via DVI-to-HDMI cable) to the HDMI 2.  I have my video card to output at 1920x1080, the same setting I used for my Westinghouse.  FIRST IMPRESSION IS "WOW ITS FUZZY" AND IT DOES NOT FILL THE SCREEN.  THERE IS A BLACK BAND OF BOUT AN INCH ALL AROUND THE FULL SIZE WINDOW !!  Ok, it needs to be tweaked.  So I selected "Standard" mode BUT much to my surprise some settings were "greyed out" and not accessible.  I can't change the "sharpness" setting for use as a computer monitor through either  the HDMI 2 or the PC input using the VGA cable!!  ITS STUCK AT 50 IN THE RANGE OF 0 to 100 AND CAN'T BE ADJUSTED !!!  I NEED TO SET IT TO 100.-->> SINGLE LINE COLOR FOR CAD SOFTWARE IS IMPROPERLY DISPLAYED -  AutoCad using 256 color palette displayed on a black backgroud displays wrong color vertically and diagonally.  The correct color is displayed only when its perfectly horizontal.  The way my AutoCad is set up, plotted line width is dependant on the color.  EACH OF MY MAIN COLOR HAS 3 DIFFERENT SHADES DENOTING 3 DIFFERENT LINE WITDH OR SCREENING WHEN PLOTTED.  THESE SHADES ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE. This may be a problem of vertical and horizontal sync frequency BUT THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS AVAILABLE to correct the problem.  I've tried everything on the video card but can't get rid of this problem.  I'm going to contact Samsung for a specific driver for the 650 series LCD (IF THEY HAVE ONE) to see if that would fix it.  The TV is recieving 1920x1080 but does not fill the screen.  It measures about 43" viewable area.-->> FONTS IN INTERNET PAGES AND WORD PROCESSOR IS FUZZY :  I thought it was just a problem with AutoCad but ALL software windows displayed as "graphics" is fuzzy.  The only thing that looks DECENT are photos and 3D renderings.CONCLUSION :This TV IS SUPERB, as a TV . . .  no questions about that.  But . . .  IT FAILS MISERABLY AS A COMPUTER MONITOR.  My inferior Westinghouse runs circles around this Samsung when used as a COMPUTER MONITOR.  It might be the combination of my video card and this TV, but I doubt it.  If you intend to use this TV as a computer monitor more than ocaisionally, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.With my old Westinghouse,  I just plugged in the DVI out from my computer and it displayed the image full screen with accurate color.  A little tweak on "brightness", "contrast", "backlight" and "hue" and it looked just as sharp as my LCD monitor on my laptop. . . NO MATTER WHAT SOFTWARE I RAN.I had expected THIS SAMSUNG TV to be at least equal to the Westinghouse as a computer monitor.  I WAS WRONG AND DISAPPOINTED.  Take your laptop to a local store and try it out  FIRST. . .  then buy from Amazon at a better price.  AS A COMPUTER MONITOR FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN E-MAIL AND WORD PROCESSING, THIS UNIT IS NEARLY UNUSABLE.
