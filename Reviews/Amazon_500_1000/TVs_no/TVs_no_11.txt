originally bought the 27" around Christmas time - watched iRobot and played some Xbox but took it back when the HH Greg rebate increased at the end of the month ($1100 after incentives)... happy with the decision (using the LCD for a computer monitior, also, and the resolution seemed to sync better on the 30")my 30" came with a superior remote, as well - would be nice if it glowed in the dark, though :Pinitially, i was disappointed over the DVD aspect ratio/zoom situation already mentioned but i choos to blame Hollywood (boo widescreen!)definitely recommend using composite (Psyclone)/DVI (Monster)cables - noticed a "swimming" effect (imagine TV static fuzz) inside of white content without them; also detected pixelation in the sky of Matrix:Revolutions end fight scene but that was the only time and i was only a couple of feet from the screen (already watched following: Kill Bill 1/2, Hero, Anchorman, Matrix II/III, and Dodgeball with exceptional results)i can't say that i noticed any ghosting (inability to correctly transition images from one position on the screen without simultaneous display of intermediate images) while watching movies or playing Xbox; haven't tried Unreal on the PC, yet, but i'm confident that any problems will be a function of my video card's inadequacythe Xbox looks great on this screen - played KOTORII and Top Spin so far; it's not the quality that i hoped for but the clarity is superior to analog TVi've heard reports that the light/dark contrast isn't so hot; i'm pretty picky and i'd say that this device has no difficulty reproducing deep black and bright whitealso, people have complained about the absence of specific color (red) settings - adjusting this value is possible when using composite inputs; i'm currently using the default, factory, settings, though, and am thoroughly pleasedit doesn't offer the 1200x1600 resolution of my laptop monitor but it can achieve 1400x700 using a DVI input cable which is suitable for a desktop machine (i'm a coder, not a graphik artist); in Win2K the text is crisp and clear and should be better with XP since it's got built-in LCD friendly character interpolation; try Virtual Desktop (similar to Sun's multi-screen) if the screen space isn't sufficient; also, the applications suggested on other sites for adjusting the input resolution work well ("powerstrip") but "multires" from the same company is fine, easy, and freeone aggrevation about the TV is that there is an annoying noise when it's on; my speakers are disconnected (they're trash - about the same as come with cheap computers) so it's not feedback as i first suspected...it's not audible when the monitor is off or there's audio content playing (i said i was picky!)warning: one of the review sites i read mentioned that it's possible for LCDs to exhibit a type of burn-in that appears to be reversible in certain circumstances; fact or fiction, i don't know but recommend not leaving the thing every night while the CNN ticker clicks alongspeaking of standard TV, i plugged the coax cable into the TV tonight and was surprised at the quality of the picture; it's not as good as on an analog set but certainly would suffice except for a couple of channels (4 out of 70 were pretty bad: CNN, MSNBC, FOX, and Comedy Central - everything else looked decent); i'm guessing that HDTV would be spectacular (much like DVD) but it will be a while before i buy into that...my only complaint thus far is a defect pixel; it's not dead but appears to be dying (on the no-input blue screen it's black, however, when there is video content it's not noticable); this is one major disadvantage to the technology which simply must be accepted for now; i decided that it wasn't worth boxing it up and returning itwith regard to aesthetics, i think it's a sharp box; there's a strip of brushed aluminumish accent near the bottom where the buttons are; the glowing blue light which indicates standby mode is a neat touch; the top of the base is clearish along the lines of a Macintosh (ripoff, true, but shows a little extra effort)to conclude, this is a stupendous piece of equipment at a bargain basement price; yes, there are superior units available if you have $ to burn but seriously consider the Olevia when balancing cost/performance
