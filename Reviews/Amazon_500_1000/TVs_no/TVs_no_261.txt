Well after owing: a series 5 42" LCD, then aSeries 6 TOC 46" LCD and finally the top of the line Series 8 55" LED... plus a small 21"  3 series in my daughter's room. ALL PURCHASES WITHIN 3 years, I have a pretty good idea what Samsung flat screens are all about.I had Panasonic... tested Vizios, Olevias and Sony Bravias... and my first LCD was a Sharp Acquos.FIRST THE PROS:IMAGEif image quality is your priority, no need to look further.. this TV's image is sharper, more natural, intense and well calibrated than anything else, period.Just as simple as that... this is just superior... even the hyped RGB + Y screens, pale in comparison... this thing on Blu Ray is a monster, and the 240 GHZ enhanced motion cinema has natural settings that remove the jittering efect and unnatural motion of old... the Bravia is SO INFERIOR IN THIS it's unvelievable... I hate it for movies!, as any cinephile does... but FOR LIVE VIDEO, such as SPORT, CONCERTS, and SPECIALLY viedo games it's breathtaking!!!... a Hi-Def football game and UFC on this thing looks out of this world... MILES ahead of any projector costing twice as much.MENUSthe new Samsung Menu Interface is very intuitive, easy to use and FINALLY offers a look that goes with the aesthetic sense of a proper high end design product... the menu is somewhat in the same lines as that of the scroll design PS3 and is just very well integrated and non intrusive.... everything is no more than two clicks away.DESIGN and MATERIALSThe stainless steel base is sturdy and elegant, although the screen panel is a bit on the plasticky side, although very elegant, more so than any other in this range, except maybe a B&O...; however the up side is that this screen is much lighter and easier to handle than even that of my previous 46" Series 6 TOC... and the slim factor of it is unbelievable.EXTRA REMOTEThe minimize function extra remote is a cool addition, a cool design... very comfortable... DRAWBACKS, not INPUT button and clock type battery.CONECTIVITYIn this case it works great... the BD WISE function is practical and instant... the network capability for streaming... these are awesome feature seldomly exploited.NOW THE CONS:REMOTE CONTROL, although impressive and comfy  it is TERRIBLY ANNOYING that this remote has to be "paired" to the TV...  and it CONSTANTLY get UNPARIED... this annoys me SO MUCH I don't even use it anymore... using the crappy remote of my Blu Ray Player. This is THE ONE AWFUL THING about this TV... I don't know if it is MY set, because by business partner got his alongside mine, and doesn't have ths problem... but it is TERRIBLY dissapointing.INPUTS/OUTPUTSThis TV HAS ONLY ONE (YES ONE) component video input... and to top it off it DOUBLES as the ONLY R/F video input (yes the only ONE!)... no S-VHS either.Now, it is clear that HDMI is king... and this TV HAS THAT IN SPADES and really the market for this TV will very UNLIKELY plug a VCR into it... but for those of you with let's say a non HDMI digital box... Nintendo Wii... it might be an issue.In contrast my Series 6 TOC has two less HDMI inputs, but 4 times as more of everything else.Optic Audio output is STEREO ONLY, if you plan to use it as monitor out on an A/V receiver.It also has VGA, but no DVI... although the VGA cable somehow, is capable of delivering true HD video when you connect your computer... in my case a Macbook Pro, which I connect... and I have to say, as two monitor arrangement the Samsung beats the computer's LED display HANDS DOWN!!!.UPDATEIt's not the batteries... it's just a problem.I forgot about it... just use the remote from the TV in my room... a 6 Series LCD!... not good.
