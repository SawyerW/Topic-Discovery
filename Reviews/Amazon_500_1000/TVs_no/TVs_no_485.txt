This is a Good TV at a great price.  I shopped this TV against the Sony KDL46EX720 and the Samsung UN466400.Pros:-Fast Refresh Rate-240hz versus 120 for both the Samsung and Sony.  The Sony has the number 240 everywhere I looked; however, this is not a true 240hz refresh rate.-Passive 3d-This was a big one for me.-I have 3 young children and I am hesitant to hand over a $60.00 pair of glasses passive glasses are significantly cheaper.-Eye fatigue, personally I felt like the active glasses caused eye fatigue significantly quicker than the passive- I felt  like I was getting a headache down the center of my head any time I wore the active glasses for more than a few minutes.-Active glasses are kind of a pain- they are heavy, you have to recharge them which I tend not to stay on top off and I felt there was a lot more visual noise (not syncing properly via bluetooth and crosstalk)-Active 3d is well entrenched with the top brands (Sony and Samsung) and you will find that every salesperson will tell you it is significantly better; however, I recommend reading this article: ([...])the author of the study referenced in this article is very highly regarded in the HDTV world and it provides an in depth comparison of active versus passive 3d.-Matte screen-I have a bright room and this is one of the few LED LCD TVs that is not using a glossy screen which reflects light.-Price-I was able to find this TV at a very reasonable price versus the Samsung and Sony.-Built in WiFi-This is huge and anyone purchasing a TV should make sure it is internet connected as you can receive software updates that can correct issues with the TV. There is one out of the box that I hope will be corrected soon and I'll cover that in cons.Cons:-The picture is good on this TV; however, I felt both the Sony and Samsung did have a slightly better 2d picture.  You will absolutely have to tweak this picture out of the box as it defaults to power saver mode which sacrifices picture quality for energy savings. I am all for being green, but I think this was a huge mistake by Toshiba-I can only imagine all the returns because people take it out of the box hook it up and the picture is lackluster.  I recommend going to AVSforums-dot-com, searching for the model number and trying out some of the users recommended settings. That is what I did and I have an excellent picture on this TV.-Incredibly long time to power on (This is the issue I am hoping is corrected via a software update)-This TV takes 20 seconds to go from hitting the power button to a picture on the screen.-Speakers are awful- This was across the board on all brands-If you are going to purchase a 3d HDTV you should have a sound system.-Lack of reviews-This has nothing to do with the TV per se, but there are not a lot of reviews on this TV and I like to research.All in all this is a good TV at a great price-I have watched 3d movies, played 3d games and watched sports on this TV and have been very happy with the picture and refresh rate.60 Day UpdateI am still happy with this purchase, some minor annoyances with the 20 second to picture delay when starting up and changing channels, particularly when going from an HD to SD channel.  I also notice that sometimes it does not seem to recognize other inputs and I have to restart the device associated with that input.Other than those annoyances, I still recommend this TV- 3D, gaming, movies all look excellent.
