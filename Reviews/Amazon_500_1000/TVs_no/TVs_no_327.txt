I HAVE SOME INFO THAT MAY BE USEFUL THAT I HAVEN'T READ IN ANY OTHER REVIEW. I tried 2 tvs before the pn58c7000. First i had the panasonic g25 50inch.It was well reviewed,the price was right and came with a nice soundbar speaker system. well hd signals were very good picture quality wise but  standard def looked bad, even dvds didn't look that great unless sitting pretty far away. This was very disappointing as I have a ton of Dvds, netflix, and a wii. The dealbreaker though was the floating blacks i had read about but thought it was maybe an isolated incident or would be unnoticeable to me. Well watching the Lord of the rings on bluray it was very obvious in dark scenes where the blacks would suddenly lighten on the whole screen.So the Tv went back.  Next I had a pn50c7000 that was much improved in a variety of ways. there were no floating blacks.Standard Dvds almost looked hd even at very close viewing and there was a very film like look to movies bluray and dvd with the color and smoothness that made me say "wow" alot. I never quite got that feeling with the g25. Buzz was less then on the g25. A couple negatives on this tv. The blacks seemed lighter maybe then the g25. I'm not sure but there was a greyness to the picture that made me want to keep messing with the settings to get the picture to "pop" more. Also image retention was very bad on the pn50c7000. I mean a couple minutes on a static screen and it was noticeable. This was concerning.I thought the tv was great minus these two issues. I didnt get the best deal on the pn50c7000 locally so it went back.  Now I was still set on getting this tv on amazon. actually the pn50c8000 to help in bright rooms and with glare.(which isnt too bad on the 7000 series)not to sure about bright room performance. Then a deal came up for the pn58c7000 for 1788 making it less then $200 more for a 58! So i went with it. First, this tv seemed massive compared to the 50 so keep that in mind.(they also ship it in a huge over sized box outside the box )  Now PN50C7000 VS PN58C7000 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!!! I dont know if it's because this is a later model (came with most recent firmware vs pn50c7000 which i had to update.)or the bigger screen size(which some reviews confirm this)The blacks on the pn58c7000 were better and the contrast had more "pop".No greyness! Color on this set is amazing! I was watching Apocalypse Now DVD on movie mode warm1 and "wow" ive never seen colors like that!  The image retention is non existent on the 58, so no worries, THIS IS CLOSE TO THE PERFECT TV! only cons: Buzz as its called is maybe more noticeable then on the pn50c7000.(only true minor flaw ) Also standard def dosnt look as good as on the 50(still very good though at respectable view distance). both these are results of the plasma tech and the bigger screen size.The Stand could be lighter. only tested 2d picture, but im guessing it beats the vt25 in most areas after their black levels raise slightly. and if samsung 2011 50inch sizes carry over this sized panel's  performance  i guarantee they'll have the top rated tv of 2011!
