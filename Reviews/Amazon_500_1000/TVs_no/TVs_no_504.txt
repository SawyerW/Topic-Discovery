I've owned and seen a lot of TVs in my lifetime. When I was searching for a midrange TV, something around 30 to 42 inches for the den, honestly the Panasonic wasn't my first choice (because I didn't know about it). I started with the Samsung UN32C6500. This was a 32 inch LED TV that had a very pretty design and the picture quality was okay but it just wasn't enough and it was way too overpriced. I sold that TV and then looked elsewhere. I looked at Sony, LG, Samsung, and Panasonic LED TVs. That was when I found out the DT30 series. This is the first time Panasonic has jumped into the LED TV fray, so it was difficult to find reviews and information on the TV. The reviews that I had read had only good things to say about the series. The design wasn't as sleek as the Samsung that I had or the one that I was also looking at (the UN40D6400) so I was unsure of what to buy. The difference came down to picture quality. To be frank, I didn't think that I would be paying attention to color reproduction and picture quality as much as I am now with this new Panasonic. I don't mean that in a bad way, this Panasonic produces some of the best color, black levels, and image that I have ever seen and it continues to amaze me even after the first month. Combined with essentially an all in one package, this is an wonderful TV.PROS=================================- Black levels and color reproduction is amazing. No backlight bleeding. Words can only say so much, find this TV somewhere and see for yourself.- Plenty of connection ports- Panasonic VIERA Connect (internet applications) is simply and easy to use. A lot better than Samsung's Smart TV application set up.- Settings menu is very easy to use.- No dead pixels- 3D picture is also one of the best that I've seen. I've watched movies and played video games (Killzone 3 and COD Black Ops) from my PS3 in 3D and have noticed no ghosting or artifacts. Produces good depth too. Way to go Panasonic!- No input lag. I probably didn't get better at video games but my controls are registered much faster than my previous HDTVs and that can mean the world in a fast paced game.- Includes everything that you would possibly need. Wi-fi adapter and 3D glasses. One of the things that annoyed me with other TVs is that none of these things were included, which meant added costs for these accessories. Panasonic provides everything in the package, which is a major plus.CONS================================- The power plug is integrated into the TV. Although Panasonic provides a good way to hold the plug close to the TV when moving, I would've liked a plug that could be detachable.- Streaming Netflix from the TV doesn't produce a very solid picture (probably because the TV has to download and process the picture) and sometimes the audio is choppy. I just use my PS3 for that.- The wifi dongle adds another two inches to the back of the TV. Not a problem for me but just so that you know...it would've been nice if wifi was integrated as well but hey, at least Panasonic includes the dongle.ConclusionA+, get this TV if you're looking for the perfect midrange TV. I bought the 37'' (cause it was cheaper than the 32'' for some reason) and I was not disappointed in my purchase. I am confident that you won't be disappointed if you decide to purchase this TV.
