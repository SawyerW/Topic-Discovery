I don't speak english enough for a review, so I'll resume my experience with this amazing tv.Pros:- The first good impression I had, was the very good built quality and the soft weight.- The Design is very nice, the TV side is really slim and the color is a kind of black mate, beautiful.- The image quality is really impressing.- The stand is the best designed I have seen.- Is so far better than my 1 year old Samsung LCD Series 7- If you have a Xbox 360 you will see totally different the way to play games- The allshare is one of the best functions on that tv, pictures, videos, music and everything you have on your computer you can see on TV.Cons:- No 3D (I know is not included on this model)- No built in wi-fi, only wired internet (You have to buy the wi-fi adapter separately.)- The internet apps is starting so no expect the apps you see on amazon page- The allshare doesn't work with MacIn resume i love it, I don't know if is because is my first LED tv, but it is everything I was expected from Samsung and is better so far, I'm using 2 weeks now, and I can't see movies o games again on my old TV.::::UPDATE:: 04/19/2010I'm updating that review to share how I have improved my experience with that TV!CALIBRATION FOR XBOX 360With game mode turned on, you won't get the best from this TV.This adjust is so far better than using "Game Mode", you will get the best image on Xbox 360 after the TV is turned on for 20 minutes.# Picture Modes  * Picture Mode : Standard  * Color Temperature : Warm 1 or Normal  * Aspect Ratio : 16:9# Picture Settings  * Backlight : 9  * Contrast : 90  * Brightness : 46  * Sharpness : 10  * Color : 49  * Tint : G50/R50# Advanced Settings  * Black Tone : Off  * Dynamic Contrast : Low  * Shadow Detail : -2  * Gamma : 0  * RGB Only Mode : Off  * Color Space : Auto  * White Balance : Factory Default  * 10p White Balance : Off  * Fleshtone : 0  * Edge Enhancement : Off  * xvYCC : Off  * LED Motion Plus : OFF# Picture Options  * Color Tone : Warm 1 or Normal  * Size : 16:9  * Digital Noise Filter : On  * MPEG Noise Filter : Off  * HDMI Black Level : Normal  * Auto Motion Plus 120Hz : StandardCALIBRATION FOR BLU-RAYIf you have too many lights on your the TV room, you need change only the Backlight setting.# Picture Modes  * Picture Mode : Movie  * Color Temperature : Warm 1 or Warm 2  * Aspect Ratio : 16:9# Picture Settings  * Backlight : 8  * Contrast : 90  * Brightness : 45  * Sharpness : 10  * Color : 45  * Tint : G50/R50# Advanced Settings  * Black Tone : Off  * Dynamic Contrast : Low  * Shadow Detail : -2  * Gamma : 0  * RGB Only Mode : Off  * Color Space : Auto  * White Balance : Factory Default  * 10p White Balance : Off  * Fleshtone : 0  * Edge Enhancement : Off  * xvYCC : Off  * LED Motion Plus : off# Picture Options  * Color Tone : Warm 1 or Warm 2  * Size : 16:9  * Digital Noise Filter : On  * MPEG Noise Filter : Off  * HDMI Black Level : Normal  * Auto Motion Plus 120Hz : Standard: (I like to use STANDARD because I like the natural movement of the picture, but if you like closer to Theater quality, you can use the adjustment CLEAR or SMOOTH)
