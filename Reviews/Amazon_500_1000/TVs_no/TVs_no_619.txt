I just recently bought the samsung pn51d7000 after purchasing the panasonic gt30, panasonic vt30, and the lg5600 led, now the lg is not even in the same league as the three mentioned, that went back the next day as it had unclear picture quality, gaming was really laggy, as I bought the first two panasonic plasmas first, was not very impressed with the gt30 with the fluctating brightness issues, the pic had artifacts and the colors did not look very impressive, a little bit of distortion as far as redder images, with the exception of THX mode. I took that back and bought the much anticipated 55 inch Vt30 which had the best blacks out of the four and the colors were better than 55 inch gt30 but wanted something a little cheaper, and figure I would try the lg led and was a big mistake, maybe I had a bad unit but was horrible, then went back to the 50 gt30 for a 1200 price, because the samsung was not in stock at the time, when it became available I bought it for around 1250 for a 51 inch and figure it would save me about 1200 compared to the vt30 with just 4 inches smaller.I have to say the black are JUST about as deep as the vt30, the color is noticably better, very impressed with overall picture quality. I just wished I would have gotten the 59 inch version although that is a little large for my living room, my one complaint is if you don't hang it on a wall the stand is a little flemsy. The panasonic series has way better stablity as far as having it on a stand, doesn't move at all,(doesn't swivel though past 50 inches) But after having the three the samsung is the much better value for about half the price of the vt30, if the vt30 was cheaper it would be a tough choice, but I think I would still take the samsung because the overall picture quality is better, as far as the bright colors,even though the vt30 did have better deep blacks than the pnd7000(but not by much).The samsung does have a nicer design, but it did have a worse glare off of my living room windows than the vt30, but its not bad by any means. I like how the vt30 looked on my TV stand as you couldn't see the wires behind the TV, to where the samsung you can because it sits up due to the swivel function. The sound is pretty decent and the controller layout is easy to navigate, have not tried 3d out but don't care much about that.If you really want to test a TV's performance, record Las Vegas on TNTHD as it shows just about everything you would want to see for picture quality  bright colors, deep blacks,skin tones)and u will be able to see the outstanding picture quality. If your looking for the nicest picture around for the cheaper price you will not be dissapointed with the samsung pnd7000 series. I had it for about 3 weeks now and the picture has gotten even better than when I first turned it on, I did use the calibration settings posted on CNet.Oh and the Tv came quick undamaged and in perfect condition from pauls fulfilled by amazon. For 1200 bucks, you couldn't go wrong even getting it for 1500, it is worth the price.I just wished they would have kept the 56 inch they used to make as that was the perfect size for my living room, but I saw the 59 inch is going for the 1700 range, not bad at all!
