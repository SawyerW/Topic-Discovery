I bought this TV at the end of 2009 when our old 56 inch 1080P JVC HD-ILA set died, a TV that we had purchased for nearly $2,500 dollars in early 2007 or 2008 if memory serves me. The JVC set had been a nightmare honestly, had a jaw dropping picture but burned through the fairly expensive bulbs far too quickly (we had gone through 3 in 18-20 months and 2 in 3 months) when I just couldn't take any more.So in a pinch I bought this TV as a short term stop gap solution with the intention of replacing it a year later with some of our tax money. We were going from what was supposed to be a superior new technology in the JVC LCOS 1080P 56 inch set (that was honestly quite nice when it wasn't blowing bulbs) down to a 720P 50 inch budget model plasma (which was rumored to be old dying tech with too many problems at the time) and from the second we got it set up we could hardly believe our eyes....This budget model of an aging dying technology was a much bigger upgrade on that 1080P 56 set than that new super set had been on a 46 inch Toshiba rear projection set. We were all floored by the quality of the picture this set was able to produce and in all honesty the picture got even better as the set was fully broken in and then calibrated (not professionally but by myself with set up discs) we are just now looking to replace this set and even that is only because we want to get a 3D Panasonic plasma (I have found a Panny 20VT from 2010 lightly used for just $700ish) and move this into our main bedroom.The black levels are still top notch, the colors pop, the sound is much better then most flat screens even though we usually use the 6.1 through the receiver and it is very versitile as it obviously looks its best with 720P sources it looks great down converting 1080P blu-ray and does a much better job handling 480i/p content then our two 32 inch LCD's (a Samsung and a Toshiba) do with it despite it being blown up on a nearly 20 inch bigger screen.I'm still thrilled with the deal we got from Amazon on this set $719 with free shipping, in fact this deal is what lead to me going from doing a little shopping here and there from the site to being a Prime member who buys from them more often then not. In terms of value, this TV is without a doubt the best big ticket item i've ever bought to this point and certainly the best value.I have had other HDTV's to compare this to over the years myself and at my friends houses, one of my friends bought a 1080P Samsung plasma last year and though i'd say it has the better picture it was also newer tech and hundereds of dollars more. In my opinion Panny has the plasma market down to a science, they are well ahead on the budget models and they consistently have won on the top end model every year since the Kuro's stopped being produced too.
