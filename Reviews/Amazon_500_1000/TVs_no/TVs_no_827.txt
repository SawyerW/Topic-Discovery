update dec 2012 - after fix the unit is 4 starsbut only because it did need servicing otherwise it is 5 star.called samsungasked about warrantyno hasslesthey arranged for repair in my homeno muss no fussno charge to mei really want reliable products but great warranty service is the next best thingnow some third party has sent me an offer on samsung letterhead to buy an extended warranty at outrageous prices that is not as good as the original samsung warranty.  about 300 for 3 years.  by then the price of a new tv will be that low.i am willing to risk it.  samsung has good reputation.and we cuold live with the defect rather than shell out 300 for a warranty.  if it fails completely we will have to buy a new cheaper set whenever that happens.  OTOH we have a great local repair shop by a guy i know that used to be incharge of pc repair where i bought my 98se pc, which is still running strong.-------update october 201211 months in --  screen wide  colored bar usually white but only one color which varies at times with the rest of the display's colors and  goes across the entire screen a pixel thick about 2.5-3 inches from bottom  -- very annoying --about 4 inches from the left of screen crossing that line but in a vertical direction is a maybe 1/4-3/8 inch length with reddish pixels that stay on  -- very annoynigwill call samsung about warranty which seems to be 1 full year and see what they have to say -  also annoying to have to be hassled with thisupdate:called samsung.  actually got a person!!quick fast easy no hassle andthey promise to fix the set next week.we will see if they really can do that.i understood that screen failures required a total replacement.  could it be an electronics board that is bad?we will see.  stay tuned================================================This was  over 5 stars with HD images from cable -  wowwweeeee.this is a 1080 120hz device --excellent picture - best we ever had(returned a 720 60hz samsung that was awful -- worse than our old 19" CRT set)(not sure how a 1080 60hz would compare but that would be cheaper)you definitely want to get an hd signal from your cable company for this setsd shows are good but hd is much better for same channel/show.once did notice on an sd show that a large red block of color tended to jump up and down slightly.  very minor issue..color greatsound very good - appears to be stereo - old set we had was monoi guess with all the fancy connections it could do 5.1 if you wanted to.two problemsremote only works on small corner in bottom right as we face itthey should have sensors on both ends and the middleand on the topcannot use a new extra remote as samsung codes are different than theremotes we can buy that control all deviceswe can get it to turn off but it will not turn onif we ever lose the samsung remote the tv would be worthlessUPDATETHE FIOS REMOTE WORKS **IF** YOU CLICK IT TWICE.Once will not turn the set on like the samsung remote does, but if you click again the set will come on.  Still have not gotten any third party remotes to turn it on/off but a oneforall brand will mute and do the volume okay so i keep that one by the pc when i am only partially "watching" (mostly listening).  Cant get that one to change channels but that is a fios set top box code issue not samsung. Maybe I can figure out how to set that one too with the cheap extra remote..set up is a mystery as are most sets these daysfortunately the defaults are good enoughwould like to find out how to turn on a night mode with less DR though.lacks a compressor or other way to turn down commercials that blast outmuch louder than the show we were watching..40" is the right size for a normal roomif you had a bigger room you might want the 55"anything smaller than 40" risks the fuzzy picture of teh 32" 720 60hz set we returned.  you really need 1080 and hd for a decent picture..very happy so farif this doesnt break then definitely 5stars- a mildly annoying 5 stars but still FIVE STARS.UPDATEIT 'BROKE' - not dead but picture annoyingly messed up11 months from purchase date -- now 1 star
