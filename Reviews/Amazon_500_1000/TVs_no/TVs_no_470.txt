For those seeing the 1 or 2 star reviews, do yourself a favor and ignore them as they address aspects of the TV that are common knowledge to anyone who has done their research and are flaws present when shopping for ANY TV of this type.This is doubly true for the speakers - if you're expecting a massive wall of sound from any TV's internal speakers then it's a wonder you were intelligent enough to type a review on Amazon.Now, on the the important stuff.From a presentation standpoint, the TV is understated and classy. The glossy black bezel is attractive in it's simplicity, with the only deviation of color being a thin strip (about 1cm) of dark gray at the bottom of the TV. The gray strip house the sensor bar and small power leds.This is a 'budget' TV, and with that classification aside, the image quality on this TV is amazing. After some careful calibration, the picture shows deep, dark blacks, vivid color, sharply honed detail, and extremely smooth motion.Despite having a lower refresh rate than higher-end sets, this TV gives fluid, artifact free motion - even in action scenes with lots of quick camera cuts.The image quality is on-par with much more expensive sets, and given the actual price of this set, the image quality alone makes this TV worth a buy.However, there are caveats and they present themselves most notably in the inputs - or should I say, the lack thereof.It's with the inputs where you realize where Sony skimped in order to deliver a set of this size at this price.You get 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 Coaxial, Analog and Digital Audio inputs, a VGA, and a USB input.This input scenario posed problems for me, as I have far more devices than this TV can accommodate on it's own.I have 3 HDMI devices), 1 Component device, 2 Composite devices, and 2 coaxial devices. In order to hook everything up to this TV I had to purchase an HDMI switch, along with a composite splitter and a coaxial hub.Needless to say not everyone will have a plethora of video game consoles hooked up to their TV, but I do, and the lack of inputs made for one heck of wire mess behind my TV.However, my last TV had 3 HDMIs, 3 Components, 3 Composites, 2 S-Video, 2 Coaxial, Digital and Analog audio, and a DVI. So I could just be experiencing 'Input Shock' after having so many options.As an aside, the VGA input works well, and integrating the computer with this TV is quick and painless. The resolution is fine so long as you have a video card capable of supporting such a large picture, but that isn't really an issue unless you're using this TV to play PC games.In conclusion the 46bx420 is an excellent TV on it's own, and it's even better when you consider the image quality you're getting for the price. The lack of inputs is disappointing if unsurprising, but for the average user the available inputs will likely be more than enough. Again, the sound from the internal speakers is lacking but as I said, that's a no-brainer - you really should have a proper surround sound system hooked up to this TV if you're watching movies or HD media on it anyway.This TV is a great buy, and easily outperforms the competing models in it's class, and it does it for less to boot. Pick it up if you're in the market for a TV in this size - you won't be disappointed.
