ADDITION:  Since I've been using this, I believe I know why the screen is tilted backwards, since it appears that when viewing straight eye level that the screen seems darker, but if you stand up and look downward, then it lightens up, if you are looking upwards at it as if it was on a higher than eye level shelf, then the screen goes dark, this is a lcd specific problem...so I suppose if I want to actually see everything in the proper brightness that I'm supposed to put it on the floor?  I didn't have this problem with the other lcd tv I have out for repair.  I'm not quite sure that that maxing out the brightness control is the right thing to do, having already gone to seventy percent.  I can't imagine what this would be like used as a computer monitor, sitting in front of it.  If it weren't for that "1080P", because of the viewing and the worthless sound, I'd return it in exchange for something else......I bought this little "gem" of a tv as a temporary use tv while my Sylvania 32 inch year old 720p is off for fixing or replacement on my store bought warranty, but I selected this tv for 1080P only and had to buy locally at Wal mart so I wouldn't miss a show on that night on dish network, and nice that it was also LED lit so I get to experience two of the latest things of max high def and fancy lighting that produces less heat(sure would have come handy this last summer during those scorcher mid days where the sylvania lcd helps heat up the room), and I watch tv in a smaller spare room, so size doesn't mean much to me as long as it aint too small.  As expected, the sound was like a message from the company that nobody is really watching tv generally without a sound system attached, and I used component cable to attach video to the tv, sound patch cords from my satellite receiver and part of the same component cable to my "tv sound" port on the back of my stereo receiver, I think I need one of those optical cables to adjust sound on the receiver via tv remote control of the tv.In the box there seems to be offers of extended warranty through vizio, wished I knew about that cause I bought a two year extension service plan through wal mart effective after the one year warranty, hope I won't need it.EXTRA ADDITION:  Of course, I get my 32 inch sylvania back, a perfect tv for my living now since I can see tv from the kitchen or across the room, and there is no darkening or lightening worth even notice to mention like this vizio, I mean, I thought so.  I don't know why the vizio is so view angle sensitive.  No, I'm not inclined to return it, cause I need two tv's right now, and $278 wouldn't get me but a el cheapo lg 32" 720P standard lcd.  The real trick was the way the display model was on display at Walmart, since display models are always set on "store" or some other word, having brighter backlight likely at 100%, something to think about when considering a display model, cause the screen life is supposedly 30,000 hours at half brightness, somehow, I did adjust the angle of view with a book, tilted it straight up and down, and setting the backlighting to 50% custom setting, with 55% brightness, even then I'd like to go to seventy to 75%, but it seems okay for now on most things and I don't want a premature failure cause believe it or not, I'd like to use this for a long time, maybe someday as a computer monitor, or a kitchen shelf tv, when or if I get some sort of tv later that has all the latest bells and whistles and is fourty inch or much larger, I mean, I'm bout to retire to the trash in pieces a philips magnavox Nov 1999 32 or 36 inch(very heavy), seems like I paid $300 plus dollars for that thing back then, and it didn't have but 75 ohm connector and composite connectors in(yellow, red/white), so television longevity is important to me, and should be to all americans, it just isn't acceptable that any tv $300 and over should only be worth two, maybe three years.
