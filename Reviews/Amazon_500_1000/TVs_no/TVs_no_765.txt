All I can say is that I'm very disappointed with this TV. I have had nothing but problems with the TV and Samsung has tried to get out of doing anything to help.First, the TVs picture is terrible. I have DirecTV HD service and my 7-year-old Panasonic 1080i plasma TV has such a superior picture to this Samsung plasma TV, it isn't funny. When the Samsung TV is powered up, in the upper left corner of the TV screen, a box shows the quality of the picture being displayed on the screen. Mind you, this is supposed to be a 1080p HDTV, but the numbers I have received in the upper left corner have been 1920 x 1080/60i or 1920 x 1080/60p. I contacted Samsung about this asking for an explanation and the reading was blamed on the cables I was using. I purchased new cables built specifically for a 600Hz TV when I purchased this TV and after chatting online with the Samsung rep, I replaced the cables thinking the cables were bad. The cables were fine. Replacing the cables did nothing to the picture quality or the numbers displayed in the upper left corner of the TV screen.Two weeks ago, the QWERTY remote control that comes with the TV starting to work on and off. Within the last couple of days the remote quit working altogether. I have a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone and downloaded the Samsung TV remote app to my phone so I am still able to use the TV. I just got done chatting online with a Samsung rep and the rep had me remove the batteries to reset the remote. That did nothing. The batteries have been replaced twice just in case there was a problem with the batteries. No change. Then the rep wanted me to reset the Bluetooth link between the remote and the TV. The rep sent me a link to their website with instructions for resetting the Bluetooth on the remote and the TV. Well, resetting the Bluetooth on the remote and TV requires a remote that works. My remote DOES NOT WORK! The rep suggested I use the instructions shown in the link, twice, and then said he could give me a link to purchase a new QWERTY remote (the remote sells for $99.00 on Amazon.com; do a search on Amazon to see the poor reviews of this QWERTY remote control). I have owned this TV for less than 3 months and everything is under warranty for one year. I registered my TV with Samsung on their website when I received the TV and it shows both TV and service is covered for one year. Samsung customer service leaves a lot to be desired!I had to ask to speak to a manager before the rep finally agreed to replace the remote.I have also sent an email to Paul's TV, via the Amazon website, and I have yet to hear from them. (I purchased this TV via Amazon.com, but Paul's TV was the seller of the TV and not Amazon.com).If you order from Amazon, be sure you are purchasing from Amazon itself and not a secondary provider selling though Amazon.com. Also, for something as large as a TV, buy locally; don't buy something this large via mail order. You will get much better customer service from a local retailer than you will trying to get help from a retailer thousands of miles away. Once the retailer has your money, that's all they care about.If you are looking for a new HDTV, stay away from Samsung! The quality of the Samsung TV is just not there! I should have purchased a Panasonic 3D-HDTV plasma TV as a replacement TV rather than the Samsung. I had absolutely NO problems in all the years of owning my Panasonic HDTV. My Panasonic TV still works perfectly, but I wanted a larger screen and 3D capability. The Panasonic screen is 42" and the Samsung screen is 51".As I said before, I do have a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone and the phone is awesome. Samsung got the phone right, but their TVs leave a lot to be desired - which is mainly quality.I have learned a very expensive lesson. Please learn from my mistake.*****************************************************************************NEW Below***************************************************************************Per some comments to this post, I have made some changes and I've increased the star rating of this TV. The picture is much better now with the changes I've made, but I am going to see how the various shows and channels display over the next week or so to see if anything major has actually changed. I will update my review again in a while.
