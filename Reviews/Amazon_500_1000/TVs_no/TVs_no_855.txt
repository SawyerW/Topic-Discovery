Wow!!!!What a shock I had upgrading to this TVI have had this TV for 4 days now and am extreemly happy with it.Don't laugh to hard at this, but I was using an analog 32 inch TV untill last thursday.This TV was the perfect upgrade for me, same height as the old analog but alot widerI plugged everything in, 2 HDMI cables, RGB Cables, old antena, hung it on the wall with the Cheetah Wall Mount I purchased with it, plugged it into a new APC AV Surge protector. Turned on the TV, setup the wireless connection, setup my profile, downloaded the new Widgets to get Amazon Instant Videos and started watching my Video Library in about 30 minutes.I was suspect at videos where Amazon says they are viewable in Hi Def on your TV, so I setup my TV on Amazon instant videos and last night I watched DR. Doolittle in High Def, WOW what a huge differanceThis TV is super clear, love the 120hz (I was looking at some of the TV's under $400, and all were 60hz), the boot up is a little slow, but not anything to complain about.I select Amazon Instant Video and search, go to my Video Library, check Prime Instant Videos, selecting the videos is fast, so far all the movies I have purchased are viewable in Hi Def on the TV (where they are not all in Hi Def on my computer monitor).I sign up for the TV Series I want to watch and subscribe to weekly updates, this is cheaper and better than having cable.It is kinda like a kid in a candy store, I love love love this TV.I was shocked that it was a Prime item (free shipping).The only complaint I have is it was a day late getting here (2 day air with Prime), I called Fed EX and was told it was labeled on Monday but not shipped till tuesday, and arrived on thursday (it should have been shipped on monday and arrived on Wednessday, sheduled to arrive on Wednessday anyway), but it got here and I am extreemly happy.If I could give this TV 10 stars I would.I did allot of research on TV's before I purchased (about 6 months) learnig all I could, talking to friends and family about their experiences, Visio has thumbs up from everyone I have talked to that has one (about 10 people I talked to, my Brother has 2).I dont have any 3D movies yet, and am still using my RGB DVD player. will be purchasing a new Blue Ray 3D player next month and a new multi region DVD Hi DEF player also, I doubt I will purchase any 3D movies untill the price drops allot.I never dreamed that a TV could connect to the internet (looking from my analog world), or that I could purchase a Hi Def TV this good for such a great price.I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for above 32 inch and under 50 inch
