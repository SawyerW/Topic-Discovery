Purchased this HDTV for under $1K early 2010 and I of course have been doing shopping for a LCDTv for quite some time then.When I ran across this TV being displayed next to Sony,Sharp,Samsung and a few other brands I was simply amazed how the quility on the Philips not only looked as good as the Sharp but looked better than other displays there Sony included.Normally i'm a Panasonic fan but when I compared them I had to go with tyhe Philips.What you get 120hz processing,480i,480p,520p,720p,1080i & 1080p.4 HDMI connectors,1 USB for firmware upgardes and Picture & MP3 playback,2 component,2x-composite,2x-s-video Plus2 more audio options. Unfortunately no optical.Have tested Blu-ray playback with the Sony Playstation 3.And the colors are rich & deep and the resolution is very sharp. The black levels are excellent on Blu-ray play back. Alos should mention that the tv handles 24hz playback excellently just as the director intended.Standard TV depending on what service you use I have tested with Bright House and Verizon Fios cable.Bright house standard picture was acceptable but you could plainly see digitization during some shows depending on the channel you are watching.Bright house HD content was very nice at 1080i and again this depended on what HD channels you were watching.Verizon Fios cable standard is above acceptable the standard picture quality is a bit moresoft than sharp but there is no digitization that can be seen good detail and excellent motion.Verizon Fios cable HD programming: I dare say it's close to Blu-ray quality on most HD channels of course not quite as sharp or deep as a BR movie but very impressive.The sound on this TV again depends on service Brighthouse the sound is loud and acceptable through TV speakers.Fios The sound is very very low requires me to turn on home theater system to hear it properly.On a note the speakers are placed behind the casing so this also muffles the sound and they do sound decent not excellent this is where Sony's TV came ahead thier sound was more crisp and louder.From edge to edge the Tv stays bright in all corners and also stays sharp in the corners as well.I have tested PC hookup and was pleased Surfing the net at 1920x1080 was sharp and easily able to read it was as sharp as my Computer monitor.Also tested Crysis,Gears Of War and a few other games on the Tv they looked incredible on the Philips and there was almost no tearing presnt when I had Vsync off in game my PC monitor tears terribly the Philips TV surpassed my 23" LCD monitor that I use daily on my PC.Xbox 360,Wii and of Course Playstation 3 playback same discovery it looks sharp and plays well.The Playstation 3 games do sound much better through my Surround system since thier games support DTS sound.something Nintendo and M$ do not offer in thier games.All in all this product is awesome and I hihly recommend this set to anyone that does not wanna spend Sony or Samsung prices but want the same quality.Just make sure to do your home work before purchasing any TV this is an investment and should be something that fits your price range and needs.
