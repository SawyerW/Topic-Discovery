This is my first medium-plus-sized flat-screen TV purchase (unlike my early-adopter friends, who rushed to spend $4+ figures on the first-generation 720p plasma flat-screens a few years ago, I was content to wait patiently until 1080p became available in the mid-3 figure price range, which is now), and overall I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.As a first-time LCD-TV buyer, I can say little about how the picture quality stacks up against other new LCDs (but friends who know better than I tell me it's "decent", if not spectacular); but it is, of course, a big jump up from the CRT I had been watching prior (and for which I paid about the same amount, 15 years ago!).So far, after a couple months of use, I can say:PROs: excellent value for money, decent build quality (no "dead" pixels I can see, which I was worried there might be), a great step up from a CRT TV (if you're one of the few people left doing that), pretty good ATSC reception (pulls in some pretty weak TV channels my ATSC converter box generally didn't), good connectivity options (very happy with the 3xHDMI and 2xComponent inputs, but the single Composite video input necessitated a composite input switchbox, which was cheap to add).CONs: No-frills exterior (any finish you like, so long as it's gloss-black plastic), power-on takes a couple of seconds (or maybe, all flat-sceen TVs do?) during which TV briefly makes some odd popping and clicking noises (not loudly, but in a quiet room you do notice), channel memory occasionally "forgets" settings (so that channels you wanted skipped, unskip themselves from time to time), IR remote sensor tucked into lower RH corner (so if TV is set in a cabinet, remote is blocked from the entire RH side of the room - unlike TVs with center-placed IR sensors, which can pick up remote commands so long as you can still see the screen), remote codes not well covered by aftermarket remotes (you're fine if you use a "learning" aftermarket remote control, but it would have been nice if this brand was popular enough for aftermarket remotes to have its control codes as presets).Overall, if this is not a great TV, it's not a bad one at all; and for someone (like myself) finally upgrading from that old CRT, you really can't beat it's value-for-dollar price at this point (so far as I can tell). So far, I'm a pretty satisfied customer; and odds are if buyers don't expect too much from this TV, I would think most people would be as well.UPDATE: After reading mention from another reviewer here, that ProScan is related to RCA (how exactly, I didn't quite catch), I thought I'd report that some aftermarket universal remotes *can* be programmed to control this TV without having to be "trained" to do so, using preset codes for "RCA" model TVs. I've discovered this is true, for both Philips and GE universal (NON-"learning") remotes. Note that none of the listed "ProScan" control codes work, but one or two of the codes under the "RCA" brand DO work. So, if you're one of the folks who like consolidating all your devices onto one universal remote for everyday use, I can report this TV can be used with them also, just so long as you try TV control codes for "RCA"-brand TVs. I hope someone else out there can use this tip.
