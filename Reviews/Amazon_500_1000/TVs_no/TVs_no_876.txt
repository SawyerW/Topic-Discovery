I bought this tv from a store that sells coustomer returns.The main reason people return lcd and led tv's is because they do not know how to properly adjust all settings to make a lously picture look awsum.When i got the tv home and set up a dvd player the picture looked like crap.I went into the settings and turned on noise reduction to high,color enhancer is set to high,,advanced adaptive luma is set to high,,enhanced contrast ratio high,real cinema also on percision.Smooth motion on high.Film mode auto.Then i go into the picture settings and set picture mode to vivid..You must leave the picture mode on vivid.I now put in a bluray movie called speed racer which has the most amazing picture of any movie ever put on dvd.I started the movie and broke down and cried because i had a picture that looked like it came from the heavens with no defects or artifects ect.sad thing is that the majority of people take the tv out of the box turn it on and return it for a refund.I go all around san diego and professionally set up tv's that someone was going to send back for a refund and never buy that brand again.When i am finished The people are amazed at what i did.Please keep this in mind before you give a tv a bad review and send it back.Do your home-work.This is the most awsum tv on the market.Vizio is awsum. Note: one problem with this tv is the auto feature that automatically changes the inputs, like when you are using your pc and pop in a bluray dvd the input automatically switches to bluray.When this happens, all the picture settings that you set for pc input are gone.I have my tv set for manual input selection.that means I have to go to the menue and change the input from pc to bluray to watch movies.Before I popped in a movie the very first time I went to bluray input on the tv and adjusted all the picture settings to my liking for that input and saved each one. Without doing it this way, when I go back to pc input I find all my settings have not been saved for that input.Example is I keep my pc and bluray on vivid settings and all the advanced picture settings the same for bluray and pc. Remember,when you adjust all the picture settings follow the instructions in the manuel to save each setting.Other wise you will have to re-adjust all the settings each time.Another example of this is when you set all the picture settings for pc input and save the settings for that input,you also have to go to the bluray input and set all the picture settings all over again for that input and save them.I have had this tv for about 7 months now and people are amazed at the picture. One final note: when you watch blyray movies,go into the settings on your bluray player and set the picture to 24p film mode.
