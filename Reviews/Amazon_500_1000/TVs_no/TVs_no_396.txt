This brief review compares certain features of the LG 42LD550 with Samsung LN40C630.These features applies to all sizes of the LG LD550 series and the Samsung C630 series.I had the opportunity to test both TV sets side by side (See Technical Problem below).IN GENERAL- First of all the pictures on both TVs are outstanding.- I did not notice any imperfections in the LCD display on either set.- The base on the Samsung is of superior quality and very rigid whereas the LG model is a bit flimsy (this is irrelevant if you mount the TV on the wall).- The remote controls are comparable however the Samsung has built-in light and the LG does not.- The LG's price tag was $78 higher than the Samsung however the screen on the LG is two inches bigger and the LG has more features (details below)TECHNICAL PROBLEMOne of my objectives was to view MP4 video from a USB hard drive and from USB memory sticks.The Samsung would play part of the MP4 movies and suddenly stop then skip to the next movie when playing from either the stick or the hard drive.It would play 1 hour 25 minutes and 43 seconds of two of the movies and only 24 minutes of a third movie.I tried a 30 Gb and 8 Gb formatted with NTFS and FAT32 respectively.Yes, I verified that the latest software/firmware was installed by connecting the TV to the internet via the Ethernet port.I tried both USB ports but the problem remained.SAMSUNG "TECHNICAL SERVICE"The Samsung customer service rep explained "that this TV model was not designed to play full MP4 movies, only short clips".She offered to schedule a service visit but made it very clear that they would charge me for a service visit if they did not find a problem with their hardware.I talked to two representatives and finally asked to talk with a technical service rep. They promised me that he would call me back within 24 hours.I eventually gave up waiting, returned the TV and ordered the LG for an additional $78 instead.Nobody from Samsung has ever called me back (it has now been weeks).WHY LG MAY BE A BETTER CHOICEThe LG model has no problems playing my MP4 videos. It plays from my 1 TB hard drive and any USB memory stick (FAT32 or NTFS format).It will even play M4V video which is Apple's file extension for MP4 containers.Here is the best part!Apart from the extra 2 inches (screen size) the LG model offers:1) Netcast, providing direct access to online viewing of Netflix, YouTube, Yahoo weather (and others).2) Free Nero MediaHome 4 CD opening up for Digital Living (DLNA) capability allowing you to access wired or wireless computers or other networked devices throughout your home to the TV.NETCASTUsing the Netcast feature, I no longer have to have my laptop PC connected to the TV to watch NETFLIX and it appears that the picture and sound quality is better than via a connected PC. Also I like to be able to select, start/stop and pause the movies from the LG remote.The TV has the RGB and stereo mini plug for a PC in case you still want to hook one up.I connected the TV to my home network by wire because I like the "wired" Ethernet speed and reliability (wireless is also available - see other reviews for details).NETFLIX was very easy to set up. Simply push the Netcast button on the LG remote, click on the Netflix icon. Enter the code displayed on the TV on your PC and you can start watching Netflix movies (obviously you must have a Netflix account or sign up for one). For only $8 per month you can watch unlimited movies without commercials. (I have come to realize that life is too short to spend part of watching TV commercials).DLNA (Digital Living Network Association)Installing Nero on my computers allows the TV to access any drive on my network. From the LG remote I can browse all Music, Video and Family pictures stored anywhere on our home network (Nero requires you to allow access to the specific folders before the TV is allowed access).The LG rep informed me that TVersity software (free) will also work as an alternative to Nero (I have not tried it yet).INITIAL SETUPThe initial setup was equally easy for both brands. The Samsung software/firmware was up to date. It took a short while for the LG to update from version 06.01.05 to 08.02.16 which may be because LG issues updates when new Netcast services comes online.The initial channel lineup was easier to manage on the Samsung.LG CUSTOMER SERVICEThe TV arrived without the Nero CD.I therefore called LG customer service. They told me that they may not be able to ship the missing CD. Instead they suggested I download the trial version from Nero.I therefore contacted Amazon Customer Service and they instructed LG to send me the CD. LG has confirmed that it "is in the mail".I am still waiting for the CD (at the time of this writing).I am currently using the Nero trial version which does not support MP4!!!CONCLUSION$78 for all the extra functionality and two extra inches is well worth it.
