I was a big fan of LCD tv's for years and had many of them.I never considered plasma as they all looked dim in the store.I also could not understand why they were much cheaper than a equivalent LCD, assuming they were inferior.Finally I decided to take a gamble and purchase this set, one of the best decisions I have made tv wise.Picture is great, every bit as bright as a LCD.Colors are much deeper than a LCD, so much that you need to resist the temptation to keep the screen so bright it washes out the colors.And the blacks, well you have never seen blacks until you purchase this setThats the thing with LCD's, everyone keeps them so bright, the colors wash out and you have a inferior picture.You must calibrate this set. There are many settings and spending a little time with it will result in a picture you would not think possible out of a television.These new plasmas are light and thin, much lighter than previous plasmas.Samsung claims the are no more burn in issues, and the tv needs no break in.This is still a hotly debated subject, so I would not recommend any still picture for hours on end just to be on the safe side.I have ZERO buzz out of this set, although some have complained that the set they purchased has a buzzing noise.No common lcd issues such as flashlighting, halos, color bleed etc.Reflections can be a problem as with most LCD tv's and plasma's, I have always kept the blinds drawn for daytime viewing although I am the only one in the household that notices it.The internet acces is a plus, I bought samsung's wireless dongle and it connected immediately to my wireless network.Netflix on this tv is awesome, which puzzled my as the quality on a computer screen is less than average at best.This tv is just full of options, more of a mini computer.For the money, this top tier Samsung offers the best picture and features that can be found at a price at least a thousand less than samsung's comparable LCD.The remote is much improved over previous samsung remotes, and has a good layout.So don't let the dim unadjusted picture in a store sway you, they are kept like that to influence you to the LCD which carries a higher profit margin.I guess you could call this set one of the best kept secrets on the plasma market and carries my highest recommendation.The only thing that was laughable was the delivery.The set was supposed to be brought inside and tested to see if it was working.The trucking company sent out one little gentleman, that looked to be in his late sixties, I had to get my teens to get the set in the house, this poor guy had no chance to get it in.I shudder to think what would of happened if there was no one available to help, or if the tv had to go to a second floor.I was expecting two people, which I felt was needed, but the shipping was free, although substandard for those that don't have the ability to help.Unpacking the tv takes less than a minute, remove the strapping, remove the 4 plastic clips at the bottom, and the box slides off the top, with the tv ready for mounting, which is a TWO person operation.If you wall mount, remove the base screws BEFORE you remove the tv from the bottom of the box, the base will remain in the box when lifting the tv with no effort required.Make sure you install the ferrous cores on the power cord on installation.The power cable must be looped though these cores, or the cores will slide up and down the cord.These cores need to be kept withing one inch of the tv and the plug.A higher end power strip is recommended for power surges, as even the smallest wear down the tv's electrical comonents over time and can lead to premature failure.
