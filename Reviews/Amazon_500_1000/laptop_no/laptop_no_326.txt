UPDATE (27 NOVEMBER):So I've had this laptop for quite a while and just wanted to let everyone know whether or not it still works for me. It does, but I did swap the HDD for an SSD. The A6-1450 processor is slow loading pages 'n stuff, but then the process will kick in (The clock speed can be brought up to 1.4 GHz but this only works correctly during single-thread load. The clock speed slightly decreases when more than one core is stressed). Basically, all the reviews on this processor says the 1.4 GHz will kick in when multitasking, but in order to activate it, you must use the balanced or high/maximum performance battery profile.Before, I could only get about 3 hours with the non-removable battery, so in order to maximize the battery life, I bought the "second" battery that recently became available on the Acer website. Now I can use the laptop all day without lugging around an external battery charger!!! I would say that now I get about 5-6.5 hours - depending on the power plan that I'm using and how bright the screen is. When set to "balanced" or "power saver," I get more battery life, of course.Summary: when prices come down, I will eventually buy another laptop. One that has a 13.3" screen, 1600x900 resolution, backlit keyboard, touch screen and a faster processor. The laptops that meet these requirements are quite pricey right now, so I will stick with this "enhanced" netbook. As a student who is a moderate user (web browsing, checking email, using MS Office), I am quite happy with my purchase.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE (15 July):Amazon did a price drop about 3 weeks after I bought this, and when I tried to get a price match, I was told they only do price matches up to 7 days after the ship date. To me that's just poor, poor customer service!!!______________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE (1 JULY):Just installed an SSD Kingston Digital 240GB SSDNow V300 SATA 3 2.5 (7mm height) with Adapter Solid State Drive SV300S37A/240G to help improve system performance and what a difference! Webpages load faster, downloads are quicker, copying to or uploading from a flash drive - the speed in which these things are done have all dramatically increased!!!Best browser to use with this laptop? Firefox & Chrome. IE is slower for some reason; the webpages load slower and IE locks up a lot. If I don't close the tabs in IE, then I get the "not responding error." With Firefox, I can just minimize the browser and not have to close all the tabs out!I suppose I could have tried to buy a $800 laptop that had an SSD or an i5 or i7 processor, but it's hard to find one that comes with both. You usually have to choose - and pay more. Also, this subcompact laptop comes with a touchscreen & a backlit keyboard!  Not to mention that it's a joy to type on the keyboard and the portable size is what I was looking for.__________________________________________________________________________________________INITIAL REVIEW (27 JUNE):PROS:- lightweight- 6GB SDRAM- backlit keyboard- touchscreen- very quiet (no loud fan noise)- processor works quite well for light gaming, web surfing, Facebook/Twitter; MS Office tasks- option for a 2nd battery (not yet available, though...)- includes adapter (ACER Converter Cable) for VGA connectionCONS:- processor can't handle heavy programs: AutoCAD, etc.- downloads take longer than usual, especially if you're trying to download a large file... or if you are trying to download multiple files at the same time.- can't have many tabs open in IE10- only one (1) USB 3.0 port- no HDMI/Ethernet port; need adapter (ACER Converter Cable - sold separately)This works for me because I don't 'do' gaming; I only use this laptop for a little bit of this and that: school work and web surfing. Battery life is about 5 hrs on the Power Saver setting. The 11.6" screen doesn't bother me. Also, I am a proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (16GB, White) which I probably use more than this laptop! So between this laptop or my Samsung tablet, I have plenty of "processor power."For those looking for a cheap, portable laptop to do general everyday tasks, then this subcompact laptop is a good choice - it's really great for those who have a desktop or larger laptop and just need something more portable for around the house or for a trip to the coffeehouse.For those who need more horsepower, an Ethernet connection and a bigger screen, should look elsewhere for their computing needs.Hope this review helps, folks! ;-)
