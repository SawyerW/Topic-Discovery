update 2/4/2013.  The battery performance is really poor. Today, i charged it to 100%, used it for about 30 minutes and then let it sleep for three hours.  After using it for another ~ 30 minutes it died.  I only surfed websites, no video or graphic intensive sites were visited. Brightness was set to ~ 70% and keypad backlit was on.  The video card performance is again quite inadequate. other than those issues, no breakdowns or problems.**************************************************My wife gave me a 13 inch Mac air a month ago.  After playing with it for a month, i have to say, it is a good machine with lots of shortcomings.  To use a car analogy, i would compare it to the Honda S2000; lots of fun, reliable, beautiful piece of sculpture,  but a bit low on oomph.I will quickly summarize the pro's and con's.Pro-1.  Slick designSturdy construction2.  Light weight3.  Speedy processor for light duty work4.  Intuitive integration of software.5.  Keyboard with back lighting6.  Still the best ultrabook available, but that is about to change in less than a year with several new entries into the segment.7.  Apps available.8.  Individual keys for volume and brightness control.  This allow simple and quick changes.9.  Probably the best and most important feature of the laptop is the bright and high resolution screen.  It makes reading 10X easier and more comfortable.10. Stable OS11. Supposedly pretty much virus free. Unfortunately, i can't say the same with window systems.12. No moving parts to break down except the cooling fan which comes on only rarely.13. Trackpad- more useful than just the good old track pads, but function is a bit unreliable and takes some training.Cons-1.  Battery life is no where close to the claimed > 7 hours, unless you turn off Wifi, set at very dim level and do not run video. For routine use, 3 hours is more like it.2.  The fonts are small and not always easy to increase in size. somewhat limited customization options.3.  Slow video processor.  Most Youtube or internet video will play fine, but some will not play well or at all.  I have compared it side by side with my HP Envy and the Mac appears disabled compared to the Envy. Very limited graphic memory and not upgradable.4.  Keyboard feels flimsy.  This is subjective, but i feel that the HP envy keypads provide more feedback..6.  High initial cost of entry.7.  Mac OS- this is subjective and controversial obviously, but i find Window 7 easier to use with more customization options.8.  Windows 7 still by far has more compatible accessories and software. There are software that allow dual OS or cross compatibility, but most of them will slow down your computer and they are not necessarily cheap.9.  No USB 3.010. The power off button is one of the keys on the keyboard next to Delete and Volume control which means inadvertent power off is not infrequent unless you pay attention to it.11. Unreliable trackpad-  beautiful engineering when it works, but is often unreliable and inconsistent.  I use my good old mouse every chance i can get.To summarize, it is probably still the best Ultrabook available, but probably not for long. You will like it if you absolutely have to have a Mac ultrabook or you cannot wait another 6 months for better competing models from the PC camp.  If don't care for the Mac OS and you can wait for another few months, then i would go for Window 8 Ultrabooks which will likely be available sometime next year. Better yet, if you don't really need an ultrabook, get a real computer.
