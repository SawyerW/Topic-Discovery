The horrified experience I had with Dell Repair Depot has made me to write this review so that some of customers can be saved from fake promises made by Dell.I had issue with Laptop LCD hinges from day one and I was told by Dell Customer Care that it will be smooth with time but it didn't. Then finally the hinges appeared that It will come out if we press hard to close the LCD. Then we reported the problem to Dell and they created report and sent us Dell Depot Box with shipping label and during the entire they were prompt and quick. The Trouble started when the laptop reached the Repair Depot and I got a call that the hinges were not covered under warranty it has been put on hold. I was asked to pay $179.00 to get it repaired then I denied it as I was never informed earlier that hinges are not covered. I was told that my Laptop will be returned unrepaired on 07/17/2013. I didn't get any information on Laptop being shipped till 7/24/2013 and the repair depot status was showing that the Laptop is being repaired after released from hold. I called customer center and they said that it is not getting repaired and it will be send unrepaired. After so many follow-ups they sent back my Laptop which improperly packed and LCD broken by Dell.I have written to Dell Director - Customer care but till no positive response.Let me mention here that same Laptop had issue with Motherboard too which was replaced after 2 months of online troubleshooting.I never expected this unprofessional behavior from Dell that they will break my Laptop when I denied to pay extra being covered in Warranty.One of the Out Of warranty representative staff mentioned me that they can't return the Laptop in same condition in threatening way that If I do not pay $179 for which they said is not covered by warranty they can't return the Laptop in same condition in which sent.So now I have a Broken Laptop (Broken by Dell) which was unrepaired and I am not sure whom to contact for my grievances.At least I would never suggest any one to buy even a small part from Dell.---------------I got several calls and emails from Dell after I raised complaint with BBB about my Laptop broken by Dell Depot and they told that my Laptop LCD, Heat Sink, Hinges, Bracets are broken which needs replacement and they just need $179.00 as Diagonostic charge and they are not charging any thing for Part. Let me tell you that I have repaired my Laptop myself after going through manuals only thing which needed replacement was Laptop Base costing $16.00 which too was broken by Dell repair Depot(They took 12 days to Diagnose or say break my Laptop).So if I would have not have repaired my Laptop myself, I would have ended Paying $179.00 (Instead of $16.00) plus Taxes. Dell stop cheating your Customers please.Original Review link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2002JCN8VMM6Q?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B009FX7DGW&cdForum;=Fx1GNCQS2Y27IVA&cdMSG;=addedToThread&cdPage;=&cdThread;=Tx5MR0H0JUIZAR&newContentID;=Mx1KPHAV0LUAMLV&newContentNum;=2&store;=pc#CustomerDiscussionsNRPB
