I purchased this laptop at the end of November 2003.  I liked the laptop - lightweight, good battery life (for what I need), compatiable for wireless internet - quick - keyboard takes a little getting used to, but not bad once you get started.  I was very happy with my purchase.At the beginning of January I accidently picked up this laptop by the screen.  Apparently this caused a VERY LARGE THUMB PRINT ON THE LCD SCREEN.  So words of advice, never EVER touch the screen.In the middle of January I set my laptop down.  When I came back it would no longer go on.  I called Sony help on a call that lasted 3 hours.  WE TRIED NUMEROUS THINGS TO GET THE COMPUTER TO WORK AGAIN WITH NO AVAIL.  I WAS TRANSFERRED TO ABOUT 5 PEOPLE DURING THIS CALL.  FINALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS THE SHIP THE COMPUTER TO SONY FOR REPAIR IN CALIFORNIA.  I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS.  So off the computer went to California.  Since the computer was ONLY 2 MONTHS old they said whatever was wrong would be covered under warranty.WELL HERE IS WHERE THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS........Remember the THUMB PRINT I told you about from touching the LCD screen.  They were trying to charge me $795.00 to replace the LCD screen and would not do any repairs until I agreed to pay the $795.00 for the replacement of the LCD screen.  Not that I particullary like having a thumb print on my LCD screen, I like even less having to pay $795.00 after just purchasing the computer in November for $1,799.00.  Touching the LCD screen SHOULD NOT CAUSE SUCH A THING.  I had a DELL laptop for 4 years and touched it on many occasions and NEVER EVER had a problem.  Not once did the DELL stop working for no reason or break because I touched the LCD screen.After 2 weeks of fighting with SONY........probably a GOOD 15 hours total on the phone, it was finally decided that they would NOT FIX THE LCD SCREEN, but they would get the computer to start working again.  It has yet to be explained to me WHY the COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING IN THE 1st place.That was covered under warranty and my computer is now back 2 weeks later up and running.  I can put up with a thumb print I guess.  But words of advice NEVER EVER TOUCH YOUR LCD SCREEN.  IT IS VERY SENSATIVE.  AND SONY CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS TO BE THE WORST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE.  I probably spoke with about 20 people during this time and only one girl by the name of WENDY provided me any CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Although I do like this computer, I would not recommend it.  A computer should not stop working for no reason after 2 months and an LCD Screen should not leave an imprint after touching it.  The customer support is terrible.  If I had it to do all over again I would go back to a DELL which caused me no problems in the 4 years I had it.  It was just time to upgrade to a largeer, quicker, newer version.  The weight of this computer and style is what led me to this.  Really, its not worth it compared to the aggreviation that I have experienced and the lack of customer support.
