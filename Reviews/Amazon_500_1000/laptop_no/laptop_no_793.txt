I bought this for my daughter so she would have something for homework, research, music and entertainment. Loved the idea of cloud storage so everything was backed up automagically. My daughter LOVED it. Great little Chromebook... until it died.Less than 30 days later, it wouldn't power on. When plugged in to the charger, no lights, no life. I did some research and read about the (old) charger problems but we have the newer, square charger. I looked for a replacement charger online, but couldn't find anything. Then I looked on HP's site and couldn't find anything. I eventually called Google and got a very nice (really) young man who was more than willing to work with me. We plugged it into a 2 AMP smartphone charge with no luck. We tried a cold reset with no luck. He escalated to tier-2 support and I worked with another nice young man. We went through several iterations until he said they're going to send us a new Chromebook (and charger). Great! I PDF's my receipt and emailed it to him and he said it would be shipped 2nd Day Air "as soon as it was available."That should have been my warning right there. He couldn't tell me when it would be available. It's now a week later and so I emailed him for an update. He said he still doesn't know, but if it takes longer than 30 days to please let him know. 30 DAYS!!??!! It didn't even LAST 30 DAYS!!! Guess what prompted me to write my review? Buyers beware.************************Update: May 23, 2014After not receiving our replacement even after several weeks, I started turning to social media. I posted a review on HP's site and their site admin wrote me back saying they would look into the issue and see if they could help. I received a replacement within 48 hours of that post. It's now been a couple of weeks and we're starting to see charger issues again, with the plug having to be plugged in "just right" for it to take a charge. I don't have high hopes for the replacement at this point, but we'll have to wait and see. Having read the most recent reviews, it appears IMHO this particular piece of HP engineering is suffering from a design and/or supplier problem.************************Update: May 30, 2014HP Chromebook 11 #2 is now dead after ~2 weeks, again due to charging issues. We've tried 3 different micro-USB chargers to no avail. The Chromebook charger itself seems to be okay, as it will charge at least a couple of cell phones, but the Chromebook won't work. We've also found that while plugged in, the Chromebook will sometimes suddenly turn off, and that also often happens when unplugging it. Seems like there is likely a short in the charging socket.I called Google again and opened a new case. I have to give them props for courtesy and speaking English as their native language, but once again we're in a holding pattern to receive a replacement. This is getting old very quickly.
