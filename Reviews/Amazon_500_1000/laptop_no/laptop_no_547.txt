[...][...][...][...]My Review of the Lenovo Essentials series B575My Mission upon searching for a new laptop this time around was the following...1. My budget was VERY tight..(350$ Total MAX everything included tax also)NO refurbs unless they came with alike NEW warrantyNo used2. I needed it to do basic tasks while being able to handle Light gaming (World of warcraft,Diablo 3,SC2,Steam games) and still have a respectable battery life3. I wanted the build quality to also not TOTALLY suck even though it is an extreme budget class.Tall order for a 350$ budget right?  This laptop accomplished that on 299$  Purchased from bestbuyLet me start by saying this will be a fairly short review (Though i will add additional information upon request if someone wants to know something specific)Full Specifications:CPU: AMD E 450 APU 1.65 Ghz Dual coreGPU: ATI 6320 Intergrated into the APUHD: 5400 RPM HD 320GBRam: 4 GB DDR3Display: widescreen LED (1366 x 768) 15.6OS: Windows 7 64 bit PremiumWireless B+G+NFingerprint ReaderPort Locker4 USB slotsHDMI OUTWebcamera 0.3 MPProduct Height 1.3"Product Width 14.9"Product Weight 5.2 lbs.Product Depth 9.9"Keyboard Full size Chiclet with Number pad6 in1 media reader slotPerformance: Thus far i have play tested Diablo 3 And world of warcraft with the following resultsWorld of Warcraft using Lowest settings and the default Resolution Provides a consistent 30-45 FPS in a large scale Battleground enviorment (Settings can be turned slightly higher in 5 mans or questing solo)Diablo 3 Is quite playable at 20-30 FPS on lowest settings i was very surprised this game was playable at ALL on this machine let alone respectably playable at thatHD movie playback 720P is without issues on NetflixMultitasking is ok as long as you don't get TOO unreal once i had Pandora WoW Chrome with 4 tabs open you could notice slowdown not apparent in better CPU's.The machine sadly however comes with TONS of bloatware you either need to uninstall or do a fresh reformat to get the max performance out of this machineBuild QualityThe keyboard is great with almost zero flex unless pushed very hard, palm rest area is equally strong..My biggest concern is the plastic behind the LCD is VERY weak and can be flexed VERY easily...I can produce no screen ripple pushing upon it..however it is a worry if the laptop sits inside a bag for long periods traveling and gets bumped around a ton.  Also the DVD drive is a bit worrysome as it shoots out much like a bullet and the tray is very stiff..not smooth at all.  The biggest annoyance is the USB/Power cord slot...they are the stiffest i have EVER encountered...i thought i was going to have to buy a mallet to work a USB mouse into any of the ports...it's insane you REALLY need to push to get anything in them..The power cord is also slightly stiff but not as bad.  The Screen is what it is..it has apparent light leakage to be expected for a budget machine but is largely not noticable when gaming or video watching..it's Plenty bright even on LOW which is fantastic for battery savings.BatteryThus far the only test i have run was playing World of Warcraft on LOW brightness but HIgh performance the laptop lasted 3 Hours 22 Minutes before shutting down.  I will add further Battery tests as i go through them myself with time.HeatHeat on this machine is fairly non existant even when gaming under load their is a tiny bit of warmth on the left Palm rest side when under heavy load but nothing of major concern.Ultimately i went with lenovo as when you are dealing with this price range you are dealing with cheap build quality across the board and compared to similar brands/specs this was the best built of the bargains and Lenovo has a great reputation
