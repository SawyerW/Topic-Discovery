This compute is absolutely the cream of the crops. I purchased this MacBook air and the 13 inch MacBook pro and compared them exhaustively and finally decided to keep the MacBook air and here is why. This computer has a wayyyyy faster SSD drive which translates to programs starting up almost instantly, faster start up times and way faster sleep times, with the MacBook pro it takes a couple of seconds for it to go to sleep which might be a problem if you want to grab the computer and hit the road instantly and the storage I thought would be a real issue but i found it to be not a problem at all for me since I have a portable external drive. The most important deciding factor for me was the screen. This has a much better screen that the MacBook pro, it has a much higher resolution that makes MacBook pros almost fuzzy(you have to see them side by side and it will be hard to choose the MacBook pro after seeing the airs screen) it has much higher contrast ratio but i have to say MacBook pro has a little bit brighter screen but this has way deeper blacks which makes MacBook pros black level almost grey. (I tested and calibrated both of them with Xrite I1 Display Pro) MacBook airs contrast ratio was 814:1 compared to 620:1 for the MacBook pro. the only advantage MacBook pro has is color gamut which to be honest isn't really noticeable after you calibrate the screens. Overall I think MacBook airs screen is the next best after retina display MacBook pro in the MacBook line. Asus UX31A has a better display which is an IPS panel, but to me and IPS panel is not really that necessary for a laptop as it is for a tablet since you won't be changing your position very often but i have to mention that MacBook airs screen has very good viewing angles even though it is a TN panel. In my opinion MacBook airs advantages far outweigh its disadvantages compared to the Asus, specially once you consider how amazing trackpad and keyboard are on this little machine. This is the first time I have switched to mac and it is exactly what i thought it would be, an operating system that is straightforward user friendly and not riddled with problems like windows 7 and can serve users form amateur to advanced levels. I feel like i can multitask way more efficiently than i ever have on windows(I used to have a Sony VPC laptop with a standard voltage Core I5) and I absolutely love the ram memory management which makes even the most tedious tasks such as running photoshop CS6 final cut pro x, chrome with dozen of tabs open iPhoto, Skype, etc. makes it feel like you have way more than 4GBs of ram.This is the laptop to get if you don't feel like the retina pros are worth the dough, I highly recommend this laptop and with amazing resale values of macs i feel like this is a bargain.
