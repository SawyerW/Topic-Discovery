I purchased a Lenovo Y580 "gaming laptop" for the good nVidia GTX 660 GPU & generally quite nice specs (1920x1080 res, Blu-Ray [in the model I bought]) for the asking price. I was unable to resolve the problems described below & ended up buying a Lenovo Y500 (I'm not a Lenovo devotee; the value/price/performance is right for me). 18 years of repairing computers (HP, Dell, IBM/Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, Gateway/e-Machines, Samsung) has taught me that no manufacturer (most & least reliable I've encountered were both IBM laptops) makes a great (I'm talking long term reliability, not "on paper" specs) machine every time, so I buy the best value that meets my current needs regardless of the OEM.Things to consider when evaluating a Lenovo Y580:-Y580 has the higher performance GeForce GTX660 vs Y500's GeForce 650 but most Y500's have (Ultrabay) dual/SLI video cards included-Y500 is actually a newer model than the Y580 (same form factor)-looks like the entire "Y" series from Lenovo only include 5400RPM (no 7200RPM) HDD's-Y500 has "Ultrabay" allowing swapping of the extra GPU with a fan, optical drive, 2nd HDD (cursory search can't find any for sale though)-1366x768 res or 1920x1080 (uncommon for a 15.6" screen laptop)-Blu-Ray or DVD options (couldn't find any Y500's with any optical drive)-white (Y580) or red (Y500) keyboard backlightingI'm relating my experience primarily to inform people of the "solution" (read the last paragraph) Lenovo presented to me to "fix" my Y580. I believe this is potentially a solid value in a gaming laptop as long as you don't have to deal with their tech support.The machine worked fine during normal computing but problems appeared when I started trying to play games requiring 3D acceleration. I believe it was continuing to use the integrated graphics card & wasn't auto-switching (should be seamless) to the nVidia GPU as it should have. I tried Borderlands 2, Saints Row the Third, Dungeon Defenders, Left 4 Dead (1). Since I don't see reports of similar problems from others (Amazon & other sites with reviews), I suspect I got an isolated defective machine.Problems I encountered with ALL the games I tried: flickering "sparks", 5-60+ second pauses (not frame rate drops), freezes (switching to task manager & back would sometimes unfreeze the game), unexpected game close with: "graphics card has stopped responding & recovered", Win8 equivalent of BSOD's (a sad face).I used the convenient one button "restore" feature (to restore Win8 to factory condition) twice while self troubleshooting (so I KNOW the software was Lenovo standard) before calling Lenovo for help.After some moderately helpful (professional, friendly; acknowledged that there was a problem & that I'd need higher level tech support) but ultimately fruitless troubleshooting, I was referred (had to dial another number; no direct/warm transfer) up the tech support path to someone who after more fruitless help blamed the problem on the fact that I was trying to run games.He told me that, since it was a software problem, I'd need to call another number. He was confident that they'd be able to solve my problem in under an hour by changing some settings in Windows & it would only cost $60 an hour to fix my machine so that I'd be able to play games on my new gaming laptop. Paying $60/hour (it may have been $59 or $59.99) is unacceptable to make a gaming laptop capable of playing games. The Y580 met all my requirements (1080 res, Blu-Ray, gaming GPU; I compromised the 17" screen) so I would have exchanged it but the seller was out & discontinuing the Y580.
