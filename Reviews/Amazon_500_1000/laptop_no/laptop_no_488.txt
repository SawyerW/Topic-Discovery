I will try to provide potential future consumers with an accurate and thorough review of this computer.The Apple MacBook notebook offered for sale on this Amazon catalog page presents a good value for the money.  Of course, this is an older model Apple product, having been released and sold approximately at retail stores in 2007 and 2008.As such, it is reasonable that one can expect it to have some cosmetic signs of previous use (for instance, some peeling/cracking to the edges of the palmrest is a famous and common issue on the original white MacBook models), and to be of different appearance from what Apple is currently selling through its Apple Store outlets.  Apple no longer manufactures any portable notebook in a white-colored plastic body (having since moved on to the 'aluminum' colored "unibody" design).All this being said, the average consumer should still find this to be a nice looking computer, and it is capable of running the large majority of the software that is out there today for the Apple Macintosh platform (as of the time of my writing this review, late 2012/early 2013)-- probably greater than 99% of what is available today.This machine runs Snow Leopard, which offers a high level of compatibility both with Mac software products from earlier in the decade (i.e., the PowerPC era circa 2002-2006/7), all the way up to recent software releases like productivity suites such as Microsoft Office 2011, iWork '09, iLife '11, as well as serving as an above-average to good platform for Photoshop CS4 and CS5 and CS5.5, Logic Pro / Logic Studio and some light video work and editing with Final Cut Pro and Final Cut Studio 3. (None of these additional software products is included with the device, aside from the operating system).For the software all users can appreciate, the latest versions of iTunes, Safari, FireFox, Chrome, and Skype all run on this model.It can even play some not-too-3D-graphics-intensive games like the popular Minesweeper and WoW respectably enough, limited only by the use of an Intel-based integrated graphics chipset.Amazon 'on-demand' streaming video (currently Adobe Flash based), YouTube (both Adobe Flash and HTML5 based), Google Video (Adobe Flash or HTML5), Netflix (through the downloadable Microsoft Silverlight plug-in) and Hulu (Adobe Flash) streaming work quite well on this machine, although you may wish to add more RAM or limit the number of applications you are multitasking with if you are intending to have HD level video output with these streaming services (720p grade quality seems to be the upper limit on this machine for these services).Facebook applications depending on Adobe Flash also run very well on this model in my personal experience.  You can watch standard video DVDs, and burn audio discs and data CDs.  It has a built in 'iSight' webcam (approximately 1.3MP resolution) and microphone for video chatting or Skyping.This MacBook can be expanded up to 4GB of RAM (it uses DDR2 SDRAM SODIMM sticks; use 256MB/512MB/1GB/2GB PC2-5300 or PC2-5400 modules for best compatibility); it comes default from the manufacturer with 1GB of RAM, so there is still some potential room to grow.  It can handle any 2.5" SATA hard drive from the usual 60GB/80GB/120GB/160GB suspects all the way up to the current 1.0+ terabyte models (if you should feel the need to upgrade).  There is no SD or media card slot on this model. The LCD is a glossy finish widescreen display supporting up to 1280x800 resolution.  Mini-DVI video output, digital headphones out, digital microphone/line-in, 1 IEEE1384 Firewire port, 2 USB 2.0-compliant ports, built-in gigabit wired ethernet and high-speed wireless 'Airport Extreme' networking round out the set of features on this laptop.This machine does not run Mountain Lion, but Snow Leopard, as said before, can run the majority of everything important out there software-wise at the moment, and is among the most consistent and reliable releases of Mac OS X that Apple has thus far released.If you can live knowing you are not running the latest model (which may be hard for some users, given the designer brand nature of the Apple name), instead appreciating the still high level of software compatibility this model allows and recognizing the general elegance and snappiness of the Apple software interface [even on an older model], and if you can live with small cosmetic shortcomings given the age of the device, this is a *more than fair* value that should get most users through at least two years of good use.An additional plus comes from the Intel architecture of the CPU on this MacBook; you can use BootCamp, or, if you prefer, VMWare / Parallels, to run Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 as well as any PC portable with similar hardware features.
