As most of the reviews will tell you ,this is great ,so since I'm not a techie ,I will tell you about one experience I had, and not repeat things that more knowledgeable people have said .There has been a couple of people that have said you really have to charge the computer about 8 hours which I did .The next day after using it for around 4 hours ,I charged it again ,maybe for 5 hours .When I went to start it ,it would not power up .I was very upset ,I thought I had a defective computer and called Amazon to return it .My big problem was I had installed Quicken on it with all my financial information on it and if I sent it back how was I going to uninstall Quicken .No one could have moved money around because of passwords but getting into my accounts ,no problem because no password .This was Saturday and I had till Monday to decide what I should do.I called Asus and got a great tech person who simply told me to hold my finger on the start button for a minute .I was so happy to see it boot ,I HAD OVERCHARGED IT...DON"T ,but if you do, that's what you need to do.I added a password to get into Quicken .One thing I do notice that opening accounts in Quicken is quite slow ,everything else moves along .I hate Win 8.1 I was debating installing Outlook 2007 from another computer  ,but decided to bite the bullet and bought Outlook 2013 which I now  also hate ,where is the address book still haven't found it ,will uninstall and go with Outlook 2007 .I debated using  Classic Shell which seems quite popular and get's your start button back ,but on checking further I think there could be a conflict with Windows updates .You can't win.12/3/13Disaster struck after my review ,again the computer wouldn't power up ,but after 20 mins did and started updating .Fast forward one day and again wouldn't power up ,called Asus (I have to say great tech support)after they walk me through a lot .nothing worked so they did a recovery for me .After recovery which took 40 mins ,it took out my Quicken and Microsoft Outlook 2007 applications & files,I also lost all my photos and quickly found out my touchpad and keyboard and mouse wouldn't work .Tech tried to bring back my drivers for keyboard and touchpad and now I had to use the touchscreen which was the only thing that worked .Folks this is a tiny screen and trying to touch places with my thick finger ,actually they're not that thick ,it's just the icons and letters are so small .One conclusion I came out with NEVER BUY TOUCHSCREEN on a 10" computer ,it's painful .I packed up the computer and shipped it back ,so much time wasted ,3 applications removed and all my settings .This is a disaster and I had such high hopes for it .On top of that I hate windows 8.1 ,who doesn't ,and was considering installing Classic Shell ,glad I didnt I would have voided the warranty.
