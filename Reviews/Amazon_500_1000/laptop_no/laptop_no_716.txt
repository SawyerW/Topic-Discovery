Despite all the negative reviews, I took a chance and bought this laptop, and overall, it is a great laptop for the price.Pros:It is very quick.  The i5-3317u, despite being a low voltage variant of the i5, is surprisingly quick for a 17 watt processor, it is capable of downclocking itself to a minimum of 0.7ghz to preserve battery life, and turbo boost can push it to 2.7ghz when needed for that extra bit of oomph.I haven't tried gaming too much with it yet, and although my expectations were not very high for it being integrated graphics, the HD 4000 chip has surprised me, I am able to run Batman: Arkham Asylum on very high perfectly, albeit with Antialiasing and anisotropic filtering turned down.  Borderlands 2 runs without a hitch with most settings on high as well.It is very light weight, and incredibly thin, it's hard to believe that this laptop has as much stuff packed into it as it does, with such a slim form factor.This laptop stays very cool under nearly all circumstances, most of the time the bottom is only somewhat warm, after a good while of regular usage.  It warms up a bit while gaming, but that is to be expected.  The fan will ramp up a bit under heavier load, but it's never loud enough to be annoying.Physically, it feels very solid.  There is next to no give in the chassis, and several of the larger pieces, including the top of the lid and the top of the laptop in which the keyboard is set are both made of what feels to be brushed aluminum, although I am not sure about whether or not it actually is.The screen is very nice, it has a large range of brightness settings, and although it would certainly be nice if it was a full 1080p screen, that is a luxury to be saved for more expensive laptops.  I like that it is a 14" screen because it's bigger than netbooks, but it's a tad smaller than most 15.6" laptops, making it a bit more portable.It has a disk drive which is usually left out of laptops of this size and form factor for the sake of size and weight, but that doesn't seem to have affected this laptop very much.  The disc drive works fine, although it's audible when it's spinning a CD at full speed.Cons:Battery life:  Despite this being an ultrabook, battery life is where it suffers compared to other offerings in the same price range, due to the relatively small 4-cell 44w/hr battery.Windows 8:  I knew that this laptop had windows 8 when I ordered it, so it can't really be listed as a con, but I'm not too fond of Windows 8, although I've gotten used to it after having been using it for a week now.  Windows 8.1 fixes a lot of things, such as being able to boot straight to the desktop, but the amount of microsoft account integration that it tries to force, I don't like.The bloatware is another thing that I'd be happier without, new, it comes with a decent amount of bloatware, as well as Mcaffee internet security which is a resource hog and annoying to fully remove.  I've seen more bloatware on computers before, but I prefer less, for obvious reasons.Other comments:The touchpad does not have separated physical buttons, which may take some time to get used to, but it is a nice, fairly large and very responsive touchpad which I don't mind using, although I still much prefer a mouse.  It is not very conducive to gaming, but touchpads in general aren't exactly designed for gaming.The keyboard is an island style keyboard, and while not fantastic, is a nice keyboard, which I have been typing this review on, and it is a fairly nice keyboard, and well laid out as well.  The right shift key is made a bit smaller as well as the space bar to make room for the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard but this change has not affected my typing whatsoever.The function keys are a bit oddly laid out, with the volume and brightness controls on the function keys, F5 through F7 for brightness, and F10 through F12 for volume with the arrow keys instead being multimedia functions(play/pause, stop, next track, previous track)  which is a bit odd, but nothing more than a small difference, although trying to press the fn key and adjust the volume with those keys can be challenging with one hand.The speakers are quite good, for laptop speakers that is, and the webcam is decent quality, although I will not use it much.If bought new, it comes with one year Accidental Damage Protection through ASUS, which is fairly easy to register for.  It only allows one claim within the year period, but it is free, and better than no protection, so I will not complain.The ports are all very snug when new, but they get better as they are used.  For the power and headphone jacks, I am very glad that they are snug, but with the USB ports, I was nearly afraid that something was broken with the amount of force that was required to insert my USB mouse's reciever into the port for the first time, although it has since gotten better.Conclusion:Overall, this is a great laptop with a few low points that if remedied would make this a truly spectacular laptop, but for the price, it is still a great deal.  It is well built, and seems like it will be able to stand the test of time quite well.  I look forward to using this laptop for years to come.
