I have purchased every brand of computer out there in my personal capacity, as a business owner, and practice manager of a statewide medical practice and Acer quickly became one of my favorite "go to" brands because they were inexpensive while also being, by far, the best value (as in you get more computer for your money), plus, I never had any problems with any of them--ever (and we had some people who could do a number on computers). Overall, in one capacity or another I've bought five Acer laptops and desktops alone, second only to Apple products (which I started using in 2005 and never stopped).I say that to premise my experience with my purchase of this, particular Acer because, based on my prior experiences, I think I was incredibly unlucky to get a dud with this computer and therefore would not hesitate to buy another Acer. I would not, however, buy this particular laptop.I was shocked when I was actually talking to a friend on Skype who, suffice to say, is an "IT person" (it would, in reality, be an insult to call him that), the computer was on standby as we were discussing some configuration options, when there suddenly appeared a message on the screen indicating that the computer was shutting down because it was too hot. When I attempted to restart the computer, it was dead as a door nail (indicative of the motherboard going out, according to my "IT person" who saw what happened and said he had never seen something like that happen in 30 years (hence my conclusion that my experience with this particular laptop is not indicative of Acer's products)).Unfortunately, I bought the computer when I was in a crunch and therefore was not able to deal with trying to return a computer to Amazon (rather than a "brick and mortar" store) within the 30 days. I have not yet to be able trying to navigate the warranty replacement under Acer and have no idea whether that will be "quick and painless" or whether it will be like dealing with Dell 10 years ago (which was an absolute nightmare curing me of ever being tempted to buy another Dell). As it is now, it's just another problem to deal with for which I have not had time.That being said, as far as the actual computer goes, I liked it; however--and bear in mind that I used the computer for less than 20 hours and never even had it fully configured, in hindsight I think the Acer Aspire One AO756 that is currently being sold by Amazon for $299 is the best value for money spent. The Aspire One has 8 gigs of memory, dual cores (which is all you need if you won't be running any virtual machines on it, as I was planning to do), Intel, and a 320 or 500 gig hard drive. I forget the speed on the AO756, but whatever it is, I did not notice a difference in performance between the AO756 and this laptop. The most obvious difference between the two is that the AO756 has an 11.6 inch screen, which is preferable to me anyway because if I'm using the laptop's screen as my main screen rather than having it displaying on a monitor, then under almost any circumstances 15 inches is just to bulky and cumbersome.Theses are two different computers and, looking at the specs, the AO756 might not seem comparable, but I think most people would not detect an appreciable difference. I purchased this laptop because I wanted to run a virtual machine on it and therefore needed the extra power, but I don't think most people do that (I would have no idea how or why I would want to do that absent my friend's suggestion).I hope this helps someone who might be on the fence trying to figure out the differences between the various models and price points.Cheers!Melisa L.
