I bought my Zenbook Prime UX31A over 3 months ago.When I received it, I noticed that a few keys don't work (up/down/esc which I actually use as a software developer).I contacted Asus, tried updating the BIOS, and eventually decided to open an RMA.The notebook was purchased in the US, but since I travel for business all the time and been to the Netherlands at the time, I sent it to the Dutch repair center.I was told that the repair usually takes 7-10 business days.After 14 work days, I contacted them, and they said that since the notebook was not from the Netherlands, they had to order parts and I will have to wait another month (!!!).I told them that I won't be in the Netherlands by then and asked them to ship it back, unfixed, so I can send it to a different service center (Japan).They failed to send the notebook back on time even though they had 2 weeks to do so and I called every single day, sometimes 2-3 times a day!They even had the nerve to tell me that they will not ship it anywhere outside the Netherlands, even though I do not reside there...Moreover, since they did end up sending the notebook back *after* I flew to Japan, they made a mistake and wrote me an email saying I did receive the notebook and it was signed by a woman named "Linda" (I don't know any Linda! I thought my computer was lost!!!).After a lot of stress and a few days (!!!) of angry e-mails they notified me that "Linda" was actually one of their colleagues...Long story short, 3 months later, my notebook is still in the Netherlands, and still was not fixed (!!!!!).They recently offered to buy the notebook back ("buyback"), but, to my surprise, even that is turning out to be an issue since I don't reside in the Netherlands and my bank account is not in that country...I was also in touch with Mr. Tien Phan who, while being very nice, could not help me at all...He explained that while they do offer a global warranty (which is a useless joke, mind you!), he cannot contact the Dutch repair center, as they are simply contractors, and he added a bunch of other excuses which, as a customer who needs his notebook back, I honestly don't care about.Simply put, I had the notebook for a few days, could not use it, Asus failed to fix it and failed to keep me informed about how long it would take to fix it.I paid a lot of money for it which they're refusing to return.Over 3 months later, I don't have the notebook, not the money, and no idea when or if I'll get either of them back.Asus produces low-quality products, refuse to replace their faulty hardware, fail to repair it, their global warranty is useless, they directly made me lose a lot of time and money and caused me a lot of frustration.I am writing this so other people think twice before they purchase an Asus, and hopefully will choose a more reliable brand.Doing research online, I see I'm not the only person affected, and it seems like every single person gets the same kind of treatment from Asus...Do yourself a favor, choose a different brand!!!
