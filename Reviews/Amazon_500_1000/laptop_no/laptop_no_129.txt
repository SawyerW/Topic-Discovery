MacBook Pro 13-inch 2.4GHzI own this macbook pro 13" for over 6 months now and I gotta say that I expected a lot more from it. If you want a laptop to light use I do recommend a 13 inches macbook pro, if you need a full computer usability, the 13 inches is not for you, get a 15/17 inches core i5/i7 version.*PROS:1 Nice design - Looks great, nice aluminum well finished body, nice screen resolution, seems really solid.2 No virus problems.3 Good webcam quality.4 Good built in mic quality.5 Long battery lasting, around 7 hours (light use)6 Useful illuminated keyboard.7 Light weight8 Nice glass touchpad.*CONS:1 Believe me, MAC freezes! I bought this macbook because I've heard of its stability, but I was wrong, it freezes as often as I use "heavy" applications or Microsoft softwares. And you cant go back to work without restarting the computer using the power button!2 Disappointing video card. Doesn't handle even light pictures adjustments without minutes seen that little colored circle asking you to wait, that is just unacceptable for a macbook pro.3 Most Apple softwares are not so complete and easy to use as others say, its hard to manage email contacts, you cant add them easily from your email,  the software erases all your emails from your email account from the first access, need to adjust that manually, besides is gonna ask you the password over and over again all day long, no matter what you do; doesn't recognize windows files (fat32/NTFS format used in your pen drive or external HD), you must buy and install an special software for that; the Iwork doesn't replace fully the MS Office; the Aperture is to basic if compared with Photoshop or similar; Itunes is freaky to use; the Quicktime doesn't run avi, Divx or most of nowadays video formats, you must get Quicktime pro for that or pay for a bunch of plugins; the Finder (Apple Explorer) is not able to  search a file in a specific folder, is gonna check all your folders; you cant maximize to the biggest screen possible at the proper button, you must adjust the screen manually every time, very annoying.4 The keyboard gets dirty and greasy easily, looks like someone used oil in a cotton to "clean it up", and have a large space under the keys, that keeps the dirt under it, they seems to have not project that very well.5 It gets very hot with heavy applications.6 No separated mic and headphones connections, they are the same, very awkward for a Pro unit.7 The informations under it (serial number, etc) are almost gone, its erasing easily with just a few months.8 Firewire port is not the standard one, you must get a proper Apple cable.9 You need also to buy an Apple adapter to video out.10 Just two USB ports.11 No blu-ray reader available on Macs at all.12 Small and slow hard drive for the price.13 I expected a lot more performance out of a core 2 duo processor on a MAC OS, video editing or large pictures editing is not reasonable on this unit, HD videos is just unthinkable, get a core i5/i7 with a discrete video card and a ssd driver if po$$ible.14 Speakers are not loud enough for Skype use or video watching if you're not in a closed and very quite space.Overall its a good equipment, but miles away from perfection. If you don't mind paying its price is worth it.
