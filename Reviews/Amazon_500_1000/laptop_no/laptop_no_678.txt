I recently got this Sony Vaio ultrabook and thought in reviewing it I would compare some of is attributes to my Lenovo Yoga 13 since a lot of people will be weighing the plusses and minuses of these two notebooks when making their purchasing decision.First, I found the Sony computer a joy to use, very responsive and easy to carry.The Sony weighs 37.7 oz, while the Lenovo weighs in at 53.6 oz.Although both computers have 13 inch screens (13.3 inches for the Sony), the footprint of the Sony notebook is actually smaller.  It is about 1/2 inches smaller in width and length.  (Keep in mind that I'm talking about the actual external dimensions of the notebook...not the screen size.).My Sony has 128 GB Solid State Drive, while my Lenovo has 256 GB SSD.  You can get the Sony with 256 GB as well if you choose.  If you get the 128 GB keep in mind that you'll have 71.8 GB left over on the C drive when you get the computer.  After you load Microsoft Office and do all the updates, you'll have about 66.9 GB free on C drive.  But you have 2 USB 3.0 slots and an SD slot on the right side of the computer if you need additional hard disk space for photographs, videos and music.I prefer the keyboard on the Lenovo, as I find the Sony has less feel, and is a bit slippery.  But the Sony has a nice lighting if you are going to use it in a poorly lit area.  Lenovo does not have a lit up keyboard.The Windows Experience score on the Sony is 6.2, while the Lenovo is 4.8.  But in real life, I didn't find any appreciable speed difference when using the computers.  Both are able to reboot Windows 8 in about 20-24 seconds. The Sony had a  4 second edge in this regard.Both screens have very nice color rendition and text depiction.  The Sony screen is much more limited in how you view it.  It tilts about 5 degrees back from straight up. That should work for most people, but I found it a bit limiting.  My preference is if it could tilt a bit further back for more comfortable viewing.  The Lenovo Yoga will flip over completely and operate as a tablet, or tilt in a manner where the screen is propped up and the keyboard faces down, or just simply tilt back to any viewing angle you wish.  In this regard, the Lenovo is much more versatile...which is where it gets its "Yoga" name.The touchscreen on both computers worked very well.  But keep in mind that some people, including me have reported issues with the Lenovo touchscreen.  I had two separate Lenovo Yogas. In one the touchscreen worked perfectly (I kept that one).  The second had an erratic, sometimes nonfunctioning touch screen that made the computer unusable.  Others have reported similar issues with the Lenovo Yoga.The trackball is nicer on the Lenovo.  It glides much more smoothly than the Sony, and has a better/larger area to click or right click the pad. The Sony trackpad functions decently enough.  But it feels rougher.I removed the Kaspersky internet security that comes with the Sony, because the updates are incredibly slow...watching a snail crawl across a football field would be faster.  This is not a Sony issue, so don't let it detract you from the Sony at all.  I noticed this issue with Kaspersky software I bought two years ago, and was hoping they remedied the problem.  They haven't.  Instead I use Windows Defender that comes with the computer.A couple of issues with the Sony.  The screen sometimes flickers or dims momentarily when you put your hand toward the screen in the center of the computer, or when you touch a link or menu choice.  Not sure why this happens.  You can certainly live with this, as it is quite momentary.  But it is annoying.Second issue is that some people have reported they find the fan to be noisy.  Normally I don't hear it at all.  But once in a while it sounds like the background sound of waves crashing at the beach. Not bad...not an issue for me.  Maybe an issue for others.I intend to make this a rolling review, adding more feedback the more I use the computer in the next few months.========================================Update on December 13, 2013I've been using this laptop a few months now and I must say the more I use it the more I like it.  When I took a recent trip to Hawaii, I decided to take the Sony, and left the Lenovo at home.  The reason is the Sony is lighter and smaller and that made a difference --- even though they are both 13 inch screens. The Sony upgraded to Windows 8.1 very smoothly.  On my Lenovo Yoga, the upgrade to Windows 8.1 was not as smooth as the Store App opens by itself form time to time.  The Sony has no such problems. I might increase the Sony to 4.5 STARS if they had such a rating.=========================================December 28, 2013 Update: I've gotten to the point where I don't use my Lenovo anymore, because I prefer this Sony laptop.  I also recently bought a Microsoft Surface 2.  After trying it for about a week, I returned it because it couldn't do anything that my Sony couldn't do far better.  The Sony doesn't weigh much more than the Surface 2 or the Surface Pro 2.  But it works much better and has a much better keyboard -- you would expect that of course considering the price difference.  But considering the weight difference is so small, the Sony basically negates the need to get anything like the Surface models as a portable computing device. I have now raised the rating of the Sony Ultrabook to 5 STARS - after all, it works great, has a backlit keyboard, replaced the need for my Lenovo Yoga and nixed the Microsoft Surface.  Highly Highly recommended.
