....I own many ipod's and an Ipad...I am a PC user...I have a Qosmio gaming computer and a Toshiba with an i7 processor....This was an impulse buy...When people talk about Mac's its like they found the most perfect thing on earth...When I ask if they've ever tried windows 7 all they say is forget about windows as Mac is far superior..If  you are trying to compare an old XP or Vista to your newer Apple, they are not comparable....Understand that I am new  to Apple OS and trying to learn this operating system with  little help....PROs  I love processors so the i5 was a huge selling point for me...The machine runs very quickly and smoothly ***but that is the i5 processor in action***....It turns off and on quickly ...Is light weight with only OK  battery life....no defrag (which never really bothered me) and no viruses (I've never gotten a virus that Norton or Kaspersky didn't handle immediately..The  keys are backlit and have a nice feel to them.....YES I AM NEW TO THIS SYSTEM but I have found many things that make me prefer The Windows 7 operating system...The Mac operating system is not as easy as people will have you think...It certainly is Pricey though... So are all the apps and everything else you might want to use...Apple is hole for dumping money into...The machine is a wonderful web surfer but that's as far as I will go...I have had little luck with the IPhotos...several site will not work with Mac..I Miss the wonderful task bar on windows 7 ..The DOC on a mac is a nuisance and has a childlike look to it....Maybe I expected more after hearing people sing Macs praises over and over again... I will use it but I will certainly use my windows 7 PC's every bit as much... I'm not a pro musician or videographer just a computer user....I notice that something in windows takes one move and some things in Mac require several moves ..I'm sure i'll hear a lot of negative comments but It's just not the end all be all of computing like people will have you believe...As far as fast goes, any i3/i5/i7 intel processor in any half way decent machine will be fast.....I am being honest...if you are happy with Windows 7 you need look no further...On a different note  ... I am happy  with the iPad...Now that is worth owning and tons of fun*****UPDATE****** I use it to surf the internet every day and I've opened and looked at all the systems......I managed to accidentally and easily delete System preferences with is the equivalent of Control Panel..The Best Buy GS service guy didn't really know how to put it back but his information was correct (use the first recovery disc) ... I love the quick start up and shut down but, I feel windows 7 is a better and easier operating system and does not impose the limits that Apple does..**** CHANGE OF HEART****  PLEASE READ MY LAST COMENT ******
