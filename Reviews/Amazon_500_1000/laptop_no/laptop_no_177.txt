Just got this from J&R; as it's local.Only had it a few days so this is just a first impression -What a beaut! - This laptop looks and feels like my perfect ideal for a laptop, understated (no crappy chrome-esq plastic, big glowing lights etc)just a very nice matte black soft finish, nice lines, small(ish) logo, everything looks and feels so solid it just comes together and seems right, a good weight, its not trying to be sleek and light, its just doing one job (high performance) and that is how it looks and feels, I will put up with the weight (not that bad in the included rucksack). So my first impression is very favorable.So I'm in the process of getting all the software sorted out, which i guess is fun.Here's my initial pro's/cons:Pro's:1 - This beast barely breaks a sweat - I mean its so quite, the stealth image does do it justice, it's very quite almost silent, when I reran the window index thingy the sound never changed, and doesn't even feel warm.2 - Screen is lovely Matte and very very bright clear and generally amazing, way too intense in a dark room, my old dell xps 1330 which is sitting besides with both at max brightness it looks like a dull yellow compared, it has very good angular visibility too.3 - Keyboard is nice, firm well spaced out, I like the keyboard lights - without it keys actually very hard to see in low light, as the text doesn't contrast at all with the black keys.3 - Touchpad nice size and nice to have multi-touch gestures.4 - Asus software, actually some useful software(and bloatware see Cons) - like fastboot which delays boot items.5 - Backpack (rucksack) good amount of pockets, sturdy and compact, only just fits laptop in fact, but has plenty of space for extra stuff, nice touch Asus.I don't know about performance as not pushed it at all yet, but from the index score its pretty good, I am mainly using it for graphic's work so its more important to be fast processor and memory than graphics, but I am tempted to buy and try some of the latest games cos this beast is designed for them. Btw in case you don't know one downside to this rig is the graphics card has a 128bit memory bus instead of 192, which from what I have read makes a difference, the 17" has the 192 bit bus. It's no big deal for me and having a usable size for a laptop was more important than Memory bus speed, still would have preferred to have the option for this, recon most gamers will pay the extra and Asus should have made some models with the bigger bus, and given us the choice.Cons:1 - Bloatware - crappy crappy annoying bloatware, such a shame cos in my mind Asus has really got there stuff together, making some seriously decent equipment and marketing and doing everything right, except bowing to the pressure to include crap on their rigs (for a small dime no doubt) - I decided to create a backup disc set and reformat which took hours only to find that the backup disc puts all the crap on again except the drivers which you need, so either way you have to uninstall it all. I ended up taking almost everything off then using the asus utility to load the drivers and useful stuff back on. thing is there are tons of processes running and I hate not knowing whats happening behind the scenes on my rig, I wish I could completely disable/delete most of these processes and services running but I don't know what they all do.2 - included gaming mouse is nice, uninstalled software for it, limited control and adds to the startup.Will update after a while when I learn more.Update 1:Had a problem with the Realtek Lan network drivers, they kept failing to install fully and could not get windows to get the drivers to work or install, spent many hours trying to find the solution online and in their help guides, was thinking either the lan hardware was dead or in some kind of zombie like deep sleep. Eventually got it to work, uninstalled everything Realtek driver and windows device hardware, rebooted then manually installed by handpicking the type of device and the driver -thankfully everything started to work! - I now have lan working and don't have to do a emergency disk reinstall from scratch or send it back.Power4Gear Hybrid seems really buggy, doesn't connect quickly enough with the hardware button, also when I save it to screen timeout it doesn't work and the screen just stayed on, all night! - not a major bug but hope they fix with a update.Also with all the software installed or most of it, my processes list is way too big for me! I like to know what's running and keep my system simple and bare, but this is more about the extra software included, and being unsure what I can uninstall.
