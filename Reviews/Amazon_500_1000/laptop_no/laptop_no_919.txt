At first I loved the laptop. For about a week. Then I installed a few programs and started to notice problems, especially with the video. As the problems became more prevalent I dug deeper. Forums all over the Internet started talking about "random vertical lines" and "black screens". Asus was blaming the ATI video drivers. ATI was blaming the Asus BIOS. The consumer was stuck in the middle. As the random black screens & "video striping" became more frequent it became obvious that neither ATI nor Asus was claiming the problem and it was not about to be resolved anytime soon.A patch came out in August. New BIOS and new video BIOS. The problem became less frequent but still was not 100% resolved. Photoshop would push the video driver & the display would tweak out. Starcraft II never worked properly, more than 50 moving graphics on the screen and the cursor became corrupted.Now today, less than 4 months after buying the laptop the screen just stopped working. It worked fine most of the day, then nothing. Now every time it boots I get a black screen. External HDMI monitor works fine, but the main screen is dead.The "awesome Asus warranty" that they tout? Useless. With a critical system failure they have ZERO options for advanced replacement, even though I offered to prepay. The turnaround time is "ABOUT A WEEK". Which, from past experience with laptop service centers really means "ABOUT A MONTH, MAYBE TWO".Bottom line - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. IT IS FATALLY FLAWED.*** Update ****Now, 2 years old, the experience with this laptop is even worse.  After Asus kept this laptop for more than 3 months in repair (they said they "lost it") we have been struggling with it on & off for the past 10 months.The trackpad is all but useless now.  It gets "stuck" in a mode that emulates clicks when the button is not clicked causing pages to zoom instead of scroll.The keyboard often gets stuck with a control or shift key being pressed.  We often have to press the shift key twice to get it unstuck.  This keyboard is kept EXTREMELY clean.  It is rarely used as we always have an external keyboard plugged in unless we are mobile or at a client site.Two of the four USB ports are now loose and often drop connections with the device.  One of the USB ports will hard power down the entire laptop if you happen to touch a USB cord to the port upside down (like that NEVER happens), essentially shorting out the laptop.On each of these issues we reported them via the "VIP" customer service system only to wait 4+ weeks to get a response of "try re-installing the OS from the system recovery" and then a "reply for an RMA".  Yeah, like we are going to send this in again any time soon after having not had use of it for over 4 months on the last go-around.Overall this is the worst piece of technology we have owned, and one of the highest priced in recent years.  One thing is certain, we will NEVER EVER buy an ASUS laptop ever again.  Support is a nightmare for a horribly built product.*** UPDATE ***Just got the laptop back from repair AGAIN.  Motherboard was failing & hard drive would not respond.  Screen had multiple defects.They replaced the screen & reformatted the drive with an original OS (OEM) install.  I give it a 90% chance it will fail again within 90 days.  Luckily this is now a backup system at the office.My new HP Envy 17, in stark contrast to the Asus, rocks.  Aesthetically very "Applish", very polished from packaging to the actual product.  Great specs. Great performance.  All around an awesome piece of technology.From now on it is HP laptops with the 3-year on-site warranty to back them up.  Better support, service, and product for LESS than the Asus equivalents.
