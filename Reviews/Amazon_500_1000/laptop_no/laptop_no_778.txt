01/20/2014 Update This weekend my daughter asked me for a HDMI Cable. I asked why and she said that she wanted to play some web content on our 55" Widescreen T.V. She hooked it up and the movies played and looked georgous. I'm going to upgrade to 6 stars.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I thoroughly researched Chromebooks before making this purchase but was skeptical of the rave reviews. Seeing is believing.You can go to the HP Spec Page and read all the specs, so my review is about my impressions.I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I'm absolutely blown away. I just set it up for her, so on Christmas Morning she'll open it up and be up and running. This was the quickest easiest setup ever. The new Logitech Wireless Mouse Logitech Wireless Mouse M325 with Designed-for-Web Scrolling - White Paisleywas instantly recognized.The 64gb Sdxram card B00E83XHXM instantly recognized but would glitch when I tried to name a file. Simply reformatted on chrome machine and the problem went away.Speed:Every low end windows laptop that I've ever tried has been laggy.Not the HP 14 Chromebook, the Intel CPU and the 4gb Ram make the difference. This Laptop is zippy. I tested out Netflix and Hulu and they both ran flawlessly. Had plenty of tabs open without performance degradationErgonomics:The feel. Everything is rubber coated including the keys, even though this Laptop is low price it doesn't feel like it. The Keyboard just felt nice. The Trackpad is amazing, once you learn the Chrome Commands. 2 finger scrolls up and down. Hold 2 fingers down for right click. It is so darned intelligent. The Pearl color is elegant and the laptop looks far more expensive then it's price. I asked a coworker to play with it and she concurred. This definitely doesn't look or feel cheap.Monitor, while not stellar is certainly adequate, I did not feel like I was looking at a low resolution monitor. It was regular. Speakers yes Tinny but hey what do you expect for$340.00Neutral: Having a 14" Monitor and all the extras like Intel CPU, HDMI Port, USB Ports, SD Card Port and solid construction adds weight. For example the hinge for the screen is one piece going along 3/4 of the width of the screen, if it was not manufactured with weight in mind then they could have made it flimsier and lighter. More components, quality construction will add extra weight. So it is 4 pounds, plenty light for a teenager or me, If you are not looking for a full blown system and desire more of a tablet like device, then this might not be for you. I'm not taking off a star because realistically life is a series of tradeoffs.Turns out that Microsoft's scorch campaign about the Laptop being a brick when not online is BXXXXshxxxtGoogle office runs, the native movie and music player runs, and with a 64gb Sd Ram card with 9 hours of life you can watch movies, listen to music, take notes, write a paper and make a spread sheet. All the basics. OFFLINEThe equivalent performance in a Windows Machine would cost me at least double and Apple Triple.If I was Microsoft I'd be quaking in my boots.
