Big 17" backlit LED screen, huge 750GB hard drive, 6GB of memory and a 4MB L2 cache, with all the ports you need, make this a great buy for about four hundred bucks.  No, it's not an Intel processor, but AMD quad cores give solid performance, especially when combined with a relatively large cache and memory.  The 1.9 GHz A-Series Quad-Core A8 processor does a fine job and offers speedy performance using Windows 8 64-bit as an operating system.Yes, Windows 8 isn't a favorite, but get a book like Windows 8.1 For Dummies, and upgrade to Windows 8.1 (on the Microsoft site) for free out of the box, and you'll find a 'happy place' that's stable and useful on this PC.The maximum supported memory on this laptop is 8GB.  I would have liked to see it at something like 16GB, but at this budget end of the laptop spectrum, that's rare. I would have also liked a backlit keyboard, but that too is rare and not necessary, just nice to have. Bluetooth is also lacking on this PC, but you can easily solve that problem by adding one of these: Kinivo BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter - For Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Vista, which works well.  It does take up a USB port, but by adding a Sabrent Premium 4 Port Aluminum USB Hub (9.5" cable) for iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, or any PC (HB-UMAC) you solve the 'lack of USB issue' with a fairly portable, small device.The AMD Radeon HD 7640G graphics look good on this 17.3" display (1600 x 900). Movies streamed via Netfix or played on the DVD burner, look good and the DTS integrated sound is adequate, but can be enjoyed more fully by the addition of wired headphones or Bluetooth headsets (when optional Bluetooth USB adapter is installed).  This is NOT a touchscreen laptop.There's a full-sized keyboard with numeric keypad, and touchpad that supports multi-gestures with on/off.  I find I still like to use a wireless mouse with my laptops, as touchpads can be overly sensitive or not responsive enough.  This touchpad seemed to be OK though.The ports on this laptop include: (2) USB 3.0 ports, (1) USB 2.0, VGA, HDMI, and a wired Ethernet port.  The laptop has wireless built-in, as well as an integrated HD webcam with a digital microphone.  There's also a headphone 3.5mm jack and external microphone port.At 6 pounds this is not a lightweight, highly portable laptop.  It has a 3-5 hour battery life (dependent upon type of use) and with its 17" screen is rather large to haul around. Users who plan on keeping this laptop at home; moving it room to room, will think it's a good choice, as will those looking for a desktop replacement.  Students on the go will want something more lightweight and portable, unless they really want the bigger screen.I recommend this laptop as a step above the basic budget PC.  It's build quality is very good, and despite having a slower 5400RPM hard drive, it's quite quick due to its 4MB cache, quad processor and 6GB of memory.  It's got a huge hard drive and all the ports you need to be useful for a long time.I'm not crazy about how the glossy finish picks up fingerprints, and I wish it had Bluetooth, but frankly if that's the worst I can say about it - it's pretty darn sweet!SPECS PER HP SITE:Product Name 17-e079nrProduct Number E8B77UAMicroprocessor 1.9GHz AMD Quad-Core A8-4500M Accelerated ProcessorMicroprocessor Cache 4MB L2 CacheMemory 6GB DDR3L SDRAM (2 DIMM)Memory Max Maximum supported = 8GBMemory Slots 2 user accessibleVideo Graphics AMD Radeon HD 7640G Discrete-Class graphics and up to 3182MB total graphics memoryDisplay 17.3-inch diagonal HD+ BrightView LED-backlit display (1600 x 900)Hard Drive 750GB 5400RPM hard drive with HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive ProtectionMultimedia Drive SuperMulti DVD burnerNetwork Card 10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector)Wireless Connectivity 1x1 802.11b/g/n WLANSound DTS Sound+Keyboard Full-size keyboard with numeric keypadPointing Device Touchpad supporting multi-touch gestures without on/off buttonExternal Ports Multi-format digital media card reader for Secure Digital cards2 SuperSpeed USB 3.01 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.01 HDMI1 VGA (15-pin)1 RJ-45 (LAN)1 Headphone-out/microphone-in combo jackDimensions 1.16 in (min H) / 1.29 in (max H) x 16.5 in (W) x 10.5 in (D)Weight 5.99 lbPower 65W AC adapter6-cell 47WHr 2.2 Ah lithium-ion batteryID Mech Description Front facing HP TrueVision HD Webcam with integrated digital microphone
