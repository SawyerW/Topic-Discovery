First, let's get the WIFI disconnection problems out of the way. No promises, but this is what worked for me and many others:1) Update the WIFI driver to the latest one. Go to us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers to get it. As of this writing, the latest driver is version 10.0.0.225. Install the driver and reboot.2) Then, on your computer, open Network and Sharing > Change Adapter Settings > **WIFI Adapter Properties** > Configure > Power Management > UNcheck **allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** See? You want to stop the PC from turning off your WIFI to "save power."3) Then go to your Battery Settings.....Click Battery icon > More Power Options > Power Saving / Balanced / High performance > Change Plan Settings > Change Advanced Power Settings > **Wireless Adaptor Settings** > Power Saving Mode > on Battery > Change to low or medium power saving (Medium works for most people. I chose Low). Reboot one more time. Done.--------------------------Now the review. I'll update this later if I encounter problems.Pros:* Optical/DVD drive. DVD drives are growing increasingly rare in the "budget" category. Maybe you don't want/need a dvd/cd drive. I do. I think the closest rival to this laptop is probably the HP Envy Touch, and it doesn't have an optical drive.* i5 Processor. This is middle of the road. Not as slow as the i3, not as great at the i7. But the i5 does its job well. And yes, you can game on this, IF you adjust your game's Resolution and Details to Minimum, bringing the fps down. It still renders the play smoothly, example world of warcraft, sims.* Graphics card / Memory. This comes with the Intel HD Graphics 4000 card (update the 4000 card driver when you get this laptop!) - and 128MB of dedicated system memory. Yes, I would definitely prefer an nVidia and more Memory. But, for the money, it can still juggle multiple programs being open at the same time, some CPU intensive. For example, if you're playing a game, you definitely should close all other programs first to free up that Memory. However, let's say your editing videos; in that case, you can manage to have your editing software open as well as other programs and truck along just fine.* More USB ports, including 3.0, and dongles (HDMI/VGA/Ethernet, packaged separately) than I've seen in most laptops under $600.* HD webcam.* HD space. This is 750gb. Some other V5's offer 500gb, yet cost more.Cons:* Battery life. 4 cell is far from stellar. The description says "5 Hours," but don't count on it, unless you're an extremely light user with minimal programs running. With heavy use, it's more like 3.5 hours. I think you could probably find a 6 or 9 cell for this and it would increase your time to 6-7 hours, but I haven't looked for one - yet.* Resolution. 1366 x 768 - max, is not great, at all.. However, the only time I can really see the effect of that low resolution is when I'm pinching to zoom in the browser, it can look somewhat pixelated. However, the desktop and programs UI look great, as do videos and everything else.Ambivalent about:Windows 8. I miss the Windows 7 interface sometimes, because the familiarity of the Start button. I use Stardock Start8, which gives you the option of using the Windows 7 or Windows 8 interface, both.Overall: A+
