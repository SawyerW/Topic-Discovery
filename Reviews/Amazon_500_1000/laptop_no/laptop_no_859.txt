I scored like never in my life on Vine this week. Tomorrow is my birthday and I will have unbelievably survived to be 65 years old. If you knew my life, you wouldn't believe it possible I am still here....WHAT an amazing present since I got this Sony VAIO SVF1532DCXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i5 Laptop AND I got the Sony VAIO SVF1532BCXB 15.5-Inch i3 Laptop as well! THAT my friends is the birthday present of my life. II assumed the I5 model would be the more powerful of the two if you look at specs alone, and come with a touch screen the other does not have. These 2 computers are in the exact same family, this model has the touch screen and the faster I5 over the other I3 processor and a bit more RAM. So it is the winner right?  NOT so fast. Windows 8.1 really made it a pain to get that good old Windows Performance data so I downloaded a nice little FREE program called WINAERO. I ran benchmarks and my assumptions of the touchscreen sucking power were correct. But it sucks FAR more than I ever would have dreamed.

They BOTH are back lit by the way which just makes my day. Never expected that. The keyboards BOTH blow me away with their silky smooth feel and NO glitches or surprises. If you read my recent reviews of my 3 Samsung laptops you will see I have been living in a nightmare with them. I will be selling them now (except my WONDERFUL Samsung Series 7 Gamer Laptop). The others have been NOTHING but trouble and in so many ways I will never again buy ANY Samsung computer. Their gaming laptop had turned me into a Samsung fan boy of sorts but never again....These 2 new Sony laptops feel and look like 3 times the quality of any Samsung or Acer Or Asus I have owned. I feel they are even a touch nicer than my wife's old HP. Tonight, she can pick whichever one of these she wants. The best birthday present to me of all is being able to give HER a new & modern computer I could never have afforded otherwise.  I have an issue with paint however. On the white model (The OTHER Model in OTHER review) I simply set it on end up against this black one. I retrieved it and got 2 BAD scratches where it apparently has such soft paint (on the other white model)that just laying against the Vaio logo on the this black one totally wiped out that pretty white paint...MY fault but no excuse for that on Sony's part wither in my opinion. To date, that is my only gripe with THAT computer.  The touchscreen....What can I say, DUMBEST idea on earth in MY opinion is any touchscreen on a full sized laptop! And just look at the performance hit you take with it included over it's little brother. Plus, being disabled there is NO way I am reaching way over to that screen, plus who wants any smudges all over such an amazingly HD sceen? If I reach that far for ANY thing at all it will be for a beer. And speaking of these Sony screens. Want amazing resolution? These HAVE IT!  My more expensive Samsung's (here I go again) do NOT. These 2 lower spec Sony laptops outperform my Samsung's for all the everyday use I throw at them, feel better, type better LOOK way better and have a CD/DVD burner that my Samsung's do not? EASY decision for me at least. Then there is the 2 second wake up time from sleep. I would say it is quicker. By the time I pry that lid open I am lit and going. Amazing. Just getting rid of the nightmare password on initial boot up was my only headache since I don't need all that security.  That's about all I can say. I LOVE these computers. Fast, pretty, feature rich and affordable mainstream laptops but with added GORGEOUS screens to boot. And let me not forget sound. LOVE it. They ingeniously placed the stereo speakers in FRONT of the laptop firing directly INTO you. Just keeps coming up with more and more to love. Now all I have to do is find one of my old surfboard or Harley stickers to cover those sad scratches......  Bottom line is this. I have thrown all I do everyday at both of these computers with just flat equal results. My YouTube videos show the same, internet speed tests come out equal as well. Video editing is something I don't intend to use either of thee for any longer but may run some tests there just to see how rendering video compares? I will update as anything develops or shows itself. MY choice would be for this little I3 model hands down over the I5 with touchscreen.  If you don't just HAVE TO have a touchscreen, this little black I3 is just a blast. Looks great, sounds great, performs amazing. I wouldn't personally even consider the "big brother" at all.
