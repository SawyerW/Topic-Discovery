I have a somewhat interesting take on the 11.6-inch MacBook Air.  I chose the 13-inch model for myself, but my father who is always on the go for business, chose this 11.6-inch model.  He wanted the extra portability, and I wanted the extra performance of the larger machine.Visually, the machines look different.  My 13-inch model does not look significantly different from the front or rear compared to a full featured MacBook Pro. In other words, on the 13-inch model, which I love, the footprint of the device is basically the same as a 13-inch MacBook Pro.  The difference is the slim side profile, and the two missing pounds.This 11-inch model is not only light and thin, but has a smaller footprint too.  It is striking to see.  It looks small, and it's gorgeous.  I do have some envy for the portability of this model compared to my own, which is light, but yet takes up just as much space so to say as a MacBook Pro.The drawbacks to this model and the reason I chose the 13-inch?  The processor included in this 11-inch machine is a fair bit slower.  Comparing some online benchmarks, this entry-level 11-inch model with the 1.4 GHZ Core 2 Duo brought in about 70 percent of the processing speed of the entry level 13-inch model.  While other parts of the machine are equally as fast, such as the graphics processor, solid state storage, and memory, the processor performance difference is not insignificant. You do feel a slight performance difference between the 13 and 11.The included storage on this model is 64 GB.  This will be plenty to store text documents and a moderately sized photo library.  However, you will not store much video on here.  However, the storage is solid state and fast, which enables fast startups and allows the machine to still feel snappy despite the slower processor.Apple specs the battery in this model at 5 hours, whereas the 13-inch model has a quoted 7 hours.  Apple is using a new battery testing procedure, which is said to more accurately predict real world battery life.  Nevertheless, the battery life edge does go to the 13-inch model.The display is no slouch despite its 11.6-inch size.  Indeed, its resolution is similar to the Mac Book Pro's 13-inch display, so there is no question that the display is gorgeous.iLife 11 is included and already installed on this device, so you will be able to take advantage of the latest iLife software right out of the box.  Two USB ports and a mini display port allow for expandability and compatibility with external devices.  Connect an external hard drive for expanded storage, or sync up your iPhone. No problem.  Indeed, believe it or not, this small 11.6-inch MacBook Air can drive the 27-inch Cinema Display that Apple sells.  That shows the impressive graphics performance this small machine offers.I was able to spend another hour today with the 11.6-inch model.  I am nearly beginning to question my decision to choose the 13-inch model.  The 13-inch asks you to take fewer sacrifices in terms of performance and storage.  However, this 11.6-inch is oh so portable.  Honestly, it's surprising when you see it in person.  This 11.6-inch is probably destined to be the "cool," choice.Overall, it is clear to see there are several drawbacks to the 11-inch model.  Less storage, shorter battery life, and slower processor.  However, there are several benefits: a smaller footprint, lighter weight, and therefore easier portability.  Plus, there a cool factor that makes jaws drop when you pull this 11-inch model out of your bag.  Despite its diminutive size, it's a quality product.  Make no mistake about it, while it might be less powerful than other Mac notebooks, the 11-inch Air is no net-book.  The quality and performance far outshines any net-book.  This machine will serve your word processing, consumer photo editing, music listening, email writing, and web surfing needs without issue.  I might caution its use as one's sole computer only due to the limited onboard storage (64GB) and somewhat slower performance (1.4 GHZ Core 2 Duo Processor).  Highly recommend product for the correct application/use.
