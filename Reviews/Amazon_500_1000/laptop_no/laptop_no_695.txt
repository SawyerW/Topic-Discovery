I bought this computer as a Desktop Replacement for class as I am currently out of my home state for about a year. I was never really looking for a heavy duty gaming machine as I just wanted something that could play my current games and maybe some more graphically intense games down the line, but mostly I needed something that was going to get my work done and still be prepared for games and other multimedia when all was said and done.That's when I found this wonderful laptop And after spending a couple of weeks with this I have to say lenovo really knows how to put together a nice and affordable performance laptop.To start off, the design is not too bulky and not too obtuse and it also uses a lovely Aluminum finish to boot. The keyboard has a nice backlight which adds a bit of style to the overall computer, sadly it's not technicolor like some of the more pricy gaming laptops but it is still a very nice keyboard. The Bottom has a wonderfully large vent for cooling, for heavy gaming this is absolutely  necessary as laptops in particular get very hot when doing long gaming sessions, for the best performance I would suggest a cooling pad to make the most use of the bottom vent.The draw to this particular laptop is it's Ultrabay hot-swappable slot, the card on the right side of the device to be slid out for an extra graphics card, another fan, a optical drive or even an extra hard drive. This particular model has an additional Nvidia GeForce 750M graphics card, giving you a total of 4gbs of Video ram. For those of you who want something affordable that can still play those high end games out there this is definitely the way to go as it is one of the cheaper gaming laptops out there right now compared to other brands such as Alienware, ASUS or Toshiba's Qosmio series, and with this additional graphics card it's worth the purchase if you favor gaming performance over a DVD drive right out of the box.This particular model is on the lower side of this series' specs with 6gbs of ram and a i5 dual core processor. If you are working with a budget and don't mind a few games not running on the absolute highest settings this a more than exceptional trade off but if you can spare the extra hundred there is an i7 model available as well, the difference in terms of current games on each processor is insignificant as it is the graphics card(s) that will be doing most of the work along side the ram but it is still a step up from this model (And again only a $100 difference between the two models).For those of you who have an OS preference this uses Windows 8 as it's default OS. If you haven't had any experience with this it won't take much to get accustom to it's features and changes from Windows 7 and below. If you so desire to downgrade to an older OS please make sure to backup the drivers for this computer which can be found on the computer's D: drive. This is necessary for some components such as the back-lit keyboard to function properly.Overall this is an excellent computer for the price and there aren't too many glaring flaws with the computer, with the exception of the Touch Pad which takes some getting use too, but if you are planning on playing games on this it shouldn't matter as you will end up buying a mouse with it anyway.
