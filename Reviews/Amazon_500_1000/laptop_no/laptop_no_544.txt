I got my MacBook Air about 2 weeks ago now, and I haven't looked back!  I have been a PC owner my whole life, and I can honestly say after having my MacBook Air for two weeks, that I have no idea why!  Everything feels so smooth and intuitive on the Mac OS X Mountain Lion (the Mac operating system).  The trackpad actions are amazingly responsive and extremely intuitive.  This helps to increase productivity and is just a lot of fun to play with!I bought this computer to use while at Law School, and I can honestly say that I made the right choice!  I bought Microsoft Office for Mac, and it works great-just like the PC edition that I've been accustomed to.  Overall, this is the best computer I think any student could own.  Weighing in at around 2.5 lbs, it is super lightweight, ultraportable, and it looks and works great!  The display on the 13" MacBook Air actually has a higher resolution rate than the 13" MacBook Pro.  This is great news because it actually has a clearer picture, and the increased resolution means that you have a bigger workspace!  Furthermore, the battery on this computer is amazing!  You can easily get 6-7 hours off a single charge, probably a lot longer if you are working in a well-lit area (so you can turn down the brightness).  Another one of my favorite features is the back-lit keyboard.  It makes it great to use in low-light.  The built in web cam takes great pictures and videos, and FaceTime is included with OS X Mountain Lion, which is a great way to video call your friends and family members!Now for the fun stuff: The MacBook Air just looks amazing.  It is AMAZINGLY thin!  It is literally thinner than your standard spiral notebook!  You might think that means the MacBook Air is fragile, but you would be wrong!  The aluminum unibody is amazingly durable, and it feels very sturdy in your hand!  When I first began to look into purchasing a new computer, I put a great deal of weight into having a SSD (solid slate drive).  The SSD means that the hard drive for the computer does not move!  This is amazing because it virtually eliminates the need for a fan!  Which means, the MacBook Air never heats up (it gets a little warm, but nothing to worry about!), it is SUPER quiet (since there is not a fan always humming), and my absolute favorite fact is that the SSD means that there is very little chance of damage when transporting the MacBook AIr to and from class!  It is not going to be damaged from being shifted around precisely because there are virtually no moving parts within the MacBook Air.I spent months looking into which computer to buy for Law School, and I kept coming back to the MacBook Air.  There is a reason.  The MacBook Air was the trendsetter for all the Ultrabooks that now saturate the market.  Many of those ultrabooks are comparably priced, but none of them are as much of a complete package as the MacBook Air.  For the price, compared to similar computers on the market, the MacBook Air is truly the best of the bunch!
