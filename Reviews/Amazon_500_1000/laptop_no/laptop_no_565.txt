Usually I write long, profusely technical reviews.This is short (busy today).I love the whole DM1Z series and was one of the first adopters a year ago, got a new model a week ago - DM1Z-4200 Customized.Here you see a ship-ready (preconfigured model) but its basis is same as for my customized DM1Z (I selected E2-1800 processor instead of stock 1200).Immediatelly I removed Harddrive & replaced with Crucial SSD, sold HDD (note: HDD is 5400 rpm speed, unlike my HP Elitebook's whose HDD is 7200rpm also coupled with SSD except it's Intel-branded).I paid $30 more for a custom config.People who waste money on MacbookAir need a life - that product is so much about appearance & hype than function, likewise iPhone fad is a fad - Motorola Atrix and Samsung galaxy beat iPhone into the dust.But I am a dry technical professional so I don't represent teenagers, kids of housewives who think anything made by Apple is "good".This HP is a dirt-cheap superNetbook or subNotebook whcihever term is preferred."super" is because it is NOT based on Intel-Atom, but is based on much better (for Netbooks only) E2-1800 processor which offers discrete-class Videocard, this little tiny supernetbook has video capability of a full blown midrange laptop.While I do serious work on HP Elitebook - that machine costs like a used car ($2K), requires ACpower (it eats battery in 4 or some hours due to crazy hi-end video), it has nVidia, weighs and sizes like a mobile workstation.  That's fine.  BUT for travel and fun computing on the go - I got this DM1Z.Sometimes I feel weird because some days even prefer using this DM1Z instead of a powerful Elitebook which sits at home.DM1Z will run for 8-11 hours depending on how good you are with power management settings & wireless & video use, which far better than MacbookAir which is using Intel core i3/i5 processors - more suitable for fullsized laptop than ultraportable laptop or netbook which is what MacboorAir or HP DM1Z are.  Macbook air will die in 5-7 hours, and IF YOU NEED Intel core i3/i5 processing power - I just had a thought, why not get a normal laptop then?  Netbook is supposed to be optimized for portability, weight, batterylife and connectivity; in this case DM1Z is also optimized for imporessive Video card rivaling many normal-sized laptops.  I run even Adobe Photooshop, YouTube, etc and all this multitasking is tolerable, not same experience as on HP EliteBook but still UNEXPECTEDLY good for a $400 netbook!E.g. I set brightness to minimum.Also I applied antiglare film to mimick HP Elitebook & other PROFESSIONAL displays which are always Antiglare, unlike consumer cheap type which is glossy to attract fools.Not having an option for antiglare screen is my only complaint but really - film costs $10-15 (HiDef version) and no big deal, besides many people aren't using it for business like myself and actually prefer glossy/glare screen.P.S. Changing TN LCD to IPS type LCD would increase laptop price by $50 or so, and as a side note to HP's management:I WOULD PAY FOR IT if it were availableIPS is a must for professional graphics work (e.g. CAD, photography).
