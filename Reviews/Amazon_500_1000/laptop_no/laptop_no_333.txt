I have had this laptop a little less than a month now and I purchased this laptop only after a huge amount of research.  My purpose was a powerhouse laptop that could run multiple operating systems concurrently via VMWare without having to have a huge desktop replacement type laptop.  I upgraded to a 256gb high speed SSD drive and 16GB of RAM and moving the original 1TB drive to a secondary drive bay for non-active local storageGood-Fairly Easy to upgrade to 16GB-Fairly easy to upgrade to solid state drive in primary drive bay-10 point touchscreen!-Quad-core 2.4/3.4ghz 4th Gen I7 processing powerhouse,3rd gens with these stats still sell for this much-7 second boot up with 840pro SSD drive-Nice keyboard, decent form factor, decent overall construction-Both integrated and discrete circuitry video card, not as good as a desktop video card but better than the majority of laptops.-A lot of laptop by a great vendor for a very competitive priceBad & Ugly-Their are 2 fans but they port air toward the bottom back which means laying this laptop on your lap or flat surface results in hotter operating temperatures.  The center of the laptop, middle and middle back of the keyboard get really hot, hotter than any other laptop I have ever owned.-Comes with windows 8 and Asus does not support Windows 7 on this laptop so there are no driver downloads for Win7 on Asus site-Finding all the Win7 drivers can be difficult and since installing Win7 I have not been able to find the right drivers to restore 10point touch so its essentially a single touch screen now-No recovery media sent with laptop nor available from Asus.  And no CD-Key for Win8, only a recovery partition so if your laptop wont boot you cant recover it and the only option Asus provides is to send the laptop back to them for re-imaging.  Also they leave you absolutely zero way of proving you own a copy of Windows 8.  I feel like they should refund the portion they charged me for Windows 8 and it should be illegal for them to charge you for windows 8 without providing a install disk and cdkey of which neither do they provide.-Battery is not removable without removing 10 screws and pulling off the bottom of the laptop, this is an incredibly bad idea.  All articles that suggest completely powering down the laptop tell you to leave it on until the battery is completely dead, this is the only way to remove power from the motherboard.  Plus no easy upgrade to bigger batteries.  This is really really bad design.-They use a non-standard slimline cd, so dont buy a standard cd/HD caddy if you want to mount a second harddrive, you will have to buy a proprietary caddy probably from Asus to add a second harddriveOn a side note, this vendor was great, shipped the laptop expeditiously and though I had to use shipitapo to get it to me, seems no vendors on Amazon will ship electronics to military personnel serving their country anymore so this was to be expected.s
