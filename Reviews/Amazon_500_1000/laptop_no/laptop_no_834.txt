###################Here's what I like:###################  * Price - A very good price, makes a good computer actually affordable to almost anyone.  * Design - The shape of this device is like any other conventional device on the market, which is good.  * Color - I like the grey and black matchup alot.  * Weight - This device is very lightweight and I can hold it with just 1 hand, which helps alot when I need  to move it somewhere or charge it while holding something.  * Keyboard - It has a good travel distance to type on, so you can touch type on it well.  * Trackpad - It has a good size and its responsive.  *Note* - You can adjust the sensitivity of the trackpad buttons by unscrew/screw on  the center rear of the laptop.  * Battery - It lasts around ~6 hours doing intensive tasks (streaming, gaming, compiling).  Around 8 hours doing less intensive tasks. (Office tasks, listening to music, etc).  *Note* - Disabling bluetooth, wireless when not needed, unplugging USB devices  and lowering screen brightness helps too.  *Boot - It boots fast (~7 seconds).######################################Here's what I think could be improved:######################################  * CromeOS - It's fast, simple, low resource, "customizable" though apps, automatically updates, it just works, so  what not to like?  It's bound to its google ecosystem, not very touch friendly yet, the apps are not as  complete as the alternatives yet, the offline functionality is limited, devices  recognition is limited too (USB printers mostly, you can set wifi printers though).  Though updates are frequent and the system improves each day.  *Note* - See the "Aside" section at the very bottom if you want to install a  different operating system on it.  * Microphone - It works but sometimes is hard to hear, the sound could be louder.  * Fingerprints - You'll see some around the computer because of the gloss finish.  * Graphics card/GPU - Sometimes videos and Skype skip frames, more noticeable when  using HDMI output.  For the price can't complain much tough.  * Ram - I wish the ram was at least 4GB or at least not soldered.#######Overall#######A very good deal, if your looking for a new basic computer or a replacement to your old one look no further.#####Aside#####  I installed Fedora GNU/Linux on the chromebook.  I have access to libreoffice, GIMP, Inkscape, git, USB printer is recognizable,  can work offline very well, skype works, etc.  If you want to do it too, I'll leave some hints here  (search with your favorite search engine):  *ATTENTION* - This can void your warranty, do at your own risk!  # Make a backup of your ChromeOS(Important to fallback in case something goes wrong!)  - Search "google Recover your Chromebook"  # Chromium developer mode info.  - Search "chromium Developer Information for Chrome OS Devices" and select  the model (acer c720 in this case).  # Upstream coreboot  - Search "chromium Upstream coreboot on Intel Haswell Chromebook".  # Arch linux acer c720 information very useful.  - Search "archlinux wiki Acer C720 Chromebook".  # Cnet info on how to multi-boot ChomeOS with Ubuntu (The most simple method).  - Search "cnet How to run both Chrome OS and Ubuntu on a Chromebook"  # Installing Fedora 20  - Search "forum Fedora 20 sur l'Acer C720P"
