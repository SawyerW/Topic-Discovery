This is written 3 months into using the computer. The laptop broke down unexpectedly one day, it has booting problems. I issued a repair case with Acer, they did not email me shipping instructions until I contacted them again a week later. I shipped the laptop away with FedEx and had to pay shipping out of my own pocket because even though it's under warranty, Acer does not pay for shipping to its repair center because "the inbound shipping cost is not covered by Acer's standard (limited) warranty". I used to own an HP laptop and when that laptop broke down, HP took care of everything fast. In contrast, Aver is really inefficient. I do not know when I'm getting my laptop back and whether I would have to pay more for problems not covered by warranty. Hope Acer doesn't give me more headaches in the future.____________________I bought this laptop right here from Amazon. The complaints about bad customer service and defective parts on this site did scare me off at one point, but I've given full consideration and compared it with many other ultrabooks, I believed Aspire S3 was the best of them all and had to give it a try. It's been only three days since I received the laptop so it is still in early stage of experiencing the device, but I gotta say I LOVE it.I really like the exterior design. It looks a lot like a Macbook Air, only a shade dark (the picture on this site makes it look light silver, but it's really not, it's a much darker silver/grey). I really like the touchpad so I hope it doesn't stop working one day.The small arrow keys are not a problem for me. The only key on the keyboard that I always miss hit is the Backspace, it seems to be so far out, and I do think the keys on the keyboard are a little widespread. But I guess I can always get used to it.Another minor problem I've noticed was that sometimes when I click something, it doesn't click, I have to click harder the second time to make it work. I keep thinking maybe it's that I clicked too light the first time, or maybe it's the laptop's problem. But because it doesn't happen frequently and the most I need to do is click twice, I don't think it's a big deal.Three days into using it, so far so good. It was very easy to set up; I deleted all the software that came with but I'm not interested in; the screen was very bright (I had to turn it down below half brightness because it was THAT bright);the battery lasts a long time even when I was watching movies on Netflix._______________________________________________________Now I've used the laptop for a week, I realized it's got a bigger problem.The internet keeps disconnecting, that happens quite frequently, like 5 times a day, even though every time it recovers on its own within half a minute, but what's the deal? My old laptop never disconnected in the house ever.Also, why did the price drastically dropped lately? When I purchased it it was $780 and today it's $740. This makes me consider a refund.
