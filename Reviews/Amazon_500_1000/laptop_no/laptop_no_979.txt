Let me begin by saying that I love my chromebook.  I have a 3-month old Macbook Pro that I paid over $3K for, but I consistently pick up my chromebook instead because it is just faster at booting and shutting down, and it has AMAZING all day battery life.  If you mostly use your computer for surfing the web, and if you trust Google with your information, then there is nothing better for you than a chromebook.But there is one caveat.  Specifically, the chromebook does not work well with video sites like hulu and netflix.  The problem is best illustrated by hulu.  For example, when you watch a video on hulu there are intermittent video advertisements.  The problem with the chromebook is that it cannot recover the video feed for the video after the commercial ends.  The audio is there, but the video is not.  This occurs every single time an advertisement is played.  The only way to fix it is to refresh the browser.  This is more than a little annoying, and renders the hulu website useless.Google needs to fix this problem now.  Melissa Daniels, the honcho at Google for all things chromebook, I'm dedicating this review to you.  Please fix this problem.  Other than this one issue, the chromebook is an outstanding product that I highly recommend.**Update - 6/20/2012**I have noticed that the chromebook is frequently unable to load webpages I request.  For example, I will type in the URL for cnn and the browser will just churn and will never open the requested webpage.  After a few *minutes* of waiting I get an error message saying the browser cannot resolve the DNS for the requested webpage.  The chromebook does this even when it is connected directly by ethernet to the router. Also, this is a frequent problem that happens every single day.Hopefully Google can fix this and the other problem associated with the chromebook being useless with popular video streaming sites like hulu.  If these issues are not resolved by the time my 30 day return window approaches, I will be returning this item to amazon for a refund.**Update - 6/28/2012**My Amazon return window closes tomorrow, so, it is decision time.  Video websites like hulu still do not work well.  Lots of other people are complaining about this problem, but Google does not appear to have done anything to correct it.The network connection issue also remains a problem.  I have sat my Macbook beside my chromebook and the chromebook has dropped the network connection repeatedly when the Macbook did not.  I think this is a hardware problem inherent to the chromebook, but I am not sure.A new problem has also emerged.  Specifically, one of the chromebook's speakers has started buzzing.  I have not abused this computer whatsoever.  In fact, because websites like hulu are useless on a chromebook, I haven't used the speakers that much.  When I do use the speakers I do so responsibly.  There is no reason that the speaker should be busted when I have only had the computer for 29 days.Because of the reasons described above, this computer is going back to Amazon as defective.  I have ordered a replacement and will continue to post updates on how the replacement computer performs.So far the chromebook has been a disappointment.**Update - 3/02/2013**The chromebook is still unable to work well with Hulu and other video streaming sites.  I have found an additional problem: the chromebook is unable to stream audio from Sirius.  Why is it that Google has been unable to fix these problems after so much time is passed?
