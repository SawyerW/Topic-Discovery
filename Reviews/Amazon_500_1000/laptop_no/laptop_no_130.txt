The computer again will not turn on, Called for repair they will send box for factory evaluation. I was getting a little agitated this had cost a great deal in time and effort. I also had installed MS office student and told them that the new disk was still in the computer.  When I got off the phone I was late for an appointment and spilled my coffee on the computer. Bad. But it had nothing to do with the problems I had been experiencing with the computer up until this point. The customer service had opened the computer at the end of June and there was NO LIQUID DAMAGE.  9/19/2010Returned again box sent back  9/22/2010Called there is water damage there is nothing we can do. "Will you return the MS office disc in the DVD drive?" "We are sending you the whole computer" "Please I don't want the computer it's a lemon. It never worked but the disc is still inside, I can't get it out if it won't turn on." There is water damage there is nothing to be done it is your problem we are sending it back to you"  9/23/2010Computer returned, disc still inside  9/26/201In the 5 months I have had this computer it has been broken 5 times. I have stated before and will do so again this computer was a lemon and Apple opened it 6/27 there was no water damage then. I did drop coffee on it 9/19 but that was after I needed to have it repaired AGAIN . Poor product, poor repair, poor consumer relations.I might have let all that go if they hadn't added insult to injury, all I wanted was my new MS office disc back.Now I have contacted the school I will try and talk the board into using PC's I know. I have several and have owned 10 computers since 1991. There are 5 in the house now. HP's x2 Gateway, ASUS, Sony I have never had this kind of trouble ever.As a side note this type of problem has been reported before, by others. There are several web sites which discuss it.
