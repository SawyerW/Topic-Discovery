I bought a new Samsung Series 3 NP350V5C-T01US 15.6-Inch Laptop (Titan Silver) for seven hundred bucks on sale new at adorama camera. It had ENDLESS WiFi disconnects, track pad fails, and blue screens of death.After 2 repairs that did NOTHING to fix these issues, Samsung offered to replace it. I refused the same model so they offered me this. I had offered to take a downgrade, and this IS a downgrade..... I was hesitant since I was losing that faster processor, the 2 MG Gaming Card, and DVD Burner. But I was getting instead, a bigger hard drive, lighter metal body with less weight.Being disabled, that weight is a BIG deal. I already own a new Samsung Series 7 Gaming Laptop for performance as well as a nice Acer Desktop with 23 inch screen for other tasks.I needed this for all day, in my lap, goofing around online.So why just a 3 star rating? Well it IS slower, quite a bit slower. I hope as it caches more data it may speed up a bit? But with this slower processor and same slow hard drive as the last, it makes for a lazy experience. Factor in the seven hundred dollar list price (usually just six hundred best best buy) and you can simply find WAY better specked hardware elsewhere. But I am where I am so I have no way out. The other problem was right off the bat, the same nightmare WiFi issues from the old computer haunt this one as well, even with an entirely different Card! Luckily I knew this beforehand and thanks to a reviewer named dissed who reviews the big brother to this computer, the Samsung ATIV Book 6 15.6-Inch Full HD Touchscreen Laptop (Mineral Ash Black), I knew the fix. It goes as follows per HIS wonderful review:getting rid of the "intel" driver and reverting to Microsoft driver.1. Uninstall the Intel Proset wireless software/driver from the computer under control panel uninstall program. (not the blue tooth just the wireless)...after thats done..2. Open device manager/network adapters3. double click centrino advanced-n 62354.click driver tab5. It should say driver provider Microsoft / 12/5/2011 / 14.8.8.756. click events tab to see if driver service added was (NETwNe64)that will fix the drop problems.then fine tune your adapter1. click tab power management / uncheck allow computer to turn device off to save power2. click tab advanced / make sure transmit power is set to highest___________________________________________________________________________________________________________So I tried this and it has been stable for 24 hours.I will update as ANY changes occur. The other reason for the 3 star rating is it only has 3 USB ports, only ONE 3.0 port. Also, you do NOT have a battery you can replace. It AND the hard drive are buried (NOT accessible for owner replacement as is normal on a laptop), build inside the case so good luck if you need a battery or if the hard drive fails. Just WAY too many negatives for me at this price to rate it higher.I would recommend shopping around, reading reviews.Lots and lots of reviews. I see other brands with 1 TB hard drives, faster processors AND with optical drives for this price everywhere. On a positive note, this is a FAR more sturdy computer with a vastly nicer (more solid) keyboard as well. THE construction just oozes quality, UNLIKE THE ONE IN PLASTIC THIS REPLACES. As far as positives go, that is just about it. I hope this Samsung will not be another lemon. I have been a die hard Samsung computer fan boy. But I am sad to say that this will probably be mt LAST......UPDATE Oct 2013:After a month is has become a MUCH faster laptop thank goodness. It is also 100% rock solid stable. Nice change.....Update again on Feb  19 2014: This computer is still a LOT less than the one it replaces and I keep getting mails telling me I am not reviewing the correct computer. It seems a few people are no longer capable of understanding English or I just don't know? My review is for the: Samsung ATIV Book 4 NP470R5E-K02UB 16-Inch Laptop (2.0 GHz Intel Core(tm) i7-3537U Processor, 8GB Memory, 750GB Hard Drive, Windows 8) Mineral Ash Black that replaced my defective Samsung Series 3 NP350V5C-T01US. Sorry, Iam simply unable to make it any more clear....UPDATE Feb 22 2014: Downgrading to 2 stars. It continues to be a battle to prevent updates to device manager items that in turn PREVENT the computer from operating properly. I am simply tired of this battle and will be moving on to anew laptop. Just ordered 2 lesser models that actually OUTPERFORM this so called "power user" model. Ordered the:-Sony VAIO SVF1532BCXB 15.5-Inch i3 Laptopand-Sony VAIO SVF1532DCXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i5 LaptopGiven the price of this thing and continuing bugs that Samsung refuses to correct it should be downgraded to 1 star.What a disappointment!
