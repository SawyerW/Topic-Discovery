Update: Major problem. Windows 8 REQUIRES internet connection and this Envy does NOT connect unless you are within 5 feet of a hotspot. This gets really scary when you canNOT login! Error reads "use the last login used on this account"? So 1) hours back I was in and out gmail accounts, shopping accounts and this machine is asking me to remember the LAST one I used?? or 2) find a connection so I CAN LOGIN.Major problem 2: I have NOTHING stored on this machine. Zero. I have 17.6 GB free out of 46.3. The only programs I have installed are firewall, antivirus, and Windows office (for work). So MAKE SURE before you leave home you are logged into your user account and be prepared to buy a few SDHC Flash Memory Cards for all your work, and don't depend on picking up the coffee shop wifi.Major problem 3: Agree sound card so cheap you cannot play music on this machine. Unless you love the sound of 1960 scratched mono vinyl records.*****Major problem 4: Still hauling the AC adapter!! HP, where can I buy a back up????? No I am NOT paying $$$80 for one. What a scam!!So no music, no video, no memory, no RAM, no app games, no wifi, NO ADAPTER, and to get Kindle to PC to work you need to be a good Tech (luckily I am and found an Opensource program to read my books). Good cam. Think what you need before you buy and know your tech level!Pro: Still is working after 4 months cycling to work.*************************************************************Envy: Love the keyboard. Compact but sensitive and comfortable.Amazing display.WARNING! The tablet weighs more than the keyboard! Do not place on the edge where a slight tap will topple it over. No, this did not happen to me. I tested this as soon as I placed it on the table. With 2 cats this was an important test.I'll update this after a few months use (Bought in March 2013 so check back this summer). My commute to work consists of 30m by bicycle most days (3m on rough roads), some Metro/trains. The cycle commute already killed one 16" laptop (Toshiba). I'm hoping the Tablets are tougher.Windows 8:WARNING! You will NOT get 64G memory -- not even close! 11G is swallowed on Drive D for re-installation and another 20G is eaten by Win 8. That leaves you with about 24G!!WARNING! If you are not use to Cloud computing you need to take the time to learn! M$ created Win 8 to >seamlessly< move between the Cloud and your hard-drive. The Cloud is not 100% safe and if your document/media is on the Cloud you cannot reach it unless you are connected to the internet. Basically, if you use an App it is on the Cloud.No Hibernate, just Sleep.APPS do NOT uninstall! The link is just removed from sight. .5G is not an issue when you have terabytes of memory but in Tablets this is important.Kindle:I bought this so I would only have to carry 1 device for work and commute entertainment (ie Kindle). Here is what I learned.Kindle APP: Fail. After an hour I could only open one book at a time, I love my digital library the same as my bookshelves. I also like to read more than one book at a time. Also during my tests I would >think< I sent the book to my hard-drive but when turning off wifi (airport mode) found out the book was on some mysterious Cloud and not accessible. Not an experience I want on a bus! --- So I am using the Kindle to PC download. Which means you have to download all of your books, one at a time, and create your 'Collection' again. But at least I KNOW they are on my Tablet. >>> Update: good luck with Kindle to PC. Found an Open Source to read my books.  >>>>note about Kindle books: To authors/artist NO I do NOT agree that when I pay for digital content (books, music, photos...) I am only RENTING! That is so WRONG! Sadly Amazon is on the line of this. Ki$$ing up to the publishers and what consumers will support. So at anytime an author can decide to take off the books and swoop, those books are no longer in your library AND no refund because you were just 'renting' the digital materials. If you believe what you buy is yours you need to back up your digital content! NEVER TRUST THE CLOUD!
