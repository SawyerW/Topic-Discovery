The Chromebook is not for everyone and will not do everything that a Mac or Windows based PC will do - the biggest things are you CANNOT download program and run them from your computer and you can't use ANY programs that use JAVA. So moving to a Chromebook is a significant change in your mindset about how you do things on your computer. I did a lot of research on my computer before I went ahead and purchased the Samsung Series 5-550 Chromebook, it was not just an impulse buy.The Chromebook does much better if you have a  Internet connection, but with how most of us operate in today's world and the way I use a computer so do a Mac or Windows based machine. However, I can do the basic things that I want to get done offline and the the Web Apps with offline capbaabilities are increasing all the time.I am not a heavy Video Editor (I make a few 5-10 minute YouTube type videos a month), I don't do programming, my use is mostly social media, blogging, writing articles, checking emails, watching a few videos/movies , not the high end stuff that some people do. If I were, I would not recommend the Chromebook for those who need specialty software or have certain higher-end needs.Personally, I was doing 80 to 90% of my stuff online before I purchased the Chromebook 550 and over the course of the month that I have had it have gone to using it 100% of the time and put my MacBookPro in the storage.A couple of things to really think about though.- If you presently have an iPhone - managing it with a Chromebook doesn't work well - you cannot download iTunes (or any other software) to manage your phone - I went out and got an HTC Incredible2  to replace my iPhone 4S and it integrates wonderfully with the Chromebook.- If you need the advanced features of Word/Pages/Excel/Powerpoint/Keynote, while Google Docs does a good job at those things, it is not as advanced as those programs and that needs to be considered. Google Docs/Drive can do most of this sort of work to somewhere around the intermediate user level, but lacks some advanced functionality.- Printing from the Chromebook can be a challenging. Since they do not download printer/scanner drivers, you have to use Google's Cloud Print, which can be a pain in the butt to get working correctly, especially with legacy (older) printers.The Chromebook does what I want and does required a mindset change, even in how I used a computer and how to get it to do what you want - might/will be different from how you do it on a Mac or Windows computer. Chromebooks are not the same thing and you have to approach how you use it differently.The Chromebook 550 does everything that I need a computer to do right now and I love how it works for me and was worth the extra $200 or so that I paid for it over the Acer or Samsung ARM Series 3 Chromebooks, with extra RAM and a few other features, that I preferred over those models.However, in my opinion a Chromebook computer is not for everyone and you need to do your research to see if a Chromebook style computer would be right for you. For me the advantage that the 550 Chromebook has brought to my workflow, far outweighs the disadvantages it has. It just works the way I do.
