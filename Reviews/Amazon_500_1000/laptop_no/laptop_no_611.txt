I was very excited about this laptop B&O; speakers, 1080p screen, great keyboard, fast ssd, great aluminum build quality. it met all my expectations for about 4 days (4.5 stars for a few days). On my first zenbook prime I had a speaker rattle and the enter key wasn't set correctly, no big deal these things happen just swapped it out for another. second one great speakers but 2 weeks later the track pad just stopped the computer didn't even see it in device panel, at this point I was getting a little upset so I called asus they took the laptop and 2 weeks later I got a replacement (no loaner laptop 2 weeks no computer failed term paper being able to only work on my ipad fyi asus) new laptop comes in the mail now the trackpad works but 5 keys on the keyboard will not type and the speakers rattle again. sent it in again for another 2 weeks got a new laptop and this one has some keys that don't work speaker rattles and trackpad is intermittent. DO NOT BUY ITS GREAT ON PAPER BUT ASUS SUPPORT IS THE WORST IVE DELT WITH (incredibly rude, unhelpful, and unapologetic) AND THE COMPUTER HAS THE SAME QUALITY CONTROL AS SOVIET RUSSIAin summery-Bang and olufsen speakers not B&O; just branded I have B&O; speakers in two Audis those are amazing the laptops are quiet and rattle NOT B&O; the Danish would be ashamed of the name on here-Screen great resolution no problems except backlight bleeds around corners-best laptop keyboard I ever typed on for the week it worked (edit: Lenovo yoga has better keyboard but no light)-SSD not nearly as fast as competing models from acer, Lenovo, apple, Samsung-build quality only external, feels good internals probably Russian-power cord incredibly short, no longer option available as with competitors (bring extension cable its REALLY SHORT)-customer service is a joke-asus refused to refund my purchase I filled out paperwork for lemon law and am in the process of review with my lawyer (thanks bro for going to law school) (CUSTOMER REP CALLED ME AN 'IDOT' FOR THE TRACKPAD ISSUE, TRACKPAD WAS NOT TURNED OFF IT WAS DISCONNECTED ON THE INSIDE)(went ape-sh** on him)-Best Buy stopped carrying this model I asked why they said that almost everyone they sold where returned within two weekssave your time just purchased a Lenovo idea pad yoga and is much better  (faster, touchscreen, loud clear speakers, long power adapter, great build quality) even called their support with a fake issue and the where friendly and where willing to send me a replacement laptop before I sent mine in (They understand you have to work on their equipment daily! what an idea)I will never buy anything asus makes again they cannot compete in the us in any serious way with issues like this, (people hold grudges in the sates and in Europe asus maybe Taiwan is different but your selling in the us get your sh** together). I have the Lenovo now, now I just need to get my $1K back for this inferior pos had it for 3 months they had it more than me
