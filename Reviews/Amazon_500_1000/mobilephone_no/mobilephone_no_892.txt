first off the cell came on time but that was the only thing done right in this transaction! less than 48hrs after activation the phone threw an abnormal recovery from abnormal reset CODE NOTIFICATION , the mic wouldn't work so callers on other end couldn't hear me (VERY BAD FOR ME , I MAKE HUNDREDS OF CALLS /WEEK FOR MY WORK) , so i emailed the seller MobileSpree regarding issues , to NO AVAIL , I GOT NO RESPONSE (AT THAT TIME, MORE LATER ON THIS) . Callers could hear me w/BT device paired so i purchased headphones & bt until i could resolve & replace cell .So a day later i had enough and i left bad review/comments on Amazon regarding purchase , & I KID YOU NOT , WITHIN 5MIN MY PHONE RINGS , GUESS WHO , YEP IT WAS THE SELLER . (well i had to call him back from another phone cuz at this point bt device didnt work with cell either) BUT HE PROCEEDS TP TELL ME IT WAS AMAZONS FAULT HE DIDNT RECEIVE MY EMAIL A FEW DAYS EARLIER THAT THEY BEEN HAVING ISSUE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT HANDLES IT , HE PROMISED TO PERSONALLY HANDLE MY ISSUE AND HE WOULD PERSONALLY SEND ME GOOD REPLACEMENT CELL 1ST THING IN A.M. & NO NEED TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE CELL ,,, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS REMOVE MY NEGATIVE REVIEW ON AMAZON , . HE TOLD ME HOW HE LOST HIS JOB 2 YEARS AGO AND AMAZON IS HOW HE FEEDS HIS FAMILY (3 KIDS 2 BOYS 1 GIRL) , SO I SAY OK MAN I WILL GIVE YOU A SHOT TO MAKE IT RIGHT , SO I FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTIONS ON REMOVING THE NEGATIVE REVIEW (HE MENTIONED ALSO THAT IF I DID'NT REMOVE IT , AMAZON WOULD HOLD HIS $) OK ANYHOW  ITS NEXT AFTERNOON SO I CALL HIM AND HE SAYS HE IS PERSONALLY TESTING CELL AT THAT MOMENT , ASKED ME TO GIVE HIM MY EMAIL SO HE COULD CONTACT ME DIRECTLY AND BYPASS AMAZON (BIG NO NO IN AMAZON GUIDELINES) IT WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS TO ME , SO I SAID NO JUST EMAIL ME THROUGH AMAZON AND TEXT AND EMAIL THE TRACK # FOR NEW CELL ...... OK LOW AND BEHOLD WHAT HAPPENS AT 3:30PM I GET A TEXT SAYING PHONE WAS ALSO ACTING UP AND SELLER HAS JUST SENT ME A REFUND CHECK!! EXCUSE ME MOBILESPREE ?????CHECK ?? I DO BUSINESS THROUGH AMAZON SECURE SITE ONLY , NO EXCEPTIONS !! BIG RED FLAG !! SO I NOTIFY AMAZON ASAP AND THEY TOOK EXCELLENT CARE OF ME , REFUNDING ALL MY EXPENSES . NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL ONLY BE BUYING "AMAZON PRIME" PRODUCTS FROM NOW ON & ONLY PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD & SHIPPED BY AMAZON , ONLY !!TERRIBLE BUYING EXPERIENCE FROM MOBILE SPREE IF I COULD GIVE A LESS SCORE I WOULD DO SO !!** BUY WITH CAUTION , HIGH RATINGS DO NOT ALWAYS MEAN GOOD SELLER , AS YOU CAN SEE HOW HE NEGOTIATED HIS WAY OUT OF MY INITIAL NEG. REVIEW * BUYER BEWARE & ALWAYS CONTACT AMAZON QUICKLY AND DIRECTLY REGARDING ANY ISSUES , AMAZON WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT WAY !!
