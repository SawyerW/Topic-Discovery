A little background: Hello, I have been with Virgin Mobile for 5 years of those years I have updated my phone fairly offend I put a lot of wear and tare on my phones and  because I wanted new and better tech on my phone. I have had 4 Kyocera phones from Virgin mobile and have never been disappointed by what Kyocera as a phone maker has to offer and remember each of these phones fondly my most recent Kyocera phone through Virgin Mobile being this one and though I am about to tuck it away in a drawer for safe keeping so I can update to an Android phone through the Virgin provider  I felt I owed it to this phone to give it a review this truely is a great phone for what I needed it for.Pro's and Con's Of The Kyocera Loft By Virgin MobileI'll start with the Pro's- This is a very reliable phone as a phone it has decent battery life and though I had read that it drops calls a lot for some this has not been my experience with this phone it has been very dependable for calls dependable enough that I no longer have a home phone and this has been the main way of contacting me.- It is great for text and picture messaging and has and I am still awed with how many pictures & messages I can save  and keep on this phone with little noticeable lag on other functions.- The camera is not the best but is decent for the price and a steady hand goes a long way with how the camera preforms for youOver all the basic functions as a phone make this phone money well spent it is VERY good on basic functions and well beyond acceptable for the price. I got this phone once from amazon had it stolen and replaced it through virgin mobile and was pleased with both units i got though I did have to pay for it both times Virgin did pay the shipping and handling for the replacement phone and it was to me within days of my order from Virgin's web site... my amazon order did take a little longer but it was also standard shipping so can't complain.- Feels good in hand and has a rubberize finish that feels like rubber silk and is very resistant to wear and tare which very nice to me.- Decent screen- Durable it can take a beating in a dark ally at night in new york.Con's of the Kyocera Loft from Virgin Moble- I was not impressed with connect at all... it's not as great as some of the reviews made it out to be and it is slightly easyer to install opera mini and take care of your social networking and e-mail through there.- The internet can be slow on this phone though pages do load in time if your looking for a phone with Bing-Bang-Zip faster then the speed of light your there... this may not be the phone for you. though the Opera brower is a MUST as the internet browser pre-installed on the phone is VERY VERY slow.- No, you can not listen to music on this phone- No, you can not watch or take video with this phone- No self picture mirror or flash on this phone.Over all I have enjoyed this phone if you can deal with the limitations of this phone you will too.
