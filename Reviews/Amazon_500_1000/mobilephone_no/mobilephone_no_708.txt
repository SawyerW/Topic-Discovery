Yes, it does work with the Straight Talk BYOP SIM for both AT&T; and T-Mobile.As a legally blind person, I've always had to use a magnifying glass when using an Android phone.  Now, I can use my phone without looking like I'm Sherlock Holmes.The box is labeled "Android Note 2," but the actual device inside is labeled "Android Note 3."  I know the "Note 2" models come with Android 4.0, and my "Note 3" came with Android 4.1, so I'm not complaining.  This is about as pure Android as you can get; no bloatware of any kind.There are 2 design issues I have with this phone:1. Because of the case design, the micro USB connector is deeply recessed and requires the use of an unusually long USB connector plug.  Start looking for extra data/charging cables NOW.2. The retaining clip that holds the micro SD card in place is of poor construction.  Cut a small piece off of the packing foam, as a spacer to keep the memory card in place, when the back is on.***** UPDATE #1 01-31-2013 *****The GPS receiver has failed.  Using the GPS Test app ([...]), no satellites seem to be visible; even when standing outdoors.  Very UNHAPPY.***** Update #2 02-01-2013 *****I was finally able to verify there IS a working GPS receiver in my phone.  It seems the receiver and/or antenna is not as sensitive as the typical Android phone.  I was able to finally get the GPS receiver to lock onto some satellites, but the operating conditions required to overcome the issue requires the user to be "highly conscious" about the environment they are using the phone in; outdoors, with absolutely no structural obstacles, etc.***** Update #3 02-01-2013 *****Lining the inside back cover of the phone, with foil, improves the performance of the phone's GPS receiver.***** Update #4 02-07-2013 *****By not using any live wallpapers, and only using weather apps that only look up the weather when you ask it to, like AccuWeather ([...]) I was able to get the standby battery usage down to 1% per hour.I also began using this feature I discovered called "Schedule Power On/Off" to automagically reset the phone every day at 2:30 in the morning.  Essentially I tell the phone to turn itself off at 2:27 AM and then turn itself back on at 2:30 AM.***** Update #5 02-12-2013 *****This is in response to the 1 star review by @Himadri.As for the "Note 3" sticker with version 4.1.1 instead of 4.0.1, I think most people will prefer Jelly Bean over Ice Cream Sandwich anyday.  I just got through loading AnTuTu and am happy to report that the model I received does contain a dual core MTK6577 processor.  As for the disappointment of only getting 1 Ghz instead of the promised 1.2 Ghz processor speed; that 1.2 Ghz is only achieved through manufacturer overclocking -- the actual specs for the processor are only rated at 1 Ghz.  Overclocking to 1.2 Ghz makes the phone more unstable, and I'm glad the manufacturer is keeping within the rated clock speed.  500 ma for the charger is sufficient to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time (less than an hour from 75%), considering the phone draws only 1% an hour during normal use.***** Update #6 02-15-2013 *****Extra screen protectors, cases and USB cables can be obtained through the Alibaba site.  It's kind of like the Chinese version of eBay.  All payments to sellers are held in escrow until you receive your package, via registered mail.***** Update  #7 02-18-2013 *****For those of you who are going to use this on Straight Talk...  Do not try creating a new APN.  Instead, edit the existing "default" APN.  Otherwise, you may discover MMS or tethering will not work, because of an extra required setting that was previously unknown to you.***** Update #8 03-22-2013 *****This morning, I awoke to find notifications in Chinese.  I should've paid more attention to those Chinese lessons my Mom made me take; I haven't the slightest idea what they are.  Are they system updates or malware?  I tried 1 of them, and it tried to download something, but the download wasn't successful; again, the reason was in Chinese.  "Lookout" doesn't think anything "bad" happened, so I simply cleared the remaining notifications and will hope for the best.***** FINAL UPDATE 12-19-2013 *****It's Dead Jim!Over the last 2 months, I've noticed the slow deterioration and failure of the phone's charging circuitry.  Symptoms are:1. Resetting the phone causes a 10% or more drop in the estimated battery level.2. Sudden drops in battery level (from 85% to 65%) if you just "stare at the display" long enough.3. Charging circuit does not "play nice" with charger.  You end up pulling the battery and reinserting it, to get the charging circuit to start doing its job properly.I noticed the price on this phone has gone down about $20 from when I originally purchased it.  Rather than purchase another one; I decided to get the BLU Studio 5.5 D610A BLU Studio D610A Android Unlocked which has more features, for about the same as I originally paid for this phone.  Look for an upcoming review on this device from me!===== Conclusion =====The reason I gave this product 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because many people who shop on Amazon have an unrealistic expectation that this is going to be an out of the box "turn key" experience.  You ***WILL*** have to tinker with it, in order to get to that "Happy Place" in your heart.
