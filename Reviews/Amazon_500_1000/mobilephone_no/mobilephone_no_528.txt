I bought this phone directly from Amazon.com in July 2011 for my husband, so we've had about 10 months of experience with the phone. We have updated the firmware to v7 since the begining of the ownership, so the option names I mention may differ from your phone's. Without further ado, here are some of my observations.Pros- Inexpensive full-featured smartphone with touchscreen- Has a physical keyboard; good for composing longer messages- Works with AT&T; Prepaid (GSM); successfully tested voice, sms, and data (up to 3G speeds)- Works with T-Mobile (GSM); successfully tested voice and sms (I did not try data but it should be up to 2G speeds)- Should work Page Plus Cellular (Verizon MVNO, CDMA); I've been looking into this and, as long as the ESN of the phone is clean on the Verizon network, it should be fairly easy to activate- Recharges through a standard micro usb port- Simple notepad-like application (OneNote) that's easy to use- Batteries last around three days with moderate use- Many free and paid applications work on this phone if you look for Pocket PC applications- Wifi works- You can remove shortcuts in the menu that you don't want to see; so if you'll never use that Verizon app: delete!Cons- Could not get mms (picture messages) to work on GSM networks- Could not get tethering to work- Did not auto-detect the apn setting (for internet) on the sim card- Occasionally had to reboot to fix things like the internet connection (gprs) and switching between usb modes- Browser (Internet Explorer) would sometimes get an "out of memory" error from web sites- Microsoft phased out Windows Mobile 6.5 support; no more Marketplace applications- Annoyingly hard to position cursor at the beginning of a line with the stylus in the notepad application; I've have to use the direction keys on the slide-out keyboard most of the time- Ghost voicemail notification (this may be the AT&T; network's fault); icon says that there's new voicemail but actually no new ones exist- Likes to automatically delete hidden SSID network settings whenever it can't detect them- New message notification goes away even when I visit the inbox but don't read them (they're still marked as unread in the inbox)Comments- Since the phone doesn't automatically detect the apn setting on the sim card, you have to manually add it. I eventually downloaded and installed the free HTC Network Wizard .cab that automatically configures things for you based on the selected network- If you want to set up the voicemail for GSM networks, set the voicemail number to your phone's number- There's a dedicated Task Manager button on the side of the phone if you need to switch to a task or to end one- There's a physical reset button under the same flap that covers the usb port. Just use the stylus to press and hold to reboot the phone if it gets unresponsive; there's no more need to take the batteries out to do this- You have to jump through some hoops to get GPS working on the GSM side: switch to CDMA or Global (both CDMA and GSM) mode, turn GPS on, select COM4 for the port, and switch back to GSM mode; I never used it much so I can't really comment on how fast/good it is----Nov. 29, 2012 Update- This phone works with Page Plus Cellular in CDMA mode; it took the OTA programming and receives/sends calls and text just fine- It's annoying that you have to manually turn off the screen when charging the phone; otherwise, it will stay on and take a long time to fully charge
