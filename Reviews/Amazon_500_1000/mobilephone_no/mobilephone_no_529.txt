I have this phone for over 2 months now and I must say that I am more than pleased with it. You can not get a better smartphone for under $90 and that as well powered by a Qualcomm Processor of 1GHz.Display $ Appearance:=====================I only wished that the display was slightly bigger (minimum 3.5 inch) but 3.2 inch is still a very good size for a WVGA (800 x 480) display. Most of the people in the reviews have complains that the touch screen is unresponsive because due to its resistive nature but I must admit that this is the most responsive touchscreen I have ever used. The phone comes with a handy stylus that is stored at the back of the phone and is useful specially while surfing the web. You have to calibrate the screen at least once in order for it to work flawlessly. This phone is not very slim because it has a FULL QWERTY slide out keyboard which is a plus for texting and other purpose. It has dedicated buttons (physical) for Call/Cancel/Menu/Task Manager/Lock/Power/Volume etc.Multimedia Performance & Camera:===============================The default media player is not going to support all the formats out there so I installed the TCPMP which plays almost all video formats and will even stretch the display across the entire 3.2 inch screen. The video playback is very smooth and there is also a 3.5mm standard headphone jack so that you can plug in any headphone of your choice. I installed the YouTube app on it and it also plays videos really well.Camera on this phone is  3.2MP which does an okay job in taking photos in situations where you do not have a digital camera. It can also shoot videos at 640 x 480 / 25fps. The quality is not very good and somewhat acceptable if you can live with it.GPS & Other Sensors:====================This phone has built-in GPS as well as A-GPS (uses cell tower). I downloaded the Google Maps official app on it and the A-GPS was working immediately after starting the app. It was not very accurate as it will only tells you that your location lies within 30 meters or sometimes more. In order for the built-in GPS to function, you need to enable the "Location ON" from Settings>Personal>Phone>CDMA Services>GPS. If you are using the phone on a GSM network then you first have to just enable CDMA network in order to access the GPS settings because the GPS settings are only available when CDMA network is enabled. You can enable the CDMA network from settings>Personal>Phone>Network. The built-in GPS shows the most accurate position and will take about a minute or two to lock on to satellites. On average it is able to see 4-6 satellites (indoors). The maximum I was able to lock on to were 8 satellites. The more the satellites, the more accurate your position would be. If your App is unable to connect with the built-in GPS then you have to enter the GPS port, which is COM4, in the app settings. The phone also has a gravity sensor, proximity as well as luminous sensor.Windows Mobile 6.5 OS:======================The only thing that was first preventing me from buying this phone was the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS but I got over with it after I installed the app called SPB Mobile shell which makes the phone more customizable and gives you Android like menus and layout. I was also able to download some of the FREE apps from the Microsoft Marketplace. Some of the apps that I have installed on this phone are Opera Mini browser, YouTube, Google Maps, TCPMP, Facebook Mobile, SPB TV, WMWiFiRouter etc. I have kept the default firmware that came the phone and have not upgraded like others had.Things I Can Change on LG Fathom Phone:=======================================- I wish the camera was at least 5.0MP- RAM could have been 512MB, though 256MB RAM with 1GHz processor is still very fast.- Slightly bigger display (maybe 3.6")- Ability to install other OS such as Android/Windows 7 etc.- Battery life (5 hours of WiFi use is enough to drain the battery from 100% to 0%)This still is a very good phone from LG for those who have a tight budget but still want to have a smartphone. Buy it and you will not have any regrets.
