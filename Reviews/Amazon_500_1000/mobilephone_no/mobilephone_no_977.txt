Let me preface this with, you get what you pay for.SCREEN: The screen is large, bright, colorful and sharp, however IT IS NOT GUERRILLA GLASS, you can even see in the picture that its contoured around the edges, it is molded plastic.  That being said, its not bad, not as good as glass for sliding your finger across it, but its usable.The resolution is perfect for this size, while its IS the PHONE VERSION of ANDROID, those who want to replace their tablet will be annoyed by the OVER-SIZING of everything, so even though it is high resolution, many apps still look low res, with GIANT title bars and HUGE TEXT.  I think the idea of these new phones with 1080p is all hype, you cant see the pixels on a 5.7" screen at 1280x768, all you add with 1080p is more overhead for the GPU to draw, which seems kinda bad to me.ON TO THE REALLY BAD, I don't know if its just my unit, but if you let it sit on the desktop screen for any short period of time, IT BURNS INTO THE DISPLAY.  Now this is temporary, turning off the phone for an hour or so, it disappears, but its REALLY BAD if you ask me.  Specially on GREY SCREENS, you will see a perfect imprint of your wallpaper, clock, all the buttons, etc.Also, the touch screen isn't very good and for some reason while its plugged in, it becomes temperamental. Example:  While scrolling through a menu system, it will accidentally click items in the menu and not just once, its almost like its tapping multiple times.  After using it for some time, it got a little better, but even in games when you use twist gestures, it will get all wonky.  Usable, but could cause added stress.It came with screen protectors, but it makes the touch screen even less reliable, so I removed it right away.HARDWARE BUTTONS:  The device has hardware buttons that are touch sensitive, I don't prefer hardware buttons, because they are really easy to ACCIDENTALLY touch while playing games, etc.  Sorta like the WINDOWS key that you accidentally hit and your back at your desktop, annoying.  If they were software buttons, you could use third party apps to hide the bar and allow gestures or slide to reveal it.AUTO DIMMING "feature":  SUPER ANNOYING, if you don't touch the screen for about 10 seconds, IT DIMS... You cant turn it off in the settings and NO THIRD PARTY APP WILL STOP IT FROM DOING SO...BUILD QUALITY:  it feels solid, I am not a fan of the hidden compartment with the snap off back plate, those little snaps can break, but you only really have to access it to put your SIM(s) in, so not so bad.CAMERA: The rear camera is very poor quality in low light, everything appears cloudy, I put a piece of tape over the front camera, so I cant comment on it.CHARGING: Unlike the NEXUS 7, which I returned, you can actually USE the device while it charges and It does charge... slowly, while plugged into my laptop, while playing games on the device. Having a STANDARD USB port for charging is great, no proprietary plugs, like my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7.SPEED:  The phone is fast and games play really well.  Galaxy on Fire 2, plays beautifully, The SIMS FreePlay works great.CONCLUSION:  I bought this phone from staples for $250, is it worth $250, probably, but with the NEXUS 5 coming out, I am torn between returning this phone because of the issues and waiting for the NEXUS 5, or just keep it and learn to live with it...  I am sure the NEXUS 5 will probably be much more expensive anyway.*** UPDATE 09/30/13 ***I have decided to keep this phone, after searching for possible replacements, the only options are other Chinese phones with no US support.  I can live with the shortcomings of this phone.  My biggest issue, the burn in effect is avoided by setting the daydreaming (screen saver) to 1 minute.*** UPDATE 10/29/13 ***Well, its been over a month since I bought this phone.  Thought I would post an update.The auto dimming, still annoying, but other than that, the phone has been great.  After turning on Daydream, I have not had the burn in issue on the screen and the phone is very reliable, never crashes and the speed is pretty consistent.As for the plastic screen debate, I have come to the conclusion that its possible the earlier model had a plastic screen and that is why mine was $50 cheaper from staples.Final verdict, worth every penny!
