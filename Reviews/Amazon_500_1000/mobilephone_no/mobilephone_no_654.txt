Had this phone for 2 months and so far am mostly pleased.  If you are looking for something other than Apple or Android, you should definitely consider this one-of-a-kind Meego phone (if Symbian or BlackBerry is not your cup of tea).  This is the original polycarbonate phone that all of the Lumias have followed.Pros:* Great build quality (typical for Nokia), even the glass has nice jewel-type raised look about it* The OS is very responsive with exception of Twitter (see Cons).* Screen resolution is decent & the Clear Black Display makes everything look sharp, especially if you set the color to Vivid.* Battery life is excellent - I can go at least 4 hours with only losing ~10%* It comes with a matching color case that is more like a cover - very thin so it will protect from scratches but probably will not do much for drops.* The swipe UI is easy to use and the events home screen is very handy to keep you updated* Like Symbian, AT&T; does not detect this as a smartphone & will not force you into a data plan* The Meego team is now Jolla & their new Sailfish OS can be installed on the N9 - so it could be like having a new phone* Developer Mode lets you code/hack the OS for those who want to* Swype app is pre-installed* FireFox & Flash apps availableCons:* The big one is that this is a 1-time OS so there is lack of support/apps.  Nokia said they would support till 2016 but that seems suspect since they will not allow any apps to be added/updated after 2013.  Again, you can install the new Jolla SailFish OS and that could alleviate this issue (Android apps are supposed to work)* The screen is a tad too sensitive.  I am constantly accidentally opening apps when trying to scroll* Volume is a bit on the weak side, especially the speakerphone* Syncing to Outlook does not work with the latest version of Nokia Suite so had to install an older version* Cannot turn off camera shutter sound; had to enter developer mode to manually delete the files* No dedicated camera button* Buttons are on the small (flat) side making them a little hard to press; also a little too close together making it easier to hit the wrong button* Twitter app gets painfully slow; can download Tweetian for free tho, which is much faster. You can also clear the cache on a regular basis thru the terminal with: rm /home/user/.cache/data/twitter/twcache** Not a very customizable OS/UI with personalization options like Android/Sybmbian; music player does not have any options/equalizer* Micro-SIM card so you may have to cut yours down or get a new one* No SD card slot* Have 3 emails running; occasionally 1 of them will stop automatically syncing but a reboot (which takes about a minute) of the phone fixes itOverall, I am satisfied with the phone.  It stays connected to wifi & updates my email & social media as needed.  If you can live with no updates or latest games, you should definitely consider this phone.  Too bad Nokia abandoned Meego for Windows but hopefully Jolla can improve upon it.
