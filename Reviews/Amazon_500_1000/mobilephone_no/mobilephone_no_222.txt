Got the silver/white version as it was the best deal this week ($359) and it is Made in China (was hoping for Made in Finland). The latest firmware from March 2011 was installed on it and I am slowly learning how to use it. ***I will update my review as I get more familiar with the phone.****Phone: thinner than I thought it would be, waiting on my Otterbox Commuter case to arrive. Have an annoying SIM card problem in the upper right corner of my phone, it keeps blinking and says SIM card memory full even though it is not the case. Not that big of a deal and I am sure I can remove it soon.Camera: Like the camera on it, was the main reason for my purchase, to replace my digital camera and have just one device to carry around. When I transfer the pics, they are around 1MB each, but when I choose to send them to an email address, they are downsized to only 70kb.Video: HD video recording is pristine, there are lots of pre-installed movie previews etc. which I hope I can remove. (Phone has around 10GB free space after maps installation and before removing unnecessary pre-installed apps).Connection: had some trouble figuring out the best settings for connecting to the internet. I am a T-Mobile prepaid monthly plan subscriber and don't have much data usage per month (might change that now), and I am still not sure when I am using the Edge/3G (uses data plan) or my home wireless network (free). Setting it up and connecting was easy but when I check the connection manager, it would say the wireless is inactive and I have the Edge or 3G symbol active on my upper left screen corner. I am sure I will eventually figure this out.Apps: installed some essential apps right away likeOpera browserSkype (so happy that I can use it on my phone now),a live TV app (watched France 24, pretty cool),Swype (had several installation errors until it somehow worked)The OVI store is full of apps, most of them seem not that useful.The OVI maps seem great, found my location automatically, downloaded upgrades.***UPDATES***SIM card blinking message problem is resolved, had to delete messages saved to the SIM card.Camera pictures are only great when not using the flash, flash indoors makes all pictures hazy/white foggy. The 9MP is the standard and it is widescreen but the 12MP is only 4:3.Major letdown and a reason to give one star less is the poor battery life. I charged it full last night and when I woke up it went down to 14%, not sure why. It was in power saver setting, every other tip from the User Manual regarding battery life was applied, so will test it out and then eventually will have to send it back because what good is it if the battery won't last?***UPDATES*** June 1, 2011The battery life has improved a great deal thanks to many tips on Nokia's website and dedicated Nokia N8 forums. Some tips that drain the battery: bright homescreens, mail server synch/fetch, constant wireless scanning, etc. You can turn all these off or disable them temporarily and right now I am still at 100% after having it charged 14 hours ago, although  have not used it much but this is a huge improvement from last week.
