As mentioned, they are basically the same devices but the Spirit has a larger screen with better screen res and I believe the USB port is on the bottom of the phone instead of on the side, plus a few other enhancements.While the specs list this the CPU @ 1.2GHz, Quadrant Benchmark testing shows it to be 1.5GHz.The LG Motion is a great phone and I'm sure I will love the LG Spirit even more with the bigger, better screen.My only wish is that LG would have used an 8MP camera instead of the 5 MP camera, but it takes great HD vids, especially outdoors. Same with pics.Pictures tend to look a bit off in color when viewed on the phone, but once transferred to your PC, the color balance looks better.I like the Motion better than my old iPhone 4S and I'm no longer handcuffed to an expensive 2-year contract, plus I can sell the phone anytime I want since I own it and not the carrier.I will use the $70.00 rebate and will also sell my lightly used LG Motion which will almost pay for the upgrade from the Motion to the Spirit.I'm also saving $40.00 a month by dropping my contract carrier and going with Metro PCS and I'm also getting better service and faster 4G, about 7.5 MBPS D/L, depending on my location.Since I have WiFi at home and at work, I don't use much Data so I can go with the least expensive 4G plan from Metro and if you go over your monthly data allotment, they don't charge you extra - they just throttle your data speed down until the 1st of the month.Either way, I'm saving about $500.00 a year, not to mention the cost of the phone, which I can always sell if I want to upgrade.Win/win.Props to LG and Metro PCSUpdate: After using this phone for the last several months, I love it even more!I've also added a 32 Micro SD card for more music storage and for more video storage capabilities. I also received the $70.00 rebate that was being offered at the time, so my cost for this phone was a little under $200.00 after shipping and Kalifornia taxes. This phone rivals the Sammy S-3 in functionality and in Benchmark testing as well at half the price.This is the best "bang for the buck" smartphone on the market. I blows away my old iPhone 4S which I have since sold, along with my LG Motion which I bought before the Spirit came on the market.I haven't had a single problem with this phone and like the fact that the battery is easy and inexpensive to replace if needed and storage can be upgraded via a Micro SD card. One other thing: "Rooting" the phone is easy and gives the user much more control over the O/S. It also allows you to disable/uninstall much of the LG/Metro "Bloatware" which makes the phone even faster and smoother.I absolutely love this phone - the screen is just the right size as a bigger screen/phone would not fit well in my front pocket.It is also lighter than the LG Motion.Everyone that sees it wants one and several of my friends and co-workers have purchased one after they were "released" from their existing contracts with other carriers.Some products overpromise and underdeliver. Not this one. It lives up to the praise and then some, all at a moderate price and performance wise, rivals phones costing 2x as much.I was going to buy a S-3 when the S-4 came out in anticipation of the cost of the phone being more reasonable, but bought the Spirit while the $70.00 rebate was offered and I'm glad I did as I like the Spirit better than the S-3The only real negative is the camera - it does great outdoors in natural light, but can be a bit grainy indoors.For the $200.00 savings, I can live with a 5MP camera vs. and 8MP camera, and if I want to take good pics, I have a 16MP Nikon Coolpix camera that cost me $100.00 for a refurbished model and it takes fantastic pics.Either way, you can't go wrong with this phone and I can't recommend it highly enough.Good luck and enjoy.
