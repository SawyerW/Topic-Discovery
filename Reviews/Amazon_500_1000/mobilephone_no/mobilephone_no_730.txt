So, I'm brand new to 4G and Android as well......just gave up on my Curve 8530 I had for 2 years.The first impressions after the switch - I was speechless !!!I wanted to go for the Galaxy S3 from MetroPCS as well but I heard about the MetroPCS/T-Mobile merger and also about the arrival of Galaxy S4 to Metro in a short while, so I figure the S3's gonna be worth about half after that release. I decided to go for a cheaper (almost just as good) model the LG Spirit :)This phone is a beast, a savage I have a '06 Toshiba Satellite laptop and this phone would easily kick it's ass in any hardware aspect.Love the OS, the games look just AMAZING - though bear in mind my last cellphone gaming session was on a BB Curve 8530 so it's a big switch for me.The 4.5" IPS display is gorgeous and the camera is recording in 1080p (the face camera does 720p), 4G LTE connectivity is wonderful the download speed is fire and with 802.11g/n WIFI this thing downloads with almost the same speed my Asus G75VX with 802.11ac antenna does - unbelievable !!!Some games literally have PS3/XBOX360 quality graphics !!!The phone is capable of taking voice commands and does it with precision, I'm yet to have it misunderstand what I dictated - all you do is press a speaker icon on the display.I seem to be going round and round with this review, I know;Let me get straight to the good and the bad if any :DPros:1.2GHz dual-core CPU;1GB RAM DDR2 (monster);4.5" 960x540 screen - flips 180*;720p face camera + 5MP 1080p rear camera with 1080p recording;Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich;4.3GB of internal storage space;speed;ease of use;intuitive OS/UI;battery life (so far so good);there's more I'm just tired today and gotta wrap-up;Cons:the process of adding files to SD card;Google keyboard glitches;I think it's one of the best phones MetroPCS has to offer right now, especially when you take in account the price it goes for, gross bill was only $308+change and what this baby is capable of doing and the speed it DOES it with. It's a no-brainer, as good as Galaxy S3/S4 are I think the LG Spirit can easily keep up with the best and therefore deserves a rightful place and a good review.I will elaborate on this naughty piece of technology a bit more in a few days......08/23/13So, I have this phone for a while now and just have to mention a few new thing I observed over time.....after about 4 months now the Andriod OS lost a bit of it's speed it had before but nontheless the Spirit still keeps up and does everything well.The most important and surprising feature is the battery: it lasts forever !!! BB Curve used to kill me with the this, the battery would die on me while the phone was in my pocket and when I need to use it it's done :/This one takes 4G/WIFI, web surfing, calls, games, e-mail ect. for hours at a time and I never have any sudden drops in battery power.....it might not be a big deal but I was expecting even less with all the features I use everyday.I know the Samsung S4 is here and it's a lot better but the $550 price is high, so if you can live without the latest most expensive toy, this phone has a lot to offer for a very reasonable price and also has some of the best quality amongst phones worth a lot more $$$.
