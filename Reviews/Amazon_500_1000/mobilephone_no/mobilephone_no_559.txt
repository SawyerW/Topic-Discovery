I just want to add my two cents worth to the other reviewer's comments - and I understand many of you won't pay attention since I did not buy this from Amazon.  One word sums up the Galaxy Note:  Fabulous!  Beautiful and very bright display and I love the pen input.  Many things, including calendars, can be written on with the pen - it is very flexible in this regard.  One point not mentioned above - it is enabled for GLONASS (Russian) GPS.  I've taken it on two walks on the GPS accuracy and speed are great.  It picks up location much faster than my other phones which I assume is due to the GLONASS GPS receiver.  I do want to mention a couple of ankle-biters though:  I've downloaded all of my Amazon games and I have to say Plants-vs-Zombies ran kinda slow.  I tried rebooting it and playing it again - same story. So - I checked today and sure enough there was a 14+ mb update from Samsung which took the version to 2.3.6 (version when new was 2.3.5).  Both games I checked ran just fine after the update. Second - it does go through battery fairly quickly when connected to wi-fi - but this is typical of Android phones.  If you're short on data (I only get 200-mb per month on mine) then this could be an issue if you intend to use wi-fi a lot.  Last but not least - I could not find any reasonably priced carrying cases for it.  One was listed for sale here but was pretty pricey and would not ship until mid-December.  So - I went to the local media store and found a Garmin pouch - intended to be used with 5-inch Garmin GPS's (ASIN: B00422KZQG).  The fit is a little tight but it's perfect for $15 here on Amazon until a real case comes out.  Anyways - the Galaxy Note really is the best thing since sliced bread - small enough to be with you all the time - yet large enough to serve as a fantastic tablet.**** Added Comments on 26 NOV 11 ****  I've had the Galaxy Note a few more days now and I wanted to update my comments.  The update to 2.3.6 appears to have addressed the possible wi-fi battery usage issue I mentioned above.  After a full charge, I have used the phone two days and two hours and the battery level was at 78% this morning.  The past two days were light usage - but I did check e-mail using 3G both days and made a short call each day.  So - if there was a wi-fi battery usage problem it has been resolved.  And, I continue to be impressed by the beauty, color and high resolution of the display.  This is a beautiful and highly functional phone/tablet that I highly recommend!**** Added Comments on 16 DEC 11 **** The Galaxy Note continues to astound me!  Just like another reviewer commented - this really is the best phone/tablet yet! Integration with Exchange e-mail (IMAP) is flawless.  And, better yet, the e-mail client does the best job I have seen in handling e-mail with embedded photos.  Screen caps are equally easy using the included pen - although the little button you have to hold down for screen caps is tricky to manipulate.  And, this is the best device I have for battery life.  With occasional use throughout each day - I have gotten as many as eight days of battery life!!  I still think there is only one (minor) downside to the Note - the lack of a quality protective case.**** Added comments on 31 DEC 11 ****  I'm still thrilled with my Note and I cannot find anything to criticize.  I continue to especially impressed with how it handle's email.  I received a Gmail message with seven large photo attachments - the Note received it in a couple of seconds - and showed thumbnails within maybe five seconds.  I use Apple Mail on my MacBook Air - and even after 24+ hours the little pinwheel is still spinning trying to pull in all of the attachments!! Despite all of it's good points, and based on a comment I just received, I would have to say that the Note (and any other device with less than a 7-inch display) is not the best device for hours and hours of web-surfing.  A 5.3-inch display is just too small for that IMHO.
