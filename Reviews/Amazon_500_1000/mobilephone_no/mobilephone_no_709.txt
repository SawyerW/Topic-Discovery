I just changed my rating back to 5 stars. This phone rocks big timeORIGINAL POST:Got it some days ago (bought from keydroper), requested it in black and black it is. Very fast shipping from Hong Kong (seller is very responsive, replied to my email in two minutes).The display is amazing, with good angle views. It came with Android 4.1.1, not the expected 4.0 listed in the description, no complains there. I find it very fast, I agree it is not "super fast". I am using it with Tmobile prepaid, perfect. I plan to keep my prepaid number and get another with the $30 plan (full internet, 100 minutes) using the two sims, will update this review when I do it. Have not tested battery duration, seems good so far.As mentioned in another review by the engineer, the cable is not standard, but I could make a spare cutting the rubber in the mini usb side of an older cable.The only issue I have had so far was that the auto-rotate stopped working, restarting the phone did not fix the issue. I turned it off, took the battery out and put it back, started and it is working ok.I would have paid much more for this phone had I had the chance to test it in advance.***UPDATE 2/24/2013****Ok I just did the test of the data plan. Let me start with the good:Yes it works with the two sims, I have (for this test month) two t-mobile phone numbers, the original simple pay as you go and the other in the SIM2 the $30 data plan. It was easy to setup in the t-mobile site, no need to call them.Now the bad: this phone (at least my phone) does not connect using 3g, it shows an icon with an E (I think it means Edge) and the best download speed I tested was 160kb, upload 50kb and right now it is 35 and 34.I did a simple test: took out the SIM2 and put it in my old and trusty LG optimus and repeated the speed test: I got downloads of 1900kb and uploads of 100kb.The moral of the story: If you buy this phone expecting 3g speed with Tmobile you may be disappointed. I will not renew the plan and keep using it with my simple prepaid, wifi. But I changed my rating to 4.****UPDATE 3/1/2013I had the intermittent issue of the phone screen going off when placing a call. Found the explanation in a post on the web, here is it:------------Question: Hi, can you teach me how to calibrate?Post:It is actually a simple process. Locate your proximity sensor, it is a small LED-like thing next to the speaker, on either side. Look for calibration of proximity sensor, you can find it usually amongst the display options. Tap on it, target-like concentric circles appear and the application asks you to place some obstacles over the sensors. The easiest way is to hold your palm above the sensor approx. 5 cm (2 inches) apart. Touch the Start button, and then try to complete the process with your hand motionless. The whole process takes a few seconds. If you did everything right, during a call, holding the phone to your ear the screen goes blank, and the phone application re-appears when moving the phone away.------------I did the exact process and the phone is perfect now: I make a call, move it near my ear, screen goes off, move it away and it comes back. :-) :-) :-)I think that somebody mentioned this in some comment, but I did not know the exact procedure to calibrate. In my phone it is under Display and the caption is "Als-ps calibration" and the button caption is "Calibrate" (what the explanation refers to as Start button)****UPDATE 4/3/2013*****I bought another for my daughter, have not received it yet.She has ATT contract plan with data, her iPhone was stolen a while ago and she is using a replacement phone which goes up to 3g only.I removed my tmobile SIM, put her ATT SIM, powered up and behold: no need to change any settings, just acknowledged the prompt stating the SIM change, and the phone worked flawlessly with data at H speed (which is supposed to be faster than 3g)When the new phone arrives I will post speed tests.****UPDATE 4/7/2013******New phone for daughter is beautiful, white, both cameras have more megapixels.It is working with my daughter's ATT contract data SIM, speedtest application reports downloads of 2.2 megabits and uploads of almost 1 megabit (995kb). Daughter very happy.
