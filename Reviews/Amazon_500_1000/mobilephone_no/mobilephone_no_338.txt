I like it, it is a good and fast high end phone, it is very hard due the fact I had dropped it from my hands a lot of times and is still working in one piece, you need to put a screen cover otherwise you could get some scratch on your screen, but anyway it is a very durable phone, something that sony always know how to do.I live in Latin America and this phone is able to work on the networks of Telefonica Movistar, Digitel Tim and Movilnet from Venezuela, I travel a lot to Europe, I have an Ortel Mobile chip on it and I have been able to connect any carrier network on this phone using roaming and get full access to the network.The only fault is the battery, you can get a full day of battery if you don't use a lot of apps like Maps and Facebook, otherwise your battery will drain in half day. With the last update you can activate the Extended Battery Mode, some sort of Stamina mode for this phone model and you can get a respectable one or two days of battery but sacrificing the push data notifications, but you can always get a car charger and problem solved.You can update your phone if it doesn't come with the latest update from sony, and it will be very stable and fast, the only thing I miss from the 4.0 system is the ability of taking 3D pictures which is one of those AWESOME for showing to your friends features, I think it could get the same functionality using other apps on the Google Play Store, but with the update to 4.1 you get Google Now a really cool assistant feature from google (so smart that it really scare me).Another cool thing is that Xperia S has a lot of fans on the market, and the Xperia SL is basically the same phone with a faster processor, in that way almost any custom rom and customization of the Xperia S can be used on the Xperia SL, including Cyanogen Mod, you can easily get the root for this phone searching on the XDA developers forum for "Doomlord easy rooting toolkit for Xperia S".You can also play games and watch movies on your tv if you order the micro hdmi to hdmi cable, it is PlayStation Certified, that means that you can play very cool 3D games on this phone like Call of Duty, N.O.V.A, Asphalt 8, etc... and the graphics are like a PS2, you can also connect a Dual Shock pad using the corresponding USB OTG cable and you instantly have a PlayStation that can be hold in the palm of your hand. On the manual says that you can use the control remote from your tv to control the phone but the tv has to be HDMI control enabled, and it doesn't work in all the TVs from the market, until now I haven't been able to test that feature, because I have and old Sony Bravia TV, one of those 720p that first came on the market.In general I am very happy with this phone and by the time it is going to stop receiving updates from Sony I probably going to get a custom room like Cyanogen Mod, it cost me about 340$ that is a lot of cheaper than an unlocked iPhone, it have a cool 12mp camera a fast processor, it is PlayStation Certified and I like Android far more than iOS.
