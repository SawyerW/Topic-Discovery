New Phone!I had been holding off getting a smart phone as they have been out of my price range, till lately.I have all the gadgets though, a cell phone, GPS, pocket PC, camera and laptop. Finally bought other brand that had to go back then a second other brand that did not arrive, then decided that I have had 3 or 4 Nokia with no issue to get the N8. Not disappointed when it arrived great look and feel and after a couple weeks I am getting use to the UI and finding way around.Great wifi connectivity, gets mail instantly and web surfing zooms too, just a little limited in what you see.Initially I was having trouble with the wifi not shutting off as it should by the manual but see from other user that it will not shut off, found work around and that is put phone in offline mode, problem there you can not get phone calls.Other gripe is related to document capabilities, as I big on pdf reading find that the pdf reader is inferior to my 5yr HP Ipac, uses a lot of the screen prorifery which reduces the actual available view screen and has no overflow mode, can work around and maybe there is an AP that will fix this.Now find the battery may be way off spec, I have turned off all key tones and vib stuff as well as on GSM only, charge at night down to one bar in morning in normal setting! In offline mode with no calls and little other use the battery will go 5days (~100hrs) always have full bars reception via AT&T.;I have done more investigation and have changed the mail settings way down to 12hr sync and a lot of the other stuff they mention in the manual under extending battery life. If this works I will give back a star otherwise I will look to return the phone.Six months now!Now had this phone over six months, I have had to put that extra star up as I managed to sort out the battery life. I keep the phone in power save mode and the phone goes most of the week without recharge.Love the GPS as long as I do not need to navigate about a big CBD (inner city area), I found that the screen goes into standby mode which was a worry, but the GPS does reawaken before any directional change.The one minor annoyance with wifi in power save mode is that the ISP connection must reload every time you change pages, open email or the like. Not a problem unless you have an account that must be logged into everytime you connect, one of my networks is like this but I am currently trying a new authentication system which should fix this.Found Quick Office APP for pdf reading with reflow (US$9.95) like I want, loaded easy only not full function removed as advised now have issue with some setting cruption. Will have to go through factory reset that includes saving all data and wiping current custom phone config, what a hassle!!!*** Remember to ask either your ISP provider, your mobile network provider, your APP provider or Nokia techies for assistance if you have issues as they are usual able to assist and should find most genuine to help, maybe some newbies will give grief but work through for piece of mind ***All in all I am really happy with this phone, it looks cool, it has what I need, it was a reasonable price and I can use my own mobile provider. Would give four and half star.The big new gripe I have is that the N9 has just come to my attention and now I want that.
