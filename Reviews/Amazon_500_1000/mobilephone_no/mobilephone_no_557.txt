I read many reviews here before making the decision to purchase this phone, I work in the IT industry, and I am probably the last hold out in my department to stay on the feature phone, my expectation of a phone is to use it easily and conveniently to stay in touch, I am not interested in using phone to watch TV, playing games, that said, I found this phone does not fulfill my expectation.Start with the user interface, it really force you to adopt to the tile layout of the interface, you almost have no other way to get around from one function to another, if you are in a browser, you need to make a phone call, you have to bring the tile up then press the phone, then make the call. If the phone number is not in the history calls you made, another button, you need to press to bring up the phone directory or dial pad to dial he number, it is nightmarish if you try this in the dark, as the  key is not lighted, you end up trying several times before you can even start to make a call.One thing I absolutely hate it in this phone is the Microsoft Bing search button, it is right there in the lower front panel, next to the windows pan button, it is sensitive, and you can inadvertently bring this search page up, and you have no intention to, which just makes your life difficult, especially you are on the go and you want to make a quick phone call.The lay out of the side button for camera activation is another aggravating point of this phone, it is right there where you held your phone, and if you grab your phone and sometimes, it just turn on the camera, you lost whatever you are doing at the time, bad design.On top of it, the battery life is not good, I do not think I am a typical heavy user of the phone, with one day use, my battery bar is down to 50%, I almost have to charge the phone constantly in a daily basis.This is straightly out of my own user experience owing this phone almost a month now, there are other minor inconvenient points that I consider just not worth of mentioning comparing with the above user interface experience, overall, not a very good phone.** 6/19/2012 Follow upI confirm my review prior, the battery life is seriously deficient, with light to medium use (check email, read email, no web or gaming) the battery will not last more than 2 days, I almost have to re-charge battery every night.** 7/6/2012 second follow upI still upheld my original observation and comment, the phone's interface has its own quirkiness, if you are Microsoft fan, and you really like the Microsoft ways (like Bing search around every corner), on your face marketing, this cell phone is a good choice for you, I have been using this phone for a while, I am getting used to it, but I certainly have my opinion of the tile motive and swipe action of the phone, sometimes, it just does not give you the things you want quickly (e.g. if you want to get to your address book from your phone, you have to go through the recent called entries, then follow by pressing the little icon at the bottom of the screen called address book), because of the "fancy" tile interface, there is no other way you can invoke your phone function by looking at your address book first. The phone itself functions well enough, and Amazon buying experience is great, my first phone develop a hair line crack, Amazon just replaced it for me, no question asked, what a service! I will add back one star for that.** 9/1/2012 third follow upnow, I have more time with the phone from hardware point of view, the battery life of this phone is not very good, I have to charge everyday, will definitely not able to last for more than 3 days of use, I do not consider myself use this phone heavily, do not make a lot of phone calls, occasionally check my email and calendar, I do not even exceed the basic AT&T; minimum data plan, but the phone needs to be charged everyday.** 3/29/2013I am on my second one of this phone, the first one developed a hair line crack on the screen, I have not dropped it but noticed this after I got the phone for several months, Amazon replaced the phone and it is very nice of them to do this.Continue to use this Windows 8 phone, now it starts to catch up with more users, I still think the phone itself (SamSung) is not of highest quality, and it is a little bit dated both in the screen size and battery usage time, I looked at a few other choices, I think Nokia and HTC are better.
