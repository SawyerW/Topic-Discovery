I got this phone a long time ago, Blackberrys always looked the same and meant status and position in life.This one was a good companion for a quite a while and I liked it for the most part...though there are more than a few things annoying about it.8530 came with a single core 528MHz ARM11 processor, 2MP camera (without flash), a very decent keyboard (my Ironworker fingers can type without much trouble) and a couple less important things.Let me just get to the good and the bad about it:Pros:Keyboard;MP3/video player;the ease of adding files to SD card;very good sound (loud);start-up time;size - fits in the palm of my hand;external MP3 player control buttons;build quality (I kicked and threw it more than once and it worked like new);decent WIFI connectivity;OpenGL ES 2.1 support;Cons:slow CPU;small screen;very short battery life;lame WIFI transmit speed;Recently, I wanted to buy a new phone but I was kinda apprehensive to let go of this phone :DDon't care how many iPhones get released - I still think they are frigile asian made trash - if this 8530 had faster (Dual-Core) CPU and a better/bigger screen it would still be my phone even today. Unfortunately a week ago my BB started to act-up and would lose network coverage, every few minutes it would go out of service, drop calls and generally annoy me as hell - I really don't know what happened to it. Now as BB brand got basically forgotten by most ex-users it's almost impossible to find a reliable service place where they could take a look at it, but than again a good technician will probably charge a lot to fix it anyway - considering one can get this BB from ~$80 today I don't think it's worth it.The thing that convinced me that I need a new phone was the "BB Protect" backup experience - it just sucks !!!!!!!!I have over 130 #'s to people I know and now I can get them out of this damn backup without a working BB connected to a service - basically BB takes your info and protects it to a point where me - the owner of those contacts - can't get them out if I decide to leave the BB brand - BS !!!!!!! JOKE !!!!I figure the only option I have is to buy a new BB from here and use that to get what I need.Hope this works.Anyway, it was a good phone always reliable and always there when I need to make a call, text, use GPS or just listen to music so I don't have to listen to people on the train.It's also worth to mention this BB supports OpenGL ES 2.1 - not that there were or are any good BB games that use it (except Aces BrickBracker 3D & PBA Bowling 2), maybe if developers took time to make full use of it.............The events of the last few days won't affect my score as 2 years for any cellphone is really pushing it considering how fast technology moves today.Peace.
