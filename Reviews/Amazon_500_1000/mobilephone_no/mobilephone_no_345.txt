UPDATE on July 11, 2013I'm adding the last star to make it a 5-star review because this phone is deserving of it. Again, it is an awesome phone if you put the work into it. I added some pictures to the customer images section here, so check it out. I'm running CyanogenMod 10.1, and by gosh is it awesome. Do yourself a favor and get a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-016G-AFFP-A), set up Link2SD, and this thing will just fly.The new camera for 4.2/3 Google Experience devices works really nice on it. Holding it and using the volumes to snap pictures really helps with the clarity since it gives you a steady grip. I love the outcome of my after sunset shots too. Really nice for a somewhat crappy camera. I really like using Cameringo with it too, perfect camera app for this phone.And oh yeah, I accidentally walked out behind my carport when it was raining like bucket loads of water. The phone pretty much got submerged in it since it was in my hand at the time. But I was able to wipe it off with a towel, and it has been okay for the last two months since then.It's going to be HARD to go back to an iPhone.----------I am coming from a S2 Skyrocket that has a dented lens. So I'm coming from a phone that has a beautiful 8MP camera, 4G, and an awesome 4.5" screen. Did I mention it had a better processor?The Fusion 2 feels great in your hands, I really like the back cover - It's grippy and not slippery like the Samsung phones. It took me like 20 minutes to get the back off to put my SIM and battery in though. I guess that's a positive when you think about it though. I have dropped my S2 in the past, and the cover and battery flew all over the place.It's fits nicely in my skinny jeans, which are the only type of pants I own. So that makes me happy. The camera software isn't as nice and complex, but I can live with that.Missing my Live Wallpapers already. I just recently found one with jungle animals made of clay. It was cute.The interface is uglier than TouchWiz, but as long as I don't have to go into settings, I have already sorted that out.Rooting is a must, it will make the experience better. I set my CPU governor to Conservative, and it makes a HUGE difference in performance. I'm also using Dialer + as a replacement dialer, it's beautiful. Dolphin Browser is working nicely too.I thought I was going to have to sacrifice most of my apps, but it was really only my Timetable one that wasn't Gingerbread certified, which is okay because I went back to my other favorite schedule app - Studious.It's not a good phone, but it isn't bad either. It'll work for me until the next iPhone comes out though.----------UPDATE on March 22, 2013I'm adding one more star because the battery life is AWESOME! I've been using it like crazy, and I still have like half of the battery left. It has a great standby, even with the amount of add-ons I have:Holo LauncherHolo LockerGloveboxPower TogglesBeWeather ProGames are working pretty nicely too. I have a good chunk of them that run pretty nice:Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EPAlice of HeartsBeat HazardBIT.TRIP BEATCanabaltDynamite JackEDGE ExtendedFieldrunnersMini Golf MatchUpNightSkyOsmosSpiritsSuper HexagonWorld of GooMost of them are from Humble Bundles though, I'm not sure if the stores would let you install them, but they work otherwise if you want to side load them from another device.One problem I encountered though is that you can't use both the internal storage and external SD card. I'm using a 2GB microSD myself, but I would try and go for a 4GB just for a little more room to breathe for your apps and games. Plan to leave it in there too, because like I said in my earlier review, taking off the back cover is a pain to take off!I got Live Wallpapers working too, and the phone is pretty good at putting everything to sleep, that they don't drain the battery. You'll have to side load them though. They don't seem to cause any issues with the memory either.This phone gets better to use everyday.
