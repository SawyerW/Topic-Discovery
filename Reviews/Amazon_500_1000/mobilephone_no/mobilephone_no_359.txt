My rating subject to change, as follows. Here is what happened so far:Received phone in new condition after 72 hours from OEM Shop.My intended use: $30/yr emergency usage plan. ($10/120 day pin x 3)Activation of phone for free from PagePlus went smoothly. Purchased $10 PIN.Enabled wifi by clicking in upper right corner of phone app and clicking appropriate choice.Immediately turned off data connection by clicking Verizon in upper left corner of phone card and clicking preference (data off) immediately after activation.Was HORRIFIED when I got message saying my $10 credit was exhausted within a half hour of activating my advice, though I had not placed any calls or texts or downloaded content while on 3G.Called PagePlus to try to get them to reapply my $10 credit.They refused claiming that Palm Pixie is unauthorized and unsupported device.Requested to speak with supervisor and told I had to request a service ticket to do so and then a manager would call back within 24 hrs.After 22 hours with no callback, I called customer service and was connected with a friendly but ignorant customer service supervisor who informed me that she encounters this problem very frequently with Palm Pixie and that it will download data even with data is disabled.I questioned her intently about this (since it made no sense to me) and she repeated that even with wifi many of the apps in the phone, such as weather, will somehow use 3G data even when data is disabled. She said it is like a little computer and needs data.She suggested that if I wanted to use Palm Pixie I had better disable all Apps that came with the phone. Otherwise, her recommendation was to buy a standard supported cell phone (not smartphone) through PagePlus.I thanked her and planned to return Pixie to OEM Shop.Decided to call Palm support at 1-866-770-PALM to corroborate/verify Page Plus' information before returning device.After asking for details of my phone including serial number and phone number, Palm listened to what happened and what I was told by PagePlus.Palm emphatically and categorically denied that with data disabled the phone or any of its apps would still consume 3G data.As I had two conflicting opinions, I next called Kitty Wireless. Spoke with very polite and knowledgeable rep (Caleb) who confirmed what Palm told me and suggested that probably what had happened is that as soon as activation was complete and PIN was loaded, phone updated its system software and this used the $10 PIN I had purchased.Caleb assured me this is a very common problem and that it should not reoccur now that data is disabled and wifi is set-up.Said that he has heard of Android phones sometimes consuming data while in data disabled mode, but never with Palm Pixie.Suggested buying another $10 PIN, instead of more expensive PIN, just as a precaution.Asked him what is the main difference between Kitty Wireless and PagePlus.Caleb told me that Kitty is an authorized dealer of PagePlus and that biggest difference is the service.Kitty Wireless only has two employees, Kitty and Caleb, so customers get knowledgeable personal service.I thanked him and placed the order online for $10 PIN with auto refilling from Kitty Wireless.Assuming all goes well, I will not update this review. If it does not, and I continue to have problems of spurious data download while in data disabled mode, I will edit this review if possible, or find a way of entering a new one.****EDIT**** RATING REVISED TO 4 STARSReceived very helpful e-mail from Kitty at Kitty Wireless suggesting further measures to make 100% sure that phone does not consume data that I have not requested:"If you know, for a fact, that you will NOT be using data on your device - CALL 800-550-2436 and say this: "I would like for you to disable the web data and the picture messaging features on my standard plan phone so that I do not mistakenly use my cash balance for data." Give them your cellular number, and have them disable your data & picture messaging services. This will prevent you from losing ANY of your cash balance."also provides this website for clarification: [ ... ]I am very impressed with Kitty Wireless so far, have done as she suggests, and am happy with Palm Pixie Plus so far, but will edit/revise as experience dictates  [I've only had phone for 2 days]
