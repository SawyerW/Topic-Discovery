I got this after accidentally dunking my Moto V551 in a cup of coffee (which, judging from V551 reviews and my boyfriend's experience with his V551, was probably a blessing).I'll admit I was sold by the external color screen. I also had a Samsung previously and was very happy with that phone - it "lived" for 2.5 years, brought me through contract and when it did finally crap out it was just the display that died, the actual phone still made and received calls.So kudos to Samsung for making reliably good phones.This phone does just fine for the basics - it has good reception, I never drop calls, sound is on the quiet side but still reasonable. The phone book works is easy to use. The display is bright and the color is vivid. Buttons give good "click" feedback when pressed and menus are reasonably well organized. Charges well, except good luck finding a replacement charger besides ordering another Samsung one (see 3rd party accessories below comment below). Everything *basic* works as it should.It's the *extras* where the phone starts to lose points. First, the camera SUCKS. The V551 was crap overall but at least the camera was decent. The E317 has a VGA camera and it's very hard to get a picture you can actually see anything in. Then again, if you want to take pics I suppose you should be using a digital camera, and not your phone.Another gripe I have with the camera function is the external button that activates the camera. Considering the camera is crap this is probably a superfluous feature anyway (you're not gonna go around whipping out your phone to take pics), but it's especially annoying because I am constantly having to delete pictures of the inside of my purse. This also drains the battery.The games are all right - a bejeweled clone, a pipeline linking game, golf and chess.The ringtones blow. Only one "normal" ringing sound, the rest are music-like tones that WOULD sound okay except for bizarre sound effects that are inserted - birds, people cheering, cats meowing...Finally, it BUGS ME TO NO END that Samsung phones do not take 3rd party accessories.So:**GOOD**-Good reception - haven't dropped a call yet-Solid phone-Decent volume in calls-Good color display-Decent menus-Okay games**BAD**-Sucky camera-Annoying external camera button activates camera when you don't want it-Horrid ringtone selection-Can't use 3rd party accessories!Overall I expect this phone to be as reliable and longlived as my last Samsung phone, which I was very happy with. If you want a decent phone that's small and has a cool color screen, but don't care so much about the camera and other bells and whistles, this is a good choice.A note about Cingular - it's a fine carrier unless you actually need to call customer service. They're only around business hours Mon-Sat I believe, and quality of the service is VERY variable. If you don't get a satisfactory answer you can call a few more times and you might be able get someone who can actually help you. This has actually happened to me - I had a billing issue and called 3 times. The first I was dropped while on hold. The second I was told the CS person would "leave a msg" for her supervisor and I would be contacted within 72 hrs. I thought, fat chance, and called a 3rd time. I got a very helpful CS who solved my problem in 5 mins right over the phone. This aspect of the CS may be good or bad depending on your point of view. Me, I can't wait till contract is up so I can go back to T-Mobile.
