I am not going to spend a lot of time listing 'specs' because Amazon's page for the Verizon version has them all, well organized and in detail. Instead, I will discuss our experience with the PLAY from a gamer's point of view because I can't see anyone but a gamer considering this.BRIEF ASSESSMENTThe Xperia PLAY attempts to combine an advanced Android phone with a portable gaming platform resembling the PSP or rather the PSP Go hoping that the integrated whole will turn into something more than the sum of its parts but, in my view, what we get is a good, solid gadget that fails to come close to 'best in class' in either the smart phone or the portable gaming platform categories. There are many smart phones that outperform it (better, faster, dual-core CPUs) and outfeature (4G, HDMI, DLNA support) the Xperia PLAY and, while it superficially resembles the PSP Go, the PLAY only accepts games specifically converted to work with it, meaning that you'll have to buy them again and, at least at the time I am writing this review, it can't access Sony's PSN store. While you can play Android games, you will need to find 'PLAY optimized' titles if you are to take advantage of the PSP-like game pad.THE GOODAgain, neither the phone component or the PSP-like transformation are bad, they are quite good and here is what I liked about them:- Android 2.3. It's not the latest in Android but I was assured that upgrades are forthcoming.- Decent battery life. Sure, you can't play or stay on the phone forever but unless all you do is play and stay on the phone all day one charge per day should be sufficient.- Good 'game pad' integration. You go into 'game mode' the moment you pull out the pad.- Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi available and working well. Also a microUSB port.- Very nice stereo speakers. They work well with the games and, as a bonus, you get better than decent sound in 'speaker phone' mode.- A couple of very nice preloaded apps: Kindle, Google Maps, YouTube, Skype Mobile,Twitter and Facebook integration.- 8GB microSD card included but you can replace it with a larger one, of course.- PSP Go like controls including some innovative implementation of the 2 analog joysticks as touch-pads.- Lots of preloaded games (I will list them at the bottom of this review)THE BAD- Single-core CPU makes it a relatively slow performer as a smart phone.- Lack of HDMI port and DLNA support makes it a poor multimedia gadget.- The display is not that bright, probably to conserve battery life.- The cameras are okay but barely so and the flash is not that bright.- The touchpads meant to replace the analog joysticks are not always responsive.- As a phone, it's a little on the bulky side.- Not all Android games can be played in the game mode. It's confusing and it can be frustrating.- Can't play PSP or PSOne games unless adapted, meaning that you need to buy them again.RATINGI am going to give the PLAY 3 stars which means "it's Okay". It's an interesting concept and it works to some degree but someone who wants an Android phone and a serious portable gaming platform may be better off with an actual Android phone and a PSP or a PSP Go. I am giving it 3 stars and not 2 stars because my kid (the one who didn't have a PSP) decided that it was good enough for him and he's using it now. Thanks to the large number of preloaded games and to the availability of some PLAY-friendly Android games we didn't have to buy any old games again yet.___________________________________________________These are the game that came preloaded with the Verizon version:* Adrenalin* Asphalt 6* Bruce Lee Dragon Warrior* Crash Bandicot* Madden NFL 11* Star Battalion* Tetris (Android mode only)* The Sims 3-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<
