I'm enjoying this phone very much as it's my first smartphone, but I have to call BS on the 720p video. Samsung is simply lying putting that in the specs. Sure, it can create a video file with a resolution of 1280x720, but it's blurry crap. The actual visible detail is significantly less than my Cannon camera's 640x480 video. Looking closely at a high contrast edge in a "720p" video, the image is obviously a doubling and softening of 640x360. Interpolating to a higher resolution is a useful feature -- it turns ugly pixellated video into just blurry video -- but it ain't 720p. The specs should say 640x360 video with interpolation to 720p. But even that would be stretching the truth because the focus is so bad that even at 320x240, sharp edges are a little soft. (I did use the highest compression quality, superfine, during my testing.) The front-facing camera may actually be sharper, but it only shoots at 15fps. At least the 5mp photos are sharp right down to the individual pixels.It has a 4" diagonal (actual viewing area) 480x800 multi-touch screen and a 1.2GHz 32-bit dual core processor.I copied 1,613,885,440 bytes to it in 1m50s over "high speed" USB 2.0. That's 14.67 million bytes/sec or 14MB/s.Without activating the Virgin Mobile service, the phone can still do everything except phone calls and texts. (And you can even do that, sort of, with VoIP apps over WiFi.) You can copy media to it over the USB cable. You can access the Web and the app store over WiFi. It can even be used as a GPS device. The free app NavFree lets you download map data for any US state and several countries and navigate without cell service. It only tries to activate cell service once each time it is powered on from being completely shut down, and you can just hit the cancel button.The audio quality from the 3.5mm headphone jack is somewhere between a cassette tape and CD. It doesn't have crisp high end even with the equalizer cranked. But that's actually above average even among dedicated MP3 players last time I checked. The built-in speaker is good enough to listen to spoken word material. Interestingly, it has microphones on either end and, when it shoots video, it records in real stereo at 48kHz and 128kbps.The 2gb limit on app storage could be a problem for some. It can use a microSD card (externally accessible, up to 32gb) but only to store music, videos, photos, etc.... (Some apps can store some of their data on the card. For example, NavFree lets you put your map data on the card.) But remember, when you buy an app from the Google store you can download it again without paying again. So you can delete a big game after finishing it and download it again months later to play again. There seem to be different memory set-ups. Mine came with 2gb of ROM and 2gb of RAM. Much of the software that comes with it seems to be on the ROM. It looks like less than 100mb of RAM is used by pre-installed stuff. Mine reports 1.73gb (1,857,573,356 bytes) total memory.Video playing tests:It plays 720x400 video @ 24fps compressed with h.264 @ 800kbps.It plays 1264x704 video @ 30fps compressed with h.264 @ 938kbps.It plays 1920x1040 video @ 24fps compressed with h.264 @ 1878kbps.Even though the screen doesn't have HD resolution, being able to play HD video without re-compressing is very convenient.With no running apps and the screen turned off (but the phone still powered up) the battery will last for days. Demanding apps can drain the battery in a few hours though. There's no reason to turn it off at night. Just put it on charge. It takes 35 seconds to start up from a completely powered down state.It doesn't come with a separate charger and USB cable. The charger has a large USB port on it. The single cable connects the phone to your computer or to the charger. It can charge from your PC's USB port, but not as quickly as from the charger. The phone has a micro-USB port, the smallest of the 3 flat sizes.The LED flash is very bright and even. It includes a widget flashlight button that turns it into a nice flashlight.The battery can be replaced by the user, though I don't think the delicate cover would survive daily battery swaps for long.It is slippery, but you can get an Aimo padded shell for it for $6 here on Amazon.
