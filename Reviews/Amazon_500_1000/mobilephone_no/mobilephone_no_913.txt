This is my first smart phone, and I am very pleased with 99% of the technical specs on the phone. The phone is incredibly user friendly, THE VIDEO AND PHOTO IMAGING ARE BY FAR SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN IN NYC (BEING SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT A SMART PHONE)ON ANY ANDROID OR APPLE DEVICE. The Battery Life is also significantly better.I can't compare it to the specs on the Galaxy IV  because that was a higher price range, but compared to the Galaxy IV & the Apple I5 this has 32 GB of storage! Based on what I have read it is 720 HD resolution for Netflix and YouTube. The Galaxy IV or Apple I5 are both 1080p. For me personally this is not significant for a five inch screen. It records in 1080 HD and can be connected to your TV via an HDMI cable.Although the music app is Nokia Music Tunes, you can upload the majority of your I-tune library via a Windows 7 or 8 PC.The only negative for me regarding this phone is the lack of Apps primarily regarding Video application such as HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, and Amazon Prime video watching. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT ADOBE FLASH PLAYER, hopefully this will change in the near future. I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE PHONE AND I AM ACTUALLY SURPRISED IT DOES NOT SUPPORT IT. IF WAS AWARE OF THIS ADVANCE IT WOULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR FACTOR IN MY PHONE CHOICE. SO FOR SPORT ADDICTS DURING PLAYOFF TIME THIS PHONE WILL NOT HELP YOU AT THE MOMENT.Another MAJOR PLUS if you actually use a smart phone in Business; is that it comes with all Microsoft Office applications, Excel, Word, Outlook, Notebook, and Power Point.If you decide to get this phone I highly recommend you attain the phone here or at Best Buy, a Verizon store or Verizon online will cost you double which is simply not necessary. When I saw how it was priced online, here and other sites, I was disgusted with Verizon. I was eligible for an upgrade, but the only difference in the end between myself as an existing Verizon customer, and a new Verizon customer (the service as a carrier is superior) was a mere 5 dollars. I hope the better business bureau looks into Verizon wireless, because the reality is for existing Verizon customers, it is a bate and switch scam, I was content with my "dumb" phone, and their email to me that I would get an upgrade at a discount was simply a means to get me into the store. I could have upgraded my device here and saved A LOT of money. that being said for 50 dollars you are getting an awesome phone that I would put up there with the I phone 5 (with much better battery life) and any high end Android Device.In summary Great Phone- if you are a TV addict you need a Droid or I phone at this juncture and this phone is not for you. As far as Verizon DO NOT buy it at verizonwireless.com or in at a Verizon retail store you will pay double. Otherwise you can see for yourself as the specs are clearly outlined by Amazon, and it does import most music files from I-tunes.
