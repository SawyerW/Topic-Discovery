HANG ON....Because this is a bit complicated.First, I have wanted a wrist-watch-phone for years...It just seems like such a no-brainer of convenience to me...No forgetting or losing your phone, no digging it out of a pocket in a hurry to get a call, or missing a call through distraction, etc....Add to that, I am not interested in going online from a hand-held device, or playing games, etc...I just want to send and receive calls...I just want a handy TELEPHONE....A phone that is right there, on my wrist, ready to use.I chose this model due to the rugged steel construction and water-proof description...I lead a fairly active lifestyle, and having my phone on my wrist presented obvious hazards to the technology.NOTE: Here is where we get complicated....I first saw this on a website being referred to as 'The Commando', and it had a price of $185. ('On Sale' supposedly, from $275.).... and I would have purchased that $185 watch-phone..Had I not noticed the EXACT SAME device priced at $93 on another site ( called there 'the w818' ...I`m not sure if Amazon allows me to 'name names' here, or I would name the site)...Then, to make matters more convoluted, I saw it here on Amazon, for $120...called 'the MW08' AND the 'W818'/ 'WATERPROOF MOBILE WATCH PHONE' in seperate listings...All of the listings for this same watch-phone on every site use THE SAME promo pictures and list the same features, no matter what it is being called and priced at.Well of course, I went for the cheapest price, at that other companies` site ...and man, am I sooo sorry that I did !The watch-phone I received was nothing but trouble...Incomplete package, defective phone that would not read the new, activated T-Mobile SIM card I had bought...and worse, the customer service from this company was TERRIBLE. No response to emails or calls and a 'returns request' page that was actually designed to prevent the customer from submitting a return !(Again, not sure if Amazon would allow me to name them, as much as I want to warn you...if interested, post a reply to this review and I`ll post the names of all companies I found serious fault with, that way if Amazon objects and removes the reply, at least this neutered review will remain active to caution others to BE CAREFUL)Anyway, not willing to give up, I filed complaints and disputes and opened cases to get my money back from the thieves...... Then, I went ahead and purchased the $120 version offered here, by VICTOR, LLC.I have faith in Amazon`s Returns Policy, and I should have gone with that faith in the first place, instead of trying to save a big $25 and ending up buying a load of aggravation with the savings.The 'MW08' purchased here came swiftly... At first, the device gave me some hassles--the same non-recognition of SIM card--then I tried something that I had previously attempted with no result in the defective one; I placed a bit of foam material under the watch-back cover so that the battery would press onto and hold the SIM interface a bit more securely...and EUREKA ! IMMEDIATE SUCCESS !The Amazon-Victor- purchase 'MW08' watchphone came to life without a problem and has functioned normally and well since. (Should this status change, I will update this review accordingly)Just an F.Y.I.: These are all made in China. The Chinese electronics industry is a cut-throat business wherein the reliable mixes with the fraudulent, and the quality can be both variable and questionable... Assorted manufacturers --both reputable and disreputable-- pirate each others` designs and crank these things out through assorted selling companies, some of them little more than fronts for shady dealings...They will slap different names and numbers on the same model and describe it in glowing terms of purest HYPE. The widely- varying prices are not representative of quality, but avarice.Bottom Line: You have to BE CAREFUL.My advice for getting a wrist-watch-phone is to purchase either here on Amazon, or on a certain notable online auction site (where the threat of a negative feedback and an in-house payment service can offer you some recourse if you get a bad device.)The wrist-watch-phone IS a great idea....Hopefully, some of the better electronics concerns will get into the field with a superior model, instead of just pushing one more smartphone/tablet device after another in an already glutted field.There ARE people who, like me (and high-probability, yourself, if you have read this far) who would just like to have a quality phone on their wrist.The existence of these here and elsewhere proves they can and do work.Until we see something better...Best Of Luck to you !
