The Republic Wireless (RW) version of the MOTO X is a bit of a different gadget. It has been specifically modified for that carrier & cannot be used elsewhere (with the exception of WIFI calling & data). The phone has been modified with a custom unflashable  ROM. It is also *not* a rooted phone, so many apps which require root access will not work. It also exclusively uses the SPRINT system for cell calls and cell data.OK, That's the limitations. Now for it's advantages & etc. ... Here's my review of the phone that I wrote in response to a column in the WSJ (Smartphone With Wi-Fi Smarts):---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been watching Republic Wireless (RW) for some time. I found that I don't use the "data" feature on my Samsung Galaxy S2 (T-Mobile) very much at all. And, I can live with the occasional inconvenience of not having it. This is especially so considering the price. When the MOTO X came available, I jumped & ordered one. I've been testing it over the past week since it arrived.Some notes:1) The first phone they sold was a bit of a dog. The second was better, but still barked. The third looks like it hit the sweet spot.2) The WIFI bias does have some potential for problems. The only ones that I see so far is when the phone is near an almost out-of-range, or heavily used, WIFI signal. Note: the WIFI has to be an open (unlocked) signal. In an area with only locked WIFI networks, it'll stay on Cell.3) The phone has a clean swap from WIFI to Cell with no hiccup. My S2 drops the call *every* time! Performing the same exact drive down the same street as I move away from my home WIFI & the MOTO X does a clean switch.4) The phone is limited to some selection restrictions: black, or white. So, bling is out, except for the case. I guess I'll just have to suffer.5) Phone shape: Very nice, except that I personally prefer a flat candy-bar style. So, it was off to AMAZON for a tailored case (just arrived this afternoon by UPS).6) The phone is middle of the road in it's smart phone features: Smaller Screen; OK processor speed; only 16G (11G, or so, available to the user); so-so camera; and the only one big negative, no microSD slot for memory expansion. Also of note is that the phone is sealed & you can't easily replace the battery.7) Available unlocked for $650 from various sellers. Subsidized by RW at $300 ($330, as tested) with ***no*** contract required! Just a month-by-month charge on your Credit Card.8) Ability to swap plans up & down to get extra features when needed. See, you can have data when you want it! I'm on the Cell Talk & Text w/WIFI Data only Plan.9) I have a MagicJack+, so I can put the MJ App on the phone & have a dual line phone when I am in an open WIFI area! I'm in the process of doing this now. It worked great in my S2, so I expect no problems here.10) And, yes, I use WIFI calling at home because I get crappy reception from T-Mobile (& before that ATT & SPRINT) at home. So, this phone & the plans & pricing beat the pants off of the competition for me.11) WARNING: It is *not* a rooted phone! So, you cannot run some Apps on it (such as Root Call Blocker). So, be advised, it's got some technical limitations. These are tradeoffs for the price & etc.Finally, I have a 2 month overlap before my T-Mobile contract ends. I'll port my existing Cell # over at that time. And drop my monthly charges from approx. $85 to approx. average of $13. ($10 + the usual taxes that you can't escape). Average plan + phone cost (amortizing the phone over 2 years - approx. $40/ mo. & over 3 years - $24/ mo.) is $40/mo.All-in-all, I'm extremely pleased with the phone & the service so far. I should point out that I researched on & off label wireless carriers for 6 months. My best general find was Walmart with their VOIP (MJ competition) & their bring your old (T-Mobile Phone) Cell plans. Both are quite a bit more expensive over time.So, my S2 is now mounted on a Grace Digital Stereo adaptor/charger system in my bedroom & has been converted to a small stereo & clock radio system. And, my even older Samsung Instinct is now used as a standalone MP3 player. Such is the march of technology.Special note: Read the fine print on your phone contracts. Do not toss out your old phone. You can still use it as either a WIFI only phone (ex. with MJ if you have WIFI capability) and as an emergency 911 phone.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------13 Dec 2013: An update. After purchasing another product (a case) that didn't work out, I replaced it with a better one. It is a PDair case (available from both AMAZON & eBay). This case isn't quite as nice as the PDair case for my now retired Samsung Galaxy S2, but it's still a great case. It does have some limitations, but is the best case that i have found for this phone to date. You can see my review of the PDair case on AMAZON.
