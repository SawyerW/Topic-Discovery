Dealing with Amazon and their Vendors has left my personal life in tatters.This is part of an ongoing four week plus saga of trying to purchase an off-contract phone through Amazon, both from Amazon(Warehouse Direct) directly, and through third part vendors, the attempt of which has cost me and my (soon to be ex-) girlfriend huge.I will admit to being broke and cheap, a dangerous combination that can get you taken advantage of, but this vendor, I feel, is involved in fraudulent activity.Over a month of our lives wasted, throwing away money on a cell phone account that has no working device, and even my girlfriend getting fired for not meeting the terms of her employment, that's the cost of attempting to deal with Amazon.My advice to you is; do not purchase from Amazon Third Parties, Amazon does nothing to protect you from these people taking your money, and destroying your life, because they have your money, and you are their hostage.  Speak out and you will never see satisfaction.Amazon is nearly an accomplice in the fraud perpetrated by their vendors against their customers, turning a blind eye to the illegal activities occurring in their market place everyday.This vendor, Cell Beautiful, who turns out to be Great Value Cellular, apparently, is involved in the selling of illegally altered phones; they have the address of a house listed with Amazon, that been listed for sale for almost a year, and according to the Realtor is sitting empty.The seller, Cell Beautiful(GVC) had an Amazon ad that listed a clean ESN device.What they shipped was a device that Sprint informed us did not have clear ownership, was not released from contract, and had an outstanding balanceGVC informed me I was mistaken, that the phone was fine.  I informed them, in detail, of the conversation with Sprint, and offered a three way call with Sprint.All in all several hours of my life wasted trying to activate this phone and then to get GVC understand(admit) what was happening.GVC finally claimed a simple mistake had been made and they shipped a phone that had been altered to operate under Boost.The phone shipped was not altered in any way according to am examination by myself and a nearby cell phone repair shop.GVC told me, that if I returned it, they would fix the issue with the phone, or ship me a replacement phone.I informed them that I expected a clear ESN phone, not an altered device and that I had no problems taking what ever steps were necessary if they failed to make good on the transactions and cover any expenses I would experience due to choosing, foolishly, to deal with them.GVC also told me they would cover the shipping.They did not.Instead, I had to leave work, drive to the Post Office and go without lunch in order to have the money to pay to ship the phone back to GVC.According to Amazon, I have been refunded my money, (but not according to the bank) and issued one of their useless $10.00 credits for my out of pocket expenses.I can return the case I purchased to go with this phone ($40) for even more useless Amazon credit.Why is the credit useless? because you can only use it on Amazon, for Amazon products.Why do I no longer feel that I can purchase through Amazon?Because they do not stand behind what happens through their marketplace, they will not investigate the practices of the people who sell here, therefore you cannot trust that you will not go through unnecessary grief and aggravation.There is already too much stress going on, I do not need more, simply trying to purchase a smartphone that meets certain requirements, because a two bit employer can, because of the current employer friendly environment, make and get away with ridiculous demands on employees should not cause so much stress that my girlfriend feels that she should go back to her mothers, in another state, to stop being a burden to me.I used to love Amazon, the last month has soured me on Amazon forever, and left my girlfriend a wreck.Don't start feeling too relaxed on Amazon, Caveat Emptor still applies, maybe extra here on Amazon.  I've had less trouble with EBay vendors then Amazon, maybe because EBay admits you may not get what you are paying for, and every transaction has risk.Paul
