Initial thoughts-------------------Pros: * Interface is very cohesive and clean.  It's fast and fluid. It just makes sense (coming from a tech that hates Windows 8 on PC!).  I feel it has more polish than the later Android phones (S4 & HTC One) * Big * Feels solid. * Bright, visible in daylight (looks great) * Contrast (darker colors) and font are very easy to read.  Over-sized fonts used thematically actually works. * Wireless charging is great (costs extra for the charger) *  Memory management is good, it will auto-close background apps if it needs more memoryCons: * Heavy * Big * Light color as theme doesn't look good; text doesn't turn black * Glass is not perfectly flat across middle of phone (edges are nicely beveled), noted dimples in middle of glass (not sure it affects the image but I would imagine it has to) * Bezel is large, same size phone as Galaxy S4, but 1/2" less screen.Use/design--------------------Pros: * Ability to change size and location of tiles is nice * Sounds are pleasant * Larger keyboard is nice, making it easier to type * Voice recognition seemed pretty good at first, more testing neededCons: * Tiles being all one color (stock tiles) is disappointing * Keyboard space is very large, leaving not that much room on display when typing * Sometimes difficult to get keyboard to go away * Spell check isn't as smart as iPhone (not just common typos but nearby letters on keyboard) * Live Tile for email (Linked Inbox) does not update if the new mail was deleted on a synchronized account * For multiple email accounts there is no way to setup a default account to send email fromBattery life-------------------- * Minimal built-in info  > Good app available to show history and time remaining * Decent life on LTE mixed with 3G (18 hours) * On strong LTE signal (minimal use) all day battery life is closer to 8 hours :(Bluetooth-------------------- * Nice search features via voice * When a txt message comes in it offers to read it to you, or you can choose "ignore".  You can also reply via voice. * It gets annoying when it's constantly chattering at you though! * It does stop/cancel it's voice prompting if you actually click on the txt on the phone. (good)Phone-------------------- * Phone history doesn't show call duration & no good apps to add feature * 2 click process to answer phone, a little annoying * Randomly seems to drop between 1X (cell signal) and 3G and LTE within a few feet (in a weaker signal area)Camera/video-------------------- * Greens appear saturated (in daylight) * Low light camera white balance is off sometimes. It appears to use a low-level red light to improve picture which causes the color to be off. * Low light (indoor) video is very poor.  Illumination light does little good, typically causing distracting reflections.Apps-------------------- * No keyboard (replacement English) or spell check apps * Calendar: pretty poor implementation;  > no week view  > month view shows # of items but no words, even in landscape view * Nokia Maps app could not locate a gas station within 15 miles, but my GPS showed 2 within 2 miles. * Can't edit excel cells opening from SkyDriveRandom Thoughts-------------------- * Some traffic from phone actually interferes with nearby computer speakers (this has not occurred iPhone4, 4S, 5) causing crackling noises.
