Well what can I say, after owning a Samsung, a Siemens, two or three Sony-ericssons and two nokias previous to this one I finally came into the Symbian world.I must say given the OS and navigation I have always considered myself a SE fanboy, however I took some solid 6 months to review and read about all kinds of phones in order to retire my trusty C702.It came down to the new LG chocolate BL-40 or something (the one that looks like a widescreen on your palm) and the nokia N86.Given that I have always thought that phones should be operated using one hand if necessary, the N86 won over the sheer sexyness of the LG. (And besides I loathe touch screens!)I had my doubts as I've always own bar form phones, the less parts that move the better, I still went with the N86.After two weeks with it I have seen enough to communicate my opinion.Over all this is a solid phone feels heavy in a good way in your hands, the front is quite a fingerprint magnet but the scratch resistant glass is still flawless as day one.The dual slider mechanism has an adequate resistance in either way so it is not too hard nor to soft, it is not going to snap in your pocket nor you will break it trying to slide it.The slider mechanism feels tight so there is next to no twiching or shaking from the phone components when slided either way or closed.I have huge hands and the number keys are reachable reasonably spaced and sized, however it is another issue with the secondary keys (the ones that control the games and the media player) They are far too small and too close to the edge of the screen so it is quite a pain to use them and the D-pad is not as responsive or comfortable as I would have hoped for in video game action.The camera itself is just plain outstanding! Awesome pics, in part due to the good lens it has. The low light pictures are amongs the best if not THE best I have ever seen on a cell phone. The dual LED flash is also outstanding. The AMOLED screen is gorgeous and it has a decent readability in sunlight.I feel nokia over did it with the dual speakers as they really distort the music when played at more than 50% of the volume.Memory-wise you get 8GB in theory but given all the stuff the phone packs I think I remember seeing 6GB reported on the phone when I started it the first time around, but being able to handle a 16GB micro SD memory card should be able to fix this problem in case you feel 6GB are not enough.The phone itself is fast and responsive, I could ramble on about a lot of things but I'll instead try to just highlight my final opinions on it.PROS:Awesome cameraSturdy and well built, does not feel cheap at all.Great hardware overall with the sole flaw of the secondary slider keys design (too little space for big hands)AMOLED screen, WiFi, 16GB extendable memoryCONS:It might be me but I HATE the navigation in symbian, it makes no sense, where is the file manager, why is it so hard to install software made by smaller companies? (torch software, disable shutter sound)Missing functionality, no way to turn off the shutter sound and no torch light function, (although you can install it read previous complain) NOKIA COME ON !So far I would rate this phone 4.5 stars (Given I grow into the whole Symbian navigation) awesome phone highly recommendable.Cheers !
