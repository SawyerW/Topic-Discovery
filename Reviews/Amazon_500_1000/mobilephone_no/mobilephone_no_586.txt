The beginning of this review cover elements other than the phone itself... If you would rather not read that, just skip to the next dotted line. I hope this review helps.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know that there are alot of bogus reviews for both iPhone and Galaxy s3 saying that the one is better than the other, when really it's just a biased fanboy trying to sway you one way without any real reasons other than love/hatred for a certain brand. This will not be one of those reviews. I will compare them in some ways, but I will not be biased.To start off I'll just say that my whole family owns iPhones. This includes my mother and sister. I say that because for them, I recommended the iPhone. They are about the farthest things from 'hard-core' smartphone users--my mom especially. They're the type of people that ask where the settings app is and why the phone says 4G at the top. Honestly, Apple designed their smartphone for those people. People that before would've been completely intimidated by smartphones. If my mom owned the Galaxy S3. She would probably only use it for texting as other things would have just been too hard for her. Or I would just have to spend all day explaining to her how to do certain things. This is not to say that the Galaxy S3 is complex. I don't think it is, but I understand how others might. Which leads me to one important thing that really defines my comparison of the two in one sentence.------The Samsung Galaxy S3 can do way more than the iPhone! IF you know how to use it correctly.------- The iPhone is a much simpler phone and appeals to a different audience-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're scared to have a learning curve for your phone, than this is not the phone for you. If you aren't afraid of a learing curve and digging a little deeper to find some goodies in your phone, and just want to get the best phone out there that can power its way through anything you ask it to, THEN THIS DEFINITELY IS THE PHONE FOR YOU.Screen - 10 - The screen is the best in the business. Huge, high pixel density, bright, and rich with color! Nothing can beat this screen.......nothing!Form Factor - 10 - The smooth curves that go all the way around the device make it very comfortable to hold! It's also super thin, which me likey.Build Quality - It may be made of primarily plastic, but this plastic is strong as it's polycarbonate.User Interface - 9.5 - The UI moves very fast and is fully customizable. Android 4.0 is amazing.Battery - 8.5 - The batter is very good considering the load it has to bare, given the screen and super fast processor.Google Play Store - 10 - I have found an app for everything I need with the phone. Plus, some of the games that this phone can run have amazing graphics.Texting - 10 - Considering you can download any keyboard you want from the Play Store, you should find exactly what you want for texting your friends.Calling - 9 - Call quality is good. Simply put.One more thing - I was pleasantly surprised with many features that are baked into the OS. There are so many I can't even name them all but here are a few.1. When in the messaging if you put the phone to your ear it calls whatever contact your texting - very cool2. You can have 4 hand picked apps that you can jump straight to from the lock screen - very useful3. Face Unlock isn't exclusive to the Galaxy S3 but it still is a great feature.There's also many many more!Get this phone, you won't regret it!
