I vowed never to buy a Symbian phone again, made exception for this camera.Initial impressions:-not as thick and bulky as some reviews make out.-on the heavier side, but manageable-texture of the phone feels great-due to the texture and white, phone will be hard to keep clean. Will need a case-camera button could do with a little more travel. Best to get a case which doesn't cover this button-OS reminds me of earlier Android OS's. A little quirky, could be more user friendly. Liveable if u don't need access to hoards of apps.-Using the camera feels like using a point and shoot. Quick and easy and photo quality is very very good-Not sure if I will use Zoom much. Reduces pureview tech and more camera shake-Since its top heavy, I feel it might be easy to drop this phone when holding as camera in landscape-This phone is only for people who like to take photos and don't want to carry an extra device. And an external microphone if u care about sound quality eg. you're willing to  - carry a purse or manbag just for the camera. Or carry it on your belt like a dork  - remember to charge to camera regularly  - recording a concert, play, speech and willing the carry an external mic. The rich recording gives  amazing sound quality-On the expensive side...-happy so far.. looking forward to taking quality pics anytime/anywhereEDITED to reflect 2 months of ownership========================================- Dropping rating to 1 star from 4 stars. Here are the reasons, new buyers should take noteThere are 2 bugs which cripple this phone. One is show-stopper and the other is annoyance which can be worked around. Nokia pulled back the FP2 release, and for those who installed it, the bugs below were still present.When number 1) is fixed, I will increase the rating back to 5 stars. I think the issue lies solely on the Symbian development and not reflective on the new Windows Nokia phones.1) Phone reboots itself on weak 3.5G data connectionSee discussions.nokia . com thread "Bug in 808 3g mobile data?" in "Nseries and Symbian Smartphones"My phone reboots itself about 2-3 times a day, if it encounters a weak 3.5G data signal while accessing data, the phone will reboot itself.The only fix is to but it in 2G (Edge) mode. All other workarounds (disable HSPDA, select 3G only, sticky tape on SIM, SD card) do not work for me.Look at the thread, Nokia has finally acknowledged the issue but a confirmed fix should be waited upon.2) Cannot connect to my home router. Can workaround by buying a new router, but your choice of public wifi's can be limiting.See discussions.nokia . com thread "Nokia 808 Belle FP1 bug: WLAN works but not all apps can use it / no available access points" in "Connectivity section"Edit after upgrading to FP2 (1507) OTA======================================Change rating back to 5 stars after FP2 fixed the 3.5G rebooting issue.My phone would reboot 2-3 times daily, after FP2 has not rebooted since I installed (3 days ago). The phone is much more stable and deserves 5 stars for user's who appreciate photo qualityEdit 12-21-2012===============Nokia finally releases a fix for the wifi connection[...]its now works great for me! The phone in NYC has not rebooted on me since FP2. Its rock stable for me, however some ppl are still reporting issues
