This is coming from a person that has actually done a lot of research in phones, and is upgrading from a Nokia 3595.  Some people have been raving about the Razr V3, but in all honestly it isn't a very good phone.  The sound quality isn't very great, the phone although skinny, is very wide, and the camera is lack luster.  The keys are bland, and hard to use when not looking, and with the exception of Bluetooth and a 2nd LCD screen, it doesn't really do a whole lot.I consider this phone a great rival.  This phone and the Razr are in great competition for Cingular customers because both have great deals going on for 2-year agreement customers.  I actually got mine for roughtly 90 dollars because I upgraded as I previously mentioned.  I could have gotten a Razr, but this phone is much more practical.This phone has plenty of features:It has video captureCamera feature (which is pretty clear if you can hold the phone steadyA bright vivid LCD screen (2 actually)A sleek designGreat sized keysEasy navigationOverall very simplisticThis is Nokia's first successful flip phone, and they didn't do anything too outrageous.  It does have MP3 playback on ringtones, and full color graphics with available moving screen savers.  Sound quality is excellent, and the phone feels very durable.  Its a great size, and feels good in your hand.  Not only charges quickly, but has a very fair battery life.  I'm not sure about other 6102s, but mine came with NO dead pixels on either screen, so that's a great thing to not have to worry about.  Although this isn't important to a lot of people, it is to me... and this phone DOES not get face grease on it very easily... which is nice... because my friend has the one LG flip phone that you can use for 10 seconds and have the screen covered in face grease.With everything however, this phone does not have all the gadgets you may want.  It doesn't have Bluetooth, so you can't be lame like everyone else and get one of those earsets, at least not the "cool" ones.  The cases for it aren't exciting.  There is no expansion slot, this ISN'T a SmartPhone, so you can't do a lot of PDA functions.  The sound quality on the ringtones aren't too great, but there are a lot to choose from.  Its your call if you can justify spending $2.49 for one.  I personally have The Outsider by A Perfect Circle, and its pretty decent quality.  Unlike the Razr, this isn't meant for those who have hearing aids, but honestly, that feature isn't that great on the phone, the newer Razr phones coming out will better utilize that feature I believe, but they will be a great deal more money.This phone did recognize my Sim Card VERY quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not much configuration involved.  I didn't even have to set up the time or date.  The phone didn't set up my numbers into single name folders like my last phone, but it did default put a number next to it: i.e. Corey had 2 numbers... so now I have Corey and Corey1.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just something I noticed.  The interface is really nicely set up, but the only way to access the camera is to click the button on the right side.  The volume rocker is on the left side, and is very simple to use, and the ringtone can get LOAD, so you might want to make it a lower setting, unless you are hearing impaired.  Sim Card enclosure doesn't seem very durable, and I was nervous when I need to take it out breifly... it was also pretty difficult to open.BOTTOM LINE:  This is a very durable, easy, phone to use for anyone, and will definately last you until the next phone generation arised.  At a great price, with some great deals, this is an ideal phone to suit all your NEEDS, even though it doesn't supply all your WANTS.  This stylish phone is a great addition to the Nokia line, as well as the flip-phone craze.  In my opinion a more balanced phone than the Razr V3, but like everything, it depends on who you are, and what you use it for.SUSPECTED LEARNING CURVE: 30 minutes to 1 hour... very quick considering the number of features... I have yet needed to use the manual to find anything.ACTUAL SPECS:Modes GSM 850 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900GSM 900 instead of 850 on Europe/Asia versionWeight 3.42 oz  (97 g)Dimensions 3.35" x 1.77" x 0.94"  (85 x 45 x 24 mm)Form Factor ClamshellStub AntennaBattery Life Talk: 4.00 hours  (240 minutes)Standby: 350 hours  (14.6 days)Battery Type LiIon760 mAhDisplay Type: LCD (Color TFT/TFD)Colors: 65,536 (16-bit)Size: 128 x 160 pixelsPlatform / OS (N/A)Memory 3.5 MB  (built-in, flash shared memory)Phone Book Capacity shared memoryFCC ID PPIRM-76 (Approved May 10, 2005)PPIRM-77 (Approved Jun 15, 2005)FEATURES:2nd Display Location: Front4,096-color STN LCD / 96 x 65 pixelsAlarm YesCalculator YesCalendar YesCamera Resolution: VGA (640 x 480)night modeCustom Graphics YesCustom Ringtones supports MP3, MIDI, AMR, and True Tones (WB-AMR) formatsData-Capable YesEmail Client Protocols Supported: SMTP, POP3, IMAP4carrier-dependentFM Radio Stereo: YesGames YesHigh-Speed Data Technology: EGPRS (EDGE)class 6 / plus class 10 GPRSInfrared (IR) YesJava (J2ME) Version: MIDP 2.0, CLDC 1.1supported JSRs: 120, 135, 75, 185 / max JAR size: 128 KBMMS supports SMILMultiple Languages YesMultiple Numbers per Name YesPC Sync YesPicture ID YesPolyphonic Ringtones Chords: 24Predictive Text Entry Technology: T9Push-To-Talk carrier-dependentRinger Profiles YesSide Keys up/down keys on left / camera (or PTT) key on rightSpeaker Phone YesSyncML YesText Messaging 2-Way: Yesplus IM with presenceText Messaging Templates YesTo-Do List YesUSB YesVibrate YesVideo Capture SubQCIF resolution (128 x 96 pixels) / H.263 + AMR in 3GPP formatVoice Dialing YesVoice Memo YesWireless Internet WAP 2.0, XHTML / supports file uploading[...]
