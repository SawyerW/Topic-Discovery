UPDATE:I am very pleased with the performance and functionality of the Optimus. If you're an Android fan and don't need the whistles and bells of an I-Phone, this is a good choice for an unlocked smartphone. For my needs, I wanted a phone that could connect with my wi-fi at home and work without paying for a data plan.I'm impressed with its look and performance. I have had good luck with the LG brand and the Optimus is a step-up from my previous phone.The only criticism I have is how slow it is to load videos, such as YouTube.PROS:- It's a good size (large enough screen) and weight (not too heavy)- Beautiful resolution- Very easy to operate, intuitive design- Wi-fi is a huge plus because I did not want to pay for a data plan. I can access the internet at home and work, using wi-fi.- Good LG website with step-by-step instructions: [...]- Although item description does not specifically say it is an unlocked phone, happily, it is. I put in a Go Phone SIM card first, disabled the phone's mobile data access in settings, then replaced it with my previous phone's SIM card.- Will accept up to 32gb Micro SD card, which is what I am using- Comes loaded with a good variety of Google and other common apps: FM Radio, GMail, ThinkFree Office, Voice Search, Facebook, music player, calculator, calendar- Because it's Android, it's easy to add apps from the online Market- Nice responsive touch screen, once you get the feel for its sensitivity- Great sound, plenty of volume- Battery life seems good; mine needed complete charging upon arrival (about 2-3 hours)- Texting (Messaging) is easy- Camera is decent; it's not the quality of an IPhone, but it's not the price of one either- Comes with a simple manual that pretty much covers everything you initially need to know.- The price is right. I shopped around and this phone has nice features for the cost. I'm pleased and feel that I got a good value.CONS:- The micro SD card is not easily accessed; you have to remove the back plate to get to it, which is even a bigger pain if you have a snap-on case- Phone is extremely slow to load high-quality video; it's fine for your average YouTube fare, just not the HQ ones. Maybe if you have consistent 3G or 4G service, this wouldn't be a problem.- Phone charger came with a plug for European outlets, no adapter (fortunately the chargers from my previous LG phone worked fine)- Included micro SD card has limited storage (only 2GB) and most of that is already loaded with phone and PC applications. I copied the files to my computer's hard drive and then transferred them to a 32gb microdisc, which works fine in the phone- The LG PC Suite (software to connect your phone and computer) was not easily found on the LG website- The earphones that come with the phone aren't much to brag about and are hard to keep in your ears because the buds are so big
