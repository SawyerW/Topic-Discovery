PROS:After the touch screen stops working, I can still dial and receive phone calls.CONS:After the touch screen stops working, I can't do ANYTHING except dial and receive phone calls.  I can't read text messages, so my phone keeps buzzing every two minutes to let me know I have new messages-- unless I turn the volume all the way down, in which case I miss in-coming calls because the ringer is also turned down.I can't even get my data off the phone because when I connect it to a computer and I'm prompted to choose a type of connection, I can't make a selection because the damn touch screen won't respond.What kind of head-up-his-rectal-orifice imbecile designs a device that is rendered all but fully crippled despite the 47 non-touch-screen buttons found on the rest of the bloody machine??  Not even the "RETURN/ENTER" button does anything useful!Other things that are wrong with this worthless piece of rubbish before the touch screen stops working:* Despite the EIGHT GIGABYTE memory card inserted into the phone, it cannot be used to store simple data like text messages, so it's all to easy to use up your text message capacity.* Long text messages may use up multiple text message slots.  No big deal if you're keeping an eye on your total message count, right?  Wrong!  The text message memory management tools still counts multi-slot messages as single messages, so you could have over 200 "available text message slots" and still get hit with, "You have a new text message but not enough memory to receive it; delete some old messages."* I set my phone to "automatically delete oldest messages when full," yet I still got slammed with "You have a new text message but not enough memory to receive it; delete some old messages" WITHOUT any old messages being automatically deleted.* I finally caved in and selected "automatically delete messages that are three weeks old."  Every night at midnight, the display lights up as brightly as it can, and makes the loud, default, unchangeable "DING!" noise for each message deleted.* When typing messages with the keyboard, every keypress registers anywhere from 0 to 3 times.  Best result are had if you mash the buttons angrily with enough force to press your thumbs through steel walls.* The random keystroke multiplier also occurs when trying to dial phone numbers or use automated services which respond to EXACT number-input, which means I've had to hang up and call again a few times to navigate some services' phone systems.* The text typing program tries to help you compose grammatically correct messages by scanning the ENTIRE message and making sure that, if you just entered a SPACE character after one or more other SPACE characters, and the last character preceding the first SPACE character was NOT a PERIOD, it automatically inserts a PERIOD character for you, even if it means placing it immediately after an EXCLAMATION MARK, QUESTION MARK, COLON, or any other grammatical character.* Because the ENTIRE message is scanned for PERIOD insertion with EVERY keypress, when composing moderately lengthy messages, the message scanning slows down the keypress buffer and keystrokes are lost, so you have to slow down to the point where it's advisable to wait the entire 1 to 2 seconds it takes for the last character you entered to appear before trying to type another.* The phone has a feature that lets you view plain text files by arbitrarily choosing a fixed character length at which to wrap the text then generating a graphical representation of the text as it would appear on a sheet of paper.  The characters-per-line length is such that you have to zoom in to be able to decipher any of the text, then pan back and forth to read the text line-by-line.  Whether you are viewing in portrait or landscape mode, the scale is the same and unchanged.  Viewing in landscape is better because you can see more horizontally, but you still have to pan a few times to get all the way across a line.  EACH time you pan or zoom, the graphic representation is fully regenerated, and it is NOT fast.* When scrolling through file lists in landscape mode via the UP/DOWN arrow keys, the file list scrolls the same distance it would if you were using the UP/DOWN arrow keys to scroll in portrait mode, which is IMPOSSIBLE to do because the arrow keys are hidden when you've tucked the keyboard back inside the phone for portrait mode.This phone was obviously designed by complete and utter idiots.
