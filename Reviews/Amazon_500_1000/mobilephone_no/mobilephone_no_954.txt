I have never dealt with any other seller that was so helpful than "Lolbuy". This seller answered every single question I had and even after I got the phone helped me trouble shoot some questions. Every single description is exactly what you get. No ifs, and or Buts. I cannot express how happy I was when I received this phone. Despite the shipping being delayed because it was entire my fault ( I was having second thoughts on the Color of the phone), Lolbuy Agreed to wait for my reply so that he would be able to send EXACTLY what I wanted. I Decided about 3 days after the order I didn't want the black color but instead white. And despite the 3 days after I placed my order, I found out Lolbuy was actually making sure if I wanted white and waited for my reply. Never the less, I got the exact color I wanted...White!!! I was soo Happy when I saw the Phone. I will even say I am new to the whole Shipping from out of the country thing, and this happened to be my first time. If your like me, I like to buy things based on reviews, and it was clear that Lolbuy had a very good reputation, so I didn't hesitate to order from this seller at all. In addition to the color change, Lolbuy had even Included a FREE Stylus and 2 extra phone Cases.......OMGEEEEE I was So happy. You Will Not Be Disappointed At all!!! I'm so sure of it!CONS:For some reason it would not work with my T-mobile. I Contacted T-mobile and they did have coverage in my area, but then again I beg to differ. When I had gone to Network Settings > Available Networks >Select Manually > It only displayed T-Mobile 2G. So I tired it a couple of time then I saw T-Mobile 3G then it would disappear when I searched again. I assume this is all based on my area simply because the whole time I searched for networks, At&t; 2G and 3G ALWAYS appeared. Good News I Found out the reason, This is All because of a frequency band issue. Apparently T-Mobile Runs on 850/1700/2100 MHZ. This phone Supports"Band 2G: GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz  3G: WCDMA 850/2100MHz" So if you do use T-Mobile Your max speed will only be 2G(Edge). Here's The Link:[...]What I did instead, was get Net10( Unlimited everything is $50 unless you sign up for auto pay; which I did, its $45/month no contract), because I was told by Walmart in order to use straight talk I had to purchase a new phone. They both Run on the At&t; Tower and Uses 850/2100. I will also add, Even though I'm stating T-Mobile didn't work, it does but it would disconnect after about 10 seconds than reconnect in 30 seconds, and the process would repeat. Theoretically this might be because T-Mobile is using 1900MHz Frequency which provides A larger range, but has "Wholes" or dead spots, kinda like blind spots on a car. Where as At&t; uses the 850MHz band which has less range but the signal is strong enough to penetrate through walls and etc, which explains  why I was able to see At&t; 2G and 3G everytime I refreshed the Network. If your wondering what My internet speed was with Net10, I get 6.9 Mb/Sec Download, and 1.3 Mb/Sec Upload.

When I had a question Lolbuy replied within at least 1 1/2 - 2hr-Claimed to be running Android 4.1.1 instead runs on Android 4.2.1Important:If you Plan On using T-Mobile Get a phone Based on the Frequency Band. Band 2G: GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz 3G: WCDMA 850/*1900*/2100MHz So that it will be Able to Utilize 3G Speeds. This includes the other services like Simple Mobile, and Family Mobile (By walmart).*All in All, I was Very Satisfied with my Order, I decided to order another one for my friends and family members.
