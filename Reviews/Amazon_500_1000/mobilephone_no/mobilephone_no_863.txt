I purchased this phone because my N95 8 Gb (4 years of intense use) is now falling apart.Primary reasons on buying the N97 mini:1) I use navigation all over the world, Nokia is the only phone (nokia maps) that will give you that service, now on the newer models even for free, but downgraded and it's gone to OVI maps, (My N95 did that, but had to pay, but it worked 100%)2) emailing, so wifi needs to work flawless. (my n95 did that)3) searching the net for business research while traveling in asia, so internet needs to work flawless with 3G networks. (N95 did that)4) bluetooth needs to connect the phone to my rental car's sound system or my own private car, so I can drive hands free and safe. (My N95 did that all day long.)The first week, the phone worked fine:- except for OS freez ups now and then, I was forewarned for this problem on this amazon customer reviews, but could reset the phone easy after a freez up.Problems that nobody wrote about:- when bluetooth is active, battery drains empty within 1 hour, and battery gets overheated.- when wifi is active battery also drains empty within 1 hour,and battery gets overheated.So if you use those features, make sure you have a charger at hand.The second week, bluetooth stopped working altogether, I tried a firmware upgrade, but no results, then I decided to uninstall all software apps that were not originally on the phone when I received it, but also that didn't solve the problem. After reading up on N97 on the net, I discover many people are suffering from the same problem.Other issues I found very frustrating on this phone:-The connectivity on the N97 mini is very frustrating, and the way it manages your access points doesn't make sense either, N95 was better, why the h@#%!ll change a winner?-Bluetooth when it still worked, would react very slow, it could take minutes before it would show up on other pairing devices.-The phone refuses to show up on my computer's OVI office suite, whether I use USB or Bluetooth, it just doesn't work, so forget synchronizing all together.-This phone will not allow you to use email accounts that use pop3 and smtp, strictly and only html mail. (I could send and receive on any email account on my N95 anywhere in the world.I decided to send it back and have a refund.This in now the second phone I have to send back within weeks after purchase, first I bought the N900, that developed grey lines on the screen, and was a big disappointment on overall performance, similar to the N97 mini.Will try 1 more time purchasing the N8-00 later this month when it becomes available, if that is a disappointment again, I will never ever buy a Nokia again in my life, so far i had only Nokia's for the last 18 years, and I've been a very satisfied Nokia user and fan.I wish they still sold a Nokia phone, that out smarts the N95 8Gb with the same or higher quality standards.
