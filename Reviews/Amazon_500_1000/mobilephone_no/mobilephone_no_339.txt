If you are on the fence about purchasing the Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White, rest assured that you will be getting what I dear say is the most advanced phone/tablet on the market to date. What are the features of this phone? What can it do? It may actually be easier to tell you what it can't do.I've had lots of different makes and models of cell phones over the years, including Blackberry and Iphone but I dear say that this is by far the best phone that I've ever owned, it has way more features than I may ever actually use. The Samsung Galaxy Note II makes the great Iphone seem very BORING in comparison.This being the international version, I initially had a little trouble with getting Apps from the Samsung Apps Store, every time I tried I got an Error Message that was basically stating that the Samsung Apps was registered in one Country and my Samsung account was from another country so I was unable to get any Apps for the Samsung Apps Store. (If you are having the same problem, just let me know and I'll help you fix the issue).The level of customization on this phone is simply amazing, I know that you will happy with this purchase, unless you have an issue with the size, let's face facts this is a big phone but it is by far the best out there, a total beast when it comes to processing power.P.S.  I must make mention of this just to let you know happened when I made my purchase so you can take precaution when making yours.I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Note II form a seller known as "Techno.Trading.House" but was fulfilled by Amazon. When I received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.When I took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly TAMPERED with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.When I checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.My advice to you is to purchase from Amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by Amazon in order for you to be covered by Amazon.When Amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so I can re-order, which I thought was great on their part, Amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.I told Amazon that I don't think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which I received the phone, this I accepted as I consider this fair for all.PLEASE be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at "Techno.Trading.House" seller's profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by Amazon for your peace of mind.
