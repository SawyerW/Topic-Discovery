As a long-time owner of Sony Ericsson and Nokia phones; I was a bit hesitant to buy any phone outside of those two familiar brands, but after my last phone got lost, I needed a replacement and needed a good phone fast.You know know Motorola's popular Razr line dominated 2006 and is still a strong contender for 2007, so with that popularity, it seems the company is not going to venture too far from a line that really sky-rocketed them to the No. 1 spot. From the Razr came the new Krzr and Rizr line and so we will pick on the Rizr at this time.I have had the phone for 3 days know, and I am really impressed with this little thing. The hardest thing for me was just geting use to the Motorola interface (this is my very first Motorola); but besides that, it had all the features I craved...P..R..O..S......1) WORLD PHONE Baby - I love Ericsson phones, but they are usually tri-band phones...I needed a quad band phone with all the travelings and phone calls I make, and I knew Motorola is very consistent with this modality.2)CAMERA & VIDEO based- telephone - I love to take pics and I love recording capabilities on my cell phones, so when I found that this nifty devide has a 2MP camera and an un-timed video recorder (both of which can be accessed with a dedicated button), I was very thrilled..It has full-fledged camera and video options, so you'd never need to carry a separate camera or video camera when you have this phone3)MP3 Player - I already have a dedicated music player, but it is nice to have the option to load as much as 40-50 songs on this phone ( with its included 128MB micro-SD card).4) Great battery management - You'd think with a gadget that boasts to be a phone, MP3 player, video and camera will die in  few hours right...wrong..I have only charged it once (I love having my phone fully charged before I leave the house) and it is really good with its battery management ( definately squashed my last cell phone which boasted all the same features - Sony Ericsson K700i)5) EXPANDIBLE - The phone only has around 24MB of memory, but with the included 128MB card, and the ability to upgrade the phone yourself and get a 2GB card, there is virtually no way to ever really run out of space6) STEREO Bluetooth HEADSET anyone? - Ok...so I havent purchased it yet, but because this is a Music player phone and because it does have Bluetooth, you can buy a Bluetooth stereo headset so that you can jam to your music and be totally wireless...NiCE!!7) Perfect for NON-FLIP Lovers - I have a thing for bar/candy bar phones...I never cared for flip phones, so this is a real treat for both the lovers of flip phones and those of us who still like the European-type non-flip phones...ALSO, voice recordings & voice note-talking capabilites, JAVA-enabled, standard productivity suite (Calendar, Alarm, World clock), Instant Messaging ( if you are on the T-Mobile network), Ability to use your MP3s as your own ringtones...C..O..N..S......1) What? No Infraread - Although I will miss having the IrDA technology, everything seems to be moving to a Bluetooth connectivity world, so I am not too sad about it.2) No FM Tuner - I didnt really need this feature on a phone, but I did have it on my last cell phone and it was great to have. This phone's other features do make the lack of a FM tuner bareable though, so its all good.that's it...I am really enjoying this phone. I am glad I got it. Thanks T-mobile.
