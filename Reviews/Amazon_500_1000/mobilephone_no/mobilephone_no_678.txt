So lets start of by saying this is my first Symbian Phone and first Amazon Review.  I have used Windows Mobile, Andriod, Windows 7 and now new to Symbian.  I was excited about the 41 megapixel camera with Pureview Technology.  I was not sure with all the negative reviews from Engadget, Mobileburn, Laptop.com and TheVerge that this phone would be utter crap besides the Camera.  They are wrong and I think the bias has shown that Symbian and Belle FP1 is actually usuable and that Nokia has crafted an amazing piece of hardware.The reviewer's from the major website made this phone to be huge and unusuable.  The phone feels right and the bump helps you balance the phone.  The polycarbonate shell is premium unlike the other manufacturers who cheapen the hardwareThe first thing is of course the Camera..top in its field in both Video and Photos but the sound you record at CD quality with Rich Recording is in itself a revolution.  The sound that you record will be amazing as you play it back.  Try it at concerts.The screen with its nHD is not appealing with some but Clear Black Technology and Amolead makes the pictures you take and the videos you play look amazing.  1080p and a ton of codecs such as MKV, AVI, MP4 and more play flawlessly on the 808 then most of the smartphones who chug and lag with all those multi core setups.  Also the 808 has the best visibility of any phone in the sun period.Storage is 16gb internally and you can add a 64gb card!!!The Nokia difference is in its software.  I had a Lumia 900 and I loved Windows phone but I like what Nokia did in the software that made my Lumia so special.  Since I have upgraded to the 808 I am using  Nokia Transport, Drive, World Gaze, City Lens, Guides, Map, Nokia Bubbles, Sleeping Screen.  Some that are even better on the Symbian platform.The app store is not incredible and not close to Android, iOS but there are many things that will work.Gravity: Best Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and social media app you will ever use on any platformSituations: Great Management Profiler that will adjust to how you use your phone and is very customizableMicrosoft Office : Excel, Powerpoint, Word, One NoteSkyfiles: SkydriveFmobi: FacebookWhatsapp:  Messaging with dataLinkein:Cutetube: for Downloading Youtube videosWhat you will be missing will be things such as Amazon, Ebay but wierdly there is a paypal app.  I know that if you like a lot of apps and you download a lot and need the latest then this is not the phone for you.  What this phone is for me is:Best Camera for taking pictures in day and night.  I started to find things outside to appreciate moreSound that is rich and Video playback with Dobly Digital is incredible.A removable battery, Battery life is great for heavy use in a day and average use will last two days.NFC for sharing pictures, videos with a tapExpandable memory up to 80 gigs! in total.  Enough for movies, videos and all sort of stuff we like to bring with usThe loudest speaker you have ever heard in a phoneFM Transmitter to wirelessly transmit to any unused radio frequency great for PODCAST and music.  Rare in SmartphonesDLNA for those playback TVs that have that capablitlityMicro HDMI to play all my videos, pictures and music on my HDTV....also playing Angry Birds on a 73 Tv rocksAlso I use the pureview 360p zoom as a binoaculars.It is my favorite device that I have ever had the pleasure of using.
