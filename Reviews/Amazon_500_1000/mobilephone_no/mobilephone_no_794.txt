Won't charge with a standard cigarette lighter adapter (12v to mini usb) It sees that it is plugged in but will not charge - I suspect it requires a Motorola specific charger, FAILCannot use Motorola Phone Tools ($50 - Seriously? $50!?) to back up data to/from SIM card - don't have lots of friends.When mounted as a USB drive on the computer - cannot make or receive calls other than 911 unless you unplug it from the computer.Speaker is REALLY REALLY tinnyPlastic feels like a cheap Revel snap together model from 1967IMPORTANT!!! ---> Because Motorola in their infinite "we're totally failing" wisdom implemented a proprietary USB format - this phone CANNOT be CHARGED!  from a Mac or Linux or (currently) Windows7 computer. It requires specific drivers from Motorola to charge - TOTALLY STUPID - total dealbreaker for me (can force install .sys driver in Win7 if you know what you are doing)Cannot mount the phone as a flash drive to load music - CANNOT BE DONE - again requires specific drivers from Moto which will not recognize Windows7 and therefore will not install, and are not available for Mac or Linux (can force install .sys driver in Win7 if you know what you are doing)if Motorola had just followed standard USB implementation (USB Storage Class built in OS Driver) - this would not be an issue. STUPID STUPID STUPIDUpdate: Finally got it working on Win7 BUT found out the phone is only USB 1.0 speed 356k per second transfer speed, so a 2GB SDMicro card takes 1 1/2 hours to fill!!No call answer button on headset - you can set phone to auto answer but that is very inconvenient.On the plus side - the headphones aren't bad - about par with the ones that Apple includes with iPods  Does allow you to set MP3 files as alarmclock and ringtoneMusic player quits when you go back to the home screen - so no playing games or texting or choosing next song while you listen to musicBest bet would be to use a USB2.0 card reader and not change your music often but the SD Micro card is under the battery so you have to shut down - open the case - take out the battery - slip out the card - and reverse. Kind of a total pain.No playlists - you can navigate to a sub folder and play all music in it - so you could do a crude workaround.If your kids are pestering you for an iPhone - and you don't have that budget - this is still not the phone for you, they will most likely be very unhappy. If you are a casual phone user and want something that will allow you to listen to some music on a morning commute or gardening this might workThis "eco friendly green phone" came in a large plastic blister pack with lots and lots of T-Mobile manuals and prepay upsell propaganda  inside (they appear to be printed with soy ink on recycled paper - but the packaging isn't nearly as eco friendly as it could be. )This is just a HORRIBLE phone!!!Thank you for taking it back without a restocking fee Amazon, you are the BEST
