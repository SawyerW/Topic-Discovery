I bought the BB q10 from T-mobile. Let me begin by writing down some cons, because there are very few:1. If you use a lot of apps (current iPhone or Android user), this phone will disappoint you. Many apps are not available, or are made by 3rd party companies. But in my opinion, apps are generally overrated and over appreciated. The safest app is always your "browser". It guarantees SSL and other security. I should never trust a banking app, for instance. Always, access sensitive accounts through your phone's internet browser.2. Smaller screen than iPhone or the BlackBerry z10. If you are used to watching videos on larger screens, then this phone is not for you. Although, I feel the screen is only about an inch smaller than the iPhone. But the Q10 has greater pixel density (336 dpi vs 330 dpi) than the IPhone 4.That's it! I cannot think of any other drawbacks.The pros:1. The call/voice quality is SUPERB! It is amazing how clear the voice of the person I am speaking with sounds. Just compare it with any phone (iPhone, HTC, etc.).2. There touch screen gestures are very useful: swipe up and left to access your communication HUB is great. Also, the ability to multitask and shutdown unwanted apps are way better than iPhone or android.3. The keyboard is the BEST yet. I can type so fast that it astonishes me. I can type a whole paragraph and not make any typos. The autocorrect/learn is exceptional.4. Finally, ActiveSync is here. So your Microsoft exchange/OWA and IMAP e-mail are fully accessible. You can access contacts, folders and subfolders.5. BlackBerry messenger is absolutely amazing. You can call other BBM users via Wifi and send them text, voice, and other attachments. NO SIZE LIMITS!6. The phone is very responsive. I have used the Q10 for a month now. I never had to wait for the phone to wakeup or reboot. It has never "crashed". My wife's HTC android phone does that occasionally.7. Front and back camera is finally here on the BB. You can Skype!8. Expandable memory up to 32 GB.9. More system memory than the iPhone 4 (2048 MB vs 512 MB).10. Finally a note about apps. I mentioned the lack of apps in the cons. But I have all the apps I need: Twitter, YouTube, Maps, GoogleMaps (very good 3rd party build), facebook (that I care less about), Navita Language translator, Pandora (3rd party build), DropBox (3rd party), Box (alternative to DropBox), Skype, Weather, DocsToGo (word, excel, power point), Calculator (incl. scientific), Clock (Alarm/World Time/Stop Watch/Timer), QR/Bar code scanner, scanner/convert photos to PDF app, GasBuddy, Slacker Radio, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and more.If you are a current BB user, please buy the Q10 . It won't disappoint you. If you are first-time smart-phone buyer (or looking to switch from iPhone or Android), please give this phone a try. Most carriers allow at least 14 days returns. I believe you will love it.I shall update my review in a few months time.===Update===The BlackBerry 10 devices can run Android apps. Surprisingly, the process is quite easy. Please visit CrackBerryDOTcom or another BlackBerry user forum for instructions and download the application that lets you do this. I have "sideloaded" over a dozen Android apps on my Q10. They work just fine. Some of them are: Pandora, Dropbox, GoogleMaps, Kindle reader, and the Amazon mp3 cloud player.
