on our family 10-line plan, we have 3 of these phones, 4 LG G2s and 3 basic flip phones.As to the Note 3 with SPRINT:Father in law bought first one from Sprint store for $350+ tax to upgrade his old phone he was credited for/due. When using the phone as issued, he was having EXTENSIVE problems with call quality. Dropped calls, garbley voices, missed words, etc. I remember when considering this device for myself, trying to have conversation with him with my trusty, old LG Optimus S...over 4 minutes of talking with him, I needed to recall him more than 8 times, due to his Note 3 phone's ability to hold a call--repeated drop calls within seconds!!! Although I thought this fan-dangled new Note 3 phone was a worthless hunk of crap at first...I REALLY wanted to like it still, so read dozens and dozens of reviews from all carriers.I live in an area that is currently undergoing a 4G LTE expansion, so figured, in the end that the issue/conflict 'tween Samsung and Sprint was related to this new tech in our area....and ended up taking the plunge on a Note 3 for both my wife and self.IF YOU'RE WANTING TO KNOW THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE, I INCLUDE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO LET ANYONE KNOW HOW I GOT MY TWO NOTE 3s FOR LESS THAN $30 EACH (skip it if you don't care)!I REALLY wanted to order ALL my phones thru Amazon for countless reasons, but a glitch with Sprint didn't allow me to do so...the system kept disallowing Amazon from adding any lines of service to my account, although I was cleared/approved by Sprint for 11 lines. *sigh* So, bittersweet...Regretfully, yet thankfully, I went to local BB (The blue store with yellow accents) & bought 'em all there (over 4 horrible return-trip-to-stores, attempts to activate with continued issues with Sprint's system glitch....NOT the fault of BB--they were also fantastic.) each for $220 +tax. [I returned today and had 'em adjust pricing for the crazy-low price Amazon blew these out for @ $125 +tax, each!!! which ended up being $25 each, since I got in on BB's promo and traded in two literally-worthless (6+yr-old) smartphones for each Note 3 to get $100 credit applied during first purchase, lol!]Well, onto the phone's functionality:SAME ISSUES with lack of calling-functionality, out of the box: Crappy phone/voice quality. So I switched the settings from 4G LTE to CDMA and problem solved!!!Since then, we've enjoyed sooooooo many functions, and the display, and adequate phone-call quality without hiccups/issues for about a month now! My wife got white, mine's black and both have their pro/con and we are both completely satisfied and thankful for this phone we feel is by far the best out there currently.The LG G2s are fantastic too, and I can see how someone wanting a bit smaller phone thinking they are ideal, but we like the size of the Note 3 better overall, and it's abilities as a tiny computer/tablet FAR surpass the G2 in our opinion, and would have been worth the $240 extra if stuck with that. CERTAINLY worth $25+tax "splurge" over ANY phone I've compared it to, lol!Hope those main 2 tips help anyone in consideration of this phone.  (BB tends to have that promo going a majority of the time, where you can trade any 2 working smartphones toward the purchase of a certain model they carry [during my purchasing time it was the Note 3 one week, the G2 other weeks], totaling $100 off your new phone, and will match prices here too!)Although I saved so much more money in the end with BB, I'm still letdown that Sprint's glitch prohibited me from an Amazon purchase--they certainly earned my business, and EVERY time I've had issue or needed to get help from their wireless dept.......they were HANDS DOWN the best customer service I've dealt with in a long long time.I saw one other reviewer concerned that when trying to activate their phone, they couldn't because they were told by their carrier that the phone was attached to someone else's account. Happened to me in the past too>> simply call Amazon's hotline for wireless support, and they take care of the glitch in minutes while you're on the phone...sometimes when Amazon ships/processes, the ECN/phone #, is left in limbo...they make a quick call and clear it up instantly to allow for your mailed-phone to be activated onto your account.*SMILES*
