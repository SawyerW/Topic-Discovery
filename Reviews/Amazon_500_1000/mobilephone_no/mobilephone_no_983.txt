EDIT TO MY REVIEW: (Thank you for the comment. I searched around again and apparently the HTC one is always on power save mode (this is built into their version and cannot be disabled. My battery complaint is now moot.)Over the summer I was salivating over a new smartphone. It was between the S4 and the ONE for me.-----------------------------------Why I chose the One instead of the S4:------------------------------------It has less "bloatware". Samsung packed a lot in their Touchwiz that I just didn't see myself making practical use of. I prefer a simple, clean approach like the ONE has.-Aesthetics. The sexy unibody aluminum design beats Samsung plastic any day.-The display is more true-to-life/naturally colored than the often brighter S4 screen (due to different technology).-----------------------------------Things I may miss because I chose the ONE instead of the S4:------------------------------------The ability to expand memory (ONE comes with 32gb, and since I'm a casual user I didn't think too much about it.)-The 14 MP camera. HTC has coined the "ultrapixel" as a marketing term, but you can't compare the two cameras that way. The pixel sizes and sensors are all different. I think the S4 comes with greater detail, but the ONE is better in low light situations. There are many comparisons online at any rate. Honestly, the camera was the only hang up I had of picking this phone. But so far, it's doing well.-I believe the NFC is better on the S4, because the plastic doesn't interfere as much with the signal (or so, a Verizon rep told me.) If you want to share mobile-to-mobile, or use a camera like the Canon RX100 II, this is the way to go. But that's a feature I don't think I'll need much.-A gorrila glass screen. I'm accident prone, so I'll have to be careful with my ONE. (oops--HTC one has it as well!)My parents got the S4, so we'll see how they both hold up.-----------------------------------IMPRESSIONS-----------------------------------I adore the ONE. It's been on the market for half a year but it still holds its own among the top smartphones available. Verizon is the last of the major phone providers to offer this model. It runs Android 4.2.2 right out of the box, which is pretty sweet.So far, my impression of the phone is everything I expected. The capabilities are astounding. I'm perhaps overawed because I switched from an archaic, no-one-has-this-anymore prepaid "dumb" phone that I have reluctantly used for the past four years... but pretty much everyone can tell you that this is one amazing phone.The only problem I have with this so far is battery life. I turn off my Wi-Fi and mobile data when it's not in use, but that doesn't help much. Most of the battery keeps the android system running (73% in my phone--there is a breakdown of how the power is apportioned if you find "usage" under the "power" tab.)I called HTC, and a representative verified that this version of the ONE does NOT include the power save mode.EDIT: ---I searched up HTC again. It turns out that Verizon went ahead and made the phone perpetually on power save mode. Which I find really ironic since neither the HTC rep or the Verizon rep I talked to earlier had anything to mention about it.One downside to the Verizon version is that you can't root the phone--the HTC developer's tools were disabled within 24 hours of its release.... Which is pretty disappointing, since it would be really neat to play with.One month later: Yep, it's still awesome. That's all I have to say.
