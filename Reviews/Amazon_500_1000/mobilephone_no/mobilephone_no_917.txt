I've had two Android smartphones in the past... 1) The original Motorola Droid & 2) The Droid Bionic.  Here's the stuff about Droid that drove me to Windows Phone 8...**Battery life - crazy bad to the point where I had to install the extended battery and cover (also true of my friend's Samsung phones).**Connection issues - 4G showing up in the display and the phone telling me during a navigation session "Data Connection Lost".  Really? I'm navigating somewhere... now what?**Random reboots - Oh yeah, never during a call but I'd be in the middle of web browsing session only to have the phone reboot itself.**Browser crashes - happened all the time.**4G to WiFi to 4G transition - a nightmare.  I'd have to turn off WiFi, wait a couple of seconds, and then turn it back on.**Bloatware and the inability to delete Verizon apps.  There were a LOT of unused apps, taking up space, that I would have loved to delete if I could.**Cost - $299 w/2-year contract renewal.Comparison to the Nokia 928**Battery life - you can't change the battery but you really don't have to.  It lasts all day with power to spare**Connection issues - there are none.**Random reboots - never happens.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had to manually reboot this phone for any reason whatsoever.**Browser crashes - none**4G to WiFi to 4G transitions - smooth as anything - there's no interruption in the data flow.**Bloatware - I actually LIKE the apps that came with this phone especially Nokia Drive, HERE Maps, HERE City Lens, and all the Nokia photo apps.  The one "already installed" app I wouldn't use, ESPN, was easily erased.**Cost - $99 w/2-year contract renewal.Notable features of the 928 & Windows Phone 8...Beautiful displayEasy OS - One screen for shortcuts (tiles) and one screen that lists ALL the programs.Great camera - pretty good low light photos, beautiful daytime photos, and a bunch of creative photo apps from Nokia that are fun and impressiveCall quality - very good; no complaintsProcessor speed - very smooth; no lagLive tiles - not the "nightmare" that I've heard of... some are kind of cool, some are functional.  All in all a nice feature to have.Navigation - works without an active data connection (map file is pre-installed).Apps - This seems to be a huge issue for some people.  Are there less apps available for WP8?, yes.  Do I care?, not really.  Why?, there really hasn't been an app that I wanted I couldn't find, or find an acceptable substitute.  I have Facebook, Skype, Open Table, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc.  More apps are being made available daily.  I found a decent tip calculator, a Drop-Box & You-Mail interface that's fully functional, and a bunch of games.  I know there's a zillion apps for Android and Apple IOS, but most of them are crappy or repetitive (how many flashlight apps do you need anyway?).  Oh by the way, all the apps I downloaded and installed were freebies.Thing I don't like about the phone...**Volume control... there's seems to be one control that affects everything (ringer, notifications, alarm, media, etc.)  A minor annoyance, but I would like to have more controls.**No FoxFi (I didn't use free WiFi tethering THAT often, but now I'll have to deal with its absence).Conclusion...I don't miss the Android OS at all.  There were too many issues with it for me to continue using it.  I was waiting for this phone to come out on Verizon and I'm glad I did.  It's not perfect, but it works really well.  Even though there are less apps than Android, they seem to be better written (more polished, more functionality, etc.) and there hasn't been anything I needed or wanted that I couldn't find.  I can't believe I got this newly released phone for $99.If you're in the market for a new phone, don't listen to the FANatics, think for yourself, and take a good look at this phone.
