This product just reminds me when apple firstly introduced the iphone, changing the mind set of the market. It takes popular activities you do using your mobile phone and tablet pushing them together nicely. Samsung just blew me away with such beauty and strength. Guess it turned as a good investment for Samsung to take risks as the first and only 5.3" mobile in the Android market.here goes, the good, the bad.The Good:--------- big, clear, high resolution fit for LOTS of reading screen- highest responsiveness I've seen in an android phone till now, had the S2 before that- speakers are really clear- camera is a bit better than the S2(though not as clear as the iphone 4, for some reason the iphone4 camera is better even than the 4S in picture/light color recognition)- 16GB internal memory, though i can't find more than 13.5GB "2GB as applications memory" "11.xxGB" general storage + place for SSD, which is 32GB in my case- the pen is really handy (when taking notes in a phone call or something when u are using a Bluetooth headset), though the delay in displaying what you are writing might affect your handwriting, best thing to write not paying attention to that "tiny" delay in order to maintain good hand writing as a final result- Slim, though you might feel weird considering the size, but it is a good thing when you get the "feel" of it- Had an HTC Desire/HD before, they used to heat up badly from the back whenever operating heavily on wi-fi or games, was concerned this one will have the same problem due to the strong processor, but it was all good.- comes with android 2.3.6, so, yaaaay .. if you care.The Bad:--------- First when I got the phone, I felt deceived because of the battery draining speed, it didn't even complete 4 hours when i first charged it .. yeah i was playing with everything ON and no power saving mode, but hey, 4 hours?!!! of course, after the 5th charge or something with some tuning "power saving mode + closing 3g whenever i am not using data" .. it finally passes the 15 hours line, with LOTS of phone calls done "averaging 2 hours talk time in a working day and like 2 hours of internet applications like facebook and so", though, wishing more performance will come out of it later.- Ok, i admit it, i have average sized man hands and proud. This caused me lots of trouble handling the phone at first, but now got used to it, operating 75% of my needs using my right hand alone now.- when you are not using a headset, using the handset is something to laugh at, covering ur whole face and when the phone slips up or down a bit, hearing the other side becomes difficult if not impossible, have to hold it RIGHT THERE, where the silver line representing the handset speaker mode is in front if your ear deep whole.- no jeans pocket can handle this phone.- a bit slippery, getting a rubber cover soon- a 2 seconds delay if you are using a bluetooth headset answering an "incoming" phone call to start hearing the voice into the headset "had this in all previous android phones as well", may be it is the headset i am using?!- Not a lot of modded roms out there yet, i always like taking tours in roms and stuff. Also, clockworkmod is not supporting the device yet.Finally, the Ugly:------------------- Nothing at all made my decision buying this phone hard. I read a lot, i receive many important emails daily, i "Facebook" whenever i feel bored, all this makes a big screened-phone a plusSomethings you might want to consider:--------------------------------------- Since handling the phone takes a lot of concentration, specially at first, a market application called "voice dialer plus" works better than the idiotic voice application coming with the Samsung, at least for the Arabic language support and non-English names, you might want to give it a try before giving up on the voice command thingy.- Samsung's idiotic dialer, i hate its search methodology but like the swipe left/right feature, so searched a bit and found "exDilaer" in the android market, also pretty handy.
