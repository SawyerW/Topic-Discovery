I've had this phone for about a month and I just started using ADW Launcher with ChompSMS to give a unique look to my phone and when I am browsing the app list, it is very slow to scroll back and forth and sometimes it doesn't even load the pictures and text of the apps sometimes and I have to exit out and then the ADW Launcher stops responding and I have to reset the default as being the ADW Launcher.I haven't tried any other launchers yet but one thing I do LOVE about this phone is how you can install apps directly from the play store on your tablet/laptop/desktop. Just visit play.google.com and click "install" as long as your tablet/phone is compatible with the app you can install it directly from your laptop/tablet/desktop. It is very easy to use.The audio is nice. I don't have any complaints about it. It doesn't have beats audio but it sounds like it does. /coming from someone who hasn't really used beats on anything but her laptopBefore I purchased the product, I saw it in a T-Mobile store and new I wanted it. It was so sleek and the screen was so big. The little card that T-Mobile has really explained all I needed to know when I got it. I wish I knew how cool android was before this but I would have gotten this phone anyway. Hahaha.*********IMPORTANT-- I tried to buy it unlocked from AT&T; on eBay but when I went to go use it my sim card was too big so I went to a T-Mobile store and used one of their sim cards made for the phone to make sure it worked and it only got EDGE service. I was not able to get 4G. I knew I should have gotten 4G where I was standing because one of the T-Mobile agents had the Galaxy S3 in white (version I got) for about a week and I held them side-by-side. So, just beware of the seller's return policies when it comes to unlocked phones. I didn't think this would happen but now I know. I was able to buy it brand new from T-Mobile that day but I would have been SOL otherwise.**************The default TouchWiz launcher is what the phone is made for and everything runs extremely smooth using that launcher. I have used up 12.05GB of my 16GB white version of the phone. I have 1.81GB in apps (about 50-60 apps; if I have more then wow! hahaha), 3.56GB in Pictures & Videos, 20KB in Audio (about 15-20 songs; just chose the one's I liked the best from iTunes), 24.54MB in Downloads (saved screenshots; instagram images, etc.) and lastly 6.02GB of Free Space. I have not purchased a MicroSD card as I do not have the money to do that yet but I plan to purchase at least one 32GB MicroSD card to open up more space. Once I do that, I may root the phone but I am afraid I will break it.Overall, the phone is perfect. I don't really have any demands or anything that I would like to change about the phone except the battery life. It doesn't last as long as I would like it to without using the app 2X Battery but if I have to use an app and an extended battery that is fine with me.
