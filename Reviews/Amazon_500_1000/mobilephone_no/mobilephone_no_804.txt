Since I already had an existing AT&T; phone, I wanted to get a new phone without the need to sign new contract or upgrade the existing one. I first checked the IPhone, but they don't sell it unlocked.So I found this Nokia phone and decided to try it out, I have been using it for a month now and overall it is good phone, but does have some drawbacks, here are the cons and pros:Pros:1- Nice and sleek design, although not true VGA screen, it is decent2- Keyboard is very soft and easy to use.3- OS is stable (so far), I used to have Windows phone and it drove me crazy, I had to reboot daily!! This one is waaaaay better.4- Lot of applications in Nokia's OVI store.5- Has support for Exchange server to sync business email and calendar, and it works perfectly, even with better interface than Windows phones.6- Support 3G (for AT&T;), sometimes it shows 3.5G, not sure if it means faster than 3G, and I really don't feel it is faster than 3G.7- The lens quality is excellent with impressive 5MP.Cons:1- When using the Speaker option, the microphone is very bad, many people complained my voice is cracking when I use the speaker option.2- The phone screen is not a real touch technology like the IPhone, it is more pressure technology, so sometimes I need to put little pressure when using it.3- Battery needs to be charged daily, especially when using Bluetooth or GPS.4- When installing the Exchange Mail app, it requires a locking password, but it does not ask the user for the password, because the phone comes with a pre-saved one (12345), and no where in docs or user guides or Nokia site provides this default password, it drove me nuts until I found it!!!5- I used Jawbone bluetooth and it works fine, until the Jawbone start run out of battery, and then the phone start act strange, calls gets disconnected or dropped, busy or no Network signal show up, etc.Overall it is a good phone, the UI is easy to use and takes short time to learn, it can be a strong competitor for IPhone if they fix the basic cons..---------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/23/2010, the phone became much more buggy after the Exchange App enforced locking code, the time out is only 20 minutes, so it gets locked easily throughout the day, here are the issues so far:1- When calls come in, 50% of the time the phone will not respond to the unlock side key, so the call will go unanswered2- When there is a Voice Mail, and lock, the VM notification will just hang the phone with no ability to choose any option3- Sometimes the phone is locked, using the side key to unlock it does not make any difference, the phone will hang.I have not seen these issues before I had to use the lock option, so if this option is not used, I think it is a decent phone, otherwise it is extremely buggy and now I need to reboot (or remove battery to restart it) at least once a week!!! It feels like using the Windows based phones again, with fancy UI.
