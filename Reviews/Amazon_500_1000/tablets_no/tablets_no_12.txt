I like all those things which has proved the greatest Steve Jobs wrong or even has potential of doing it. Because such things has to be something beyond the greatest. Examples: (i) Software and hardware has to go together: Windows and PC proved it wrong. Then again Android proved it wrong. (ii) Touch devices with stylus dead on arrival: Galaxy Note proved it wrong. (iii) Who reads books? First Kindle proved him wrong. (iv) Tablet of smaller than 10 or 9 inch screens are of no use.AND THEN COMES NEXUS 7 TO PROVE HIM WRONG AGAIN.IN SHORT ITS GAME CHANGER OR TREND SETTER, AFTER THIS DEVICE, SMALLER SIZED TABLETS MIGHT BECOME FASHION AND GO HEAD TO HEAD OR EVEN FAR THAN THEIR BIGGER BROTHERS.MARK MY WORD : YOU WILL USE LESSER BIGGER SIZED TABLETS OR LAPTOP FOR THAT MATTER ONCE YOU HAVE IT.IT'S ALWAYS MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ONES RATHER.Now please proceed to the detailed review of this great device (this deserve it)1. VERY BEAUTIFUL DEVICE: SIMPLE, SLEEK, SEXY AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS LIKE APPLE DEVICE MINUS ALUMINUM IN BACK FOR HALF OF THE MONEY.2. MOST PORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO USE AND CARRY. BEST FOR CASUAL USAGE: Its just like novel which you can put in pocket and use it any convenient position. Nothing beats it in this regard. People are using it even for serious work.3. VERY POWERFUL.4. VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED OPERATING SYSTEM equivalent to iOS but more powerful, flexible and customizable. It puts YOU IN COMMAND and don't let you feel helpless or dumb. You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI (Buy any micro USB to HDMI adaptor). I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART. Seems they have much lesser complaints about quality. We three friends bought this and we are much more than satisfied. Its one of our best purchase so far.
