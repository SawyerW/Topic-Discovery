i live in South Africa and after spending many hours on my computer reading reports and reviews on ALL the available devices on the market , i decided on the KINDLE FIRE even though it was only available in the USA and i had to buy the device through a 3rd party company here and i knew that many of the features of the KINDLE FIRE would not work in South Africa , my reasoning was this ,i travel around SA frequently and spend lots of hours in airports in aircraft lounges and on aircraft and i also read a lot , i wanted an E reader or tablet , with the ability to access the internet , watch a movie , dowload a magazine and i got exactly that OK i cannot access the "cloud storage" and because of this i cannot access AMAZON music store or app store or watch movies from AMAZON prime or otherwise , for those people outside of the USA thinking of buying the KINDLE FIRE but who do not know what will work or not here below is what i know works at this point 2 weeks in and what you CAN do on your KINDLE FIRE..DOWNLOAD E BOOKS AS PER A NORMAL KINDLE.DOWNLOAD MAGAZINES WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS AS PER A NORMAL KINDLE EXCEPT OBVIOUSLY IN COLOR..DOWLOAD AUDIO BOOKS.SOME OF THE APPS YOU GET WITH THE DEVICE SUCH AS "WEATHER" WORK FINE.YOU CAN ACCESS THE WEB / INTERNET  GOOGLE , TWITTER , FACEBOOK ETC.YOU CAN DOWNLOAD CONTENT FROM YOUR HOME COMPUTER TO YOUR KINDLE THAT INCLUDES MOVIES , PICTURES , OTHER E BOOKS , MUSIC , I SUPPOSE APPS BUT I DONT KNOW .What i do when going away is to load my content that i want to take with me from my PC such as a couple of movies and some music ( the KINDLE FIRE uses certain software so you need to convert your movies into the right format , my son did it in 10 minutes ) buy the books i want to read and leave home with the KINDLE FIRE loaded up , when away if i want another book usually the airport lounges have WI FI hotspots so i can buy a book or magazine if i need to but that is rare , when i get home i remove what i have finished with and clear the memory for next time , i never read books or watch movies twice so once they are watched or read thats it , "next please"CONCLUSIONThe KINDLE FIRE is still a great buy even if you live overseas and cannot accesss the cloud content , for people like me who want leisure content only for relaxation after a hard days work it is still perfect , i have always believed that people doing work on laptops and tablets after normal hours on aircraft every day should find another job , if they cannot do the job in working hours someone should check what they do during the day !!!its OK to work over when needed but some people "live" if that is the word like this  , i have read hundreds of TECH REPORTS on KINDLE FIRE V I PAD  V SAMSUNG GALAXY V NOOK TABLET ETC ETC what tosh!!! these guys write the man in the street buys what he needs , if you want leisure content with access to the internet , if you read a lot of books and magazines and like to watch movies get the KINDLE FIRE , if you want to run your entire life on a tablet buy the I PAD its simple , as for those of us living outside the USA , the NOOK is not an option as far as i am concerned AMAZON is a truly international company BARNES AND NOBLE i never heard of until i read all the reviews , in the TECH REPORTS i read all kinds of stuff about reaction times , "jerky" connections ,this function not as good as I PAD ,that function not as good as I PAD , if my KINDLE FIRE WAS any faster i would not be able to use it !!! the information about AMAZON SILK BROWSER getting faster as you use the device is true , the KINDLE FIRE starts to understand the stuff you do , i am sure that the APPLE I PAD is a wonderfull thing my friends who have one love theirs but these are my friends who are TECHNOPHOBES , APPLE I PAD will have a huge market of these people but AMAZON will have a massive market too for all its KINDLES for people like me , one day in SA maybe we too will have AMAZON cloud access that would be great but the KINDLE FIRE is still great for me as it is . if anybody from outside the USA reads this i hope it helps you decide what to do.
