I fully agree with the guy who made the chess analogy. This is a great device but you need to be able to look beyond the obvious to use it well. An instruction manual bigger than 2 pages might be nice. I am a former iPhone user (very satisfied with the switch) and have played extensively with iPads owned by colleagues. Very limited in their productivity and Apple's idea of multi-tasking is laughable. They mostly just seemed like large game-boys to me.Xoom seems to lend itself more to productivity and is much closer to the laptop replacement that i am looking for in such a device than the iPad, though not quite there yet.Anyone who complains about the lack of apps hasn't actually tried downloading apps for it. As of 01May2011 I have 96 non-sprint specific apps on my Evo phone. of them only 6 have not work perfectly on my xoom. of the 6, 4 didnt make full use of screen space, and one i could not get to install. Not a single one was downloaded from the "tablet specific" store. So yes while few android apps are specifically made for Tablets, at least 90% of them seem to work just fine even if they are not "optimized".Those who complain that it doesn't play all movie formats need to do a little research as there are a number of great free apps that work perfectly on xoom and will play all movie formats i have tried. I recommend MoboPlayer. Its free and works for every format i have thrown at it.For music; Try Mixzing. could use an interface uplift but works on all sorts of music formats including my music i thought was eternally corrupted with iTunes formatting and DRM.Battery life has been great thus far. i did not recharge it at all for the first 4 days fairly heavy use. I understand that when watching movies, you can expect 10+ hours. I cannot confirm this but i can confirm that i have gotten at least 15+ hours of what i would call normal usage (some office work, some movies, some games, a lot of downloading, etc) and this took it down to 30% battery life.The weight issue is null to me. I have held it in my hands performing a variety of functions for hours on end and experienced no fatigue what so ever. The convenience of Flash far out-weighs the extra 4 ounces this thing has over other devices.With the Flash issue fixed, i currently have only one technical complaint, but i am confident it will be addressed soon. That of course is the still lack of ability to make use of the SD slot. This one thing, in my opinion, makes Xoom, non-comparable to the iPad. So many reviews focus on internal memory. Once the SD slot is activated, Xoom memory will be essentially unlimited.Other than that i still feel that the price is a big hurdle. As far as tablets go, i believe this will give you more bang for the buck than the leading tablet, however 600 bucks for a device that is not yet a laptop replacement still feels steep to me. If not for the fact that i am in the military and getting deployed in a few weeks, i would never have purchased this at $599. Still when it comes to convenience of stowage, tablets are hard to beat.-----------------Update-------------------------Bought mine with Deployment looming. Now 3 months into deployment its absolutely the most satisfying purchase i have made in years. Use it for everything including talking to my wife with google talk regardless of which device (computer, phone, or her own xoom) she is using.  Also of note, a friend of mine is now on his 3rd Ipad began because they are so fragile. Apparently they cannot withstand the slightest drop. I have dropped the xoom from my top (approximately 8 feet) rack and merely a few scratches and no detriment to functionality. Also of note, i tend to find better wi-fi signal with my xoom, than my liberty buddies that use iPad. Laptops still get better reception unfortunatly, but they have to deal with their limited battery life.Pros-Flash player-Customizable interface-great screen quality and pixel count-great mobile movie player (download moboPlayer and learn to use it)-excellent wi-fi and blue-tooth reception (essential when you are deployed and spend liberty looking for a place with wifi)-expandable memory-**Durability**-**Battery life** (easily get 12 hours of video)Cons-SD slot available but still read only-Price -> I personally believe that the correct pricing for any tablet should be in the $200-400 range for full functionality.
