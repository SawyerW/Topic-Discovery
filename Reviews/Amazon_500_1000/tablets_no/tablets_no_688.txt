I bought the Playbook for my wife as a gift. I did not buy it on Amazon but elsewhere and I just wanted to give my comments on it.PROS:1- Integration with my wife BlackBerry was easy, she can use her BBM, BB Calendar, BB email, documents right there on her Playbook after sync. She can use her phone data plan too on the tablet without any extra $$ cost or requiring reconfiguration.2- The Office App is the best I have found on a touch device (Docs, Excel and Presentations), she uses it every day and she can decide where to save them, on the Playbook himself or in her BlackBerry.3- Perfect size for her needs, nice bright and DPI screen, I love the speakers (2 of them put in front of the device: some other brands only have 1 speaker placed in the back the sound doesn't feel right).4- Apps, well some say there are no apps in here but there are a lot, maybe not the same quantity than Apple Appstore or Google Play but you have all that you might need... Comes with 3 big games (Need for Speed, and 2 others I don't remember cuz I dont play -my wife doesn't play too- that much :-P)5- Best internet browser I have seen on mobile devices or tablets, yes I think its better than Android and Safari its is fluid and can render Flash without any problems, Its really like browsing on a full Desktop PC.6- Multitasking way better than iPad, and maybe even better than Android ICS, its so intuitive to pass from an open App to another one, to close them, to chose another one. Trust me, its amazing what this little tablet can do.7- Playbook OS 2.1 its a nice piece of OS, RIM needs more developers to put more apps in here ... and the better part is that now if you don't have any BlackBerry phone, it doesn't matter because you have Calendar, Email, Docs, Facebook, etc without needing a BlackBerry (the phone its a plus, but not necessary)8- Battery life is really good, I have used it on a trip for more than 5 hours watching movies and at then end, battery was like 55% - 60%9- Nice back camera, taken videos and pictures with it and really nice.10- Standard connectors Micro USB and Mini HDMI that you can hook easily to you TVCONS:1- It feels a bit heavier when compared to other 7 inch tablets (I compared the Samsung 7 inch and this before buying)2- Maybe more Apps... well to be honest the only real one that I want and can't find is Skype so I can use the front camera3- No expansion card..I can say that it is the best 7 inch 16GB tablet you can have for $199, yes now there is the Nexus Tab 7 for the same price but its a 8GB ... if you have an extra $55 go buy Nexus Tab 7 16GB or Samsung 7.0 only if you are worried about not having apps, but for me and my wife the Playbook cover all our needs (Office apps, Browser, Twitter and Facebook, some casual games, watching movies, pictures)
