In February I reviewed this on the Samsung product site.  At that time, my overall opinion was "No, I would not recommend this to a friend."  However, with the recent upgrade (FINALLY) to the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system (4.0.4), the problems have ALL been fixed.When I spoke with Samsung back in March they refused to even acknowledge the so-called "Sleep of Death" issue.  This is despite the fact that it has been well documented all over the internet; any search will turn it up in seconds.  I am now COMPLETELY HAPPY with this product.  I love it and I use it all the time.  I actually loved it, more or less, prior to this upgrade, although it annoyed me regularly.  I see now that I had forced myself to become complacent with the problem.I use my Galaxy Tab extensively for scheduling and personal management; I have used it for playing audiobooks while driving; for reading ebooks in both epub and pdf format; for surfing the web; for reading and composing email; for taking pictures and video; for streaming music; and for playing games.The available apps in the android market (now known as the Google Play Store) are plentiful and totally satisfactory.  There are apps and widgets for nearly anything.  When I search for a particular type of application I am always presented with many matches from which to choose.  More apps are being added all the time.I would now HIGHLY recommend this tablet to a friend.Frank===== MY ORIGINAL REVIEW - NOW OUTDATED =======================================February 8, 2012I just received this tablet for Christmas. The good: The physical design of the tablet is perfect for my needs. I wanted a tablet that I could read books on, plus surf the web, do email, etc. I found that a larger tablet would be uncomfortable to hold for a long period of time. I also wanted this tablet because it has a MicroSD card slot. The tablet is perfectly responsive, even with a screen protector. It's nice and bright, although I find I have to decrease the brightness when running on battery.And now the bad news. Almost immediately, I began experiencing a problem. When the device goes into sleep mode, it will randomly shut down. TOTALLY. After experimenting I eventually found that pressing the power button for about 15 seconds would restart it. So, sleep mode is somewhat useless. This happens a couple of times a day or more. After researching this issue online, I discovered MANY people having this issue. It has been dubbed "Sleep of Death". Unfortunately, Best Buy won't help me so now I will have to start dealing with Samsung. Stay tuned - if I get this fixed I'll update this review.A new problem today - it locked up upon recovering from the "sleep of death" issue. It was stuck on the "Samsung Galaxy Tab" splash screen. I could turn it off, but it would come back to the same screen. After working with it for about 20 minutes, it restarted - in recovery mode. Luckily most of the apps were backed up to my Google account, so they restored automatically. Not so my wallpapers, other settings, etc. Don't know if this is an isolated problem or not.Pros: Built-in speakers, Bright display, Realistic color, Lightweight, microsd card slotCons: buggy
