i purchased this 3-days backalready there have been reviews regd it's pros / cons.....so i 'd not repeat the same.....the additional cons i came across1)usb ports (2) is/are at the bottom where the device docks to supplied keyboard - they 'd have included at least one usb 2.0 to the left or right2)no RJ-45 [wired lan port] on the device....i 'd have to dock it to use the wired network option [do not trust wireless stuff]....guess i'd have to purchase hdmi-lan cord....3)may be it was said before or not i do not remember but the thing that cribs me is  the plastic cover to pull down to insert SD/SDHC card - they 'd have this slot left open with a dummy card inside [ to save from dust etc]4)difficult to change boot options - i have to dock it or use usb keyboard to access boot menu....tried to load win 8 but soon gave up - settled for removing bloatware and tweaking on win 7 HP further as per suggestions in the forums on net...Now the pros1)superb screen - very sensitive to touch....very bright / great colors and sharpness...2)Full touchscreen to access any menu/sub-menu....though i'd recommend using the stykus with rubber-tip.....3)battery is ok[video playback 3-4 hrs,wifi off, bluetooth off ,around 10-25% brightness ]  considering it's full on computer so no worries - adapter cord is lengthy and comes in handy while using the device...4)not overly bulky at all... at least for me...over all 4 stars becoz of 'cons' aboveupdate 1i backed up iconia w500 with acronis softwarethen i installed the win 8 devaloper build 8102 [if i remember correctly]installed total media theater v5 and virtual clone drv...TMT v5 did NOT work ok - 'd not access any thing that's connected via usbVLC 'd NOT be installedeven XBMC failed to work correctlyas for win 8 - this is still very pre-mature version i guess it will take a long time to make win 8 a truly touch interface with full on OS supportreverted back to win 7 HP - removed the acer bloatware and tweaked itdevice working ok for now with TMT v5 and VLC installed along with virtual clone drv...update 2been streaming videos over wifi for sometime.....i have asrock ion 3D [GPU nvidia GT218 integrated] for use as nettopi streamed a few DVDs and compared the performance of both for the same DVD streamed over wifialthough the c-50 cpu can handle DVD playback once the dvd structure is stored on the internal memory but the CPU is not very powerful to decode on the fly over wifi [HD6250 GPU is inferior to nvidia GT218 in Asrock ion 3D ]so dvd when streamed over wifi to iconia was almost like a slideshow but the same one did great on my asrock ion 3d with least stutteringbut no regrets already most of my DVDs are converted to h.264 MKV (using free utility called handbrake] so they play just fine on both asrock ion 3D and iconia w500 over wifibut definitely ATI HD6250 is no match for nvidia GT218 - though GT218 is not great but still it's more powerful than HD 6250 and can handle streamed wifi data on the fly with least of stutter...my next upgrade : when  tablet with atom cpu and nvidia GPU integrated will be released ...till then w500 rules.
