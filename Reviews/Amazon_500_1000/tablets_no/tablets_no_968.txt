My Prime was a gift for Christmas, which I finally got my hands on 1/1/2012 (was on vacation when it delivered 12/28 via BestBuy). In the 28 hours I've had it, I've fallen in love with the simplicity. I even broke out an iPad 2 to do some comparisons. So far, with the camera update and such, the video and camera is better than the iPad; web is quick; gameplay is gorgeous; only a few minor bugs with sensitivity (it really needs a precise touch for closing programs and moving apps on home screen). You want a more detailed review, just search the ones already on Amazon; they are way more tech-savvy than I.I don't care about the bootloader, although it seems to be a really big issue for everyone reviewing the Prime. As the product is intended to be, the Prime is amazing; reviews that say otherwise are bogus, although I understand wanting the bootloader lock removed (but that should not equal 1-star ratings, guys! Come on!). No WiFi issues, but I have noticed the signal will say it is low; when I do a speed test, I get 5mbps, which makes me think the signal indicator is the issue, not the actual WiFi. However, I am not a pro.I'm a student, so this should come in handy so I don't have to lug 10 pound texts + laptop + notebook everywhere I go. SuperNote is pretty awesome on it. Waiting for a good case to come in, but will probably pick up a sleeve tomorrow until the Tuff-Luv for the TF201 releases in February.***update 1.3.12***Asus announced their statement about bootloader. They will allow unlock.***update 1.21.12***After ICS update, my Prime showed a dead pixel and would show black horizontal lines. I found a replacement at Best Buy nearby and exchanged it. The new one has no issues that I've found. I tested the WiFi speed: 17.44 d/l and 3.44 up. Same as the iPhone in my house and Bionic Droid.I have also gotten my hands on the dock. I'm loving it. When the Prime reaches 70%, the dock charges it, but the dock dies very quickly compared to what I was expecting (but I'm always using it).So, yes, many Primes have flaws. Not all.***update 3.29.12***Okay, so now that I've used this thing daily since the beginning of the year, I wanted to give some more feedback. I'm a graduate student, so I use this thing for school all the time. Most of what we read is in .pdf format, so I love that I can switch between notes and reading; it's easy to take the dock off when needed. (If you're a student like me, apps you'll want: EZ PDF, because you can annotate most .pdf files; QuickOffice, because I hated the stock processor, and I can't stand Google Docs; SplashTop is pretty cool, in case I forget a file on my computer at home.)I use this thing to read. No issues with daylight reading, and without the dock, it lasted my from 7AM to 4AM with a lot of reading (I'm on Spring Break). When I game, it handles it perfectly, and I love the graphics. I usually keep it in battery saver mode unless I want to play games.About the dock: while there are some issues with the rubber things coming off the bottom, I love how easy it is to use the dock with the Prime--and it's so thin when they're together! Issues: screen is heavier than the dock. I got a good case and now I don't worry about it at all. Mouse is a little awkward at times, so I usually just use the touch screen (it's funny transitioning back to my regular laptop; I'm always hitting the screen).This thing is so easy to use! The only thing I wish was that the WiFi detector was stronger. If I'm in my backyard, it doesn't pick up the signal; if I am five feet from the door (about 200 feet from the router) I pick it up again. Still, the perks outweigh the cons.
