Pros:Snappy ProcessorPerfect Size4G Built InCons:Battery LifeOne of the Viewing AnglesI recently got this from T-Mobile during a promotion for $99.99 on contract. I am an extremely avid Android user, and I did quite a bit of homework prior to purchasing this tablet. For those of you who are OK with playing around a bit and are on the fence, check out the XDA forums to see what's going on with development:[...]The good points of this device are, of course, the size (7" is perfect, no matter what Apple CEO Steve Jobs says), the Tegra2 processor, T-Mobile 4G, and the fact that it runs Android. This thing is a joy to use, and the free tethering is just icing on the cake (icing that my Cr48 is taking full advantage of).The cons, as you'll read about on tech blogs and from uninformed reviewers, are as follows: it only runs FroYo, Dell stage UI stinks, the screen is crap, and the battery life is abysmal. I'll take these one at a time.FroYoYes, this tab "only" runs Android FroYo. Two points of note: 1. FroYo is still leaps and bounds ahead of any non-Android operating system out there. It trounces the iPad's software rather easily. 2. This will get Honeycomb, Google Android's tablet OS. Dell has already confirmed this, and the guys at XDA (above link) will have it on there sooner than that. Even if this stayed on FroYo indefinitely (which it won't), it's still a great OS. In conclusion: enjoy the FroYo experience, which is quite good, and then enjoy the Honeycomb when this gets updated, which will be pretty soon.Dell stage UIIt's kind of crappy, admittedly. Head over to the Android Market and install, for free, any of the following: ADW Launcher, LauncherPro, Zeam Launcher, Regina Launcher, or a slue of others. Problem solved.ScreenThe screen resolution is fine, netting a pixel density greater than the iPad. Viewing angles are mostly good, with only one angle being poor. Since Android will flip the UI any which way, it doesn't matter. Is the Galaxy Tab's screen better? Absolutely. If you don't have the two units next to each other, will you notice? Highly doubtful.Battery LifeThe battery life is pretty poor, even with optimisation. Some tricks you can do (if rooted): uninstall the T-Mo bloatware, set the antenna to not search for EDGE or 3G/4G but to stick on just 3G/4G (unless you're in an EDGE area, then do the opposite), and underclock when the screen is off. It still won't be great battery, but it will be better.Out of the box, this isn't the greatest tablet. Once optimised, this thing rocks! Easily a 4 star device, with one taken away for battery life. With the improved battery from Honeycomb, this ought to get better (but it will still be a little weak, I'm betting). Oh, and if you want phone calls, get a free, Google Voice account and pay the $4 for GrooVe IP. Done.If you want to simply purchase it and use it, get something else. If you're OK setting it up for a day or so before use, this one is hard to beat.
