Googling for MONTHS for how to solve "phone errors", or find any "official" support - the best source for info has been Amazon reviews!  Am writing this review after hunting down the OEM and receiving their email below the six points here:Indeed this device is clean, sleek and 35% cheaper than an Acer, Asus (or iPad).By saving $100, you also: 0. Save a digital tree - ABSOLUTELY NO MANUAL -PRINTED, NOR PDF, NOR by website. 1. Lose ability to use Google Chrome for Android - restricted by Gmail / Google from using their full features.  (highly recommend Firefox *and* Opera browsers) 2. Have no option to ever upgrade - see manufacturer's email below saying they plan to replace/obsolete this item 3. Experience "phone errors" - giving strong indication the Operating System is cloned from a phone 4. If a student of Japanese or other Asian languages, will have have difficulty installing alternate keyboard.  You can change the entire keyboard easily, but to switch to second entry method, more difficult than any competitor I've seen. (Certainly LePan's OEM, having a Chinese website and Japanese name, should be experts at this.) 5A. Gain a reliable email collection / response tool for public WiFi hotspots like Panera, Starbucks, Peet's, Whole Foods, and McDonald's - It is SO VERY PLEASANT to be able to type on a full keyboard instead of the tiny iphone keyboard 5B. Become a WiFi troubleshooting expert: this reviewer could ONLY connect with WEP key - the oldest, and simplest WiFi security / encryption method. It would recognize the more robust AES and TKIP methods but alternately connect/disconnect every 10-15 seconds. Solution was to reduce my router's WiFi security to WEP - and gain full connectivity!! 6. Lose points with your teenager - I offered this to him and he rejected it - says he'll save up for a real pad like Acer, Asus or iPad. Visited Matsunichi dot com - this device is nowhere mentioned. Visited lepantab dot com - and got fake virus warning before the page even loaded - probably / hopefully not an official website ??===EMAIL HISTORY WITH OEM===> From: Shawn.liu(AT)matsunichi(DOT)com.cn> Date: April 24, 2012 21:42:49 PDT> Subject: Ni hau - need help updating Le Pan 970.>> Dear Mr. Whitworth:>> We are sorry that there is no new firmware for our TC 970 tablet as we are selling Le Pan II and Tc 970 will phase out in few months. The Google Froyo 2.2 was used in the phone in early release. We should remove phone related function and display. We don't know why the warning of phone connection appears. Sorry about this. We seem unable to satisfy you on your requests.>> Shawn, 4/24> ======= 2012-4-25 10:35:52 ''''''''=======>> Hi Shawn,>> I'd like instructions of how to properly update the LePan. My LePan has an older (system, version, firmware?) so that it currently can not run Google Chrome for Android. Plus it has 'reported phone connection warnings as if it has an older telephone version of Android O/S.'>> Therefore, I believe that I need an official version of update from your firm, if available. 'After the update I'd like to report on the successful experience. And, with your permission, I'd like to'link to your sales and support website(s).
