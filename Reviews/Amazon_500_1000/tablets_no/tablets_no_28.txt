I RATE THIS ITEM VERY HIGH.  I LIKE THE FACT IT IS ROBUST, WINDOWS BASED AND CAN BASICALLY REPLACE YOUR LAPTOP.  THIS IS A GOOD MANUFACTURER THAT MAKES RUGGED UNIT FOR INDUSTRY.  ONE WORD OF CAUTION IF YOU BUY A USED MODEL, CHECK IT OVER THOROUGHLY TOP TO BOTTOM AND MAKE SURE IT ALL WORKS WELL. DONT DELAY, YOU ONLY HAVE FOURTEEN DAYS TO NOTIFY THE VENDOR IF YOU FIND A DEFECT. YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO RETURN IT, BUT IT BEGINS TO BE A HASSLE WITH CERTAIN VENDORS. I RECENTLY BOUGHT ANOTHER MOTION COMPUTING TABLET AND HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THAT VENDOR MESDECART OF COLORADO. THEY ADVERTISED THE UNIT AS BEING IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION AND HAVING BEEN UPDATED WITH WINDOWS 8.  UPDATED IT WAS, AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT WINDOWS 8 HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN RELEASED YET SO THERE IS NO SUPPORT, NO DRIVER OR MANUFACTURER UPGRADES OR SUPPORT FOR THAT OPERATING SYSTEM.  THE TABLET LOCKED UP CONSTANTLY AND WOULD NOT START AGAIN UNTIL YOU DEPRIVED IT OF ALL POWER INCLUDING REMOVAL OF THE BATTERY FOR A FEW MINUTES.  ONCE YOU DID THAT YOU COULD START IT, BUT IF YOU TURNED IT OFF OR IT TRIED TO HIBERNATE FORGET IT, YOU HAD TO REMOVE ALL THE POWER AGAIN. THE BATTERY WAS ALSO IN POOR CONDITION AND THE STYLUS FAILED IN THE 21 DAY OF USE.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE VENDOR AND AMAZON I GOT THE RUN AROUND.  THEY WANTED TO BLAME THE WINDOWS 8 INSTALL TO WHICH I REPLY, HEY GUYS YOU ADVERTISED IT AS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER WITH WINDOWS 8 AND YOU LIED ABOUT THAT. THEY TOLD ME TO INSTALL WINDOWS 7.  OKAY, THEN SEND ME A RESTORE DISK. THEY ORIGINALLY CAME WITH THEM.  I GUESS THEY EXPECT ME TO GO OUT AND BUY WINDOWS 7 NOW.  THE VENDOR MESARTDECO GAVE FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT HAVING RESOLVED WHAT THEY CALLED A TECHICAL PROBLEM TO AMAZON SO AMAZON HAS FAILED TO STAND BY ME.  I AM STILL TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS AND EVEN GAVE THE MERCHANT THE CHANCE TO CREDIT ME FOR A NEW BATTERY, SEND ME A RESTORE DISK AND A STYLUS. OTHERWISE, BY TOMORROW IT IS GOING BACK AND I WILL GET MY REFUND.  THE VENDOR WANTS TO CHARGE ME A RESTOCKING FEE EVEN THOUGH THEY WILL BE GETTING IT BACK WITHIN THE 30 DAY RETURN PERIOD.  LIKE I SAID, I LIKE THESE MOTION COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THEY ARE RUGGED AND WORTH THE USED PRICE IF YOU GET AN HONEST VENDOR WHO WILL STAND BEHIND THE SALE.  IN REGARD TO THIS MODEL, I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE I AM RETURNING BECAUSE IT HAS A BIGGER SCREEN, MORE PORTS AND UPGRADE ABILITY LIKE A LAPTOP.  IT CAN DO ALOT AND EVEN SOME THINGS THAT LAPTOPS USUALLY DONT PROVIDE.  THIS ONE HAS A FINGERPRINT SECURITY SYSTEM.  NOW THE FIRST ONE I ORDERED CAME WITH A BAD POWER SUPPLY AND I JUST GOT IT SO THIS TIME, I CONTACTED THE VENDOR AND AMAZON RIGHT AWAY TO RETURN IT NO DELAYS NO FOOLING AROUND ON THESE USED PRODUCTS. IF YOU FIND A PROBLEM THEN MY ADVISE IS SEND IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING. BUT I LIKE THIS MODEL SO WELL THAT I DID GO AHEAD AND ORDER ANOTHER ONE FROM A DIFFERENT VENDOR. HOPEFULLY THIRD TIME IS A CHARM.  THEY EVEN HAD A BETTER PRICE WHEN I ORDERED THE ONE TO REPLACE THIS ONE. IT IS TOO SOON TO SEE IF THE VENDOR WHERE I GOT THIS LE1700 WILL HONOR THE GUARANTEES WITHOUT A HASSLE BUT I HOPE SO. I AM ON IT HAVING BEEN BURNT BY MESDECART.  AMAZON USUALLY HANDLES THOSE MATTERS WELL, BUT THIS TIME THEY ARE FALLING SHORT AND FALLING FOR THE LIE OF MESDECART. I BOUGHT THAT UNIT BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION THAT IT WAS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND THOUGHT THAT WAS PLUS THEY HAD WINDOWS 8 ON IT.  BOY WAS I WRONG.  AND NOW THAT IT IS NOT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION, EVEN IF WINDOWS 8 IS PART OF THE REASON, THE BATTERY IS BAD AND SO IS THE STYLUS.  THE BATTERY IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE THEY COST 186 DOLLARS, THEY DO NOT HAVE A GENERIC AND THE SAME WITH THE STYLUS.  THEY MAKE THEM GOOD, BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE.  BOTTOM LINE DO BUY THIS TABLET, YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE IT IF YOU DONT MIND THAT IT IS A BID HEAFTY, BUT THE USED PRICE IS RIGHT. I LIKE A TALBET THAT WILL RUN WINDOWS RATHER THAN ANDROID AND LIKE A STANDARD PC YOU CAN UPGRADE THE MEMORY INSTALL BIGGER HARD DRIVES, PCMCIA CARDS, IT HAS DIGITAL VIDEO AND A GREAT BRIGHT MONITOR.  THE ANDROID TABLETS ARE NICE, BUT TO DO WHAT THIS DOES, YOU WOULD BE PAYING ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MODEL THAT CAN COMPETE USING WINDOWS 7 AS ITS OPERATING SYSTEM.THANKS FOR READING THIS.
