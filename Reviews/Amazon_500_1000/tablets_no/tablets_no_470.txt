I ordered my 16gb Thrive and some accessories on 7-14-2011 and had all the items in hand 7-15-2011...thanks to Amazon and Nu Image!I own the Iconia A500 32gb and the Samsung Galaxy Tab and extensive use of the Dell Strek so I have a point of reference.The first issue I had was not being able to get the wireless to connect or allow manual configuration for about an half hour when all of a sudden after several reboots it allowed me to manually configure networking without DHCP and it started working (I'm an electronics technician and a network engineer).It seems that startup takes a lot longer than my other tablets as Toshiba has you to view some neat graphic while waiting.Even though most users don't buy the tablets to take a bunch of high quality pictures but you should be able to get some descent pictures from either front or rear cameras.Not the case with the Thrive, as the photos and video are very grainy and washed out unless you're using abnormally bright lighting of your subject.I don't know why Toshiba decided to leave off the led flash which helps a bit on very close subjects though not perfect but better than what is offered on this tablet.I played Angry Birds and found that at the end of each round the music would freeze and sometimes the playing action would pause breifly in the beginning.It seems that the app's don't always fully close.Other than the above I absolutely love this tablets with replaceable battery and the full size USB/HDMI ports and the available accessories.I like the fact that it's a little thicker than most tables with a wider bezel which allow give the feeling of a well made and sturdy product that will easily accomodate people with big hands.The screen could be more sensitive to touch as sometimes I have to press several times to get it to respond to the onscreen buttons.To really get the brilliant color display I'd suggest turning off the autodisplay feature which make the screen a bit dimmer than is necessary and adjust to your preference which if brighter will affect battery life.I'm not trashing this tablet as I know it is new on the market and will surely have a few updates to firmware/software to tweak it to the best it can be.PROs:Sturdy build and full size ports that don't require you to purchase a bunch of unique cables to connect to your PC or HDTV.User changeable battery and a wider bezel to easier handle the unit without pressing on the screen surface.The rubber ridged back makes it comfortable to grip and feel secure when handling without portfolio.Has a file manager to further manipulate your files on the the SD or internal memory storage.It uses a 19Volt powersupply very simular to your average Laptop powersupply!Good battery runtime.CONS:No camera Flash, poor quality pictures and videos, slower startup, some audio freezing in games and sometimes when changing applications.Initially cumbersome WiFi setup which I'm finding is more related to HoneyComb OS rather than the hardware itself.Still a bit too pricey.I would suggest it to my friends and family if they don't care about the photo quality as I feel confident that Toshiba will be issuing firmware/software updates pretty soon to stay competitive with the other Tab's.UPDATE: I reloaded a few applications and they sound and execute much better :-)Still experiencing the stutter in starting programs or booting up.Right now the Acer A500 Iconia is a better buy at Costco for $4429.00 as of this writing and that's the 32gig model with portfolio case.
