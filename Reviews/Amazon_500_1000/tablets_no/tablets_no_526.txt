I got this Acer W500 2 weeks ago - And LOVE it!  It will take some tweaks to get this machine up to speed, but well worth it.First off let me say that I looked at getting a Xoom or Ipad  I have a droid phone and love all the things it can do, but it did not meet my requirements for working with the programs I use extensively like Photoshop, OneNote and Outlook.  After searching for many months this machine seemed to do everything I need to keep my business going.This tablet was shipped quickly and includes almost everything you need to use:  The tablet (screen), keyboard, power cord and recovery DVD's.  I would recommend purchasing an SD card and external DVD player, as well as a case to carry it.First thing I did was remove all applications I did not need.  I hate bloatware and would rather have a clean machine to begin with.  Removing the bloat, updating windows, and updating the BIOS took a good day's work.  One thing I kept on the machine was the Acer backup manager.  After all my work, I made an image of my machine and can always go back to my `clean state' whenever I need.  As with all my PC's, I will reload every 9 to 12 months.  Although I made an image, I have not tested this as a restore yet.  I have never been a fan of Windows Backup and it has failed me in the past.I removed the following to make this customized for the way I work:* Acer games (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Bing Bar* Ebay worldwide* Clear.fi* Clear.fi client* Office 2010 (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Social jogger (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Times reader* Virtual earth 3d* Nook for PC* MS Touch Pack* Acer VCM (will need a reboot)* McAfee (will need a reboot)* Acer screen saver* Acer touch application Suite* Acer welcome center* Acer registration (I registered first)* Acer Device Control* Auepo* Bluetooth suite* Acer device controlI also deleted the Netfix folder and the Skype folder.  These were not installed and I would rather make sure I have installed the latest and greatest instead of what was current at the time of shipment.Then I changed windows folders to single-click instead of the double click that I am used to with a mouse.  This makes touching the screen so much easier!  It's kinda funny that when I go to my other laptop, I am touching the screen expecting it to act like this tablet.  This is how fast it is to get used to the touch.I also turned off windows features:* Games (I don't play games on this machine)* IE8 - Chrome is much better and I can sync folders* Internet printing* DVD maker* GadgetI then installed and mounted a 32 GB SD card.  Mounting the card allows me to install applications to the SD card instead of the c:\ drive.I installed the following to my mounted SD Card:* AVG Free* Chrome - and set up to sync* Photoshop* Dreamweaver* Dropbox* Turbolister* Mastercook* Office 2007* Quicken* Adobe Acrobat* Picasa* Canon PrinterI do notice that running these programs are a bit slower than my other PC, but the difference is not making me pull my hair out.I love the fact that I can take this anywhere.  I purchased the Belkin Top-loading Messenger bag (for laptops up to 10.2") which holds the screen, keyboard and power.  Its small lightweight and has 2 padded compartments - I put the screen in one compartment, the keyboard in the other.Overall, this is a work machine, not a toy.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
