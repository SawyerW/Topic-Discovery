//***********************// Personal Review. //*********************//After having an Ipad at work for over a year, I decided to purchase a Kindle Fire for my own personal use and for some light work at the worksite.Three days in, the device has met my expectations.  I use it to watch movies during my breaks and play music while I work, play Angry Birds more than I should, and have even side loaded a app of my own creation for use in the field.  It is a Media machine, and in that field it shines.As a tablet, it works well, but the limitations are obvious to anyone who has ever used an Ipad.  The silk browser works okay, and the OS feels better than other android variants, but it picked up a lot of little quirks along the way in regards to the interface.  I found myself abandoning the upper 'recently used' carousel early on, as it filled with various media through the course of the day and was 'sensitive' in ways that managed to infuriate me as I flipped back and forth between apps. The on screen keyboard is okay, but it's layout limits it to quick emails and tweets only.  Trying to write a novel on this will only end in tears, and due to the lack of bluetooth or traditional usb, a physical keyboard is out of the question.That said, do I regret the purchase?  No.  Will I be purchasing the inevitable upgrade?  Probably. What will I do until then? Probably watch more Mythbusters on my Kindle Fire.//***********************// Statistical Breakdown //*********************//Breakdown by Category/Grade //*********************// Ease of Use: A- //*********************//Amazon, for the most part, got this right.  As of this writing, the system work, it works well, and aside from some previously mentioned quirks, it works.  The '-' is mostly earned by the quirky nature of the system (You'll be wanting to go to the 'Gallery' app to watch videos not downloaded from Amazon, not the 'Video' section) and the onscreen keyboard's layout. //*********************// Speed: B+ //*********************//Inferior to the Ipad in Speed, but not so much than it affected my daily routine.  Start up is slower if you shut it all the way down, but similar to the Ipad booting up from standby. The browser didn't impress nor disappoint, but all forms of media work well on this machine. //*********************// Physical Size: A+ //*********************//The small size makes it perfect for ease of travel.  Being able to shove it in my coat pocket instead of a bag has made my life simpler over the past few days, and I've had no issue reading any of my documents on it's screen.  That said, remember, this isn't an Ipad. The smaller screen is designed to make it more portable and personal, whereas the larger Ipad definitely has an edge in having a larger space to work with.  If you accept the size as a design choice rather than a flaw, the rest of the device will start to make more sense. //*********************// Memory: C- //*********************//Seriously wish it had a SD card slot.  8 gigs fills up fast these days, and I can't get access to the cloud storage at work which limits me to whatever I have on the Kindle Fire. //*********************// Apps: B //*********************//Not as big as Apple's store of the Android store, but most of the essentials are there. //*********************// Value: A //*********************//The Kindle Fire, provided you know what it can and can't do, is a excellent value.  That is because while the Ipad can outperform it, the Kindle Fire performs solidly as an entertainment and basic utility platform at 2/5th the price.  Just don't expect to use the Kindle for heavy lifting.
