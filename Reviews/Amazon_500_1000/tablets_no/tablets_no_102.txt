I've never bought anything on the first day it was available, but I was off to Venice on the 5th, so I got an iPad on the 3rd.  Even though I'm a Mac-only person, I never had an iPod or an iPhone, so I think that many of my problems arise from that and will probably go away in time.Right now I'm not sure how to answer the great Wizard of Oz question:  good witch or bad witch?GOOD WITCH:~light, small, and I didn't have to play the whole "how many books in my purse?" game for the transAtlantic flight~beautiful screen~great battery life -- I read the new Maisie Dobbs all the way across the pond~holds a massive number of books and movies, and I've got just the 16gb model~gets you into many interesting conversationsBAD WITCH~hard to keep it turned off when not in use and that's bad for draining the battery~steep learning curve if you don't have an iPhone or iPod-touch~pages on book-mode turn too easily unless you keep a perfect grip on it~hard to prop up on a table to read while eating~no substitute for a real book when standing in line, sitting in bright sun, falling asleep ...~no way (yet) to directly up-load pix from camera~no real photo software~hard-to-use documents software~wireless connection not all that enthusiastic compared to my laptop~sloooooooooooow to charge up, which is a real issue when there's only one outlet in your hotel roomSo am I glad I bought one?  Well, sort of.  If I weren't traveling, I might be more grumpy, but the book/movie thing alone is certainly sufficient reason for getting an iPad.PS/News from the front on 4/15::~the Netflix thing -- which doesn't work in Europe, so I hadn't tried it when I wrote the review -- is AWESOME.  Netflix has really stepped up the available offerings, too.~there's a KINDLE app now and you can get books from Amazon that the iBookStore doesn't have.  The special effects aren't as cool, but it's still fabulous to be able to get a book in 10 seconds.  And this _does_ work in Europe.PPS 3 weeks in (4/24)~I'm much happier with this than I was the first week, but that doesn't mean that it's entirely perfect.~Nooooooo, it's not a lap-top substitute, nor was meant to be, but if it's gonna offer document software, it would be great if it worked better.~I very much wish there were a way to batch delete mail messages, rather than having to select each one individually.  It takes a significant period of time to clear out a day's worth of messages.~A SAVED box would be great, too.~the worst thing, really, that it DOESN'T have is a camera -- so you can't Skype~there are lots of apps in the App Store, but it's hard to sift out the ones just for the iPad.  More deceptively, there IS a filter for that, but it still gives you iPhone apps, which don't look as cool or work quite as well on the Pad.~I'm very very very glad that there is a Kindle app, because the bookstore is low on new releases, at least in mysteries and thrillers~I still worry constantly about dropping it and eagerly await the arrival of the Apple case.~The wireless problems I grumped about are now famous and no fix in sight.Summary?  still glad I have it.
