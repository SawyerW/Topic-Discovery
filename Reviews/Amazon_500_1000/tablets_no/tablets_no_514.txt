I bought the Coby Kyros mid8125 for my wife a couple of months ago now and I am very happy with my purchase. I did a lot of research into making sure I got the size she wanted (this one is 8 inches) and that the tablet would still have enough power to do most tasks comfortably for a mid range tablet! And that is what people have to remember this is not a high end ipad or Samsung Galaxy.The Coby Kyros mid8125 does come with a very decent 1GHz processor and 500MB Ram and for a tablet in this price range those are very good specs, it has a lovely clear 8 inch screen and is very fast and responsive To the touch although a stylus is recommended for accuracy in certain applications and games. (my mother had recently bought a tablet of this kind but was very sluggish which is why I was so specific on looking for these kind of specs) it plays video flawlessly, it has no trouble remaining connected to our home network, its 4 GB internal memory is great to start with but can be expanded up to 32 GB with a micro sd card, it comes with all of the necessary cables etc for anything you might need and I also purchased one of those faux leather cases with mini keyboard and did not have any compatibility issues, it worked perfectly, the only thing I would recommend was buying a male micro USB to female USB adapter (it does come with an adapter cable but because it is a cable this adds length whereas the $1 adapter doesn't)The Internet browsing is fast enough and the audio is also pretty good for a tablet this size (it also comes with earphone socket and earphones which came included)The getjar app market has been really good we have been able to find most of the things we have wanted on there including some very nice games which perform very well on this tablet, no lagging, the type of games include solitaire, word searches, mahjong, suduko, gemstones, boggle and the ever popular angry birds! We have not tried any of the high-end games because this is not a high-end tablet, but the games before mentioned have worked perfectly!The battery life is pretty good, approximately 5 hours of non-stop use but this can be extended by lowering the screen brightness and turning off the WiFi when not needed, also it can be used while plugged in and charging.So, I gave this product four star because I am very happy with it, (I reserve a five-star rating for exceptional purchases) it does everything it says on the box and it does it very well and for a very good price! If you are looking for a mid range tablet this is certainly a good purchase and as long as your expectations are realistic, you will be very happy! My wife is very happy with hers therefore  so am I!UPDATE: if anybody has any problems connecting these devices to their home WiFi network, go to the router configuration and switch the WiFi channel signal to channel 2 and it should resolve the problem without affecting any of your other devices
