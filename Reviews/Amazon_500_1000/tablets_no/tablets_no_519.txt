I purchased this back in April, this year.  It arrived in good condition, and I loved it from the start.  It just worked.Having been an early-adopter of Android, (G1 from T-mobile nearly 2 years ago) I was quite familiar with how to work the Streak.The Streak's dual-core made it all lively and responsive.  It is a shame about all the bloat-ware, though-- I wish I could simply delete the unwanted junk-ware Dell loaded me up with, but short of rooting?  You have to live with it, I suppose.The dell stage was amusing for about 2 days, then all of them got deleted-- I do not use a single one of Dell's "stage widgets".  Nor do I use the "dell sync"-- it is a useless, bandwidth-hogging unwanted thing.  But that's about the only thing I do not like...I would've given this 5 stars.But.  Last Friday, I took my Streak to lunch, as usual, and tried to open my E-book (Kindle-app) and enjoy my lunch.  No joy:  "force-shut-down, low battery"What?  The battery icon shows 100%!  After a Streak-less lunch, I put it on the charger-- only then would it turn on.  But, now I was faced with an endless series of "force-close" in the software, mostly the pre-installed junk.  And the battery reads 100%, and the green "full charge" light is on... what gives?Unplugging the charger gave me 1-2 minutes, all the while showing 100% charge. During that time, any attempted access to either SD card resulted in "force-close" of the affected software.  After 1-2 minutes, a too-quick force-shut down, low battery message is barely visible before black screen.Okay.  Leave it on the charger a couple of hours.  Now, it boots up, but any access to either SD card results in "force-close", and it refuses to acknowledge anything on either card as having been installed.Finally, I was forced to factory-reset-- wiping everything.  This was after calling Dell tech-support-- they answered quickly enough, but there was a fairly severe communication barrier, unfortunately.  In spite of that, the people were supremely polite and did try their best (I think) to help.This cured the force-close issues (as far as I could tell), but the battery issue remained.  Leaving on the charger all night apparently trickle-charged it enough, that it would boot up without the charger on.  Over the weekend, I left it off the charger, but at factory-reset condition, and it happily reported 14 hours since being plugged in, 100% charge........ clearly, I had either invented a perpetual-motion machine, or the battery was toast.Today, I got the return-box from Dell.  What a nightmare >that< turned out to be-- no instructions on what to do vis a vis FedEx, just a barely legible shipping payment invoice, only 1/2 filled out.  A trip to FedEx was worse-- the counter people were quite clueless what to do with it.  They even insisted I fill out some sort of "commercial shipping customs report", of which I had no idea what to put, and neither did the clueless peons at FedEx.  After much time-wasted, they finally concluded the pre-filled out form from Dell was invalid, wrong ID or some such excuse.A call back to Dell made things worse-- they then e-mailed me a printable label that would've just returned it for partial credit!  (I did not learn that, until I returned home).  Yet another call to Dell, and ... ?We'll see.  They are always quite helpful over at Dell, and unctuously polite-- but polite-wrongness is still wrong.  They are sending (how? E-mail? Not clear) me yet another label, this time supposed to be the repair center in... Mexico, of all things.So.  4 stars-- minus one for the SNAFU vis a vis getting this repaired.Meanwhile, I'm >still< out $300, and no Streak to show for it, and it hasn't even shipped yet!... we shall see what we shall see.*****************************Edit:  not quite 24 hours, and still no e-mail with the shipping label.So far, I'm out my nearly $400, and I haven't had the use of my Streak since last Friday on June 17.  What's worse?  My busted Streak is still sitting on my coffee table, >>not<< shipped for repair ...  If I could take-away a star, I would.*****************************Edit:  6 days since my first call, and I >>still<< have not mailed this busted, no-battery Streak to get it fixed... I'd remove yet another star.  They say 14 or more "business days" (translation: two of the regular days most of us have to live with) before I'll get it back--if then.*****************************Edit:  Friday morning, no shipping label in my inbox.  Yet another call to Dell tech "support".  And the guy had the stones to ask for yet >another< 24 hours to get this label to me!  Attempts to get to a manager resulted in a disconnected call.  Call back, skip the peon, and asked for manager direct.  And the >>manager<< had the stones to ask for "just give me 4 hours".... we shall see.  9:31 am CST, still no mailing label.  Meanwhile, the no-battery streak is still sitting unshipped...  I'd give it 1 star at this point, and only grudgingly.*****************************Final Edit: At last, late Friday, the issue is to be resolved.  After speaking to a higher-level manager, Dell will be cross-shipping me a replacement Streak, and I'm to return mine within that shipping container (pre-printed label to be included inside).  This is an acceptable solution, but it should not have had to take so many phone calls, and a whole week to resolve.
