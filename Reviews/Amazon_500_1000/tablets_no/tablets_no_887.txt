I have the 16GB - Received as a gift September 2011. Didn't use it much until by Sony Viao Laptop got infected SINCE THEN have used THE HP TOUCH 30 hours a week for the last 10 months.Super easy to use - very intuitive - I spent 5 minutes reading the product over view and was good to go.things I learned:1. JUST TYPE function on the home page is like Google or Bing2. FUNCTIONS - Press the arrow at the bottom left - gives you 4 choices at the top screen:a. Apps -* Kindle app is pretty cool* Facebook app is not so cool* Adobe works great* Camera - several apps -tricky to use because  the camera lens and view screen both faces you* PHOTOS - awesome* Maps - not so great* email app for Yahoo - AWESOME* QuickOffice - terrific for Word docs* THOUSANDS OF OTHERSb. Downloads* HP CARE PACK* HP APP Catalog - not really my thing but super easy to do if it is yours* THOUSANDS OF OTHERSc. Favorites (I use this the most)* you use the 'arrow in the box icon' on the upper right to add* you can delete and move once added by pressing & holding any icon* press the blue 'DONE' in the upper right to make firm.* have as many as you want you use the scroll function to locate and use (sounds more complicated than it is).d. Settings* icon for updates - right now I am on HP-webOS 3.0.5* software manager* WIFI - use this the most - and it is THE BEST when linking to new wifi sites - SUPER EASY* Device Info - mostly use for reset - resets take a minute and I use on occasion when the devise seems to run wonkybattery lasts the 4+ hours, I charge at night when asleepAdd youu top 5 favorites to the bottom of the screen by dragging any iconHELP function- I used  the first 12 months and wish I had used it more as it was super helpful talking to a live person.Had to get creative only once when the charger usb cord stopped connecting - I used my Samsung phone charger USB cord and connected it to the HP TouchPad cylinder recharger and it works like a charm (you can also buy another HP cord, for $30 I think).When the Touchpad freezes: press the power and the open screen button at the same time and hold for a slow count of 20 - it will reset after a minute, the hp icon starts to come on in a minute and you are back to normal.Pictures - SUPER SIMPLE - touch the picture and you get 'copy to photos'; 'share image' (via email) ; 'set wallpaper'Pictures (viewing/auctioning/shareing) - go to Apps; Photos & Videos; select; you then see screen captures; profile pictures - wall papers; downloaded pictures; Miscellaneous pictures (which are like Downloaded pictures and I can't figure what the difference is); and if connected to Facebook any pictures you have there. To get rid of a picture you have a trash can in the lower right;Screencapture is way cool - to make a jpeg of what you are viewing: press the power and the open screen button at the same time and let go - you hear a camera clink and your screen gives a round flash - lol -When you have too many pictures or documents and you want to download/delete -use the use cord to link to a computer  - it's that easy!
