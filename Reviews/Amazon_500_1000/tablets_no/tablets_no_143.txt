EDITED Feb 2011***  This is a frustrating device, I did have hopes for it but after my daughter received an Ipod touch and I got an Iphone I see how flawed this is..They totally made this device useless as is and do not let you enjoy much at all.  They really limited you to only a few small things to enjoy, including a small amount of APS.It will not become a toy for our 3 year old, as he has fallen in love with his sister's Ipod touch.  but again we have hit a snag as it seems to say we have to space left but we have virtually nothing on the device-  It is CRAP.....*******I am a not very techie person, my hubby is a techie type.We also do not own any smartphonesDay one thoughts...Out of the box, it looks realy nice and was A comfortable size to hold.It started up and ran quickly.It was easy to navigate around the apps screen, and was easy to connect the Wi-Fi.Once I started playing around though I seemed to hit walls of limits right away.The "radio" that comes with it, deezer is useless IMO.I found once I started trying to go to websites I would freuently get errors.DOing a little research I discvered Downloading Skyfire to the device seemed to be a key to getting past these limits.I found out to DL the APK version to your computer first and then drag it into your Archos file while it is connected to the computer.Install it and VOILA the web is now open and ready to use. (my first day and I was enjoying the Vevo website featured on Skyfire).Skyfire lets you view websites in desktop OR mobile format.Hubby pointed out that too bad they did not make this a 3G item like my Kindle is.  That way you can surf the internet from anywhere not just YOUR Wi-FI spot, or trying to find hotspots.Before DL skyfire he was realy disappointed with the tablet as a truely mobile internet device.  It would only be good for DL your own music videos, ebooks, or apps, I was OK with it being good for that, but skyfire really gave it that extra enjoyment.I think it is worth the time to find help sites for the Archos 7 to help you get as much as you can out of this little device.I do find surfing the internet a little frustrating as what you would think is a "home" button on the top left brings you back to the multimeda page not an internet home page.This is also where the "cranky" touch screen can be a bit ummmmm irratating.Yes the touchscreen can be a bit "cranky", my first touchscreen device so I am still happy.My next goal is to figure out how to get some movies or shows on here for my 3 year old to watch while we are out and about..  That is something totally new for me.Update:Still trying to get mpeg 4 videos to play on my device.  I have spent days researching it and and have not had luck.My husband HATES this and finds it to be very frustrating.I am baffled that they seem to be taggina and marketing this item as a "Droid" tablet, but have taken away most droid access like the market place.This utterly confuses me, and it has render many useful applications for this item kind of useless.I know many people like this as an e-reader but I have a kindle and would not even want to think about using this as an e-reader comaperd to my kindle.The kindle's screen can be read anyplace you can read a real book with no glares or reflections, not true with this device.A few of the apps I have downloaded from the applib have not worked, like the .m4v videos.
