***ADDENDUM*** on 3.24.13Even though I use the tablet on a regular basis, I do regret being an early adopter and will not buy another Toshiba product after this first experience. In summary of owning this thing for the last year and a half, I purchased it for the hardware, but was disappointed by the software. After a 100 dollar price drop within a few months, that did sting a bit. I had it for about a year of OTA software updates that fixed the SOD, and also found out that the audio aux quality was poor due to software, not hardware. In closing, I DO NOT recommend that if you decide to purchase this ill fated product that you upgrade to 4.0.4 or Android ICS through Toshiba's OTA. It will boost overall performance and fix the audio aux problem, however the wifi browsing speed has slowed to a crawl and the "Sleep of Death" has returned. Also with this update they "lock the bootloader" which means that once the warranty expires and Toshiba no longer supports it (like they really ever did during the warranty period), you will not be able to root the device to extend its use by flashing further updated OS. I never though I would root myself, but ever since I OTA the ICS, I regret my decision.*********************************************************************************************************************************************************ADDENDUM*** on 7/18/11Just like another positive poster did, I am going to have to add a "CON" that will make my star rating a "3" if you look this up on multiple forums, you will find that after a brief period of time in sleep mode, you will not be able to wake it up unless you do a hard reset. This is very annoying. I plan on keeping my tablet for the reasons listed below and with hopes that a firmware update will fix the problem, BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE BUY THIS TABLET UNTIL THERE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I began searching for a tablet because the use of PDA's has now become long gone to the world of smart phones and tablets. The primary use of this tablet was to act as a PDA and install Epocrates, Medscape, etc to assist with school and clinical rotations, and got allot more than I bargained for.I own a Ipod, and cannot stand the exclusivity of it where it only will play AAC file formats and can only use I tunes to transfer files. I also use an Ipad at work, and the back of it, as sturdy as the metal is, is very slippery without a skin on it and the touch is less responsive than I would like. Also another downfall of apple is that there is no option for expansion.I have had my thrive for a week now and I love it, the possibilities of it's use are endless.The "wide screen" display allows me to watch movies the way they are intended. Also, when you rotate it vertically, you can use your thumbs to type on the keyboard, which is not so easy on the "square" tablets.With the right apps, it will play any movie and music file formats. I decided to expand the storage with a 64GB SDXC card, to which I now have a decent amount of my favorite music and movies on the tablet with some room to spare.With the HDMI, Full SD, and bluetooth capabilities, I am able to connect a keyboard, mouse, and watch it all on my HDTV. As soon as I plugged in the mousefrom my desktop, a cursor appeared immediately .Data transfer is easy, and does not require an "I tunes" program. SD, thumb drives, and every one of my external hard drives are recognized (those who do not know how to format to exfat on windows 7 need not apply.)The rubberized backing is comfortable and negates the need for additional accessories.The Honeycomb operating system is fast, and I love the multiple "desktops" in which I can organize school apps on one, entertainment on another, weather and news.....etc.The Wifi receiver works well, for I still use a basic five year old Belkin wireless router and the web surfing speed does not suffer a bit.The only cons I have found so far is when attempting to remove the back cover to access the battery, I feel like I am going to break the connectors every time I do it, and have no intention of buying a spare battery to switch back and forth, unless the first one dies.I have nothing to report concerning the battery life at this point, because I have not used it outside the house yet and usually keep it plugged in to save the battery.Is this tablet heavier and thicker than the others, yes but that does not bother me. The extra ports that the other tablets lack is more than worth the extra bulk. For those who disagree here is my solution: Either wrist and bicep curls, three sets of 15-20 three times a week, or hang from a chin up bar for as long as you can X 3 for three times a week.
