I hope my quest to look for a tablet that fits my requirements and not just become another toy that gathers dust ends with this product. First I bought the Blackberry Playbook and although the device is fantastic and is very responsive, fast browsing, bridge and teetering worked just fine, I realized any app that I was looking for my work related stuff was either no there or was under development. In my opinion the app market and the no support for native email are the major cons.I returned the playbook and then got the iPad 2 from Best Buy, again no complains with the product but lack of flash, as lot of my work require me to use flash site and too closed environment, make me realize that I don't want my tablet just for surfing, music & video but something that can extend my work from my regular laptop.I just received my ICONIA W500, thanks for Amazon's super fast shipping. I opened, plugged the power and ready to use. First impression, very sleek, the touch screen is working perfectly fine. The device is top heavy that's for sure but when you put it on a desk it stays put without any problem - on the lap it's difficult.I am in the process of removing the unwanted software's and will update my review again in few days. So far it's an excellent device (finger's crossed)Update (End Day 1)==================Most of the day I used the tablet attached to the keyboard I was little hesitant on the touchscreen keyboard, I used the entire evening undocked from the external keyboard and I must say its very neat. I am positive people who are used to iPad will not find the touchscreen smooth but I must say its good enough to get your work done and not bad enough to get you annoyed. Considering that windows by default is not designed for touch interface, the device performed excellent.Update (Day2)============One thing I missed is that the Dolby Sound, the clarity and fidelity is just fantastic. Its better than my Dell Latitude laptop. I had some trouble adding the - NetFlix to the windows Media server, because I found when watching in browser, there is lag. Make sure you use the Silverlight 3.0 for NetFlix to play from media server. I had to remove the Silverlight 4.0 and then install the ver 3.0. Still enjoying ...Update week1============I fully understood by some comments -"this device start performing after all updates and tweaking. After several updates I am noticing significant improvements in touch screen and ooverall performance. I watched yesterday the entire movie Iron man II, just one word fantastic. The sound effect and clarity for this size is just fantastic. I installed office 2010 only word and excel and didn't felt any difference in performance. Only when I am playindg videos (from broser) that I noticed cpu touching 99%. So far rating 4+. Why not 5? Limited space, currently have 14gb free.Month 1 Update==============Still enjoying my laptop tablet hybrid - I noticed keeping the windows update in automatic mode was filling up my space few MB every few days, had to turn off to manual mode. The only complain I have so far is the space constraint. Although I haven't purchase the SD card, I feel you really have to be very selective in what you want to install. I have removed nearly all the extra junk, and installed only the software's that I absolutely need, I am running with just about 12 GB of free space.
