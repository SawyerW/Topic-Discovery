I'm writing this review from my touchpad. Surprising since I went from believing tablets were devices without a use, to reading the negative reviews of the touchpad to trying a device at Best buy, then ordering one with overnight delivery. The touchpad because of superb multitasking and a complete web browsing experience (I'm looking at you iOS) is close to replacing my laptop. General impressions are that it's solidly built but unfortunately glossy. Screen is superb as is the resizeable keyboard with 1st in class number row. Setup was easy and didn't require connection to a pc, just a wireless connection to the internet. Also because I'm a pre-existing webOS user, all my contacts, memos and apps were automatically downloaded to my device.LikesDesktop like multitasking-Applications once opened run until you end them by flicking it off the screen. Unlike iOS or windowsphone os it won't freeze in the background till you return to it. Apps, web pages continue to load no matter what else you're doing with the deviceDesktop like web browsing-flash is not only used for youtube as the reviewers would have you believe, it's also about interacting with the web as it was designed to be. How about going to your bank's website and actually being able to log in rather than having 'an app for that' or browsing to hulu.com, espn3, etc and watching content immediately?Free 50 Gb box.net storage-tremendous value, plebians pay $20/mo for this while touchpad users receive it free for life. Two years of use and the device pays for itself. Apple doesn't offer this now and when it will, only 5 Gb with various restrictions.Email client- superbFacebook app-superbBluetooth integration with palm pre plus-serious cool factor answering and rejecting calls and listening to voicemail on the touchpad. Even impressed ipad owners.Just type-search on steroidsSynergy-even better now with SkypeKeyboard-best in class only tablet with numbers row and adjustable keyboard sizeBeats audio-tremendous sound through speakers and headphones, hands down better than any pc or portable device audio you've ever heardFlash-much improved after update, streaming HD video from Amazon, HBOGo et al is sweet without an appDislikes  Intermittent pauses and lags-inexcusable with top in class processor, when iOS is buttery smooth. Hopefully fixed with updates shortly. Update 8/4/11: After 1st wk of use, pauses and lags were almost nonexistent. After the update, performance is excellent and no longer an issueLack of SD card slot-how am I supposed to get my DSLR pictures into my tablet, HP?Lack of document editing-update:Google docs is a workaround till quickoffice is updatedLack of video out-should have hdmi out, how are business users supposed to show their presentations?Relative lack of apps-web browser will give you a lot of functionality but still inexcusable not to include a calc, task or alarm app. Update: calc and alarms have been added with update. Kindle app is now active and HP movie store has been added to app catalogSkype- update :video has improved and calling land lines is flawless, has saved me $$ on international callsGlossy finish is fingerprint magnet-update:fixed by excellent HP caseExpensive accessoriesOverall I'm enjoying my touchpad tremendously. Is it the device for you? Hard to say as tablets IMO are still luxury devices but if you're going to partake I'd recommend giving the touchpad a try.Update: after several weeks of use this device is truly incredible, HP has shown commitment by correcting the early flaws in a timely manner. I rarely use my laptop/desktop anymore at home so as of today I'm increasing my rating to 5*.
