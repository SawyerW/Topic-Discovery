I have done quite a lot of research in to purchasing my first tablet. The minimum requirements I sought after have all been fulfilled by this version of the Coby line including:- 7" Capacitive Touchscreen- Android 2.3 or greater- 4GB of internal memory or greater- Available MicroSD card upgrade to at least 16GB (32GB available)- Fast processor (Cortex A8 1GHz single core)- Good battery life (4.5 hours video)- Less than or equal to $175 (Paid $170).At this point I have no problems in stating that this is likely the best starter tablet out there considering price per quality ratio.The device is responsive and stable. It feels solid and looks attractive, must say I prefer the black to the older grey around the front edges.The downfalls or should I say cost cutting areas so as to provide such an affordable yet good quality device are:- Resolution of the screen is only 800x480. This is probably the biggest downfall for me but not vital. The screen still looks good but not as crisp as other tablets with higher resolutions.- Single 0.3MP Camera in the front. While it would be nice to take pictures with a tablet I personally think it would be unorthodox and mostly unused. The front camera should be a little better because portable video calls are a benefit to tablets over laptops, but again good enough considering the price.- Speakers aren't exactly surround sound quality. The volume level is a little on the low side but from what I've read it is an upgrade to the predecessor the Kyros 7022...it is acceptable but I'm nitpicking.- No resident Android Market. As others have said this is of little importance because you can install it manually. Also I have tried out GetJar which is limited but not the worst out there.//UPDATE...I successfully installed Android Market, however some applications will not be able to download (ex Juice Defender & Olive Office)due to an incompatibility error while most will. The only way to get around the error that I have seen is to root the device and use an app to reduce the screen's aspect ratio. There is a new video on YouTube explaining the process for those who are interested.//- No Bluetooth. It would be nice in the event I wanted to attach a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to avoid having to use the one MiniUSB port. The upside though is one less component consuming battery life.As you can see the "cons", with the exception to the resolution which may be more important to others than to me, are quite minor and definitely under weigh what you are getting for $170.If anything changes over the coming months of usage I will update this review but as at now 4 out of 5.__________________________________A quick note about the Kindle Fire__________________________________The Fire was probably the next in line when comparing price/quality. However two very important factors made me shy away from it.1. It does not support expandable memory. This is self explanatory and is in direct relation to...2. You are forced to use the Amazon Cloud. I have contacted Amazon about this during my research when comparing devices. As an International I cannot access Movies/TV, Music with the Amazon Cloud and even the Ebook selection is much more limited. Not certain about the Applications but is likely also affected. This is very important for people in my position to understand and I think Amazon should take steps in making this information more visible for lack of a better way in putting it. I'm certain people have purchased the Fire without realizing this.The Fire is based around users accessing the Amazon Cloud for virtually everything, so to not have that access is a serious constraint.
