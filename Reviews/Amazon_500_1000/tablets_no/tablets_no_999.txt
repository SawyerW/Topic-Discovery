I got my Prime right before Christmas so I had the holiday weekend to play with it. I returned it two days ago for an iPad 2. It was a tough decision because the Prime has many sexy features but in the end I found it too frustrating and complicated whereas the ipad, while not as sexy, is easy and intuitive.First the bad...The Prime suffers from some key problemsBattery life - All the reviews talked about how great the Prime's battery life was expected to be. I got 5 hours to a charge on the normal setting with the brightness turned all the way down (I did not use the balanced or power save mode because what is the point of having 4 cores if you don't use them?). I downloaded an app to conserve my battery life when the screen was locked (something was draining my battery all the way to dead during the night) but it would turn off wi-fi when the screen was off but would not turn it back on when the screen was turned on despite the fact that I had it set to do so.Wi-fi - my Prime would consistently lose wifi signal requiring me to reboot it (which takes about an entire minute to do)Size - the 10.1" screen is just too large to type on using just my thumbs (although there is a thumbs only keyboard that solves this and the swype keyboard can be resized and positioned in the corner of the screen)It also shows fingerprints WAY to much and would not turn on for me the second morning I owned it requiring me to reset it by putting a pin in the reset hole.Google's problems...While not ASUS' fault necessarily, I must mention Android's faults as the two go hand-in-hand.App store - I had trouble finding good apps using common term searches (e.g. "to-do list"). The only way I found that I could find the best apps was to perform a google search and then find the name of the app and search for it in the marketplace.Unresponsive apps - force closing and freezing apps is never a good sign.Lack of tablet apps - I had trouble finding good apps designed for tablets. I also was shocked when many of my favorite apps that I enjoy on my iphone did not have an Android version or the Android version lacked the features that I use and enjoy.Many of the Android apps lack the refined style present in iphone and ipad apps which isn't critical to performance but more to aesthetics.I would be remiss if I ended without mentioning the good...The screen is AMAZINGLY clear and bright.The Prime is so thin it's scary.I LOVE the ability to have widgets (this was the hardest thing to give up for me).It is super light.It plays flash (although so many websites are built so they can be viewed on apple devices this is becoming less of a selling point).It's new and you are unlikely to run into another person who owns one :).
