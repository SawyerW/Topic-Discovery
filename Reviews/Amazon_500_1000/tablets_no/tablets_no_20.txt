I purchased this tablet as a holiday gift for my mom, who is a senior and has no computer or internet skills, as a way to hopefully get her online and using the net for things that would make her life a bit easier.  I actually found this tablet much cheaper than here on sale for $149.00 from that grouping website if you know what I mean.  For that price, I couldn't resist getting this.  Yes I know it is last years model versus the 2013 version but since I am getting this for mom who won't stress this tablet out with any kind of high end applications or music or things that like, for the different in price from the 1 year old version and the new, it was worth it to me in savings.  Since I wanted to check this tablet out and get is setup before giving this as a gift to make it easier for her, I opened it and got things set up.  Initial setup was pretty easy and basic, with choosing the language and email and your Wi-Fi, pretty simple stuff for anyone with basic computer skills.  The most time consuming was the system updates, with the tablet coming with version 4.1 on board but having to be updated three times individually to get the latest android operating system that is currently available (Jelly Bean) I believe.  Not sure why you couldn't just update to the latest version without having to update incrementally.  That would have frustrated someone like my mom who wouldn't have had any idea how to do that.  but never the less once that is complete, the use of the tablet seems very simple and straightforward like most android style tablets.  For those like me, who are not necessarily looking for the latest and greatest to give as a gift, I will compare the new nexus (2013) versus this model (2012) version so you can decide for yourself whether the extra expense is worth getting versus this model.This Nexus 7 had a three-piece layered design, boasting a textured backplate, grey plastic middle and Gorilla Glass front, the 2013 model has a single-piece smooth chassis that wraps around its glass front which for some may make you feel that the 2013 feels a bit more high end.  The 2013 Nexus is a bit slimmer and weighs a bit less than this version although in my opinion, not significantly so.When it comes to software the 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7s are all but identical, with upgrades to the latest 4.3 Jelly Bean version of Android available for both.  Now whether the 2012 version will continue to receive updates that remains to be seen, of course you could also say that next year with the 2013 version.  Like all electronics these days, no matter what version you get, you are almost always out of the loop within a couple years.  But for now, to get the same operating system for a cheaper price, this is the better deal.This Nexus 7  1280x800 HD, 216ppi display is decent but the 2013 Nexus 7, has a 7in 1920x1200 1080p HD 323ppi display which definitely means the new version has a brighter crisper display versus the 2012 nexus.  A definite advantage to the new Nexus but you do pay for that in cost.The 2012 Nexus 7 is fairly powerful, with a quad-core Tegra 3 processor and with this model having 32 gb of storage space.The new 2013 Nexus 7 has a quad-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor.  Although the new version is a bit speedier, for someone like my mom, who will do basic internet surfing and not be playing any heavy duty games, there will be little difference in performance and both tablets will do well.  If you are getting this for a gamer, then the 2013 version would do better for that.The 2012 Nexus 7 only has a 1.2MP front camera designed purely for video calling versus the 2013 Nexus 7 that has a 5MP rear and 1.2MP front camera.  Considering I have a hard time getting my mom to use the digital camera I bought her a couple years ago, the camera difference is not of great importance to me.  I personally would prefer a regular quality digital camera over using a tablet or phone anyways for that purpose.The  2013 Nexus 7 has a smaller battery at 3950mAh versus the 2012 Nexus 7  with a 4325mAh battery.  Granted the power management is better on the 2013 Nexus 7 model but  the 2012 model does a decent job at lasting an adequate amount of time.This  2012 Nexus 7 comes with 32GB version and you can get an comparable 2013 model with a similar amount of space but aside from the difference price per gigabyte is a better deal with the 2012 version.Granted the 2013 version is an improvement overall from this 2012 version but this 2012 tablet is a good tablet overall and should serve the purpose for what I am getting it for, which is a senior who has little internet and computer experience.  If you find the deal, like I did at 149 then this is worth getting for someone like my mom as they don't need the latest and greatest.  My biggest challenge with this tablet is not the specs but is teaching my mom how to use it and getting her to use it so that she doesn't get frustrated and make it a coaster for her coffee.  Wish me luck.  :-)
