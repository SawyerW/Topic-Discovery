With fine art and industrial design as background, needless to say I've taken a picture or two begun decades ago in the analog world in which no small amount of cash went into camera equipment. Having had a decade or more laps before deciding to look through a lens again, it was obvious spending a large amount on equipment would not be a wise choice (digital equipment this time). I'm more than pleased with the Canon PowerShot SX20IS. It's an incredibly capable camera. It replaces an analog professional body Minolta plus two zoom lenses (28mm to 300). Comparatively the SX20IS added 200mm (total 500 optical zoom) with good image quality likely aided by its image stabilization; allowing hand held telephoto shots at photo speeds impossible with analog. That's impressive at less than a quarter the size and weight of the Minolta plus lenses. The result is it travels when the analog gear would have stayed home. After approximately nine months of ownership it has begun to sink in there are enormous advantages to a capable digital camera combined with a change in field approach vs. analog. The impressive analytical software of the SX20IS encourages your photographic eye by automatically replacing the extensive technical analog camera-information needed to attempt to make photographs appear the way you see the scene. The only down side has been learning the new lingo AKA software based controls instead of analog buttons, dials etc; wish it had fine incremental zoom control. It's not a professional camera, but its capability combined with software frees you to just seeing what's begging to be photographed. If it fits your hand grasp reasonably and you're willing to discover its abilities, you should enjoy this camera. (The SX10IS won't discourage you point and shooters either.)Side notes 7/2010: SX20IS (and SX10IS) do not have treaded lens rings to fit lens filters (hard to figure).

(It is definitely faster to have the Polarizer filter already attached to a second Lensmate adapter.)(There is a blog comment about the weight of a lens filter and the lens zoom drive-mechanism. (Opinion) it wouldn't say much for Canon engineering quality if the miniscule weight of a filter turned out to be too much, long term, for the drive system on this camera.

The Vanguard monopod is solid as a rock, extremely fast to extend and contract and is light weight enough with an added Vanguard ballhead (total combined cost $212.70), it often goes where the camera goes; extending dim light (i.e. under heavy foliage) photography options significantly. The SBH-300 ballhead is serious quality; the SBH-100 is likely the same.

Thought of another way; it's approximately the same cost as a Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm alone; no zoom from 55mm to 500, filters, optics protection or monopod; and may more pictures taken because the gear goes with you and photographic options have increased.
