This is going to be more like a story than a product review, but maybe it will be helpful to others who were looking for the same features I was.First of all, I wasn't in the market for a camera at all: I have a Casio EX-Z750 that, frankly, is still nearly unbeatable in its class (subcompact P&S;). I happened to be browsing a recent B&H; catalog and noticed the Olympus E-P2 - very attractive retro look! Started reading up on it (especially the outstanding information on [...]) and decided I had to see one of these in the flesh. Found one at a local store, and while it's gorgeous, it's nowhere near as compact as I imagined from the catalog photo. And it has no viewfinder (Casio does) and no flash! But it has a large image sensor and apparently amazing image quality. So I got to thinking: what else is out there that can do better than my beautiful little Casio? I've always lamented its lack of RAW images, and eventually it will break, but pretty much everything about it is incredible. So my research turned up these cameras (data largely gathered from [...], with additional info from manufacturers' websites):Camera || Sensor size || Aperture || Focal length || FlashCanon PS S90 || .43 cm2 || f/2.0 || 28-105mm || YesOlympus E-P2 || 2.43 cm2 || f/2.8* || 17mm* || NoPanasonic LX3 || .45 cm2 || f/2.0 || 24-60mm || YesSigma DP2 || 2.85 cm2 || f/2.8 || 24mm || Yes* The Olympus camera has interchangeable lens; the 17mm F/2.8 was the fastest "normal" lens that fits my needs.The Panasonic's lens is a Leica that's very highly regarded.The Canon S90 is, by far, the most compact of the cameras in this group. The Olympus could never be considered a pocket camera. The Panasonic is somewhat larger than the Canon, though perhaps still "pocketable". The Sigma is really too large for a pocket, though quite a bit more compact than the Olympus.All of these cameras have RAW mode. None of them has an integral viewfinder (not many subcompact P&S; cameras do, anymore, but I still like them for when the sun is shining directly on the LCD).I ruminated about all of this for quite a while before settling on the Canon. Its lens is excellent, the image sensor is the .43cm2 size (1/1.7") of the best-in-class subcompact P&S; cameras, and it has RAW image mode. The other cameras were all larger - enough to be the deciding factor for me. But I really do like the idea of the very large sensor - eventually someone will offer a camera closer to my wishes, but there isn't one around at the present time.Concerning the camera itself: there's little need to repeat what's already been said very well by others. I've compared the JPEG images to my Casio (which is probably the best I've seen on any camera for color balance, saturation, etc.) and they're just as good. I haven't seen a P&S; that does better. But having RAW image recording opens up a world of processing that's not possible with the Casio. There's some barrel distortion, but it's no worse than on any other camera with a similar lens (and marginally better than the Casio, which can be fairly annoying). And, for the desperate, this can be corrected with PhotoShop and other software.My only real complaints have been voiced numerous times by others: the rear control dial looseness and the flash location.The control dial on the rear of the camera is outrageously loose. It's virtually impossible to use the camera in any mode but fully automatic without inadvertantly changing whatever setting the dial controls for the chosen mode (the dial does nothing in full automatic). In fact, the entire control assembly of which it's a part is so poorly designed as to be an utter anomaly in Canon cameras. How on earth could they not notice such a shortcoming before releasing the product? Nevertheless, I knew about this and had even tried the camera in a store, and it still didn't deter me from buying it. But it will be a constant nuisance. No doubt Canon will eventually get around to addressing this, but as it can't be fixed by a firmware update, those of us who bought this camera are stuck with it.Second, the location of the pop-up flash is absurd: it's at the top left front corner of the camera, exactly where my left index finger is all the time! I've had the camera for exactly two days, and I can't count the number of times that the damn thing decided  to pop up (since it's usually preferable to leave the flash in automatic than turned off all the time) and promptly retract after bumping into my finger, with the resulting "restart camera" error message. I hope that this doesn't eventually cause the flash mechanism to self-destruct, and, with luck, I may get used to holding the camera differently, but even though I knew about this before buying, it is unexpectedly annoying. Given the size and layout of the camera, it's not an unreasonable location for the flash, but still ...So it's not quite the perfect pocket camera, but for me, it's the best currently available. I really miss a viewfinder, and that control dial and flash are a royal pain. But I finally got my RAW mode on a very compact camera with a good, fast lens and a larger image sensor. So I'll carry both the Casio and the Canon for a while until I decide which one will become the spare. I suspect the Casio might end up in a drawer - unless that dial on the S90 finally drives me crazy.UPDATE 5/24/10After less than 2 weeks, the front control ring stopped working. A search on the internet turned up nothing on this, so it apparently isn't common. Returned for replacement (as advised by Canon tech support). Oh well.
