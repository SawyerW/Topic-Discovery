Straight up! Wasted "HUNDREDS" of dollars on fancy IP cameras, cctv cameras, ect that either wasn't compatible with computer system or my Android phone, until I walked into Harbor Freight Tools (BALTIMORE).So after many trails and errors I reluctantly purchased a Bunker Hill 4 channel/4infrared cameras & digital video recorder Model 67139 and that was 3yrs ago, and still running smooth.. The newer Model 68332 is upgraded but similar to it's older model 67139 NO PROBLEMS TODAY.. ZERO! My pictures are always 100% sharp during the day, almost in HD color. At night cameras illuminate front & rear yard up to about 10' to 15' enough to ID someone at that range but still have enough visibility to notice a prowler approaching in the dark two blocks away in black and white on my 60" flat screen. I have manipulated the weak LED bulbs in my cameras by purchasing a "IR ILLUMINATOR" from AMAZON. They come in many sizes depending on the amount of area you want to cover with a powerful infrared lighting. YouTube carries a very good demo of a "SL1080-HIGH POWER INTELLIGENT IR ILLUMINATOR". It is very illuminating in pitch darkness up to 300 meters and has a 60degree wide span of coverage or you can surf Amazon inventory and decide what suits you. Just be sure to check owners manual on camera "WAVE LENGHT & VISIBILITY" or call Bunker Hill 1-888-866-5797 and find out what IR ILLUMINATOR is best for you. Your going to have to purchase either a 850nm (NANO METER) or 950nm (NANO METER), one of the difference is the 850nm offers a slight reddish glow at night from its LED bulbs that can be seen... But the 950nm offers total invisibility and CAN'T BE SEEN by the naked eye for stealth, secrecy, or detecting unit at night...  I have the "Invisible IR-200-940 CMVISION 940nm WAVELENGHT 198 IRLED NIGHT INDOOR/OUTDOOR LONG RANGE 50-300ft LED ILLUMINATOR w/FREE 5A 12V POWER ADAPTOR (from Amazon)$79.95 come with automatic low light on & off..it's like DAY LIGHT AT NIGHT but unseen to any intruder... I've since purchase another DVR KIT one for my  backyard and have caught undesirables trying to break in my garage, tool shed, urinating,ect..because either they didn't realize the small black cameras were monitoring them or thought it was just to dark to be caught!  (CONS)  Remote works but sometimes you have to press buttons repeatedly to get working so I use buttons on DVR to pause, fast forward ect, works 100% better. Cameras are weather proof but sometimes moisture and condensation can build up inside housing lens obscuring video.. I solved problem permanently by purchasing a tube of "SEAL ALL SILICONE" at HOME DEPOT $5.BUCKS and with the tip of my finger spread silicone just enough among each seam and crevices on each camera to keep out any rain moisture. Not all cameras have moisture issues but I added extra silicone to protect  all my cameras in case there is a possibility of any rain water seeping in... The camera arm is very flexible when positioning cameras but does at times become to loose making camera its self to flop around loosing its original position.. Issue can be solved by first positioning camera into its desired position, then placing gorilla tape on camera housing,then to exterior wall or it's screw base temporarily to keep from moving out of place once positioned, then apply "Seal All silicone" to arm joints liberally and let sit for 5hrs or over night... Will hold through heat and cold, just don't get silicone on lens glass... Going to buy a 3rd BUNKER HILL DVR KIT soon, just wish BUNKER HILL made a 8 or 16 channel DVR KIT...IF YOU FIND SOMETHING BETTER AT $260 minus 20% STORE COUPON GRAB IT.. AVERAGE JOE
