I'm updating my initial review from March. I've been using this camera for 10 months now and I really have begun to hate it. I regret purchasing it and I'm considering selling it. I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and thought I was making a good decision but not anymore. So far any attempts at using the "features" of the camera have caused more problems then they're worth.  I've lost many pictures from my vacations and events due to file error which I don't realize until hours later when I decide to view the pictures I've taken.  These file errors usually happen when I try to use any of the features aside from the standard point and shoot. The camera is terrible at night shots. The flash is not strong enough and when you try to use the night/low light feature the picture doesn't even come out at all. The hook feature of taking a picture of yourself by using the view finder on the front of the camera to frame your shot doesn't work correctly and after many attempts at trying to get it right I've just given up. It's also been having problems freezing up on the screen after you take a picture and the front view finders stays stuck on even when you have turned it off.  Save your money and purchase one of the more reliable cameras - you'll be glad you did!*****************************************************I bought this camera mainly because I wanted the "hook" feature which is to take pictures of yourself by using the viewfinder on the front of the camera. I have to say that I'm not really crazy about the feature now that I have the camera.  Maybe I just need more practice to get it right but I found that the pictures I take that way are not right in terms of where you look into the camera to take the picture and the focus of the people in the picture. What I found though after using it was that I really like the camera overall. It's got some cool features and is very easy to use.  Some cons are: the price - it's definitely more expensive than many small point and shoot cameras out there and I'm sure that has more to do with that cool hook feature than anything else. It's a fingerprint magnet due to it's shiny surface. I really do miss having a view finder to look into in order to frame my shot vs. just the large viewer screen especially on sunny days because you have no idea what you're taking pictures of when there is a glare on the screen. The cord to charge it and download pictures to your computer is VERY short. Not sure why it's so short but it can be a huge problem if you're not close to the outlet you're plugging it into. If I plug it into the wall the camera will barely touch the floor. It's really THAT short. I thought the micro memory card would be a problem but it really hasn't been, mostly because instead of taking the card out to transfer pictures to your computer you actually just use the USB to connect to your computer for downloading. I wish it came with a full owners manual instead of having to download the pdf manual. I'm sure there are many features I haven't used yet just because I don't have that manual as a reference guide.  All in all it's a great little camera and it takes really good pictures. It's very slim and small and holds a battery charge for a fairly long time. Not sure the hook feature is worth the extra money though.
