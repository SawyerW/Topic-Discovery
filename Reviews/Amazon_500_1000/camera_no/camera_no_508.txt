*****ETA:  I love this camera but I decided to just give it to my nephew instead; the more I experimented with it, I did not care for the USB plug-in to be located inside the battery compartment.  It's a fine camera otherwise.  Instead, I bought this one for myself - Fujifilm FinePix Z70 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)*****This was intended for a young relative of mine - since this camera has an optical zoom lens in the internal style, I thought it would be a safer camera for little ones to use, in case it is dropped.  More on that later!  And the whirl white color scheme is perfect for young kids.But after testing the camera to make sure it was ok prior to gifting it, I fell in love with the Z30 myself.  Now I'll have to go and buy another - I'm partial to Fuji cameras and I couldn't pass up the great price on this one. This is my 8th Fuji camera purchased since 2004, I love them.The Z30 is TINY - and the screen is big and bright - I have no trouble seeing anything on this LCD screen even outside in bright sunlight.  It's tiny and lightweight and easy to carry in either a pocket or small bag.And since the lens has a cover - and this is the way the camera is powered on/off - by sliding the lens cover open (like the first Fuji digital cameras) you almost don't need to buy a separate case....although I do keep mine in a case because I don't like the exterior to get scratched.A couple of complaints for an almost-perfect entry level camera:>>>  The USB port is located inside the battery compartment.  I don't know why they couldn't have designed it for the side of the camera like most others.  I'm afraid of opening flimsy battery compartments unless I absolutely have to.  Even if I want to use my SD card reader instead of transferring photos via the USB cord, I still have to open this compartment.>>>  There is no good location to grip the camera on the back of the camera.  The entire area is composed of LCD screen and buttons.  At least the back area of the camera is rubberized so it does help with the gripping.But the pro's way outnumber my complaints:>>>  Quick response when opening the lens cover to take the first shot>>>  Takes beautiful life-like color-saturated pictures>>>  Fast response time after taking a flash picture>>>  Takes good videos - better than my expensive Panasonic Lumix>>>  Love the auction setting for grouping shots together in 1 frame>>>  SR Auto - there's no thinking, just point and shoot>>>  Lithium-ion battery - the charge lasts for weeksOne "pro" which I want to take the time to make stand out among the previous is I love that this camera enables you to choose standard color, saturated color, and even black & white photos.Choosing the saturated color setting (which is accessed through the Shooting Menu Options), produces almost the same effect as what Canon advertises as the "Poster Effect" on its new line of Canon A495 cameras  Canon PowerShot A495 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.3x Optical Zoom and 2.5-Inch LCD (Red).  You can make some really nice wall art by choosing this setting and tweaking it a bit with Picasa.Bottom Line: This Fuji is a good entry-level camera and I recommend it for just about anyone that is looking for an easy to use digital camera (even young children) AND it's built tougher than it appears.  Case in point:  Two days after I received this, I was sitting at my kitchen table when it slipped out of my hands and hit the floor (my condo is built on a slab).  I thought the camera was broken, but I turned it back on and it's none worse for the wear.  Not even a scratch.
