Overview:It's the best point-and-shoot in the less-than-$350 range I've ever used and I've used a lot of them including big names like Nikon, Canon, Sony, Panasonics, Olympus, etc.I know Samsung is not known for cameras and I too hesitated at first. But it has so many useful features and functions that you don't find in cameras in this price range. The keyword here is "useful". While a lot of cameras have many gimmicky features, those in this Sammy are actually something you want to use.The built quality is high. The controls are well placed. Menu is reasonably initiative. The photo quality is great.It's half the price of my last Panasonic but I am twice as happy with this Sammy - although I do like my Panny a lot.Pros:Schneider lens. For those who may not know, Schneider is a world famous optics maker best known for their large-format camera and enlarger lenses.Good optical zoom range. So, it's not a super zoom but to be honest you don't want a super zoom in a P&S.; It's very difficult to make a long zoom lens in a compact body. Most P&S; cameras with super zoom don't take good pictures in the long focal length zone. Besides, the max. in this Sammy is 432mm and how often you need more than this? I am glad that Sammy doesn't try to force a super zoom in this camera and degrade the overall lens quality.Has a BSI-COMS sensor which among other things takes great low-noise photos under low light (if you expose the shot right.)Only 12.5M Effective Pixel. Yes, I say "only" and it's a good thing. Pixel count is a number game cameras manufacturers use to sell cameras. For this size of sensor, you really don't want to over pack it with way too many pixels b/c it would increase noise. 12.5 MP is enough for most P&S; shooters - how many big posters are you going to print, right?Panorama mode that actually works very well. Real automatic sweep-and-stitch not just "stitch assist" like in some cameras. And it actually works great. I tested it on the street with moving cars and pedestrians and it captures everything nice and sharp w/o blurs. Haven't tried the Action Panoramic yet but it sounds very interesting.Custom controls. Most P&S; cameras don't give you much of a choice for most of the functions and settings. This Sammy gives you many choices for many of its functions and settings making it more like an more expensive bridge camera than a P&S.; I will list some of them below:****Flash Output control. Most P&S; only has options to turn the flash on, off or auto. This Sammy also let you change the amount of the flash to fine tune your shots.****White balance. Besides the many presets, you can do a custom WB yourself or "dial in" a specific color temp.****"Selection" AF. In this mode, you can move the focus area to a specific spot.****Full Manual Exposure Control. Not many P&S; cameras at this price have this.Miscellaneous.****Smart Filter and Magic Frame. Gimmicky and not really important but they are fun to play with. You can apply them either before or after taking the shots.****Simulate 3D. Not true 3D but it's kind of fun.****Take still shots during video shoots.****Can turn audio recording on or off while zooming in Video mode.****Stereo audio.Cons / Annoyance:Short charger cord. Really, the USB charging cord is way too short. I have to use an extension cord all the time.No stand-alone battery charger. They don't sell one nor does it come with one that you simply put the battery in the charger and plug the charger in the wall socket. The one that comes with the camera charges the battery when it is in the camera. They do sell one that charges the battery outside of the camera but you plug that in a computer via USB instead of a wall socket. This is just stupid. Fortunately, you can buy an after-market charger for about $20.No Orientation Sensor. So photos taken in portrait orientation will not display vertically. You can rotate it in View Mode and it saves the rotation. The operation should be lossless but I am not 100% sure. Besides, it is very annoying to have to do it one by one in the camera. I use software to do that in batch.Flash delay. Some reviewers report that the flash delays a lot. I find that while it is true for the first flash shot (up to 3 seconds), it fires immediately in subsequent shots. There is also a delay when the battery is running low but that is to be expected.No GPS. It's not a con for me but it may be for you.Conclusion:That's it folk. I think the WB750 is a great camera for the price. Actually, I think it is better than a lot of cameras twice as expensive.
