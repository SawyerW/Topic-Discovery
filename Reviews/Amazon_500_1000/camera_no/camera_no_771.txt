THe following review is copied from a review i did for canon SX230 that included Sony DSC7, one more thing to add, the video quality on Sony  DSC-HX7v is superior to the canon.-----This review compared to my Noby experience with camerasI Owned before this canon the followingPanasonic TZ3Sony DSC7I had this canon for 3 days now, took 300 pictures, I'm not a professional nor hobbyist, just a father trying to find a good indoor camera for kids.Panasonic TZ3 owned for 3 years had a great stabilizer system which can prevent the had movement very well but had very very bad indoor photos and low light picturesthe Sony DSC7, pictures looked very well and nice on the Camera's 3.0 LCD, bright and crisp, but viewing these photos on computer looked bad, pictures look kinda washed out or cant put on word, may be had noise or looked like paint. even applying some editing to them didn't add anything. so I returned the sony and got the canon SX230HSCanon 230HS PROyou need or must have a good understanding of basic photography, Understand ISO and other simple settings.the camera took very well indoor shots, very nice a crisp without a flash, afternoon indoor photos without a flash looked way better than the same photos with a flash, the flash will bright the subject and darken the background. taking photos without a flash beats any point and shoot camera I used above.AUTO MODE, AUTO MODE, AUTO Mode, sucks, didnt do anything special, photos looked kinda grany with good noise.I used P mode, Scn mode, and Kids/pets mode and all did very well, I used Mostly P and kids/pets modes on most of my shots.Stabilizer system could have been better, some images came out blurry, my old Panasonic TZ3 had a better stabilizer than canon SX230HS. which make taking zoomed images harder, way harder.Some people recommended Panasonic LX5, I never tried it before and seems its almost $100 more and has more manual control.I'm still learning on this camera, I'm a big Canon Fan and buy anything Canon, as my experience with sony, Sony like to put Bling Bling on their cameras which make photos and images looks nice when you view them from the 3.0 LCD.I would Love to have the new Canon DSLR next to Canon SX230HS.as I said, i'm still learning on taking pictures, i will be taking more this week and post some them.If you are welling to pay more for point and shoot, take a feel and a look at Panasonic LX5 and Canon S95. these three camera I believe are the best in the market, buy one for a week use and return then get the another, view the pictures on your computer and have them printed out to compare image quality, dont just go by only viewing them on the camera's lcd or only your computer.this Camera and S95 as well as LX5 are all over priced, SX230HS should not be more than $250, same as any brand point and shoot cameras.
