Re-posting comments since I originally sent this for the FH27, a similar modelReplaces old Fuji Finepix which took excellent pictures. Experience so far suggests Panasonic Lumix was an excellent choice (reviewed many other brands but none matched the reviews for Panasonic Lumix models -- both the FH25 and SZ1 are great products)Pro's:Easy to operate; did not need to use instructionsControls are very intuitive and "finger-friendly", no fumbling for buttons, etc; great layout enables you to get on with taking pictures rather than figuring out where controls areAbility to turn flash on/off with a press of a button is much appreciated, nice touchLove the large LCD screen (a bonus after the old small LCD of my Fujipix); do not miss the viewfinderMultiple functions that you actually use (eg, "sunset" setting really works!) because they are accessible and well described on the camera LCD screenSuper clear, sharp, true color outdoor photos; indoor photos best with flash depending on light (probably could be better using available settings -- yet to test)Stunning hi quality videoLong battery life, fast charge (bought generic for spare)Camera size -- not too small, not too bigSimple connectivity for foto transfer -- just connected to computer, followed instructions on LCD and voila! Did not need supplied softwareCons:None worth mentioning -- 16 megapixels is overkill, thoughSummary: A great little camera that does more than the price suggests. This model offers more than the SZ1, although both are now priced the same. I like convenience of the separate battery charger that enables use of the camera while charging spare battery on the FH25 (SZ1 needs to be connected to charge -- worth buying the charger, it's the same unit as for the FH25).Just as important, I've had a lot of fun using this camera!UPDATE: after taking a few thousand pictures in a wide range of conditions:- this camera does not take indoor shots well, especially at night;- I prefer to set ISO at 100 to obtain crisp pictures -- high ISO readings, which come up if you use iA settings at night outdoors are very grainy and disappointing- outdoor daylight pictures are excellent and iA (with relevant scene settings) can be very effective (eg, sunset setting when shooting into the sun; action setting for movement)- I edit most fotos on the computer; nearly always have to increase brightness and contrast to obtain crisp picture- that 16 mega pixel is overkill - I get grainier pics and never use this setting (3M or 5M is more than adequate)- colour balance is not quite up to my old Fujifilm finepix 2800 (brilliant sharp color fotos!) -- fair to say it did have a larger lens though- never thought I'd appreciate the wide angle lens as much until I compared with my older standard camera- takes terrific burst pics (daylight)- super video so long as you are not pointing toward the sun over water- battery life better than expectedOVERALL: I expected a little better colour balance and flexibility in dark/indoor lighting; outdoor night shots are very lmited unless closeup with manual ISO 100 setting; however, this camera has been used extensively and never missed a beat (always carry a charged spare battery). Very convenient "pocket" camera for the price, fun to operate, and likely to get a ton of use!
