Digital camera-wise, I started with a Fuji S304 seven years ago after a couple years with a DSL camera Canon 50E. In 2005 I moved ahead with a DSLR, Fuji S2 Pro, probably because of good exprience with the Fuji colors(espeically skin tone). Since then, a number of DSLRs obtained from ebay have came and went, including Canon D30, Rebel XT, Nikon D100, D1H, D50, D40, D80, D300...You know, the gear fever for most photogs.My purchase of a Fuji F40fd is actually an upgrade from a F20 I got a year ago. I use them as a backup that always stay in my pocket, coming handy when I see an interesting scene in the streets, but not so big a deal to take out my DSLR in my backpack. But thank goodness, it's these "backup" little cams that helped me record most of the candit street shots in the everything-can-happen New York City.You'll have a better idea what a Fuji F40fd performans if I compare it to other cameras I've used.Warning: Don't compare it to any DSLR, the small CCD can never be on par with its big brothers. A F40's ISO 400 is only close to a Nikon D40's iso1600. Also, don't expect much from a lens small like the pocket cameras', the worst DSLR lens (including Sigma's or Tamron's) is much better than a point-and-shoot's.Compared with its earlier version, F20, the F40 has advanced in everything but iso performance.1. thinner body. Now it really feels like a pocket cam, as the F20 is still a little bit too thick.2. Larger and better LCD. I don't want to talk about numbers, but the F40 has a larger LCD. And most importantly, the number of pixels is much more than the F20's, and the view angle is much wider. Result, no more low-definition picture like that on a F20, and you can chimp from all angles now.3. Faster response in starting, focusing and reviewing pictures. You just feel it's a lighter and swifter camera.4. At last, the cons. ISO performance is a full stop lower than F20. I tested them side by side with the same settings, and the F40 with more mega-pixels (which I hate, I don't need that many pixels crammed into such a small CCD) just showed more grains and noises. F40's iso 800 is close to F20's iso 1600. This is the biggest disppointment for me, because at first I was exited to see F40 be equipped with Auto ISO 800 and 1600 (F20 only has Auto iso limit on either 400 or 1600, missing the 800 step that I consider the best compromising spot between speed and picture quality)Anyway, though F40 is not as good as F20 in ISO, it's still better than many cameras of other brands, including Canon and Nikon. My friends' Canon SD870 and SD1000 show worse noises on high iso.Conclusion: good colors consistent of Fuji taste, relatively good iso, an affordable foolproof pocket camera for candit shots. But if you are serious with photography, try any entry-level DSLR of Canon, Nikon, Olympus or Sony, you'll see a difference wider than from heaven to earth.
