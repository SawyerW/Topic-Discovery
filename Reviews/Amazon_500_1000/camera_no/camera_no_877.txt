This Zmodo Surveillance System works well for my needs and is also a great deal at $200 and Prime shipping (at the time of this review). To be perfectly clear, this is not a high-end system with high definition cameras, but it isn't priced like a high-end system either. This is a budget system that exceeded my expectations for what you get and how well it works. Here are my observations:Our Use - We recently bought an old but very large building for my wife's business and needed a way to monitor the six exits and the retail shop space.Included:* Main Control Unit - this is a fairly small unit (smaller than most DVD players) that is has button access for most functions* 8-Cameras - these are also fairly small, good physical quality and include mounting hardware* USB Mouse - connects to Control Unit* Remote Control - gives access to all menu functions (batteries included)* Required Cables - 60' Video/Power cables* Power Supplies -  one for the Control Unit and two for the cameras (uses splitters to distribute the power between the cameras)* Instruction Manual* Software CD* Hard Drive Mounting Screws (Hard Drive not included)Features:+ Camera; IR Illumination for night vision+ User configurable Options; Privacy Zones (blackout areas in the display), Motion Zones (areas where motion triggers an alarm)+ Network Access; Can be viewed on local network using Internet Explorer (required allowing ActiveX and would not work with Firefox) and remotely via a DDNS service (often an extra expense for a reliable service)+ Alarm Notification; Audible alert and E-Mail capability+ Display Options; Includes a VGA monitor connection and BNC/video out for TV viewing (we use Q-See QSRCBN6 6 Pack RCA-BNC Connectors)+ Remote Control; Really makes it easy to quickly access featuresPros:+ Setup; Basic configuration is surprisingly easy+ Image Quality; Good enough for basic security needs in both bright and dark settings (but see "Cons" below)+ Value; Lots of cameras and features at a reasonable cost+ Options; Can be made to do everything we need it to doCons:- No Hard Drive; Can use external USB drive or add your own Hard Drive to add recording capabilities (we installed Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 16 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive - WD5000AAKX in less than ten minutes)- Washed Out Colors; Colors are somewhat muted, but can be individually adjusted in the controls to get the best possible picture for the lighting conditions- Night Vision; Limited range, less than 20'Hints/Notes:* With the Hard Drive installed, Alarmed Events can be recorded and searched on later* A 500GB Hard Drive can record 168 hours of video (according to the manual)* Placing a camera too close to a window will cause the IR to reflect and blind the camera when it shifts into night vision mode* Display can be set to show 1, 4, or 8 video feeds at a timeThis system covered my needs very well and provides a lot of advanced features that were unexpected in a budget system.Highly Recommended!CFH
