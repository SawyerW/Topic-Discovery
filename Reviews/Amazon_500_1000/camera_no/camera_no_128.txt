I've purchased and used the X10 XCAM II cameras for years without trouble in addition to installing and setting up wired security cameras & systems. The X10 cameras always worked great for me and I never had need for software while operating four X10 cameras in my home.X10 cameras do not require software to operate as they are switched on or off and are activated through house wiring with remote controls which link to receivers plugged into power outlets as designed or they can be powered on simply by plugging the AC adapter into a power outlet.Optional software was offered for X10 device home automation which was Windows PC compatible and the software was designed for total home automation to control a variety of X10 devices throughout a house or home but I personally never used or had need for software to operate X10 cameras.I used an X10 remote control for manual switching between four cameras installed in my home and also used X10 motion sensors for automated switching to watch my child and for home security and they worked great. I set the X10 cameras with separate addresses through a simple selection on the X10 power supply and set the frequency for best reception to match the receiver from the switch underneath the oval switch cover on the camera base which made it surprisingly simple to install and setup.The only potential problem is/was the same as when using any wireless camera system on the market which is competing for a clear signal in an increasingly crowded 2.4 MHz frequency or bandwidth as the X10 wireless cameras operate and transmit in the 2.4 MHz frequency as do many or most wireless cameras on the market.If you're looking for a professional security system with multiple cameras free from from potential interference and you have the ability to pull cables, a wired system may be best but more costly and wired systems are subject to interference or noise as well.Wired systems are typically designed to support 4 to 8 cameras or more and will also have software for viewing multiple camera images concurrently however X10 also provides the option of combining camera operation with motion sensors to switch X10 cameras on where and when motion is detected to avoid viewing or recording nothing of interest.If installing in a highly populated area, the chances of interference from a nearby or neighboring 2.4 MHz wireless phone or wireless network increases the potential for interference or reception problems however as indicated, wired camera cables pick up noise too.The X10 wireless camera system also offers the functionality or switches to select from a range of settings within the 2.4MHz frequency to avoid noise from competing signals.For best X10 wireless XCAM-II video quality, it is best to direct and position both camera and receiver antennas towards one another while also placing X10 wireless receiver as close to cameras as possible.Fundamentally, there are pros and cons between both wired and wireless cameras and selecting the best choice depends on your application, install site or location and objective.In contrast to many options including baby or baby room video systems or monitors, X10 cameras work quite well and are simple and easy to setup and install while also versatile in the ability to easily relocate cameras while further supporting the operation of multiple cameras without the complexity or trouble of running wires, cables or installing software.
