My company is primarily marketing, graphics and promotion; not a photo studio. But it's a significant, additional in-house service we provide. This met my particular needs for an upgrade from the F707...and, yes, I wrestled with the same issues people have mentioned here. So, this is a pretty detailed, often technical evaluation:ALL-IN-ONE VS. DSLR:*SLR mirror noise is intrusive in many of my shooting situations, i.e., arts events, rehearsals,*I don't need to carry the additional weight of extra lenses at live events,*Dealing with sensor dust could ruin my client's day.8MP NOISE:*Unavoidable with that many sensors on a 2/3" chip. I shoot ISO64-100, 200 if necessary. I can always clean it up with Noise Ninja if required. I'll take the extra detail.CHROMATIC ABERRATION (CA)/PURPLE FRINGING:*Unavoidable in digital cameras (that purple border around light sources such as bulbs, sun reflections). Pretty bad in this camera.*Solution: I post almost everything anyway. Photoshop CS fix with judicious use of the sponge tool is easy. Lots of solutions posted online.ALTERNATIVE CAMERAS?*Canon Powershot Pro1 was the only other competitor for me. But, had no live histogram, nonexistent low-light AF, and half the battery life of the F828. Nikon (8700) lens disappointing @ only 35mm equiv. wide, proprietary front filter mount. Olympus performance was dismal.*Sony R1 (10MP): MUCH bigger sensor/less noise. But, R1's 120mm zoom equivalent couldn't match the F828's 200mm (f2.8 vs. f2.0 wasn't an issue, considering sensitivity of different chips). R1 front filter is 67mm vs. 58mm on the F828, meaning fewer and/or more expensive accessory lens options for the R1 - except heavy, expensive proprietary Sony adapters. Disliked the top-mounted LCD on the R1.WHY THE F828 WORKS FOR ME:*Immaculate Zeiss lens,*Manual zoom,*Same (now) classic Sony swivel body for easy overhead/ground shots...solid, solid, solid,*Fast hologram AF,*Speed or framing (yes!) burst, bracket exp,*RGBe sensor solves the problem of overblown reds in previous models, excellent depth,*Expanded, though still easy, menu navigation/thumbwheel/joystick,*Both CFII media (I use 5GB) & Memory Stick (faster..I use ProDuo 2GB),*Compatable with standard 58mm thread accessories (filters, adapters, etc.),*Simplified single button delete on review or PB.And a note on Sony proprietary flash (i.e., the HVL-F32X):I use the Promaster DX5500 which may be the only other hotshoe mount that talks to the Sony. The advantage is x-axis rotation - which the Sony doesn't have - particularly useful in bounce flash situations.In short, the issue of whether this is a good product or not is moot.  Like "JohnBoy" Shultz (see below) would probably say, "It's a Sony!"It's a matter of whether it meets the user's needs. You're probably reading this because you're smart enough to research your puchases and evaluate a product based on your abilities and requirements. Despite a few shortcomings, I've found this an excellent "best of both worlds" choice.***************************************************************************March, 2011 Update:  Upgraded to a Nikon DSLR a year ago.  Regrettably, the Sony Alpha series didn't have the same bang for the buck.  And, even though only 8MP, the best endorsement I can possibly give over four years later is that I keep this gem as my backup camera.
