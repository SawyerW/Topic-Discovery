UPDATE JUNE 2012:I bought the 2-year Nikon Extended Warranty NIKON COOLPIX 2YR EXT WARRANTY back in July 2010 with my Coolpix S8000....I figured it's $2, I'll give it try. My S8000 started acting up with a mind of its own....so I had nothing to lose.I'm here to tell you it's TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! I was at 22 months with my S8000, sent it in for repair (to the factory) and they took care of everything! Covered new parts, labor, cleaning and return shipping (I had to pay shipping to get it there). Mailed it to them May 29, got it may June 11. I couldn't be happier!!Doesn't matter who the seller is, they just need proof you bought extended coverage and that it's within the covered range.ALSO, now that I have a couple years with this camera, still very happy, but I wish it had a "sports" mode to choose like their S3300 and other camera's I've owned.  Other than that, I still love this camera!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought the S8000 having had Olympus Stylus 740 and C50 Zoom camera's.  The Nikon LCD view finder is BY FAR BETTER to see in bright light conditions than the 740 and C50.  Yeah, it could be better, but it's night and day compared to Olympus.Nikon recommends a Class 6 or higher SD card for the S8000 for faster data writing (within the camera).  I bit the bullet with a Class 10 8GB SDHC by Sandisk ($50).  To torment myself, I compared my classless regular 2GB SD card to see how much slower the data writing process was.  With the camera at the highest setting (14M* 4320x3240) and outdoors, it took 1 picture every 3 seconds with either card. (For comparison, my 740 set at SHQ 3072x2304 took 1 picture every 11 seconds).  Then I tried recording in HD.  I'm not sure I can really see a difference using the fast and slow card!  Maybe I'm not under the right conditions to see a difference, but now I question biting a $50 bullet.  The 2GB card was a freebie from my local MicroCenter store.....would have been $6 purchased outright.  I discovered 1 minute of HD video = 62MB for a quicktime movie.  In my situation (basically shooting pictures), a slow card (less than Class 6) probably would have been fine.  Live and learn.Bought the "ZipKit" ($25 with shipping) to accessorize the camera....what a great deal!  The kit comes with a USB2.0 SD Card Reader that boosts transfer time.  100MB of pictures took 16 seconds with the USB on the camera, but using the USB Card reader it dropped to 7 seconds with a Class 10 SDHC card, and 8 seconds for a classless SD card.  The reader is the way to go. Obviously Nikon's recommendation for a Class 6+ SD card has nothing to do with getting pitures off of the camera.CASES: the Olympus 202066 Neoprene Case fits this camera better than the 740 it was designed for!  It's not tight and there's room for a couple extra batteries.  I read concerns for the Nikon hard shell case and held off.  Glad I did because I would get another 202066 if I ever wear out the Velcro.Overall I'm happy so far.  I'm wondering about battery life. With my 740, battery life was the weakest link. I was lucky if I got 3 hours (250 pics) per OEM battery (far less with non-OEM batteries).  For the S8000, I'll know in August...
