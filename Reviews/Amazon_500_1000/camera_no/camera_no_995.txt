Although I have been pondering going full frame for some time, I am postponing the switch out of concern for my pocketbook and because this 7D has been giving me lots of joy for the year I have had it.I shoot a lot; kids, parties, performance art with available light, sport etc. plus I am getting into home studio portrait and strobism with a pair of speedlights and this camera works beautifully and reliably.In a year I reached above 30 000 frames, nearly no video (I do stills).Side equipment I would recommend - I don't have tons of lenses and gear so I can't speak about everything there is out there but here is what I gathered around that camera that I really use all the time. I am very happy with what I can do with this stuff.LENSESAll three lenses are quite pricey and well-built and give gorgeous pictures that the 7D sensor captures with minute details.- I already had a 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM from a few years back. This lens remains one of my very favorite.- I bought the 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM with this 7D, also a full frame-capable lens with in mind a future upgrade to a full-frame body like the 5D-III.- I recently procured the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM, which is a crop-sensor only lens - it will not work on the 1D, 5D or 6D but I really wanted a wide-angle lens and this one is just beautiful.With these three I can do almost all I want.If I had known I would have bought the 7D body only and foregone the 18-135mm hich is ok but really not as enjoyable as the ones listed above.LIGHTAdd to that a Canon TTL flash or two such as- the 430EX II,- the 580EX II,- or the 600EX-RT (for a comparison based on spec sheet with the 580, see my review of the 580Ex-II)and you are all set.You will likely find that you want some more lighting equipment but this is beyond the scope of this review.SOFTWAREIt comes with a software bundle that covers all the bases but following the advice of a pro photographer friend of mine I still added Lightroom v.4.0, and I am very glad I did. I wish I had known of it earlier.The 7D is a great camera, very simple to use, yet provides a wealth of possibilities for technically inclined amateur like me.- Once I got used to its basic controls, I found that the camera does not get in the way of taking the picture. This to me is probably the most important, even before image quality.- The sensor gives beautiful, vibrant images - the color rendering is very close to what I see with my eyes, which is my criterion.- The sensor also features a native ISO range of up to 6400 and at ISO 3200 the pictures are really good.- Flash control is excellent - I frequently use the remote flash control from the camera with a 580Ex-II and a 430Ex-II together and the possibilities are staggering.- The JPEG you get directly from the camera are gorgeous. I rarely shoot raw due to the size of the resulting files except when doing landscape or portrait, and the dedicated button that switches to raw+JPEG for the next picture is very useful to me.There are many more good things to say about this camera but I would find myself re-writing the manual, which is informative, well written and well-worth reading from cover to cover.All in all a great camera, the best I ever had and one of the easiest to use.
