I received it a day ago and I am still playing with it. I will update my review as I learn more about it.As of now, I am giving it 4 stars. I had to take one star away for the cheap look and lack of clear information and directions on the website and the manual. The grammar in the manual is bad. Confusing, with too many typos. It is unfortunate that someone can make such a good device, but cannot write a good, clear manual. Other than that, It works pretty well. I have connected all the 8 cameras and spread them out on a bed. All of them are working. Picture quality is decent. It is not perfect, but more than enough for the purpose (security monitoring).Disappointment : It can't use an external HDD for recording. There was no information about this anywhere. May be it is assumed that everyone knows that external HDDs cannot be used for DVRs. But, I was hoping I could do that with this unit. Since, it doesn't recognize my external HDD and since there is no mention of it anywhere, I am concluding that it expects an SATA HD to be installed inside. No big deal, except for the extra expense.The Good: Connect the cameras, connect the mouse, connect a monitor through VGA and switch it on. It works. You can view all the 8 cameras on a 3x3 matrix on the monitor.The Bad: The interface looks cheap. The mouse feels cheap. I think, as companies struggle to cut corners, cheapness is something that we have to live with in the future, when it comes to equipment and appliances. Again, no big deal as long as I save some money and this thing doesn't die for a few years.Yet to try out: SATA HDD is on order. I haven't tried out the recording and motion sensing. I haven't tried out the web interface. I will post updates.I love it so far.Update (after 15 days):-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I still love it. I still have it spread around on the bed with the cameras pointing in all directions. I want to test it fully before mounting it in its place. All the functions work as they should be except for some quirks, mainly due to user-unfriendliness.Added a 2TB HD (Western Digital AV-GP WD20EURS). The device detected it fine and formatted it and ended with a loud continuous annoying beep. Not sure what the beep was for, but as annoying as it was, I had no option but to switch off the device. Anyway, the hard drive seems to be working after the restart.I was able to get it set up for recording on motion-detection. That was a challenge by itself. Out of the box, the device is set up with manual record on. I had to switch it off before the scheduled recording would take over. On scheduled recording, there are options such as "Record always", "Record on motion", "Record on alarm" or "Record on motion or alarm". Schedule can be set up at hourly level for a whole week. It is pretty neat.I got it connected to network. The network interface is nice. Better than the interface on the monitor (directly connected to the device). I can see that the ActiveX control is a bit heavy. I was able to install the ActiveX control and log in on local network, but from a corporate network I could not log in. I think there is some security stuff that the corporate firewall doesn't like. They should make this authentication a bit simpler.I have an e-mail alert set up now. You have to add a DNS server before e-mails can be sent (if your smtp server is a name, not IP address).Still to try : Mobile access; Durability etc.This is my project of the year. Still love it.Update after 40 days : Disappointed by camera angle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I am installing it in its final resting place and mounting the cameras. I have to say the cameras are a disappointment. I am ok with the clarity and color that many people have complained about. My major complaint is that it is very narrow-angle. If you are planning to mount it indoor, be aware that you are not going to be able to see much of the room. You need a bit more wider angled cameras for that purpose. Even outdoor, you are going to miss a huge area closer to the camera. For any serious surveillance, you will need wider angled cameras.
