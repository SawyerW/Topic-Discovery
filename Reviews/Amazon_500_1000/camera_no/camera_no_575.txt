This is an excellent value, especially if you already have a set of EF lenses, in which case it's a "no-brainer." 6.3MP means that 8x10's taken with this camera are indistinguishable from film when printed. The 10D was already a bargain, this camera is $600 less with 99% of the features. Don't let the plastic exterior fool you, the interior frame is all metal, and just as durable as the 10D.I've taken thousands of photos since getting this camera for Christmas, and it has done everything I've wanted it to do. As an old film SLR shooter, I'm happy to have an actual TTL viewfinder again. This has been my biggest gripe with digital cameras with "Electronic View Finders"--having to deal with parallax, poor viewfinder image (manual focus becomes a guessing game), slow shutter response, etc. Have all kept me away from digital cameras.  All of these are non-issues with the D. Rebel, it's just like using a film SLR, and at under $1000, what's not to like?A camera is no better than its lens, so we come to the one "down side" of buying this camera: to make proper use of it, you must spend even more money on good optics. This is something to keep in mind when making a purchasing decision: you'll probably spend at least as much on optics as you did on the camera body.I suspect many of the poor reviews from this camera are the result of using the kit EF-S 18-55 lens (or some other cheap, similarly poor-performing lens). There are probably worse lenses out there, but you'd have to search far and wide to find one. The camera performs way better than this lens does.Still, The EF-S 18-55 that comes with the kit is worth holding on to. I would recommend keeping the kit lens in your bag for those occasions where you need a wide-angle lens, like group shots. Otherwise, keep it off your camera! If you find yourself taking lots of wide-angle shots, you should seriously consider investing in a good wide-angle lens like the EF 17-40 f/4 L USM. Sell the kit 18-55 lens on Ebay--you'll get about $75-$100 for it--to help defray the cost.An EF 50 f/1.8 USM is a must-have. For $70-$80, you get an excellent lens for portraits and indoor shooting. Don't let the cheap plastic construction fool you, this is one of the better 50mm lenses out there. Remember that the camera has 1.6x cropping, so the 50mm lens produces the same image size as an 80mm lens on a 35mm film camera, which is a good focal length for portraits.A good every-day lens is the EF 28-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, for about $450. A good second choice would be the EF 28-105 /f3.5-4.5 (NOT the f/4-5.6, which is junk, in my opinion), for about $250. You'll find yourself taking 60% to 80% of your pictures with this mid-range zoom lens, so don't skimp. You should really get the better quality 28-135 if you can manage it.If you'll be taking lots of telephoto shots, the EF 70-200 f/4L USM is a bargain at about $550-one of the lowest-priced "L" lenses. If that's out of your price range, go with the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM, for about $275, which is superior to any of the EF 75-300 f/4-5.6 offerings, unless you really need IS, which is not offered on the 100-300. Stay away from the EF 55-200 f/4.5-5.6 USM, it's no better than the kit lens, in my opinion.Getting good images requires good optics, making the camera more expensive than the initial $999 purchase price.  But the results are worth every penny spent.
