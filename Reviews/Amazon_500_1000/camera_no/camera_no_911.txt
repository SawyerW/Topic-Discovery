Pros:1) features2) Super macro worked up to 2 inches in average light3) ISO 100-32004) Aquarium anti reflection mode...worth trying for glass cases in museums.5) Decent movies and easy to use and work6) Good long range telephoto...not great but usable without carrying extra lens.7) image quality average8) tricky menus until understood and then works well...in viewfinder is nice...fast menu display.9) Many options but are laid out well, dont clutter each other up...rotate selection works fast and well for P mode. AEB works fine but is slow. ISO 3200 works really well but as one would expect has noise, but the images are usable if you like to Photoshop your images...marginally acceptable but better than nothing if you cant use a flash or carry a tripod to art museums or Cathedrals10) Zoom and digital zoom....the ability to have that compact zoom range, is better than having to lug around a lot of gear for the casual person...this is a people camera, not a photographers camera...this is not an SLR,$600 dollar lens, raw image camera, so dont have that expectation.Cons:1) Canon tightwads do not include a detailed robust manual like previous cameras, what do they expect you to do, download and print it out...or carry a laptop.This is fairly stupid on Canons part, they could have at least created a one page cheat sheet like there is for the SX10 from third parties.2) Unless you have hard surfaces and a lot of light, this camera has some serious focus issues in Auto mode....SCN mode seems to be ok and so are movies, but auto mode is misrable.....this is not a low light camera unless you have rock stable hands, the image stabilize does not seem to be that good, unless there is light.G10 was an easier camera to use, but did not have the focal length. No problems with Macro that worked well and so did super Macro. The indoor setting was average but worked.3) Jpg vs raw....this is a jpg camera, and what you get is average jpg images, so lower your expectation if you are looking for a wonderful jpg or really need the detail and color or raw.4) Camera is ok sizewise but has an awkward balance, kind of stubby in the width, it is accetable but the camera does not balance well, a little tight and cramped, this is not a showstopper the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.Believe what you read in all the reviews, when it takes a good picture it is really nice, but when it is bad it is really bad, seems to be the usually Canon issue, Canons like bright light....if that isnt there, they get noise.You will really need to experiment with the focus options, and since cheap Canon, not unlike AGI, Enron, and other companies out to stab the consumer does not provide a decent portable manual, you will need to experiment, and spend time on your laptop to review the documentation.....having to have a laptop to study a portable camera...kind of perverted for a camera company to do this.All in all it is an ok, Swiss army knife kind of camera, and if you can get into the "does it all, but doesnt do it all .....really great" Then you will be ok.I dont think I will send it back yet, need to experiment a little more.Do not think that the reviews about bad images are false, for a camera that has an auto mode, the images just are not that great for "AUTO". This camera does have some focus quirks.In general so far the good and bad are balanced, it is a picture takers camera, not a photographers camera...this is the keep it simple and provide a lot tourist travel camera
