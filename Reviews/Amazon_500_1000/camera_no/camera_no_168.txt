I will not cover areas by others, just low light.1) EXR Low noise setting works fairly well at ISO 16002) Pro Lo light takes four shots and then merges the images and this works.The low light functions are actually doing a brightness boost and it is amazing how much additional light is captured. I tested this in many areas of a church that had stained glass, metal, wood, textiles, tapestries, marble, paintings, low light, medium light and high light. There are numerous settings and I spent about 4 hours time.My conclusions are:Both EXR low noisw and Low lite pro are valuable and produce good results....if you have a steady hand....I do not, so even though the images were much brighter without having to use a flash , they are still blurry because I could not hold the camera steady enough for it to cycle through 4 shots, it was bright, color was good but blurry. There was more blur than there was noise, so the lower noise claims are true.I could not use these features on the fly without a tripod at a certain level of low light, they worked but too fuzzy. They do work very well, and if I were only about 25% more stable they would be bright, clear and mild noise.It is very hard to hold this camera by hand for it to take the 4 shots in a row it has to take for low light as they are not immediate, there is a lag and you shake between the individual shots.The balance between the larger lens and the camera body itself is awkward, therefore it is hard to  hand hold the camera for low light situations. The design is lobsided, as the lens is not centered. It seems to be designed for right handed people.Next week I will try the camera in regular mode at ISO 3200, for the exact same museum objects and lighting I used for test my Canon SX20 IS ( which so far I think I like better) Since I have not tried the Fuji in ISO 3200 mode, I cannot do a fair comparison until this weekend.I suspect the Fuji in ISO 3200 for low light will be as good as the Canon SX20, but will have less noise, but it is a much larger camera to carry around.Compared to the telephoto, the Canon SX20 will win because it is 20X vx 14X.Be aware that the focus on the Fuji is auto, but the zoom is manual whereas on the Canon the zoom is auto as well.The Fuji uses lithium instead of AA, but it looks like at high resolution the Fuji will handle at least 200-300 images on one charge. I quit before the battery did.I think this is a good camera, but I did get better results with my Canon SX20 in ISO 3200 mode, even if the Fuji does better at ISO 3200, I do not know if it will be worth the price and size bulk difference, unless you are rock steady in low light.One thing I did notice about the Canon SX20 was that give the normal amount of shaking I do hand held in dark light, the pictures were acceptable (not great, acceptable). I am inclined to think that the image stabilization on the SX20 might be a little better than the Fuji. In both cameras the final low light ISO images are not full size as they would be for normal use...they would have more resolution.SO for either camera in low light more you wont be able to do much of an enlargment, the resolution isnt there, even if the noise isnt there.The Canon 20SX in ISO 3200 mode tended to be more stable for the low light shots, but the price you pay is more noise than the Fuji.So Fuji = cleaner low noise low light image  Canon = Better stability and better balance for low light shots, but more noise than the Fuji.In rapid fire shots the Canon would win in telephoto because of auto zoom and auto focus, but the Fuji batteries will last longer in manual telephoto.If you have a tripod the Fuji would probably win in low noise low light.I still have to test Fuji in 3200 and 12000 ISO.Normal picture modes in the Fuji are very nice, set the camera for sharpness and toned down colors.If you are doing movies the Canon 20SX will take higher resolution video, the Canon SX video is not great but certainly not bad.Fuji was way better than Canon for color saturation for stained glass but if the light was too bright the sensor bloomed out in white highlites.The objective was to determine which camera holds better for stained glass without using a tripod because stained glass has so much light variation.THe Fuji had better color saturation but tended to bloom, the Canon colors were acceptable but didnt clip out on the white highlites as bad, but did still clip.But put this in context, the objective was "hand held" , normally on a tripod you would not shoot a bscklit window at that high of an Iso setting so the setting itself would cause wild highlites, again the whole exercise was 100% handheld use.I like them both, so far the Canon SX has a slight edge as an all around tourist camera.For normal outdoor scenes I did like the further zoom range of the Canon.The Canon Super Macro is better than the Fuji macro in low light for stability.On a tripod in low light the Fuji would probably make a cleaner image.Fuji supports raw (viewer will not have that until November), Canon SX20 was jpeg only.
