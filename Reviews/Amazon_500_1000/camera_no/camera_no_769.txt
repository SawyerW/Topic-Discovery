I have to first tell you that I own two cameras right now. I own a Nikon P90 (great zoom, great picture) which I thought was a step up from my old Olympus Tough, I had previously owned a Kodak and a Casio which I dreaded. (picture quality was really poor on both of them). The last camera I bought was a Panasonic ZS6 which is a phenomenal camera due to it's Lecia lens. After buying this camera I told myself that my next camera will either be a DSLR or a Lecia. (Both costs a lot of money)I first saw the camera at Costco which is selling it for less than $280 with an 4gb SD card and a Sony bag. I picked up the camera and spent about 20 minutes going over everything. It was awesome...* 10 shots in burst mode at the full 16.2 Megapixels due to it's "Exmor R" CMOS Image Sensor (not the slow CCD sensor/ processor that Kodak invented that everyone else uses.) It also takes awesome pictures at night like an DSLR without the flash.* 3 different Sweep Panorama modes, 1 standard , 1 wide, 1 high resolution. (up, down, left, and right)* GPS and Compass works great and syncs up with google maps and tells you where you are. (remember to turn it off before you turn the camera off or it may drain your battery)* Smile mode~~ three different setting for different types of smiles, depending how big your smile is.* Face Detection has 3 different modes one mode gives you priority over who you are taking a picture of, either child over adult or adult over child.(up to 8 people)* HD Video~~AVCHD  at (1920 x 1080 @ 60i)24Mbs, (1920 x 1080 @ 60i)17Mbs, (1440 x 1080 @ 60i)9Mbs (face detection and zoom works while taking a movie). The movie mode also has 2 different stabilizer usually only found in camcorders making this camera dual purpose.* Zoom 10x Optical plus digital multiplies this up to 1000mm or 40x zoom.* 3D Still Image and 3D Sweep untested needed a 3D camera and HDMI cable.* Advanced Manual and Priority setting where you can select the Aperture and the shutter speed. Within the camera you can also select the ISO which is needed in order to get the right exposure.* works with mac and pcsome of the other features it has are background defocus, 25mm wide lens, Shutter Speeds : iAuto (2" - 1/1,600) / Program Auto (1" - 1/1,600) / Manual (30"-1/1600), Scene Mode(s) : High Sensitivity / Soft snap / Landscape / Twilight Portrait / Twilight / Gourmet / Beach / Snow / Fireworks/ Pet / Soft Skin / Handheld Twilight / Anti Motion Blur, ISO : Auto / 125 / 200 / 400 / 800 / 1600 / 3200I personally LOVE this camera. It is small and easy to put into a pocket or a purse, it has the shutter speed of a DSLR and the zoom of a lens that works while taking HD 1080 @60i videos. The biggest debate is what is better 1920 x 1080 @ 60i or 30P which is better? (they are the same?) It can zoom in as close as 1000mm and can take Sweep Panorama which is awesome!!!I went to Orlando 2 years and took over 1000 pictures 5 of them using panorama assistto take a picture of the Lake at Epcot. I to this day have not used the software in my computer to stitch them together. who has time to do this? This is why I love Sweep Panorama, it does all the work for you..I can't believe it takes 16mp shots at 10 shots per second, It's smaller than a Micro 4/3's and and as fast as a Professional grade DSLR for a tiny fraction of the price.Don't believe me try it yourself, Costco has a 90 day return policy with no restocking fee, ever!!!
