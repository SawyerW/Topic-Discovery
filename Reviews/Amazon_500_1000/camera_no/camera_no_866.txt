This is my first SLR camera and after a lot of research, reading all kind of reviews, including Dpreview and comparing many pictures on flickr, I was still having a hard time deciding between Nikon's similar model D5000 and this one from Canon.I went to best buy to feel both of them in my hands and take a close look at all the buttons. anybody who is going through this dilemma should try to hold the cameras for a few minutes.Anyways...What made up my mind?- According to dozens of Flickr photos both had pretty much the same quality.- Nikon lenses are really expansive and even if you're not planing on getting other lenses than the one that comes in this kit, well.. better safe than sorry you never know, maybe you will find yourself as a great photographer and might want to explore your talent at some point- I was used to canon buttons, which it made a whole lot easier to handle this camera, I was a little lost with the Nikon buttons, I know it wouldn't take long to get use to them , but still it made me a little nervousWhy am I happy with this camera?- great low light conditions shots- fast (Please, get a CLASS 10 card for better performance)- I can get different lens for way cheaper than Nikon lenses, so glad i don't have a Nikon- no flash photos are perfect- nice 3" LCD with great quality- LiveView helps me when I need people to take my pictures and they don't know how to use dSLR cameras.- Video is better than I imagine and with the different lenses you can get you make nice shots, though I would recommend a tripod for better image stabilization, specially with zoom lenses.- Battery life is fan-tas-tic! I got a second battery along with the camera, which it was great, but I never had to switch batteries on a same day or trip. Considering that I went to London in the winter (the battery life is always shorter in the cold) and the battery lasts almost my whole trip. I took a whole bunch of pictures because I was just testing my new camera.Tips:- Get a second battery just in case, though its battery doesn't take that long to charge and lasts a long time- get UV filter to protect your lens, even the cheap ones, at least you know that your lens is safe.- take off the filter for night shots with a lot of lights ot they will ruin your pictures.- if you are still not sure if you want get this camera go to flickr and examine some samples ;)- Get its manual for Dummies, it helps a lot- Buy it from Amazon, they were great. I bought it for my trip and I only had a week before my departure, so i call Amazon costumer service and they said I would have to cancel my order to have the shipping speed changed, but since I bought it with an international credit card I would lose money on the transaction, so they had it shipping 2-day shipping for free, just for understanding my needs. I love Amazon Costumer Service. If there is any problem with your camera you are safe with Amazon.This is a small camera comparing to other SLR but if you are new in the SLR camera world you really don't need to go with the big fancy cameras, this camera has plenty of possibilities to explore different set ups, but it's still easy to use.I hope this was somehow helpful.
