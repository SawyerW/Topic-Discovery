A previous reviewer stated, inaccurately, that the product descriptions for this unit are misleading. This is not the case. I am submitting this review to (hopefully) correct the misperceptions created by that review. (If said reviewer happens to see this, check the last part of my review to see how to correctly use your unit. I think you will be pleasantly surprised to see it will, in fact, very easily do exactly what you purchased it for, based on your stated needs.)Here is the Amazon.com product description (my comments added):"The new iVision achieves both by giving you the ability to not only know when somebody is outside your home, but to view and talk to them from the safety and comfort of any location in the house. The iVision package includes a convenient hand-held wireless receiver with 2.25" LCD monitor and battery operated doorbell/camera unit with over 300ft. transmission range.  (Specifies that the door unit can be battery operated, which is accurate.)  In addition, the doorbell/camera unit can be hardwired into existing doorbell power supply to allow the user to utilize a "browse" feature on the handheld unit.  (Very clearly specifies that ***IF*** you wire the door unit to the existing doorbell power supply, ***THEN*** you can do more things with it. Note that this says nothing about wiring it directly to AC power - this unit operates on low voltage only.)  This feature allows the user to monitor the view from the doorbell/camera unit on the LCD display.  (States what the addition capability is. Monitor simply means to be able to view the camera at will, versus interacting only as a two-way video intercom when the doorbell button on the door unit is pressed. It should be noted that this product is called a VIDEO INTERCOM, not a full-time surveillance camera. And it really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that the ability to sit around viewing the camera whenever you want, for as long as you want, would require some additional power source at the camera besides the small batteries it uses. The manufacturer locked that function out when on battery only mode so people wouldn't sit around constantly running down the batteries in the camera unit.)One can certainly understand if, upon receipt of the product, the purchaser realizes he/she did not fully understand the product description and decides to return it. (My sympathies to the reviewer who apparently went through product return hell.) But to give the product a one star review because you didn't fully digest the words you read is unnecessary. I have used many Optex products over the past 15 years, and I say with complete confidence that they make uncommonly solid, reliable products.HERE'S HOW TO WIRE THE DOORBELL/CAMERA UNIT, QUICKLY AND EASILY:Note: This assumes the existing doorbell a) Exists, b) is functional and c) is a hardwired doorbell. The overwhelming majority of homes in the US have hardwired doorbells. Whether they are functional is obviously a matter of whether they have been maintained in working condition. If your existing doorbell system uses a wireless doorbell button (usually done as a quick, inexpensive fix when the hardwired unit malfunctions, rather than having it repaired), you will not be able to use the browse mode on the camera without wiring low voltage power to the doorbell/camera unit. If you don't know what that entails, find or hire someone who does.Installation: Hardwired doorbells use a transformer inside the house to convert AC power to a low voltage power source that operates the doorbell system. Basically the same as all the bazillion transformers we all have plugged into our outlets to power various things, except this one is hardwired directly to your AC wiring instead of plugged into an outlet. That low voltage output powers two things - the doorbell itself (the actual ding-donger), and the button by the door. ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO HARDWIRE EXISTING DOORBELL POWER TO YOUR NEW DOORBELL/CAMERA UNIT IS TO TAKE THE EXISTING DOORBELL BUTTON OFF THE WALL AND ADD A FEW INCHES OF TWO-CONDUCTOR WIRE, GOING FROM THE TERMINALS ON THE BACK OF THE BUTTON TO THE POWER INPUTS ON THE DOORBELL/CAMERA UNIT. REATTACH THE OLD BUTTON, SCREW THE NEW UNIT TO THE WALL, AND YOU ARE DONE.If your original doorbell was working, then the new one should now be ready to go. Note that this means the unit is intended to be mounted next to the door (just like your existing doorbell button), not on the door directly. If you don't care about the extra capability gained when hardwiring, and just want to stick with battery operation, slap it right on the door if you want to. Keep in mind that if you choose not to wire it to the existing doorbell, the existing doorbell cannot activate the video intercom, as a previous reviewer noted. But that really shouldn't seem like rocket science to anyone smart enough to get online and order products.  :-)I am not affiliated with Optex in any way. I am self-employed in a service industry. I just ordered one of these units for my mother, who is about to have hip-replacement surgery. It's a brilliant design, easily installed and operated, and from a good, reputable manufacturer.
