As they say (remember this one)..."The BEST camera is the one you have with you". TRUE...right? Now you can actually HAVE the best camera WITH YOU all the time!***Here is why THIS camera is better than the other HD point and shoot camera-recorders  available:1) TWICE the resolution on the LCD screen than virtually EVERY OTHER CAMERA of its kind...super bright.2) DOLBY STEREO MIKE (and you can TELL it's stereo during playback....cool!)3) CAN SWITCH BETWEEN HD MODES! IF YOU NEED IT...AVCHD Capability is available which uses about 30% less memory than the MPEG 4 QT HD (though included software is awful for editing, and not much is available except maybe roxio or other expensive AVCHD editing programs)..USE the MPEG 4 QT HD recording method available in the camera4)..That 12X otical is at the full 10 megapixels...it goes to 24X OPTICAL with slightly lower resolutions, but still excellent quality and over 40X zoom with digitital zoom (limited to 12X optical on the full AI mode)5) Motor sound on zooming is almost nonexistent (unlike the Sony...you need only watch a few YOUTUBE videos of the cameras you like to hear the zoom motors)Aside from the obvious (12X OPTICAL+ zoom), the small size (in a pocket) and the decent battery life (buy extra battery if traveling), the HDMI mini cord for direct to TV,(buy one on ebay for about $6)the Panasonic  ZS3 is just plain COOL!You will LOVE the simple pre-set modes, and there are PLENTY of adjustments on the modes for everyone but the most professional photographer. The loose dial that some people complain about is NOT really loose, just easy to switch...smooth.OK, heres the deal on HD video....USE the standard HD format (Quicktime) INSTEAD of the AVCHD format for now.WHY?(1)The QT (MPEG4 HD) uses a bit more memory than the AVCHD option, but AVCHD software STINKS right now except for a few.(2) The savings in memory space using the new AVCHD lite method WOULD have been more useful 6 months ago, but now you can get 16 and 32 gig cards, so use the QT standard HD format because it is WAY MORE UNIVERSAL and the quality is EXACTLY THE SAME...I TESTED IT.(3) You can more easily edit and burn (and people can play easier) the MPEG4 Quicktime HD format.(4) The MPEG4 format is easier to find on your drive and fits into the file storage method you are likely using now. If you try to find the AVCHD file you made...good luck. Its auto named VERY FUNKY and wierd.DONT USE THE INCLUDED SOFTWARE...IT SUCKS...BIG TIME. Use whatever photo editing software you like EXCEPT the included software. So, again, when you store the HD as a QT (MPEG4) format, it fits in with everything you are used to doing, buit now you get HD in STEREO!WOW!AGAIN, SAVE USE of the AVCHD for the future IF you ever will really need it. Basically, I look at it this way...the AVCHD is cool, but the need for it is ALREADY obsolete with large hard discs and large storage capacity on SD cards nowadays. Besides, you WANT to share these videos anyway, and most of them are only about, what?...10-60 seconds long anyway? Filming a graduation ceremony or a play...FINE, THEN use the AVCHD...it's an easy switch IF you have to use it.FINALLY, USE YOUTUBE VIDEOS to see how any camera you are interested in works. I also found that using Firefox browser is better to avoid the youtube choppiness that happens when you aometimes view HD on internet explorer on youtube.Hope this info helps.NEW COMMENT UPDATED 06-27-09: Constant Clicking In Viodeos..SOLUTIONIn many of my videos, I heard a constant clicking. This is the continuous auto focus which you do NOT need for 99.9% of your videos. Simply disable the continuous auto focus in the video mode. You go to the main settings menu using the center button (when in camera mode), and on the left is a video camera icon. Choose that, then go to the page where it says CAF and disable it. This will take care of the constant clicking.
