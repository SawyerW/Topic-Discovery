Over the past four years I have purchased 18 ($250-450) compact cameras, in search of one that can take sharp pics in all lighting conditions. Half of these cameras were CANON. My issue with Canon is - they over-expose the shot, preventing me from capturing the MOOD of the shot. AND Canon is not as quick as this FUJI F200. (FYI- I have owned/used their SX210, SX200, SX110, A610, S60 ...)My CASIO cameras had superb color saturation, contrast & sharpness "outdoors", because they generally under-expose the shot just a bit; AND they shoot fast! BUT not so good in low-light situations, like most cameras. Later, I purchased the Casio FH20 when it came out, BUT no matter what I tried, images were a little washed out and soft for "my" taste.After reading great pro-reviews on Panasonic TZ5 and FZ18 and FZ28, I was convinced Panasonic had what I was looking for. BUT after only four dozen shots, I was disappointed right away with soft edges & smeared detail in pics, AND Auto White-Balance had too much Blue in outdoor shots.My Olympus SP565 was pretty nice, and did fair job, but "I" didn't like their Menu layout and missed buttons that gave me direct access to features I use all the time.WHAT pushed me to give up this SP565 was when I checked out the FUJI F200 at local retail store.This FUJI F200 was unbelievable! Very Fast, Great color and detail, and unreal depth-of-field. In mid-day bright sunlight, faces were not burned out, and when shooting 5-dozen pics at a class reunion outdoors - every shot FROZE the action. ie- people walking, waving their arms, etc.. With over 90 people at the reunion, it was great to be able to capture people fairly close, as well as far away. One of my shots captured a camera bag only 4-feet away on a picnic table AS WELL AS people in front of a pickup truck 60 feet away. I have NEVER seen such clarity, great color, depth of field and NO burned out faces before! AND this FUJI F200 shots fast. AND finally a camera that can take ridiculous low-light pics. I love its natural-light and natural-light w/ flash feature. In tough lighting conditions - its EXR modes can do it all.to be fair - this FUJI F200 is limited to a 28-140mm lens and battery life is 250-300 per charge. AND video is limited to the typical 640x480. Recently FUJI released its HS10 EXR camera with tons of enhanced features, including a 24-720mm lens and HD 1080p video w/ stereo audio. Its manual zoom around the lens is nice too. This HS10 is the Fuji F200EXR on steroids..To date, I have taken 2500 shots with my FUJI F200, and still love it over ALL other compacts I have owned or tried. Over past four years I have taken 9500 shots with my cameras. When I can afford it, I will (add) this FUJI HS10, so I have more zoom and abilty to take HD movies.
