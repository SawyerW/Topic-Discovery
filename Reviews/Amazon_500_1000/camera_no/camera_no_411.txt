I always wanted a real serious camera. Was thinking of getting into professional photography and so was seriously thinking of getting one of those photographer-type camera and lens, but with the prices of them bad-boys and my loss of interest in lugging something so big around me, I opted to just get want I always wanted (a compact camera with ALOT of Optical zoom!) and this is what I found!PROS*******PROS*******PROS**********PROS1) ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM: 12X Optical Zoom! It's range is 25mm wide-angle to 12x telephoto.Now I've just had this camera for 2 weeks, but I took it on my vacation recently and was able to get amazing pics from the airplane as I flew over (what I believe is) the Grand Canyon and Colorado River...(plus I always read reviews on CNET.com and is STILL #3 from THE TOP 5 BEST ALL-AROUND CAMERAS - and that's good enough for me! [[...]2) AMAZING MOVIE OPTIONS:- It records in HD (Formats are Motion-JPEG or AVCHD)- Digital Video Format (QuickTime & AVCHD Lite)- You can zoom while recording!- Has a dedicated button for recording movies3) MANY, MANY Scene modes for great photos:- Portrait, Soft Skin, Self-Portrait, Scenery, Sports, Night Portrait, Night Scenery, etc...(plus I especially love the 'Aerial Photo' Mode since I am always flying)[there is even a scene that distorts a portrait so the camera actually does make you 'lose' 10 pounds, lol.4) LARGE 3-inch LCD window:  My last camera had a 1.5 inch LCD, so YOU KNOW this is a huge jump for me!!!5) Shooting Modes: There are six:- Intelligent AUTO (which does all the hard work for ya!)- Normal Picture (which is like the one before)- MS1 & MS2 (they stand for My-Scene-1 and 2):so can quickly pick scenes you used frequently- SCN (stands for Scene) and allows quick access to changing to a new scene- Clipboard: this is a neat one: it ONLY saves pics on the camera memora, but its for pics or documents you may always need access to (AKA, a train schedule, or your itinerary, etc..)6) BRIGHT, AMAZING PICS/ VIBRANT COLOR7) USES SD & SDHD cards (My memory card of choice!)8) RECHARGEABLE AND AMAZING BATTERY LIFE: (plus, the battery charges MUCH faster than it losses charge, so a big plus there! even when taking video!)9) Surprisingly great night pictures!10) COMPACT!11) SOooooo many more........(plus you can get it in other colors than the typical silver color. I purposely got the black one, and its a beaut!)CONS********CONS*********CONS*******CONS1) No Memory card - Yeah, not even a 32MD one...which wouldn't do anything anyway. I have a 2GB card with mine!2) Few Manuel Controls - Now this is a big set-back for this camera, one of the biggest I heard, but hey, I am no professional, I still don't mess with the ISO's and the exposures and such, so if the camera is already set to do its own hard work, then let it. THIS IS NOT A 'CON' for me, but just want you to know since it may be for you3) No camera case - but that's not too much of a big deal4) Can't think of anything else actually....Hope this helps...I am SO glad I got this camera. I am still playing with it, so if you have any questions, ask away...I am SO glad I got it! It is worth every buck!!!
