This is a high quality camera, but you must take time to read through the owner's manual to understand how to get the best pictures.  You can just grab it and point and shoot using it while in the "automode" setting, but the resulting pictures may leave you a little disappointed depending upon the photographic conditions.  To get the highest quality photos you must become familiar with how this little beauty works.  Unfortunately, you might have to print out and tote the manual with you when you find yourself in situations where your pictures aren't what you'd like, or you can't figure out how to do certain things like know what's behind the flashing icon error message, or how to simulate different types of film, or can you choose between clarity, reduced noise and dynamic range?  This is not really a simple "point and shoot" camera and all images will turn out great.  You will have to study it, practice with it, and most of all have patience and you will be pleasantly rewarded for your efforts. Though the indicators vary with camera settings, there are 23 different indicators just for shooting mode, and 12 for playback mode, not to mention the date/time stamp, battery level, and indicator.  It can get confusing.Although a basic manual booklet is included with the camera, a much more detailed manual must be uploaded from the enclosed CD and then all 125 pages can be printed out or read from your computer monitor.  The manual covers all the material in the booklet almost page for page but includes much more information about features the booklet leaves out and the booklet will refer you to specific pages in the manual for more information.  Also, in the manual are about 50 FAQ's that are very useful. I am a manual reader, (having written many technical SOP's) and appreciate having well-written and well thought out manuals that are understandable and succinct.  Though I would have preferred a manual that I don't have to upload to my computer, it is well-written and many useful pictures are included.This camera is loaded with many different options/features but accessing and understanding many of them will require reading the manual.  For people who don't want to be bothered with all the bells and whistles this camera may be more than they need.  I can see very serious photographers using this camera.  Reading through the manual I have compiled a list of some of the various modes, options and features available:Digital ZoomMovie ModeSilent ModeVariable ISO settingsImage size selectionAspect Ratio selectionIntelligent Face detectionScene PositionShooting ModesEXR ModeFilm simulationDynamic RangeWhite BalanceContinuous PhotographyPhotometry - multi, spot, averagePlayback Options:EraseSlide ShowRed-eye RemovalImage RotationProtection from accidental deletionCropResizeVoice MemoPrint OrderTime DifferenceFormatPages 37, 67-68, 86-87, 97-103, and 104-107 would be good to print out and keep with your camera as they contain tables of various camera functions and a trouble shooting chart.I have taken many pictures and movies inside and out, light and dark, with this camera set on various settings.  And though I have practiced with it now for several weeks, I still need to often refer to the manual when I choose to vary from automode. Some things I have found especially desirable are:Silent Mode - I attend classical music concerts where flash photography is prohibited.  This mode will silence all beeps and flashes.Large viewing screen on the back of the camera.  It is exactly 5.5cm x 4.0 cm.Digital Zoom - extremely good.  I attended a local minor-league baseball game and sat far away on the grass well beyond the playing field.  I was able to fully zoom and still get good, clear, close-up shots of the players with no blurring.Movie Mode - Completely surpasses any other I've experienced so far.  Images are clear, colorful and the sound quality is excellent.  Camera noise was heard and recorded while using the "zoom" function in Movie Mode though it was not very loud.Multi-frame play back function is very useful to quickly scan for a particular picture.Fine Pix Viewer Program was very easy to install on my computer.  I use Windows XP.Very good photography in low-light conditions.Also some things I did not find particularly desirable but are not major flaws:I cannot directly burn a CD using the Fine Pix Viewer Program which comes with this camera.  I have to use another camera program, import the pictures into it and then burn a CD.Very easy to accidentally turn it on or off and easy to get misfires.The zoom lever is too sensitive.  I have learned with practice to barely move it very slowly.The camera does not give helpful suggestions on how to get a better picture as does my HP R717.Not HD capable.The higher the ISO the grainier the picture though a higher ISO is desirable when shooting in dim/low light levels.  I have set the ISO level to 200 and that seems to produce the best pictures so far.Almost too many options, modes and functions to choose from.  Though you can immediately begin to take pictures using Automode, it will take time to fully understand the many other aspects and features this camera has.In Summary:I can find no major complaint concerning this camera.  It takes excellent clear and colorful photos even in situations where I least expect it - indoors with no flash.  Any poor quality pictures I have taken are not the fault of the camera but due to the photographer's ignorance of how to use/understand properly the many features of the camera.  The basic mechanics of such things as battery and memory card installation are very easy.  Battery charging is a very simple process and battery life seems long.  The manual is detailed and covers more than I would probably care to know.  This is almost more camera than I need, though I will continue to use it and will update this review as necessary.
