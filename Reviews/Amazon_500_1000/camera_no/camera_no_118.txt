The Canon A70 Powershot is my first digital camera. Before this one, I owned a Canon EOS 35mm and spent hundreds of dollars a year on printing photos. However, I wanted to save on photo printing fees, share photos with friends and family over the web, and still enjoy the features that used for years on my EOS. I wanted to take photos in night and dim light situations as well as daytime and wide scenery, and enjoy the creative expression I had with the EOS. Going digital with the Canon Powershot was the most sensible move I could have made.Things I like about this camera:- the 3 megapixel resolution allows printing of very clean, clear photos on glossy paper;- colors are natural-looking, vivid and realistic- the ISO setting of up to 400 makes it easy to take photos without flash- CompactFlash cards are cheaper than the other alternatives on the market- the software included allows easy transfer of photos via USB- power-up time is minimal- the camera is a comfortable weight, and feels like a more expensive camera to the touch- battery life (when using standard rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries) is more than satisfactory for the casual photographer (I take maybe 50 photos a week, most without flash but with the LCD on, and only have to recharge once a month or so)- photos taken using digital zoom, while looking grainy on the LCD, end up with surprisingly crisp clarity overallThings I dislike:- no 800x600 resolution setting (sometimes 640x480 seems too small and 1024x768 too large for photos shared over the web or used in PowerPoint slide shows)- inept redeye settings (it never seemed to work too well for me - is there something I'm missing?);- photos taken in sepia seem a tad yellowish for my taste (possibly a problem that could be adjusted in printing)- the meager selection of LCD display background and sounds- camera cannot read or display photos from a CF card that have been edited and resaved in a separate PC application (the LCD just shows a question mark)- slightly flimsy focus knob/level (I would have preferred a bit more solid feel)- removing the CF card requires a bit of a trick to get the lid off (it's fine once you get used to it, however)- focus cannot be adjusted while recording video, and the sound quality of the built-in speaker is comparable to a cheap child's toy- some purple stripes appear on the LCD in certain lighting conditions during shooting (these do not appear in the final photo, however)All this said, for the main reasons why I bought this camera, I haven't regretted the purchase. (But for sharing photos over the web, the single most aggravating point is the lack of a 800x600 photo resolution setting! Alas, that is what Photoshop is for...) The camera is simple enough to use, feels sturdy, takes photos that are of excellent quality, and the benefits of this camera far outweigh the disadvantages IMO. Although I'm no expert photographer, I feel like I have purchased a product that will satisfy my basic needs and my creative needs for years to come.
