Ok, I am going to balance this a little. I had a Nikon D40, loved it, but got stolen. I saw this deal on deals2buy.com to get this pentax (plus the 50mm-200mm lens) at $560+ through the Dell website. Due to all the rave positive reviews of the k-x, I bought it! In fact, I think a reviewer actually said say that he "upgraded" from his D40 to this, so I thought wow, great price! $560 for a DSLR bundle with 50-200mm lens! The Nikon 50mm-200mm costed me $200 alone!After I received this this Pentax, I understood why people say this is a big bang for the buck. It has so many features that the D40 doesn't have, live view, video mode, all the fancy editing stuff, even HDR! BUT! The picture quality just can't match my previous D40! Yes, the Pentax has iso all the way to 6400, it goes down to iso 100 where the D40 stops at 200. But I think you will be pretty frustated with the Pentax because the focusing is really slow... I swap over to the 55-200mm pentax lens, tried to snap pictures of some birds. I can't! The focus is too slow! The birds either flew away by the time the focus is set, or when I snap it, they have moved and I ended up with a blurred picture. Even with the 18-55mm lens, the focusing is way longer than my D40! Next test, I took the Pentax out for a night shoot with my tripod at some of my favorite locations in the city. Took out my note book and set the K-x to all the previous settings I used with my D40, took the same set of pictures using my previous D40 settings. I placed the photos on my PC, and compared side by side with those pictures I took with my D40. Nope, the D40 won hands down.Final final test, I bought the Nikon D3000 with 18-55mm + 50-200mm bundle (both are VR lens). It costed me $660 from RitzCamera (through Amazon), Yes, I paid additional $100 for a camera that has less features than the Pentax just to convince myself it is not my imagination that an entry level Nikon is better than this entry level Pentax... Now, I let my wife use both cameras and start shooting stuff in her kitchen in automatic mode. She is the type who prefers point and shoot cameras, and thinks that the DSLRs are too complicated for her. After she is done shooting her microwave, iron, etc... I placed both sets of photos on the PC screen, without telling which set of photos were taken by which camera, I asked her to pick the better pictures taken by her. 8 out of 10 times, she picked the photos taken by the D3000. So, if a housewife who knows nothing about using DSLR can tell the differences between pictures taken by a D3000 vs. the K-x, I think I am convinced that I should be selling my K-x on Craglists. Since it was listed at $700 here, I sold my "used K-x" for $600, not bad considered that I bought it only $560... :)Yes, yes, I know, some of you probably grumbling right now that I haven't push the K-x to the limit, haven't picked the extreme conditions when I will appreciate the functions of the K-x. But what I am trying to say is this, if you want fancy stuff, you really get a lot of it from the K-x. If this is what you are looking for, go get the K-x. But if you want good quality pictures without having to kill yourself over the slow focusing, or IF you have used the D40 before, the K-x ain't an upgrade!Lastly, even if you are going to get the Pentax, and you are intending to get it with teh 50-200mm bundle for $699? You have been ripped off! Go deals2buy.com and wait for the promotion, I got it for only $560 for the whole bundle!And if you want to get the D3000 + 200mm lens, go Ritzcamera's website and get the bundle for $650! (For whatever reason, Amazon nolonger list that bundle...)Hope that this review can put things in a different perspective for some...
