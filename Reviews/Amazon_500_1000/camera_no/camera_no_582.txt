You just got to hand it to Canon to come up with the best package cameras in the market today. The A60, A70 and A80 provide huge feature sets at a very competetive price.Regarding the camera, my A80 let me just say that it performs admirably.I was initially choosing between the A80 and also the excellent  Canon S45, but decided on the A80 for the foll reasons:1. Superior handling - the A80 just FELT better to hold in my hand, due to its protuding grip, than the S45. However, i recommend you try both cameras out before you buy. You might prefer the S45 instead.2. Flip-out-and-twist LCD - The A80's real ace over the S45. Initially, i thought it to be a gimmick, but i found out that the LCD is really useful in everyday situations, e.g. taking photos of kids from a low level without breaking your back. BUT, the A80's LCD is also a bit dissapointing, as it has only a 1.5" size and 67k pixels, compared to the S45's 1.8" and 100k+ pixels. See for yourself, and decide if you are comfortable with the A80's LCD. I wear glasses, but have no problems with it.So the choice is yours. Both cameras are priced about same right now, i think.Back to the A80, here are its pros and cons:Pros:1. Good handling and feel, Sure , it may not be as small as a Pentax S4, but come on, the camera is more 'prosumerly' oriented. Is small size is what you look for, you'll HAVE to give up on many advanced manual controls.2. Good quality images. People in forums have complained about purple fringing and excessive red-eye on the A80. I find a bit of fringing too but it is not that noticable. And redeye? I've seen none of it even with flash shots.3. AA batteries seem to run on and on and on...... 2100 mAh cells lasted about a week with 30 or shots a day with LCD turned on.4. NO E-18 errors which plagued the Canon A60 and A70!5. Flip-out-and-twist LCD. Really useful.Cons:1. people say the the CF card door is flimsy, but in fact I find the Battery compartment door to be even more flimsy. I wonder when the springs will break off.2. Shutter lag: This plagues almost all comsumer digicams. I've learnt how to handle it thought, by adjusting my timing, but it still annoys me.3. A bit low quality LCD as i mentioned earlier. Some of you may find it to be a problem. It works fine with me.So, all I can say is that the Canon A80 makes a very strong case for itseldf in the 4 megapixel comsumer camera market. However, if price is a hassle, you can also try out the 2MP A60 or 3MP A70, good performing cameras in their own right. In the 4Mp category, also be sure to check out the A80's competitors i have listed below:1. Canon S452. Nikon 43003. Pentax S44. Kodak DX 64905. Canon S4006. Sony P92 ( a 5MP model)7. Canon S50 ( also 5MP)For the Canon A80, i recommed the following accesories, which should be definitely bought:1. 128 MB ( at least) Cf card. 256 MB is a good size.2. 2 sets of rechargable Ni-Mh batteries, (each set having 4 batteries)of about 2000 mAh and a fast charger.3. Camera pouch/bag. The Lowepro Z10 which i bought for the A80 provides a snug fit.
