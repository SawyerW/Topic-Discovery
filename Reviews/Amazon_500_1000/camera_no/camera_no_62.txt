I'm going to make this clear right off the bat, i love this camera and the following review will tell you why.I started off as a complete novice, as innocent as a baby when it comes to photography, I recieved a Sony Cybershot W55 for Christmas in 2007, which was similar to my mothers P150 Cybershot, which basically packed all the same features as the p150 except one critical feature that lead me to the D80, the Sony Cybershot lacked a manual mode, the W55 was completely automatic.So I began to look into DSLR's as a suitable replacement for a completely automatic Sony Cybershot W55, which i could not take manual pictures, sports shots, or slow exposures with.I considered the major players first, Canon, Sony and Nikon on my dad's recommendation. I found that Sony's SlR, the Alpha line, pretty much sucked in terms of their performance in low light, the only attraction was the live view, which basically defeats the purpose of an slr anyway.So now the only two competitors were Canon and Nikon, and by this time, my budget jumped from the initial 400 to 750 dollars which was the starting price for slr's. I read some reviews for the Canon D-Rebel line of slrs, this is the thing about Canon THEY PUNCH OUT THE SAME STUFF W/DIFFERENT NAMES AND COLORS WITH ALL THE SAME FEATURES INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!!!!! the XT and XTi were no different to me and by the time i had purchased the D80, the Xsi had just come out.I was turned off of the Canon line for two reasons, 1) were negative reviews about the crappy performance and durability of the Rebels, the former of which I noticed myself. Plus, the Rebel's felt cheap in my hands and too delacate; and 2) after doing a lot of spec grazing and review watching on CNET i turned finally to Nikon.At that point, the competition was going to be between the D60 and the D80, both of which were in my budget.THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO:D60's matrix metering was flawed, while the same system in the D80 worked like a charm, that was the main reason i wanted it, along with modest aperture settings, that stretch from 3.5-22 and 5.6-36 with the 18-55 VR Nikkor, (3.5-22 is at the minimum focal length of 18mm while 5.6-36 happens at the max focal length of 55mm) the final thing that sold me on it were the large number of great reviews from people who loved this camera coupled with some fantastic customer images submitted by people owning this camera.While the d60 does have a higher ISO index, up to 3200, I find the Nikon D80's ISO 1600 to be pretty good unless the light around me requires it.The PRO's of the D801. Excellent color reproduction in all three color modes, saturation and hue is very good.2. Sharpness and contrast (buyers should change the default settings to the highest sharpness and normal contrast in CUSTOM mode to acheive the best pictures) are spot on.3. Lightning fast: powers up in an instant with very quick shutter response, i don't miss a single shot with this camera.4. Matrix (multi) metering system: very good unless the subject is sillhoetted by a bright sky in which case you should switch to center or spot weighted metering.5. Intuitive: i barely read the manual for this thing, the buttons are easy to use and manipulate.6. Speed: I don't usually use the built in flash because i normally shoot in M,A,S or P modes and i can adjust the ISO to the perfect setting.7. 1/4000 of a second to 30 seconds is a modest gift, and allows me to almost never employ alternative means of lighting WHICH MEANS I SAVE MONEY TOO!!!!!!!!!!Who should buy this camera?-Anyone looking to upgrade from a point and shoot with a budget of $1000 or less.-Anybody looking to grow as a photographer, by using this camera I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY!!!!!!!! AND I'M STILL LEARNING.-Anyone looking to buy something worth their money!!!!!!!!NOTES:PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURS WITH THIS CAMERA.to those who wrote such reviews, listen to this:take advantage of the manual, aperture, and shutter priority modes, often times i use those over P mode and always over all that other crap like "Landscape" and "Portrait" which don't do anything, if you want good looking pictures, take advantage of the manual opportunities presented with this camera, IF YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT UNDEREXPOSED OR OVEREXPOSED PICTURES, YOU ARE PROBABLY USING THE AUTOMATIC MODES AND WOULD GET ALONG FINE WITH A POINT AND SHOOT
