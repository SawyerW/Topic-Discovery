When using this camera, you do need to be aware of what setting will work well for the photo you wish to take. Trial and error.The sliding lens cover functions as both the lens protectant and as the off/ on switch. Once the cover is slid, the camera will take 3 seconds to power on (give or take).The product description states it has a long-life re-chargeable battery. In this case long-life is accurate.

It is easy to store it in your pocket without worrying that it will power on. It is roughly the size of my Droid or the iPhone. The sliding lens cover serves its purpose well.The unit has a fast response time and can be operated easily. Its Lithium-ion battery lasts for weeks. It is durable and has survived several falls on various hard surfaces from rough handling by my daughter. The USB cable comes in handy for uploading images onto the computer. A few images may appear grainy on the LCD screen, however, the prints and the transferred images on the computer are not. The camera's sleek black color is consistent. The overall quality is fair.
