I love this camera.  My guess is you'll love it too, at least if your needs are similar to mine:I cut my teeth on a Pentax Spotmatic in the 1970s, and appreciate the flexibility of manual controls.  Point-&-Shoot digital cameras are small and light, but (nearly) everything is automatic.  The P5100 allows you to manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture, just like with a DSLR; but unlike a DSLR, the P5100 is (while a bit heavier and bulkier than I might ideally like) pocketable.  It's a compromise between a DSLR and a P&S;, and in that sense works really well for me.The build is really solid, the controls are exceptionally easy to use, and image quality is superb.  My only real complaints are that it's a bit slow (shutter lag seeems longer than most, there's a lag while the image is being processed, and it grinds and struggles to focus in low light) and the on/off switch is located in the wrong place (the center of the grip, so I find myself turning the camera on & off when I don't mean to).  I consider these minor inconveniences.So if you're a photo enthusiast who wants more control than offered by most P&S; cameras, but you don't want to deal with the bulk of a DSLR, you may love the P5100 too.===============================================UPDATE: I've had the camera for nearly 3 months now, so a brief update.  I still rate it as an amazing little camera -- a lot of features and flexibility are squeezed into a small, solidly-constructed, pocketable box.  If pocketability is what you want, this camera is I still believe an excellent choice.  It's truly like having a DSLR in your pocket in many respects.And it's not perfect: I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars.  When there are so many features packed into a small box, I guess there are bound to be compromises.The P5100's compromises show up mainly in low light.  First, there's a lot of noise above 400 ISO (although it's rated up to 3200).  In that sense, this camera behaves more like a film camera -- which isn't so terrible, I've learned to work with it.  The bigger problem is AutoFocus: It's a bit slow in the best of circumstances, and in low light it can take up to ten seconds to fix a focus.  This doesn't lend itself to "point-&-shoot" captures.  Again, I've learned to live with this: In low-light situations, I frame a shot and pre-focus: I depress the shutter halfway well before I'm actually ready to shoot, and then just wait.  It works, but takes getting-used-to.  I've also learned that center focus is a lot faster than the other auto focus options, and that in landscape mode, AF is turned off, with focus set at infinity.  Most important: from a half-depressed position, the shutter release is very responsive.  Bottom line: Low light photography requires a bit of advance planning.When shopping for this camera, I preferred both the Canon G9 and A650 to the Nikon P5100, each for different reasons.  But neither Canon camera is IMO pocketable.  So if you want DSLR-like flexibility in a small box, I still think the P5100 is about the best you can do at this point.
