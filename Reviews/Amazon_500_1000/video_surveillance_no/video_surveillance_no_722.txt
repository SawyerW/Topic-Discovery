********************************************Update number two. My rating just dropped to one star!  yes, these cameras hoovers in a major way! One has totally stopped working and the other one keeps loosing it's network connection and I am talking wired via a cat 6 Ethernet cable. And when it does work, the video changes to something one would expect if on drugs!  It's like a polarized negative of the image! I'm fixing to call Foscam and ask for a total refund.****************************************************************************************Update: My Wi-Fi/Ethernet problems seem to be not from the cam but from my choice of location in mounting the camera.  Yes, while it was the same distance as my other camera from the router, there was a little product that I didn't think mattered. The Power supply and meter to my home. Obviously, they have a HUGE affect on not only wireless but also wired connections! I was about ready to call Amazon and ask for a refund when I decided to move it away from the meter. Low and behold, the connection returned.  I suspect that if I had a shielded Ethernet cable this would probably not be an issue, but needless to say, it was my power connection/meter causing my connection problems. I only write this as I hope it will help solve other's problems with an outside camera. Don't do as I did and automatically blame the product.  But, the Wi-Fi antenna is a piece of crap! I broke one off just trying to attach it to the cam. Also, the mounting hardware is a piece of junk. Foscam, cut the price of the cam by eliminating both and allow us to purchase them separately, as we will have to do anyway.********************************************I ordered two, so this review is for both.First, the cameras seem to be of a sturdy construction.  while setting them up, I compared them to my other Foscams.  I have two other models (918 and 910), so I knew what to expect from this manufacturer. Both inside and outside, this camera seems to have a much better picture than the indoor models.  Setup was the same, although one of them wanted to be a female dog and not accept my changes (static IP), but it finally took them.The IR is less than the indoor models though.  This puzzles me as one would think that an outdoor camera would need more, but I'm not an engineer.The Wi-Fi also hoovers majorly with this model. I placed one beside of my 910 model camera and it failed terrible at sending a signal. The 910 trumped with flying colors.With all this said, this is still a good camera for the price. The daylight picture makes the other short comings seem minute.Two faults that I see almost cost this rating a star but I decided against it. Fault one is the assuming that the camera will be mounted with the base down. Second, is the quality of the mounting hardware.  It's plastic! Also, hard to adjust as it's cheap quality makes it almost impossible to aim it "precisely". You aim the cam, tighten the fastener, and then it slips/moves!
