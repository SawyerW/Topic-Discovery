This is my first IP Netcam. And though I have a Computer Science degree, who works as an engineer, I had problems setting it up myself. It took me 2 days until I finally got it going.Thanks to those who have already lavishly provided detailed instructions for others (including myself) who had problems getting this cam set up.I would like to pay my due here by detailing out the steps that I took in order to get this IP cam up and running:I configured it using Windows XP:1.) hook up the ethernet cable from your cam to the router using a free port.2.) connect the ethernet cable from your desktop (or laptop) to the router to another free port.---- up to this point, please note that both of your PC and your cam are not powered on ----3.) connect the power adapter to your cam, wait until the LED indicator blinks green.4.) power up your PC.5.) Insert the manufacture installation CD.6.) Click "Search/Look for IP CAM" (forgot the exact name of the button, but it is the first button on the page you see once you inserted your installation CD). If all goes well, you should be able to see both the MAC address (i.e. XX.XX.XX.XX.XX) and the IP address (i.e. 191.168.0.xxx) of your Panasonic CAM.See if you can access your cam by viewing it from a browser by clicking on "view" button from the installation CD Configuration Page.7.) Log onto your router configuration page (usually 192.168.0.1).8.) Go to the status page (it might be called something else due to different routers)  and see if your IP Cam is picked up by your router.9.) If your router sees your cam, assign it (your IP Cam) with a static IP Address (if you are using DHCP) by:On my router, click "DHCP Server", specific a range:example:"IP Address Start: 192.168.0.xxx" and "IP Address End: 192.168.0.yyy"xxx: specified by you, for example: 100yyy: ending address also speificied by you, for example: 150Hence, your IP Address Range begins from 100 - 150 (i.e. from 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.150)--- Assigning Static IP ---10.)Once all the above steps are done, go to "DHCP List and Binding" (again it might be called something else due to different router, but it is usually under "DHCP Server" Tab) on your router's configuration page.Once there, from the "Static IP" Section, put in both the mac address of your Cam and an IP Address for it:For IP Address, you could put in ex: "192.168.0.150" (or one that is in between the range of the IP Address you set up from the above step (step 9), which is not in used by other machines on your network).Then, click "Mac-IP Bind". Finally save all your setting on your router.--- Port Forwarding ---11.)Once a static IP Address is created for your IP Cam from the above step, set up a portfor your IP Cam (so that it can be viewed remotely).Again, go to your router's configuration page, click "Virtual Server/Port Forward":a.) Set up a starting and ending range for the port: example: 10001-10001 to the IP Address of your IP Cam (from the step above, I used "192.168.0.150". But yours may be different depending upon which numbers you specified it to be).b.) Portocol: use both "TCP/UDP"Now, go back to your Panasonic Installation Page, and click on "Network Setup".There you should see a pop-up page that says:"Port NO." <--- put in the port number you specified from the step 11 above (ex: 10001)"IP Address" <-- put in the Static IP Address you specified from the step 10 above (ex: 192.168.0.150)"Subnet Mask" <-- 255.255.255.0"Default Gateway" <-- 192.168.0.1"Primary Server Address" <-- 192.168.0.1"Secondary Server Address" <-- 4.2.2.1 (important!)12.) Then click on "Network IPv4", and from "Connection Mode" choose "Static".Once this is setup, your Cam should restart itself and when you click on "view"the browser address should become: for example:"192.168.0.150:10001"From your Cam's Page, click on the "Setup" tab:a.) Then, click on uPNP and Disable it.b.) Then, click on the "wireless" (we are still on the "Set up" page)Put in your SSID, Communication Mode = "802.11b/g"For Cipher, use the one that your router is using.For Network Key: Put in the password.!!! If your network key contains spaces, you MUST re-set your password for the network key to another that contains no spaces !!!For example: "PasswordToMyNetwork" will work, but: "Password to my network" will not work.The last step:Go to "DynamicDNS" (we are still on the "Setup" page")click "Viewnetcam.com", then click "next".From there, set up the name and the password to access the camera remotely.Once that is done, then your camera should be able to work remotely by typing in:"(The name you chose with viewnetcam.com)".viewnetcam.com:(port number you set up from step 11 above)Example: MyBabyCam.viewnetcam.com:10001From my experience, I never even used the "Internet" Tab to configure.EDIT:For Wireless Setup, if you have followed the steps above correctly:Simply power down your Cam, and flip the switch to "Wireless" andpower it up again.ALSO: If you have previously tried to set this cam up without success and would like to give this setup instruction a try: reset your IP Camera first.Should you become frustrated whilst getting this thing set up, walk away from it.Grab yourself a cup of coffee, then come back at it later.I am relocating overseas; as a result, I understand how some of you might feel, whoeither want to keep an eye on your properties or on your pet (my case) while you are away. I hope this instruction is of help to you.
