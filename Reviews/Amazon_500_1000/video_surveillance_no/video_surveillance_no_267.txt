Initially 1 camera started acting up in the terms of color; seemed to have difficulty determining if it was night or day...eventually all the cams started the same symptoms..Support online was sloooowwww in return and all the inquires from the Q-See trouble shooting staff revolved around "where did I buy my cameras" or "did I purchase the system through Costco"!I..Possibly to determine ease of return or replacement... in fact I switched cams to other ports, rebooted, changed poe cables, rerouted cables, swapped cams and locations via ports and every time I returned this information in a response email I was asked the same questions and told to do the same thing of which I said I did, as if nobody had read any of my return emails which is a pain to communicate through to begin with making a unpleasant scenario worse!!!  Finally after expressing my disappointment with the q-see trouble shooting team which was useless to contact by "email" in my opinion I was emailed a link to receive a RMA # for a return of the troubled cams only!!Great!! so I would have to wait to see if the cams were at fault or if it was the system or just setup issues and be left without surveillance at the mercy of a turn around time not disclosed...I decided to keep the cams and deal with the color changes due to the fact they still had a clear image..Even though the 808-461 knowingly has only 4 cams and is advertised as a 8 cam system it only has 4 poe ports, why would I buy a 8 cam system with 4 ports? because if it were "advertised" as a 8 cam system with only 4 POE ports needing an additional $150 POE switch to turn it into a 8 cam system I would not have purchased it also, statistically sales would probably be lower as consumers would expect a lower price tag..Why it is so difficult to supply a system with eight POE ports is a mystery to me....However,  there is still a minor statement in the add in order to add cams use a POE switch , so read adds completely ( another $150) and there is absolutely no info on these upgrades consequently its all a mystery on how to do any upgrades or just basic setup unless one has extensive knowledge on this matter..Finally I purchased the additional POE switch and 4 more 1080p cams with a 3TB HDD to add... Adding the HDD was a straight forward procedure of course as was the POE switch..However, having problems configuring the system to add the 4 cams I once again contacted Q-See tech support but, this time by phone and I am still in the process of configuring the system to view the addition 4 cams with progress and should have them up and configured asap thanks to speaking directly to a member of tech support which I highly advise opposed to email contact..Bottom line is ; You must download the entire manual and study it as you perform tedious tweaking and numerous configurations to the systems internal on screen adjustments to time frames, camera settings etc..."internal settings and configuration of FPS, recording options, Kb/S etc..can and do have a effect on performance and live view which is expected of you to know first hand!..This system has so many optional scenarios for one to taylor it can be difficult to decide how you'll want to configure everything as the adjustments can seem endless but the many options allow for serious fine tuning and tailoring.."Do" as much research on home/business surveillance systems as possible unless you are a network engineer or It can be a nightmare if you have equipment problems, additional equipment needs (POE switches, HDD drives etc..) or set up issues which will consequently have to be researched extensively...Truthfully; the answers are all there in the online manual and with the help of a live voice it is manageable but, It is a relatively advanced system which allows for upgrades with no indication or additional hardware to do so consequently I believe it is still a good alternative to a mega big bucks system or forking out a couple K for an install...The start up literature is a joke which is to say all it does is "start you up and thrust you into a realm of the unknown configuration" you'll get a crash course in "ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS 101"...I believe most of the reviews here are from those who have some basic knowledge of IP cams and surveillance units to start with...It is not a simple up and running system for the novice....Although the q-See 1080 cams I purchased are more costly and should be clearer than the 720 cams they do not project as much IR light for night vision as the 720 cams...Additionally, I truthfully cannot tell the difference in terms of detail, color or clarity between the 1080p and 720p cams BUT in fact I can indecisively say I have had too many problems, erratic non consistent  color and constant FOGGING up with SEVERAL of the 720p cams and a few 1080p cams also..Additionally, the q-see 1080p cams have a much wider angle or panoramic view making them more suited for close up wide angle surveillance as opposed to any kind of distance...CONSEQUENTLY AFTER ALL THIS I HAVE SENT THE UNIT BACK TO THE MERCHANT FOR A REFUND AS I DID WHAT I COULD TO RETIFY ALL THESE PROBLEMS AT NO RESOLVE...I WILL UPDATE ON THE RETURN STATUS SOON...
