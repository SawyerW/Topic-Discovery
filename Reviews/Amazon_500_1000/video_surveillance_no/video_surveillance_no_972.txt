UPDATE March 2012: U had put this away after just a week of use. Dug it back out to permanently set up and it worked for less that 15 minutes. Green light went off, hard reset did NOTHING....Knocking this to 1 star ans customer support has FAILED to even respond & the hoops you jump through to go NOWHERE with them is just too much. Buyer beware.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Original review below"After the utter FIASCO of trying out the Archerfish Solo 802.11 Wireless Intelligent Video Surveillance System with Built-In DVR ..... I was convinced any of these similar devices were pure crap. But this has not only turned me around but made me an enthusiast. THIS is how it is "supposed" to be done in my opinion.  NO hidden fees & costs. NO taking my credit card number for some SO CALLED FREE service!, NO problems our hours trying to troubleshoot and end up never getting installed. NO hours on the phone with tech support....Nope. This took less than 15 minutes, was almost as simple as plug- n- play, and woks. Just plain & simply works.  I can't address sending images to cell phones etc since my use is as a garage monitor & UPS lookout device. When it is hot I like to leave my garage door open and not worry about who enters to help themselves to my toys. I also want to know who is near my driveway so If my doorbell rings I know to answer it or if I am wasting my time dealing with some religious nut trying to save my soul...So my use is far from what the mainstream is I am sure. What I love is that this really allows me to do all I need and to even set "motion zones" with free software you download to add to this camera.  Plus It has the ability to record directly from the camera to a local hard drive, trigger motion detection, set recording schedules, set e-mail alert notifications, and even support for up to 32 cameras. Best part unlike my last nightmare with Archerfish, I can record video directly to a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, eliminating the need for a dedicated computer to store video. You set up any "zones" where motion will trip recording with FREE software. THIS is how I wanted in the first place!  If you choose, you can have emails sent and configure this almost any way imaginable. Again, quick, clean and SIMPLE! No hidden fees, costs, traps or hassles. As a baby or Nanny cam, this would be amazing. In my case, I just have neighbors to worry about....The picture is nice for this price camera. Low light performance is good as well. I use it in wireless mode and no problems at all. It does require plugging into a wall socket to power so that is a consideration for camera placement. The camera also has a light that flashes when recording so that is nice as well for someone wondering about privacy? All in all, I am very grateful to have found this since I had given up after the last joke of a camera with Archerfish....
