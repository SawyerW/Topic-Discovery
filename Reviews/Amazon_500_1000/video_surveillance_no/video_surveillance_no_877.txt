******UPDATE******This is an update to my original post. After I wrote this review I was contacted by the company that sells this Samsung product. They were disappointed to hear that I purchased a product from them that I was not happy with. They offered to exchange the monitor free of charge. They sent a new monitor right to our door within a few days. We then packaged up the old malfunctioning unit and sent it back, no shipping charges to us required. The tune still plays when I turn it on, that can not be helped and maybe with the next monitor Samsung creates they will leave this annoying feature off. I find that the video and sound is clear. Do not expect HD TV quality picture from a monitor, you will not find one. The daytime picture is fine. I can see my baby, eyes closed or open and what is going on. The night vision is just what I expect it to be. It's night vision people, it is not intended to be the best quality picture you could have. You will not see certain colors on the black and white picture, but you will get the idea of what baby is up to. This feature is for checking on your little one to see if they need you in the middle of the night, and it allows me to do just that. I am no longer having the OUT OF RANGE reading when walking around my home either. Overall, I think the Monitor functions just as I need it to and I am happy for the most part with this.*****ORIGINAL POST*****Like so many other reviewers, I did my homework before purchasing this monitor. I have other Samsung products and have been nothing but happy with them. Unfortunately I am not a fan of this monitor. The night vision blinks in and out and I have called support about this issue. They told me that the room must be pitch black in order for the night vision to work. I assured them that the room was completely black. He then told me that it was possibly a manufacturing defect and unfortunately he could not help me with that issue. I would have to first contact Amazon for a return and then if they couldn't help I could call back so they could put in for a service request for the video portion of the unit. He gave me nothing but a run around and in the end didn't help the issue. The tune that the monitor plays is extremely loud with no way to turn it down or mute this. I have to hold the monitor against me to try and muffle the noise. I often get an "out of range" signal when I am across my home (about 40 feet, just a bathroom between the monitors.) No other electronics or signal disrupters between the units.The audio is clear and the day video is clear. Disappointed in this product.
