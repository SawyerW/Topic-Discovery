** UPDATE 1 ** I added a screenshot in customer photos to show you the hundreds of video files it creates in a single day. Take a look.** UPDATE 2 ** I did continuous recording for day and each recording MAX time is 5 minutes each. So 12 recording files per HOUR and 120 files for a 10 hour period of recording. This is not motion. This is continuous recording. Should be at least 30 minutes. BTW, there is no way to fast word or rewind in the mobile app software. So you're stuck watching every single minute.** UPDATE 3 - 10/2013 ** Seems if you record using your phone, the audio is recorded. But if you record to SD card, no audio. WTF... BTW, this camera seems much better intelligence... [...]I just had it for over 2 days and here's my feedback on this. I have owned Trendnet, Foscam 8910, and others. I may return it because of the HUNDREDS of 4MB files it records when I turn on motion detection. Yes, HUNDREDS of tiny 10 second length files you have to wade through for a SINGLE DAY of recordings. Yes, it's that stupid. I got it for $85 on Amazon promo.SetupThis is probably one of the easiest to set up. I installed the Android software I found on Google Marketplace and it found the cameras quickly and easily. Harder for me was figuring how to get to admin using web browser. Turns out username is admin and no password.Once you are running on the phone, it also requires password. Default is lorex.What I liked- Installation was simple. I used web browser and just point to IP of camera. Username is admin and blank password. If you need to find IP address of camera on your network, use arpspyx software on Mac to find what ports are being used and just try a few.- Great long USB cable that connects to a power adapter. So if you have usb devices nearby, you can just plug it into the USB port.- Images were sharper than my Foscam FI8910W. Not as smooth in motion though.- Smaller and lot lighter than my Foscam FI8910W- Mounting was simple and could pretty much adjust any way I like- Night vision looked better than my Foscam FI8910W.- You could record video directly to NAS drive. (but see my CONS below)- You could directly record to micro SD video card- You could turn off all the lights on device- You could access almost all the functions of camera using the mobile app- I did not try the included software on the CD. I just installed their software on Android and use the web browser admin to set it up.- I can remotely access it also using 3rd party android video cam software like IP Cam Pro through port 80- The power plug adapter is standard size (unlike the tiny thin one on the Foscam)What I did not like- You CANNOT record audio in recordings. Which is just so dumb... why would they not include it?- The video recordings are weird CRF format and can only be played via its mobile app or VLC once you download file to your local computer- The video recordings are kind of ridiculous in way files are saved. I did motion detection and it would record SEVERAL HUNDRED small video files that were 10-20 seconds each. Stupidest thing I have ever seen. So basically you have to wade through several hundred files to find something. Each one is named according to the date and time. And you'll basically have to go through several hundred video files if you used motion detection. There's nothing like other intelligent cameras that allow you to put 30 seconds before and after. Each file is like 4M each so compression is good. It's plain STUPID they would make hundreds of files of 10 seconds each. I guess the only other option is disable motion detection and use full day. Because software is too stupid to not allow user to add 30 seconds before and after.- Video recordings are somewhat pixelated and play very slow on my android Galaxy S2. It plays like it's in slow motion. Plays fine on VLC. Video is better than Foscam FI8910W.- Videos has NO SOUND and you cannot enable it- No way to tilt or pan the camera- The camera lens is less wide angle than the Foscam. So you will be able to see less of the room. Maybe 15% less width.I think it's better than the Foscam in terms of quality but it really is stupid in that it cannot record audio and playback on android devices suck and the motion detection recording is a joke. I kid you not. HUNDREDS of 4MB files of 10-15 seconds and each after the other. So one would be 9:00-9:01 and another is 9:02-9:03 and 9:04 - 9:05 and so on and so on. It's the dumbest recording algorithm I have ever seen on such a device. How hard is this? Motion, record. Wait 30 seconds. More motion? Keep recording to same file. No more motion after 30 seconds? Stop recording. Geez...
