Once I had the camera up and running I was pleasantly surprised by all its features and functionality. It took me 3 days though to get it up and running (I'm just your average computer savvy user). I had it running in wired mode within 15 minutes by following the instructions. Getting wireless to work, make it accessible over the Internet and setting email notifications up was painful though. The explanations, documentations and screen notes added by Panasonic to the camera software are clearly designed to drive anyone nuts. After I finally figured it all out I realized that it could have been very easy. Panasonic should just have provided decent documentation on how to set it up manually - instead of relying on the "Plug & Play" functionality of routers (aka UPnP). Others here have done a good job reviewing the camera features so I'm just going to add some notes on the setup that I hope might be helpful to other "not so technical users" like me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Setup Notes:The automatic setup worked until I got to the part  for wireless and Internet access (to be able to connect to the camera from outside via Internet). If you have the same trouble I would suggest making first sure that all the following settings are correct even if you THINK you entered them correctly (no typos etc.).***********************a) Most important: Network settings (all kind of problems derive from having these wrong).Go to > Setup Tab > Network(IPv4) > Connection Mode > Static > open the link and check the network settings. If your connection mode is set to Automatic then first restart the camera (Maintenance tab/Restart). Once it's up again put the Startup CD back in > start the setup program > search for the camera > select the camera > press "network settings" > check "specify an IP address".The following settings have to be filled in correctly here: 1) IPv4 address (this is the IP address of your camera on your local network and should have already been filled during the automatic setup (e.g. 192.168.0.253)), 2) Port Number is 80 by default.  80 is fine if you don't have any other device on your home network that you want to access from outside. I changed the port number to 8001 to avoid conflicts.3) Default Gateway & DNS server 1 should both be filled with your router's local IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.1).  That's the number that you use to access the settings of the router (e.g. by putting[...] into your Internet browser.3) Subnet mask is usually 255.255.255.04) I filled DNS server 2 with 4.2.2.1 following a screen shot that I found on the Internet. Honestly: I have no idea why but it seems to work.*************************b)  Set up port forwarding on your router. Usually you log into your router by typing the local IP address of the router into your Internet Browser  (e.g. by putting [...] into your Internet browser.)Somewhere on your router should be a setup form for port forwarding. It might be called differently though (e.g. Virtual Server, Address transalation).Setting up port forwarding only means that you map the port that you've chosen (8001 in my case) to the local IP address of your camera (192.168.0.253). For protocols choose "both" if there is a setting like that. Port forwarding will allow you to access the camera from the Internet.***********************************c) Go to > Setup > Dynamic DNS and register with [...](don't use the Internet tab). If the account link under "account" does not get filled then that means that your network settings are not correct (see point a, ignore the notes in red on the top of the screen, they refer to the online registration form that you haven't opened yet). If the account link gets filled then you have to click on the link to get to the [...] website and register. Once you're finished you can find the new Internet address for your camera on the Maintenance > Status tab. That address might not work if you are connected to the Internet through the same local network as your camera (ask someone else to test).***********************************d) Check your wireless settings (tab setup > wireless). After checking the wireless settings I noticed that the SSID said "Netcam" instead of having the name of my home network. I'm pretty sure I never entered that.***********************************e) Try restarting the camera after you made changes if it still doesn't work.***********************************f) Email notifications: that might only work if you use the email and the mail server that your ISP gave you (for the outgoing mail). I have Comcast cable Internet so I'm using [...] as server and my Comcast email account as login. If you want to get SMS text notifications then you have to find out what your phone email address is. It's your phone number followed by a specific domain that your cell phone service provider supplies. E.g. I have T-Mobile and so it's my cell phone number followed by [...].************************************The Panasonic customer support number is difficult to find on their website. It's 1-800-211-PANA (7262).I found these websites more helpful than the Panasonic website: [...][...][...]
