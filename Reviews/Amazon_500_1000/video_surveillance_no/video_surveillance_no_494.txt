Ive not written a review on any products I've purchased over the years from Amazon because Ive always been satisfied with them ...This product is such junk that at 0100hrs in the morning I felt compelled to write a review so that no one else wastes their money ...Product arrived timely from Amazon 2 days. Upon opening it I found the packaging to look like the cheesy China stuff you see in the dollar store...Packaging says 2-32GB TF cards..IM not sure what that means No card is included nor were there options for the color bases it shows.There is no wall mount that comes with it as advertised on their site...I only saw a slot for one micro SD Card ( must be ordered separately) Inside the highest quality item is the rubber stand that holds the cam. The cord, power pack, battery and cam itself are cheaply made for $135.00. I can't speak for the battery life this early in the game since we just purchased it.The directions are a nightmare. The 1 page 2 sided directions you'll never understand ...for example "Step 4 Check videos" makes no sense ..Turns out you have to set up a txt file and put date and time on it and then put it on the micro card after you've accessed it through your computer ..We have a new Macbookpro on Lion ..Says it works with Macs  ...Well the mini cd provided with the software and second manual you need to set this up won't fit in the computer dvd slot so its useless. So id say it doesn't work with macs...I did read where one buyer was able to email SpygearGadgets and get them to send him a file via email ..I can only get a answering machine that says to leave a message. Technical support seems unfounded let alone lifetime service ..I really have to question the value of the 1 year manufacturer warranty. However, I will hold Amazon to it ...Spygeargadgets web site says their products are made in USA of highest quality ...This was not made in the USA nor was it packaged in the USA ...Re Instruction Manuals:Page 2 of guide talks about upgrading software on DVR ...They ask you to put in cd and click on config.exe and copy this supposed file to your micro card root directory ?? Root directory is what?Im not sure who wrote the "USER GUIDE" but it too looks like someone not fluent in english tried to convert another language to tell us how to set this thing up..Heres an example.."Note: The exact instructing, Please as CD-software manual" What does that mean?  or how about this "Exception Clause: We don't guarantee for the document veracity, reliability or any content except regulate in proper laws. Including no guarantee for product suitable market or  suitable area promise" Meaning what ?One of the two files on mini cd is a 3 page "Software Manual" now this is different from USER Manual that comes in the box. Very confusing directions to add to confusion of the other manual ...Again if you can understand what the person is trying to tell you ...I couldn't.I spent 3 hrs trying to figure this out ..finally searched net and read someone else's directions on how to set this thing up...how to set the date and time, how to set up files and how to view them etc..As for the quality of the video ..for darkness at night video seems to be pretty good and sound is good..once you get it working ...It takes a least 5 seconds from first movement to actually come on and about the same when movement has stopped to stop. It is motion activated Sound alone will not activate it ...Many so-called 'spy shops' sell bargain rate hidden cameras and low-tech surveillance gadgets; toys that are as useless as they are cheap. But if you have a serious predicament, you need professional-level, high quality equipment and a support staff with trained expertise.On their Web Site they state....which I seriously beg to differ on ...."At Spy Tec, we pride ourselves on stocking only the highest quality, state-of-the-art spy and surveillance equipment such as Hidden Cameras, GPS tracking Devices, Nanny Cameras, Spy Accessories,  Bug Detection Devices and much, much more.Whether you are in the corporate world, a small business owner or a concerned parent, Spy Tec's discreet and knowledgeable staff of security experts will provide professional advice."In summation I'm truly amazed that any seller especially AMAZON would sell such poor quality device with such poorly written instructions that aren't even in proper English.For $135.00 I expected a lot more ...Most likely will return product and look at higher end products and spend $300-$400 to get something that doesn't seem like a cheap plastic toy from the dollar store.I would encourage AMAZON to take a serious look at this product and its instructions and discontinue selling this over priced poor quality CHINA junk that tarnishes their reputation.
