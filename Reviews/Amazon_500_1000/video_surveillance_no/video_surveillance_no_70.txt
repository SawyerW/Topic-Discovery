I've been trying to set up a remote monitoring system for a while now, and have experimented with a few different solutions including webcams and other stand-alone cameras. The same problems problems occur over and over:- When the router gets rebooted, invariably you can't connect to the camera without going back and fixing some part of the configuration.- Remote viewing through dynamic IP addresses is flaky, and many DDNS solutions don't work very well. And do you really want a static IP address just for this?- You need a computer switched on near the camera, or a web-server that the camera can stream to. That's somewhat awkward.- The image quality is so-so, and tends to be good enough to see a person entering a room, but hard to identify who it is.I'm pleased to say that the Logitech Alert system beats any of the others I've tried hands-down, and it's clearly designed with absolute simplicity in mind, together with the need to connect with the camera system remotely without a degree in network engineering.Everything is provided in the box, including various mounts, network cables and software. It took more time to individually unwrap each component than connect it together - the whole system was live in under 5 minutes. The software updates itself in seconds, and even setting up user accounts on their website took no time at all. In terms of positioning the camera, it's possible to place it on a stand, screwed to a wall, or attached to a window using the suction cup provided.This package does several things (very) well:- The software is extremely simple to use, yet offers some bells and whistles such as motion alerts by email, live recording and playback, and basic controls such as zoom. It's also written in English, and you'd be surprised how many other systems are not.- It handles Internet disconnection gracefully with an on-board SD card, and doesn't need any user action to help it 'remember' any IP settings.- Talking of IP settings, these are all under the hood so you can be blissfully unaware of how it works - which is such a major benefit that I'd buy this package for this alone.- Viewing remotely through a desktop browser in another location is as simple as visiting the website and logging in.- Viewing from a smartphone is even better. I used their free Android app, and the speed and quality surpassed my expectations.- The audio broadcast is very clear.- Adding additional cameras is straightforward, although you have to make sure your Internet bandwidth is capable of supporting the number of cameras you need.- You can switch off the LED lights that might give away the location of the unit - what a nice touch.But this package is NOT:- A completely wireless solution: the camera connects to an outlet unit and communicates to your router with another outlet unit. Although wiring is really minimal, there is always the one cable needed on the camera side.- A replacement for a multi-camera professional system - though it comes close, and for a fraction of the price might suffice for some commercial users.- A way to spy on your neighbor's license plates across the road - why would you anyway?Still, even with those caveats it's a remarkably good solution if you want to view a location remotely with a minimum of hassle.
