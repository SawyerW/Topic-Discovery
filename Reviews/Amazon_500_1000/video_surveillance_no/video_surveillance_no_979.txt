**** Updated - See latest comment at the bottom of this review *****I live in an apartment in a fairly secure neighborhood, but it would seem with the economic downturn, there are more thefts then usual these days.  So I decided to start building a security system.  I must say, after shopping around for several months for security systems and services, this by far is the best and easiest way to go!  My home is all about the internet, so, the decision to go with the wireless N camera was a good choice.  This camera was incredibly easy to set up with the software provided.  While I am a network head, I didn't need to use any brain power at all to get this camera up and running.  The most difficult thing is finding the right place to put the camera!  Once installed, I searched the D-LINK website for the Security Software so that I can record and playback video from my camera on my PC, even set it up to only record when there is motion in front of the camera!  Also, it seems easy to add additional cameras for other areas like the garage, entry way, and more!  Further, I can check on my apartment with video and audio from my Kindle Fire with the D-link app!  So, while I am away, I can check on my place!  Also, I can also go to D-Link's website from any other computer and log in and check that way too ... amazing, and my only initial cost was the camera!The only complaint I have is that the power cord from the wall plug to the camera is only 4 feet long.  So, that means splicing in another wire to get more length to get the camera high enough so its out of the way.  Being an electrician, that's simple, but for others it might not be.  The only other choice would be to mount the camera lower, about halfway up the wall.This was a very good decision and a great way to build up my own security system over time.  Best of all, its professional, and wireless - Living in an apartment never got better!***** this is an update below ******The camera has been working so well, I actually purchased a refurb one from Amazon, and it also worked awesome, and I saved a ton.  For those that are interested, I also have these camera email me when there is motion.  Since I use HOTMAIL, I thought I would post the configuration for them ....Dlink Security Camera - DCS-932LThe camera works with security software from DLINK, but the camera can also email images when there is an even, such as motion.  This is particularly useful when you only have email access and want to check up on your house, or whatever our camera is watching.Dlink Local Camera LoginSetup>EmailSMTP Server Address: smtp.live.comSMTP Server Port: 587 (default of 25 will not work)Sender E-mail Address: ** your email@hotmail.com address **Receiver E-mail Address: ** your email@hotmail.com address **User Name: ** your email@hotmail.com address **Password: ** Your email access password **Use SSL-TLS/STARTTLS  (No)  SSL-TLS  (NO - blank)  STARTTLS  (YES)***** Update 1/15/2014 *****I am now up to four cameras after I purchased a condo and moved out of the apartment.  I still very much like the items.  They are fairly simply to install.  I used to use the full recording software on my PC, but I have since found that letting the cameras email when there is motion is simpler and just as effective.  Further, I have installed battery back up power supplies on all cameras so that if the power goes out, the cameras can still record and email me.  Also, here in Idaho, its gets really cold, and that doesn't seem to affect one camera which I placed under an eve out of the rain overlooking my front door.  Also, I wanted to mention that the camera actually caught someone trying to break into my home about 2 months ago.  The would be burglar gave up when he attempted to enter and noticed by dead bolt locks, but I got some awesome images of him and have forwarded them to the local police which might be helpful in other neighborhood break-ins. The only complain I have is that it would be nice if there was an extension for the power cord available from D-Link.  I did wire my own low voltage power cord extension using speaker wire here on Amazon, but an nice clean extension, from D Link, would not only be profitable for them, but easier for those that don't have wiring experience. Also, there are occasional issues with ActiveX and Java, which are 3rd Party software add ons that are required by D Link to make these cameras 100% functional.  There are work arounds, but again, for those not versed in software work arounds it would be nice to use another platform rather than rely on these other companys.  But even with those small issues, this is by far one of the best purchases I have ever had on Amazon.
