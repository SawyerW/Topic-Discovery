Below is my initial review, however, the problem has been resolved -- see the addendum at the bottom of this post.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------This "could be" a great system - and may be for some. But not for me.  I have a modern home with good wiring, but since this system ONLY networks via electrical lines, it won't work for me. I had two cameras (one indoor and one outdoor) and both were very erratic - I'd lose the image for hours/days at a time, then it would come back.On Logitech's recommendation, I ran the diagnostics which showed that the "powerline performance" was inadequate. According to Logitech, it had to be over a value of 150. Mine ranged between 5 and 75. When on a separate electrical circuit, the performance was between 5 and 40. When the cameras were plugged into the same electrical circuit as the master (according to Logitech, they shouldn't be plugged into the same circuit as they can interfere with each other), the performance was betweeen 45 and 75. Never was it close to the minimum acceptable level of 150.The system has everything I could want - great image quality, decent night-vision IR, decent desk-top app, smart-phone connectivity, etc. The only thing I'd like to see them add (other than decent networking) is better user management - i.e., ability to have multiple user accounts and have the ability to limit users to one or more cameras (with or without admin rights).The software is pretty imature at this point - the motion detection isn't the best and when you "pan/zoom" (really move a virtual window within the full range of the camera's vision), it starts recording motion. The motion files run between 1.5 and 2.5 MB in size each and are stored on the camera's SD card as well as transfered to a base computer when connected. I suspect that the software will improve significantly over time, though.The system is supposed to send emails out when motion is detected, but that feature only worked about 10% of the time - out of about 40 motion files, I only got about 4 emails.Unfortunately, they went back to Amazon today - I really like the system, but the networking was just unacceptable, at least in my case.As a post-note, I had called Logitech support 4 or 5 times about the issues I was having and the support personnel had no recommendations for me. So, after dropping it off today to be sent back to Amazon, I got a call from Logitech and they want to try to troubleshoot the networking issue - I suspect I won't be the only person with this issue - and apparently, they suspect the same. I'll post results if/when I have them.bert---------------------------------------------------------------------------------post-note 1---------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/24/10 update - I spent some time on the phone with the development staff and they think the issue is my "whole house surge protection" system that's attached to my circuit breaker panel. Unfortunately, I can't just switch it off to find out if that's the issue, and am not sure I want to eliminate that from my house!  It's a dilemma.  But, if you're considering this system, you may want to make sure you don't have a whole-house surge protection system installed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------post-note 2---------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/28/10 - As a follow-up, Logitech has been spending a lot of time with me to determine what the cause of my problem was. At this point, several facts have been determined:1) The whole-house surge protector didn't seem to affect the system.2) I have 3 UPS units on the circuit that the Logitech master bridge was plugged into. It appears that these UPS units had an adverse affect on the system.3) A remote Logitech camera was plugged into an outlet that also had a wireless internet camera plugged into it (Trendnet TV-IP410W). The Logitech system did not work well at all when this Trendnet camera was plugged into the same outlet as the Logitech camera. Apparently the wireless transmitter in the Trendnet camera had ill-affect on the Logitech camera.I have since moved the Logitech bridge (master unit) to an outlet in a different room, on a different circuit than the 3 UPS's and unplugged the Trendnet camera, and the system is now working fine.  MUCH credit goes to the Logitech people who have been fantastic in working with me to determine the cause of the problem.I can sincerely recommend this system - with the simple caveat that you may need to find the correct outlet(s) to use based on any equipment that may interfere with the networking of the master or camera units.bert
