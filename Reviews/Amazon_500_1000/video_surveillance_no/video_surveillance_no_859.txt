This Defender Sentinel Surveillance System works well for my needs and is also a very good value. To be perfectly clear, this is not a high-end system with high definition cameras, but it isn't priced like a high-end system either. This is somewhat of a budget system that exceeded my expectations for what you get and how well it works. Here are my observations:Note: We already own a Zmodo Surveillance System (PKD-DK0865-500GB) used to monitor our small business, so it was easy for me to switch out the main DVR unit and cameras to do a side-by-side comparison. The Defender and Zmodo systems have roughly the same specs and features, but the Defender is a little more expensive (at the time of this review), so is it worth it? The answer for us would be "yes" since the cameras on this system are clearer and have much better night vision clarity and range. I will be making comparisons as appropriate.Our Use - We recently bought an old but very large building for my wife's business and needed a way to monitor the six exits and the retail shop space.Included:* Main Control Unit - this is a fairly small unit (smaller than most DVD players)* 8-Cameras - these are also fairly small, good physical quality and include mounting hardware* USB Mouse - connects to Control Unit* Remote Control - gives access to all menu functions (batteries included)* Required Cables - 65' Video/Power cables* Power Supplies - one for the Control Unit and two for the cameras (uses splitters to distribute the power between the cameras)* Window Warning Stickers* Software CDFeatures:+ Camera; IR Illumination for night vision+ User configurable Options; Privacy Zones (blackout areas in the display), Motion Zones (areas where motion triggers an alarm)+ Network Access; Can be viewed by a PC on the local network+ Alarm Notification; Audible alert and E-Mail capability (which works very well)+ Display Options; Includes a VGA monitor connection and BNC/video out for TV viewing+ Remote Control; Really makes it easy to quickly access features+ Remote User Access; Can be viewed remotely on PC/MAC, iPhone, and AndroidPros:+ Setup; Basic configuration is very easy+ Image Quality; Good for basic security needs in both bright and dark settings, better than the Zmodo cameras+ Night Vision; Surprisingly good clarity and range, also much better than the Zmodo system+ Value; Lots of cameras and features at a reasonable cost+ Options; Can be made to do everything we need it to do+ No Exposed Camera Wires; Wires can pass though the mounting hardware so are hidden and protected, an advantage over the Zmodo mounts, or you can choose to have the wires run outside the mounts if you don't want to put holes through the wallCons:- Slightly Washed Out Colors; Colors are somewhat muted, but can be individually adjusted in the controls to get the best possible picture for the lighting conditionHints/Notes:* Alarmed Events can be recorded and searched on later* A 500GB Hard Drive can record up to two years of video on this system* Placing a camera too close to a window will cause the IR to reflect and blind the camera when it shifts into night vision mode* Supports PTZ Cameras (not included); we use Zmodo Home Indoor Pan Tilt Surveillance Camera with IR Night Vision for 80 feetThis system covers my needs very well and provides a lot of advanced features that are nice to find on a budget system.Highly Recommended!CFH
