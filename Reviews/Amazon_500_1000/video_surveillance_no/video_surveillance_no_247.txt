**UPDATE BELOW**** NEW UPDATE BELOW **1) First I had problems being able to write to the card. I think that you need a) to have power plug OUT .. b) insert card .. c) then power on. After this, I had no problems writing to the card.2) Playback from device seems to be B&W; only, however, playback via VLC on computer was color with timestamp in bottom right. (See update below)3) It's certainly compressed video, the playback isn't as clean as the original source. (See update below)4) The manual is in "chin-lish" .. but it all seems to make sense.5) Passthrough to external monitor image is as clean as original. (but playback is not see #2 & #3)6) All in all, really not bad for the money paid, I am waiting on a different model tomorrow which is 2x the price. I'll let you know which turns out to be tops.7) The size of this unit is about same as pack of cigarettes .. quite compact.8) It TAKES MICRO-SD cards (what the manufacturer seems to refer to as TF cards (tiny flash??))9) Navigation and setup very barebones and simple.10) I have not played too much with Motion Detection feature, but it does seem to have the feature.11) It comes default set to PAL TV output. Easy enough to change to NTSC, but this change is not done via the menu system. You need to add a file to the ROOT-DIR of your Micro-SD card called "system.txt" .. that file should contain only 7 characters .. F15V0S9 == F = Framerate (default 15) V = video system (default 0 for PAL .. change to 1 for NTSC) .. S = sensitivity (dafault 9) they say higher number = more sensitive. They say to remove the file once it has been read once since it will otherwise be read during boot each time which is unnecessary.1-star off for the obviously compressed video quality, which might not be fair to the unit, but I would have liked to have seen slightly better quality. FYI, I am running an Everfocus EHD730 Camera as input.**UPDATE AFTER A DAY OF PLAYING WITH IT**Regarding #2 above: The playback on through the device is IN COLOR. Maybe I just had it in a strange state PAL vs. NTSC in my initial experience.Regarding #3 above: lower frame rates (5fps) seem to have better playback quality (this is to be expected) .. but still not as good as original source (also to be expected).A thought: At the price of this unit, it may be advantageous to place it "inline" for each camera with a more standard "security DVR" for backup purposes perhaps as it's passthrough video is clean "original image quality" and for a small camera system, it might be nice to be able to simply pop a card and save/share the video.. again, just a thought.** NEW UPDATE **See my review of another portable DVR product, where I compare directly to this product .. http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Detector-Recorder-Security-Surveillance/dp/B002QHBNXI/** Will update again should the need arise, but currently I'm very happy with the unit. I've added a star (total of 5) based on my new findings. **
