EXECUTIVE SUMMARYAmazing features for the price, but if -- like me -- you've never setup an IP camera before, it can be a bit of an adventure.  If you're on a tight deadline or want something that just works without some tinkering, you should probably look elsewhere and plan to pay double (or triple) the price of this guy.That having been said, my camera is now working great. It's $200 worth of functionality for $50 plus the time to figure it out.HELPFUL TIPS FOR THOSE BRAVE SOULS WHO WANT TO SAVE THE MONEY BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING(you're my people)Below are the problems I encountered and how I surmounted them.Problem #1: Wifi will not work; router can only see camera when it is plugged into an Ethernet portSolution that worked for me: Firmware updateDetails:1) Go to Wanview's website (I'd post the URL, but Amazon will delete it)2) Click the "Download Firmware" link beside the entry "Series B Pan Tilt Camera"3) Once the ZIP file has been downloaded, unzip it (it contains a single BIN file)4) With the camera connected via Ethernet cable, point your browser at the camera's IP address5) Click the "Maintain" tab at the top6) Click the "Upgrade Firmware" button on the right7) Beside "Upgrade Firmware" browse to your BIN file and click submit.I may have had to reboot or cycle power after the update and unplugging the ethernet cable.Problem #2: Included software has very limited functionalitySolution that worked for me: Use iSpy insteadDetails:1) Go to CNET downloads website and search for "iSpy" (I'd post the URL, but Amazon will delete it)2) Download "iSpy_4_2_6_0.zip"3) Once the ZIP file has been downloaded, unzip it (it contains 2 files)4) Launch "iSpySetup.msi"5) Also need the VLC plugin: Go to VideoLAN's website6) Download VLCProblem #2B: iSpy's configuration wizard does not know this cameraSolution: (from a most helpful fellow at the iSpy connnect forum)I just figured out how to add my new Wansview NCB 541W to iSpy. All I did was to catch the Commands via SmartSniff an add them manually to the ptz.xml file.[here is the vitally important magic.]The Videostream for the VLC Plugin is:h t t p : / / [USER] : [PW] @ [URL] / videostream.asfType the above into iSpy's video stream VLC URL field.  Here's how to get to it:[your camera] > rt-click > Edit > "Camera" tab > click "..." button beside "Source"A "Video Source" dialog should popup.Click on the "VLC Plugin" tab (this is why you needed that plugin above)and enter the above URL into the VLC URL field.[I think this next bit is optional but helpful]I added an extra Item to my ptz.xml file with the commands as follows:<Camera Make="WansView" Version="NCB 541W" id="26"><CommandURL>/decoder_control.cgi</CommandURL><Commands><Center>command=25</Center><Left>command=6</Left><LeftUp>command=93</LeftUp><Right>command=4</Right><RightUp>command=92</RightUp><Up>command=2</Up><Down>command=0</Down><LeftDown>command=91</LeftDown><RightDown>command=90</RightDown><Stop>command=1</Stop><ZoomIn></ZoomIn><ZoomOut></ZoomOut><ExtendedCommands><Command Name="Stop">command=1</Command><Command Name="Horizon patrol">command=28</Command><Command Name="Stop horizon patrol">command=29</Command><Command Name="Vertical patrol">command=26</Command><Command Name="Stop vertical patrol">command=27</Command></ExtendedCommands></Commands></Camera>Edit: You might have to adjust the "id" attribute in the first line according to the place this camera will take in the file.Problem #3: Email on motion not working (test failed)Solution that worked for me: Use Gmail's SMTPDetails:On the Wansview web interface, Go to "Alarm" > "eMail Settings"Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - requires TLS3 or SSL: smtp.gmail.com (use authentication)Use Authentication: YesPort for TLS/STARTTLS: 587Port for SSL: 465Account Name: your full email address (including@gmail.com or @your_domain.com)Email Address: your email address (username@gmail.comor username@your_domain.com)Password: your Gmail passwordSource: [...]NOTE: I have not addressed port forwarding, because I didn't need it.Hope this helps,Ken
