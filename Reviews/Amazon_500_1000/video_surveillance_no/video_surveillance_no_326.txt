Recently, we expanded our store and needed to add some new security cameras; but, as I was searching to upgrade our existing system, I came across this system that used POE cameras.  Since I had to replace the DVR and add 4 new cameras anyway, I decided it was worth it to just upgrade to a completely new POE system - and this has turned out to be an excellent system![*** Installation ***]Before installing, I pulled the NVR apart and replaced the single 1TB hard drive with 2x 2TB drives.  There was nothing complicated about that at all - and the extra power and SATA cables were all provided.Since I didn't know much about POE before this, I did some research to verify that it works with standard Ethernet cables - and that has turned out to be an excellent benefit.  In fact, the technology is so cool that I went though and switched our VOIP phones over to POE once this project was done. :)The install itself was extremely straightforward since you really don't have to do anything more than run an Ethernet cable to each camera.  The system includes pre-built cables; but, we just built our own to the correct length.Once everything was installed, the configuration took a little more thought - but was still fairly simple.  The system does offer a ton of configuration options, so it took a bit to be sure everything was setup correctly.I also wanted to keep the NVR in a secure location, while being able to monitor it from the primary work areas.  We ended up running an HDMI cable from the NVR to an HDMI splitter and then plugged in 2x 50' HDMI cables to go to different monitors that were already hung on the wall.  This provided exactly what I had been looking for - and was a far better solution than what we had previously.[*** Performance ***]The cameras are a huge step forward compared to the previous cameras we had, so it may not be completely fair to compare them directly - but they look great!  We have a couple of cameras that are running in complete darkness in our vault, and the picture is still excellent.  Honestly, it looks like the lights are on full.We ended up using the 4 cameras that were bundled with this system and then purchased 3 more Dahua IPC-HFW4100S cameras, which seem to be almost identical in quality to the cameras in this system - but they cost a bit less.  We also added on one Dahua IPC-HDB3200C/2.8 camera to cover our back entry - and that also looks excellent.It's interesting because, even though the performance, picture, and overall quality seem better in almost every way than our previous system, there is an occasional glitch from the network - which is a reminder that these are using standard IP technology.  (We are using the integrated 8 port switch, so there isn't any other traffic on our camera network, but the frame rate and quality are cranked to the highest level for all the cameras.)I also like how the display can be configured to have one main area in the screen and then the rest of the cameras forming a border.  That lets us monitor the front of our store directly to know if people up there need help, while still monitoring the other areas that require security.At this point, I haven't had a chance to mess with remote viewing the cameras - but I plan to get that setup just so I can check out the store if the alarm ever goes off - without having to drive over there or sending the police.[*** Conclusion ***]Overall, I can't think of anything bad to say about this system.  For the quality and performance, I would have expected to pay a lot more money - so the value is definitely there!If you're looking for good security cameras with a video recorder, then I would highly recommend this system.
