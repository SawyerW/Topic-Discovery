I purchased this tablet on release day, & very much like it.Things about it I like:Gorilla Glass screenSnappy processorEnough memory for multitasking.Sturdy BuildThere is only one thing I do not like:How some things on the web do not display properly. (Videos, etc)A great buy for a fun Android tablet.
