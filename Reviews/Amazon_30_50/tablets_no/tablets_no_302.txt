All of my purchases from amazon have been execellent,until this time. The nokia n810 from Thrifty Computer was a waste of my money and time.The unit comes without the correct user manual,charger, and earbuds.Tried to use the n810 without any success.Will not purchase any products from Thrifty Computer again.
