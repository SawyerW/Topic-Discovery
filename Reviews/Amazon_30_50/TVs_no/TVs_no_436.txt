Sony products are occasionally overpriced, but, nearly always, higher quality than competitive offerings. At this price (purchased @ $1314 around October, 2006), this was an even better value. Every output and input you could imagine + a resolution that is unbeatable, including darker pitches. Nicely done, Sony. Well-priced, Amazon.
