Superior picture, inputs, outputs, and auxilliaries.Have not experienced the reflection problem frequently attributed to this screen.Even non HD signals are good.Zoom feature (picture sizing) is very handy.TV sound quality is acceptable but who would watch a TV this size without a home theater?Great TV for a good price.
