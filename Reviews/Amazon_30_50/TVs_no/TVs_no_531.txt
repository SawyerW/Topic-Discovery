Very pleased with Amazon.com from price, to delivery, to set-up, to picture quality.  Amazing color and detail, especially for sporting events.  Would recommend this product without hesitation.  Only drawback is delay (about 3 seconds) when changing channels, otherwise extremely pleased with this TV.
