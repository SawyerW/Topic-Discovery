Could not be more pleased.  Set-up was relatively easy, picture is outstanding and sound is surprisingly good after reading so many reports about poor quality sound.  My only disappointment is that Samsung doesn't include with the TV the wireless internet gadget.  The Amazon service and delivery was very satisfactory.
