FANTASTIC !It does everything the specs call for, without compromise.Rugged.  Reliable.  Flexible.  Extrermely high performance.Everything in my Nikon digital system works with it.The price was attractive.  I bought one body to try out.The next day I ordered a D80 body for each of my staff photographers.
