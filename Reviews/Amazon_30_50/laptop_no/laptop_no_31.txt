This laptop is really worth the money.It's really fast and received in good condition.This is the first time i bought refurbished laptop.Initially i'm worried about buying used laptop,but now i'm really happy.Seller installed all necessary softwares for daily purpose.There is no unwanted softwares.I planning to add additional 2GB  RAM.
