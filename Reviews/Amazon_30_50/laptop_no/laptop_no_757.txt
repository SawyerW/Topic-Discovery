My brother and I bought Toshiba laptops different models, his from Toshiba mine from an electronics store. Both of the laptops malfunctioned and are useless!Store and Toshiba won't stand behind them for repair or replace even while under purchased warranty. They argue there is nothing wrong with the laptops.
