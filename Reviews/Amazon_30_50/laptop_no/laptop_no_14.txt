Cons:a)Bad Hard Drive Partition,which makes the hard drive feel even smaller.b)Bad Battery Life.c)Locks-up frequently.d)A lot of useless software.e)So so customer service.f)Modem problems.Pros:a)When it works, is a pretty decent, basic computer.Next time I will go with pentium or centrino, with a bigger hard drive and DVD-R.
