we needed to get another monitor for my mom's house and we previously had the older model summer infant day/night monitor which i had no actual complaints about except that the actual hand piece is bulky and looks like a cordless phone from the 1980's.  the samsung seemed to get good enough reviews that i thought how could i go wrong?!  ...soo many ways.  first, the clarity of the camera is far worse than the summer infant.  i can't even tell if my son's eyes are open or closed in the monitor.  and it's not smooth.  like the rate per sec is seriously low.. so it's very choppy and since the quality is so poor, i'm not sure if he's moving a cover over his face or over his lovee.  the sound is also definitely not as clear as the summer infant monitor, so i can't tell if he's just mumbling to himself, or actually calling out to me since i can't tell what he's saying.  and lastly there's was a feature that at first i thought may have been a good idea, which was an alert that either vibrates or beeps when the monitor picks up a sound (which at first was going off constantly until i found the sensitivity dial on the camera - no biggie - that was an user error)  but unfortunately, the choice is either vibrate or beep and nothing else.. like off.  so you don't have a choice and it could literally drive you batty.  additionally, the battery is quite questionable.  i left it on one night (after it was fully charged) and put it on 'sleep' to test out the feature, and by the morning it was out of batteries.  what's the point in that?  i'd give it 0 stars.  there's absolutely nothing positive i can say about this monitor other than the hand piece is possibly better looking than the OLD summer infant monitor i had.  but it's cheaply made and only marginally more attractive than my old monitor.
