The Lorax security system seemed like a great price for what you get.  And it works!But.... putting it together is not as easy as advertised.  I will admit, I am not very technically minded.  First of all, there are items that are not included in the set that will be needed such as a 15 pin VGA cable or a BNC terminated cable.  Another annoyance was that all the chords are very short!  The 2 power chords (one for the cameras and the other for the digital recorder) are only ~ 3 feet long.  Plus the head of each power chord is a large rectangle size that does not easily fit on a strip.  Also, the Ethernet Cable a mere 3 feet, too!  Realistically, most people will need much longer chords.  Once I got the cameras working the color was off -everything had a faint green tinge that would not go away no matter the settings I changed.  My last quibble is that for some reason I thought this system was wireless.  As in the cameras were wireless but this is not the case so you will need to find a way to snake the wires that connect the cameras to the digital recorder in between walls etc. to hide them -need I say how much work this is?!ProsGood priceIncludes mouseInternet remote monitoring- need broadband router and computerConsShort chords - 2 power and Ethernet ~ 3 feet eachInstructions that skip multiple stepsCameras not true colors, poor image quality?Does not include VGA or BNC cablesSnaking the wires from the camera is difficultMust find/have a monitor that works well with this system.This is not an easy set up, especially with all the issues of chords that are too short, missing cables and figuring out getting the right placement of all the wires and snaking them.  The computer set up was relatively simple in comparison. You can do it but it would be easier to hire someone and I am not sure if the quality of the camera images are that great.  But the price is right for someone who wants security and is on a budget.Would I get this again?  Only if it came with a person to install it!
