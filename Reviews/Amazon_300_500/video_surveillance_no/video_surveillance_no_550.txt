Yes these are great dummies for indoor use ,even out on your porch, number  one they are motion detected in other words the have  cue lights that start blinking when you walk up on them with any movement, also for the kids or that babysitter or home services that are done inside your home # 1 they will have you wondering if there real or our they not and most won't take the chance to steal something or do something wrong. these are so cost effective you can't go wrong as i say in most my security products that once again deterrance is 90% of the battle,but you have a cleaning crew who comes in once a week and there walking by these camera's and then to top it of they they start blinking when there noticed as you walk infront of them. and if anyone asks you never give up your secret and that means the kids as well as far as every one is concerned they run off your computer and have wireless trancievers that work off your router ,know most you won't have to go all there ,they will just  be noticed. so for a few bucks give your self that extra security, I promise you will have the babysitter wondering on this one and your indoor service people as well and alot of times that's were the theft begins,if it's not them thereself it's them telling someone who has the guts to break in,until there told there is camera's all over the inside of this place, remeber were are in some desperate times and you would be surprised who would be the one to think of stealing from you so  if you don't have the money for the real thing this is the next best thing DETERRANC, DETERRANCE, DETERRANCE !!! so as a person who has been in the security business I  give this product a above average Value
