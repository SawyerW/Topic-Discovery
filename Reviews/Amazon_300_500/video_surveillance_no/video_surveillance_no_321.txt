I want to monitor some of my property at night and after much searching it seemed Foscam was the most popular IR camera manufacturer.I suppose these cameras are the low end of Foscam's line-up at $95 each and they do now have an hd version but at a much higher price.My largest disappointment with the camera is the video quality, out of the box the focus is almost unbearable. I contacted Foscam technical support about the focus, I have a lot of trouble understanding people with a strong accent so I started emailing them and they said there is no focus adjustment for this model. Well, after clicking through their website I found the focusing procedure which involves simply removing the lens cover, light board and rotating the lens. That helped but there is no way to get a real clear focus you just have to live with sub-par videos.I must comment a bit more about the technical support. I asked them a couple of questions about the video quality and it always came back to there must be something wrong with MY network or MY PC setup. I even connected the camera by a direct Ethernet wired connection through which I get Gigabit communication between the PC's in my house with no change in video quality. I have 2 of these cameras and they both are exactly the same. The video is not focused and is very pixelated, so bad I can't even recognize someone I know at 60' daytime much less at night.Like I said, $95 is a relatively inexpensive camera and maybe I'm expecting too much but the technical support is important to me, especially in this situation because I'm new to this and I did not have a very good experience. On the positive side, the cameras are solid, feel well built. They are easy to configure to the pc, they even have WPS capability, upgradeable firmware etc..Like I said the price of the cameras is to be considered, you get what you pay for and if the technical support had been acceptable I probably would have bought some of their upper grade models but I am probably going to look elsewhere next timeThanks,Mike
