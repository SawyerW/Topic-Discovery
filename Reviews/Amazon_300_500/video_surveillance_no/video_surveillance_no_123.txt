We live in a rural area on a farm and although my house sits 1,200 feet off the highway, it nearly shouts "COME ROB ME" to travelers going up and down the road. Our nearest neighbor is too far to see our property and despite having dogs here on the farm, I wanted something that would visually communicate "we are at home" at night, when we were really gone, for days (and nights) at a time.This device emits illumination inside my living room (or any room I want to place it) and from the outside, it looks like someone is inside watching TV.  I've actually done surveillance (as a licensed private investigator here in Texas) and have written in reports and synopsis that residences where surveillance has been conducted, "revealed television set was on, inside the house."  I was even able to tell what TV station the set was on... long story and you don't need the details...To me, as I set this device up inside my home and went outside to monitor the effectiveness of this device, IT LOOKED REAL TO ME!This tiny unit flashes illumination inside the room and colors change (from greens, to white, to blues and others) and it perfectly imitates a television being viewed. The trick is to place it so it illuminates a wall or drapes and make certain it can't be seen by a passerby.It was so convincing to me, I ordered a second one to put in my 5th wheel RV. Now, when we are gone, it looks like someone is not only inside our home watching TV, but it also appears we have guests staying in the RV...I am delighted in this product... It probably costs a few pennies per day to run, it doesn't heat up the house (like if leaving the real TV on) and it cycles off automatically when the sun comes up in the morning.
