Outstanding! I wanted an easy to install high quality security camera that would log activity. Opening the box to check the contents, you can't help but notice a lot of thought went into the packaging. My hopes were  high at this point. Removing the various parts of the system, it was also obvious there was a lot of thought in the engineering design. Everything was well made, and even the screws used to keep access hatches on the camera and camera powere box were held in place after unscrewed so you couldn't lose them.I installed in under 2 hours. Software load was smooth, system start up uneventful and routine. Camera works well, has a very good quality image, and the motion detector works well and doesn't go off all the time. There were a lot of things that could go wrong in a system like this, and none did. I'm a happy customer. I know I'll be looking for another camera and wish the price wasn't so high, though. $330 or the system and $270 for a second camera? You need to work that down. I can watch live from anywhere on the net even with my home computer off with images sent over my home network directly from the camera. I'm receiving email notices of motion detector activity and learning how to set the motion alrm threshold to reduce alerts even furhther. Most alarms set off by insects visiting the infrared lights overnight. I'm thinking if I turned the camera lights off and installed seperate light 10 feet away, almost all motion alerts logged overnight would stop. Haven't signed up for the $80/year ability to reveiw the historical log yet, but don't think that's too bad a price for that aility given what a security frim would charge me for the same capability.If you want an easy to install one camera system that is fully functional and a snap to install, look no further! You'll pay more than you might with some competitive products, but the total lack of hassle in getting this up and running made that a great investment.
