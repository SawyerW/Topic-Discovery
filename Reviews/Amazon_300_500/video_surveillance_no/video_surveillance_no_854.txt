UPDATE-  Since I wrote my review below, I was contacted by Infant Optics and they have fixed the situation in a satisfactory manner.  We are going to continue to use the monitor for now (once we receive the new battery).  Once the review was written the company was very fast acting to rectify the situation which was great and showed their customer service as a high priority which is nice to see.I ordered this after reading the reviews and thought we would be happy.  Well, our son is only 6 weeks old, and has only slept in his room 8 days, and the monitor is dead already!!!  I'm soooooooooooo upset about this.  It keeps turning off, and not going to VOX, but actually turning off.  Then it won't turn on when he's crying. If not plugged in, it only stays on, maybe 20 minutes.  And last night it was turning off even when it was plugge din. Might I add that his bedroom is on the 2nd floor and ours is on the first, so between him being fussy and colicky we're already run upstairs enough.  Don't need this added issue.So I emailedInfant Optics.  There first response was that "as with all electronics, batteries will die if kept below 50 degrees."  What!?!?  Where the heck do you think i'm keeping this monitor, outside?!?!?  So I wrote back and said that wasn't it.  So then I was told I had two options.  1- order a new one from amazon and return this one. 2- send this one to infant optics and they will send another.My big concern to them was that I'm then without a monitor at all, for probably at least a week if not more.  That is not an option with a baby!I will never use this brand for anything again.
