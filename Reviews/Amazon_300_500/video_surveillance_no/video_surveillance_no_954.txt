This camera will suffice to detect intruders but there are better solutions.1. Construction is very good. The housing seems solid and the mounting bracket is very sturdy and holds its position. Doesn't wiggle in the wind.2. Angle of view in my camera is a measured 30 degrees, not the 39.8 degrees (horizontal) as advertised. I doubt that it has a 6mm lens, more likely a 9mm.3. Can't read license plates unless the vehicle is very close. This is due to the 640x480 resolution. At night, the reflectance built into the plates washes them out completely. The nighttime effect is likely common to all IR illuminated cameras.4. Nighttime illumination is very good. I can easily see and detect objects at the end of my driveway which is about 50 feet away.5. Wireless works pretty well. My camera is about 30 feet from the router and there are several intervening walls.6. Instruction manual is thorough and written in decent English.7. Daytime colors are horrible. Blues and greens are completely washed out. My grass looks like it is covered in snow. Apparently there is no IR cut filter in this camera. This is not good if you are attempting to identify an interloper by noting the color of his shirt (or car).8. You have to deal with the pigtails for the little AC power converter and the reset button. If you decided to hardwire this unit with Cat-5 cable (rather than wireless) you could run the power up that cable and use a POE splitter at the camera to power it. That would get rid of the AC power converter.9. Works with ZoneMinder and Blue Iris software.I have this camera installed over my driveway now but I will replace it with one with higher resolution. I will then move the Tenvis to sideyard duty where its issues aren't so important.
