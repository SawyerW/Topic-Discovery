I've been wanting to get a motion sensor camera for my second home in upstate New York.  Primarily for security purposes and also because I am a wildlife nut.  I've been curious of what animals are roaming around my back yard when I'm not there.  I got the camera when I was on vacation and I set it up, sadly my generator did keep the wildlife away, but it did take a picture everytime I walked into the back yard.  I have the camera set on a tree in a rear corner of my grassy area in the backyard and it's approximately 55 feet from the corner of my driveway and it detected my movement and took a picture (daytime).  It did take a few night time shots and did catch a deer from about 20 feet away and it was crystal clear.  All of the pictures it took so far are fantastic.  Clear, no blur and sharp.The one error I did make was with regard to the sensitivity.  The instructions state that during the warmer months you'll need to set the sensitivity to "High" so the camera can differentiate between body heat and other objects.  My home is in rural farmland and forest and I've been trying to determine if I have a bear or coyote (or both) roaming through my backyard.  I left some chicken bones out one night and they were gone the next morning.  Sadly the sensitivity was on "Normal".  Had it been on "High" I would have captured the critter that took them!  Other than that, the camera has been great and I plan to buy a second or third one.The camera does not come with an SD card so you'll have to get those.  I did and I also got the cable lock (highly recommended).Well I've been away from the house for two weeks and I'll find out this coming weekend what's been going on there.  I hope I see lots of critters!!  I'll let you all know how the camera did.Ted
