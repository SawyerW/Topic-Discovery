I've had the same problems as the 1 star reviews of this product and obviously have had some IT experience under my belt.  The instructions even if followed to the T yielded no results as well as not being able to ping the camera from my webbrowser(s)  After several hours of frustration and trying different things even suggestions from the web.  I was not able to get a picture nor able to get this product working.  I kept getting the message the device does not want to accept a connection while it was tethered to my router, I had not even gotten to the wireless part because I could not even get into the camera itself after several hours of trying.  I tried looking for updated firmware, changing the several things on my router, but I quickly realized that I had a substandard product a hit or miss item and a defective poorly manufactured product.If you want to frustrate yourself for several hours and have nothing better to do, want to waste your time playing with JUNK and raise your blood pressure, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  If you want to get something that actually WORKS and your not into being an IT detective, then get something else... this product IS A JOKE.  Rather the instructions that came with it are MISLEADING and will have you trying to fit the square peg in the round hole....My shipment didn't come with the REAL instructions, you have to download them by googling the model number of the camera... I didn't realize that your ROUTER IP CONFIG has to be 192.168.0.X!!!! not the REGULAR 192.168.1.X  After that you have to follow the WORD DOC instructions and you should be able to get into the CAMERA to make your Settings...I wish they had made that CLEAR but the instructions that came with it made me change the last octet of the IP address to the same octet of my ROUTER!!! Causing many problems...This will HELP the 1 Star reviewers... I think....[...]
