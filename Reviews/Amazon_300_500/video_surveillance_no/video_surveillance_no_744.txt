I absolutely despise this monitor, but on the other hand it's the best.  Let me explain.When stating whether something is good, you have relative and absolute.RELATIVE to other baby monitors on the market, this one is good.  You can talk to the baby, it supports up to 4 cameras, and the image quality is good (even at night, as long as the camera is close to the baby).Without comparing it to other baby monitors, this one is, by itself, a complete piece of trash.-The battery life is laughable -- if you actually use the video feature, you'll get MAYBE 1 - 1.5 hours of battery life.  If you turn off the LCD screen, it goes up to maybe 2-3 hours tops.-The audio stops working for no reason.  We are on our second one and have the same issue as the first one: no audio.  When the baby cries or makes other noises, the LED's on the unit light up to signify that it's receiving the noise, but there is no audio.  And yes, for all you wannabe technical support experts, the volume is turned up.  The only "fix" I've found was to hit it against a table or desk -- then it would kick in, but for how long?-If you have multiple cameras set up and one of them becomes unplugged, you can't use the SCAN option (which switches between all cameras every few seconds).  It just starts to beep and hangs on the missing camera instead of bypassing it.Here's my advice:  buy this monitor from a store that takes easy returns.  Keep the box, receipt, instructions, and everything else in the box.  When it dies, return it or pull a switcheroo.  This product has many manufacturer's defects but Motorola doesn't really care since this product represents very little of their bottom line.The absolute best worst monitor on the market.  I hate it, but there's nothing else.  Now, please excuse me as I'm off to buy my third one.
