I had been looking to update my analog camera system and DVR and wanted to invest in a quality megapixel IP solution that I could rely on to give me images that could actually be useful in the event that something happened at my house and I needed evidence.The Vivotek IP8332 was recommended time and time again on various forums and I was able to find video demos on YouTube that seemed to show that this was a great investment for under 500 bucks per cam, which in the world of IP cams is actually very cheap!The manual is a bit sketchy but if you read through it and go into the menus and experiment you can easily figure it out and get some amazing results.The camera has the ability to stream 4 different quality and resolution streams via web interface, droid or other smartphone, email pictures of events or upload to a storage device such as a NAS. Using the built in Linux OS it even has the ability to setup Dynamic DNS and IP forwarding for access outside of your network. I use IP Cam Viewer Lite (Free for up to 5 cams) on my droid and am able to keep tabs on everything at home even when away.In my situation I have setup several motion detection boxes on each cam and when triggered they will record to a local drive using the included and free ST7501 multicam software, take several frame grabs and both store them on a server and email them all in 1280 x 720 HD yes it's a 1 megapixel cam which is the low end of HD but it's HD none the less.The only drawbacks that I've found is the low light image quality, it's far better than the old analog cams that I had in the past but I've yet to find the secret sauce that was used in the videos that I've seen on YouTube. My lighting conditions aren't pitch black in fact there is a fair amount of street and house lighting but I've obviously setup something wrong since I've not been able to match the quality they showcase in their videos. In the day time, it's another story, the images are super crisp and ultra high quality.On a recent UPS delivery the driver didn't deliver a package that was supposed to be there that day by 10:30am, at 5:30pm the tracking updates to say that delivery attempt was unsuccessful and would be attempted the next day. I went over the recordings and pics, found the driver had been to my house at about 11am was there for 20 seconds, never got out of his truck and left. I called UPS, emailed them the pics and a new driver was there the next day with my package, I guess it was hard to argue with the time/date stamps and the license plate of his truck on my cams!
