Bought the 750 master system with outdoor camera and then added a second outdoor camera within 7 days. The very first time I took it out of the box and plugged it in the video image came up immediately BUT...then it vanished and I could not get the camera recognized again. Ended up installing the Commander software on a different laptop in the house and got it working. Probable total time from the first attempt to when it was working was 90 minutes. Camera does not seem to interact well with certain firewall software.One of our cameras is installed under the roof eave of our two story home and is probably 25-30 feet off the ground. It points at the front yard, our driveway, the street and catches neighbors' homes across the street. Image quality at that distance during the day is decent but not fantastic. You could identify a make, model and color of car but definitely can not make out a license plate...its just too far. Night vision at this distance isn't great.The other camera is installed above our garage and looks down our driveway where we park our vehicles. It points at things much closer up than the other camera and the images are much clearer and higher quality.You can use the software to identify motion zones: if something enters a predefined motion zone the camera records what it sees. The camera does an okay job of confining its recording to only movement within the zones, but tends to err on the side of recording versus not recording, which is probably a good thing.I love being able to monitor the cameras over the Internet. There is no cost for this, just go the the URL, enter your UN and PW and you can view the live feed.Between the master system and the add-on camera I paid about $600. I feel I got good value for the money and after 2 weeks of constant use I am satisfied with the product.
