I am an IT Professional and I bought this camera for use as a baby room monitor as well as a security device I could move around my home. It was recommended to me by my boss who already has 2 of them at his home which we can view remotely once the DDNS stuff was setup.As far as simplicity of setup goes, this is the easiest camera I have tried. It sets up everything with the step-by-step installer. It will even configure many routers (DLink and Cisco/Linksys types) automatically for you with only having to enter the admin credentials for the router. Overall the ease of setup makes this one of the best cameras for a simple do-it-yourself setup.The software is really great too. Has dozens of simple options for recordings and such but you will want to have a lot of free drive space on the local drive where the software is installed to. It even has a security-timeline that shows you at a glance where motions events were recorded if you set it up that way. Overall the software is top notch.As for the features of the camera hardware...well the image quality is really great and it can handle moderately low light but not dark or nighttime. No IR LEDs for night vision which many other cameras I have used have for around the same price. No pan/tilt so getting the camera pointed where you want is difficult. It picked up a lot of interference on the audio side only and I was unable to resolve that issue. Other cameras I have gotten since do not have this issue.For the price it should have more hardware features but it makes up for some of that with the software. Overall if you are familiar with DDNS, port forwarding, and the like then get one with more hardware features as you will be happier. If you want something that does the job and is easy to setup and use the software here is the way to go.
