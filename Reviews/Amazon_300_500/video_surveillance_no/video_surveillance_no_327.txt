Hmm, where to start. Good quality picture/video, even outside, though you have to change it to outside mode via settings in browser. This 6mm lens is a serious zoom in, so you have to get the camera perfect for what your trying to watch, in my case I have it 50ft away from the front door to get a close up shot of any intruder. That is all your going to get though, just a little area, there is no zoom or wide angle on this. Quality is pretty good, I am impressed on that aspect, disappointed in the lack of wide angle. The huge blow that if I could return it, I would aspect: The camera keeps changing IP address' so the port forwarding to view the camera on my phone or any computer away from home keeps failing. I have not figured out why, I have multiple cameras and only this camera keeps doing it. I have to update the IP address in my router settings at least twice a week. So this camera does not work the way I need it too, but may work for you if you dont need to view it away from home. So I would personally return this item and shop for a different one. I do have other cameras of this Brand "Foscam" and like i said before those work fine like it should.Updated 8/25/13: I was able to change the settings for the camera to stop changing IP. It was not in a place I would have looked at. So I have since changed my review rating. I am happy with the camera, only disappointment is the lack of wide angle. I can no view this camera on my phone and tablet without a problem. I have noticed another problem. When it sends the alarm email with the picture it took, it has the wrong date in the email. I assume this is just a glitch and it is not an issue as the picture is dated properly, but the email is dated wrong.
