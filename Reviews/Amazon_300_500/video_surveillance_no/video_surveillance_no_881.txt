I purchased 3 Agasio M105I cameras.  One of them was obviously bad out of the box- trees were purple.  I guess the IR filter was stuck on.  I got a refund from Amazon for it.  Another worked, but would occasionally "flash" between normal exposure and slightly darker, about once per second.  The only way I could make it stop was to reduce the resolution to 320x240.  After a random amount of time (few minutes to few hours), switching back to 640x480 worked again for a while.  I eventually called Agasio tech support, but they did not recognize model number M105I!  Eventually they figured out which camera it was and had me return it to them.  After a month I was sent a refurbished camera.  It must have been a return that they hadn't even tested, since it was named "garage cam" and was password protected.  I reset the password with the button, and it's been working fine for a month so far.  The third camera was working fine for a couple of months, but has now also started flashing, so I guess I'll return it as well.  I was hoping that the refurbished camera had newer firmware, but both of them are 4.35.2.43, so I expect the refurbished camera will also start flashing at some point.It's a shame, since the cameras appear to be well built.  As the other reviews state, the mounting hardware is flimsy and rusts, but you can make it work.  The cabling requires installing a waterproof electrical box near the camera.  Using the Ethernet jack to connect it to my network, I get 7-8 frames a second.  Wireless with a strong signal, 5-6 frames a second.  Wireless with a weak signal, about 1 frame a second.  The cameras work well with iSpy, except the flashing brightness causes it to record constantly.
