I just finished an 8 hour photo shoot on a cold, windy, and snowy central Pennsylvania day. I bought these mounts for both my wife and I, and we were able to get some FANTASTIC shots from our car instead of freezing our butts off using a tripod in the wind and snow. We did get out to shoot a few times, and I was cold in spite of my four layers of clothing.Here's what I like:1. This thing holds on like a vice. We never once had to to re-suction them to the window, and I kept my Panasonic FZ200 clamped to it while we were driving as well as shooting. My wife uses a Nikon D5100. Incidentally, the outside temperature was about 28 degrees, with a wind chill of about 17 degrees. Wind about 30 mph.2. The car window can be rolled up completely with the mount still attached, and it's easy to move the camera down and out of the way when you are not using it. There is no need to take it off the mount when you are driving from one location to another.3. The ball head can be removed and kept on the camera base if you want to put the camera away for a while.4. I detached the whole unit from the window, with the camera still attached, and kept the mount attached to the camera when I shot outside the car. It makes a great supportive handle to provide more hand-held stability.5. A hint: Take the ball head off the mount and screw it into the camera base when you first attach the camera for your shoot. It's easier than attaching the camera to the mount while the ball head is still on the mount.6. It's small enough to simply keep in the car, though I'm going to experiment with using it for taking images of birds feeding from our window feeder; have to get a remote first, though.7. Actually, it rotates in two instead of three planes, which is a little inconvenient. But the good points far, far outweigh this one minor point.
