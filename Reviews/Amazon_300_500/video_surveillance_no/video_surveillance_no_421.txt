I bought this to replace a wireless alarm system I bought from Radio Shack years ago. It was starting to give false alarms so twas time to replace.This system is a very nice system, already programmed and easy to install and set up. The alarm/horn is VERY loud. So, as the instructions say, do NOT put this near where you sleep or normally sit (such as the living room). It truly is LOUD! It's easy to hear the arm signal when you "arm" it from the outside. My older system was sometimes difficult to hear from outside after locking the door and arming it.One thing my old system had that this one doesn't, that I became used to, is a chime whenever the doors were opened and closed. There is no signal at all to let you know if someone has opened one of the protected doors. Convenient if you're at home and do not arm the system while inside.One thing I'm disappointed in is that the instructions say that it will not work with any phone line other than a land-line. I wonder, however, if it will work with the new wireless home phone systems that Verizon Wireless and AT&T; are selling ($20 per month unlimited calling) that your normal phone plugs into (corded or cordless). They give a dial-tone, which is what kept home alarm systems (and satellite boxes) from working with cell phones as they do NOT give a dial-tone. The device, such as an alarm system or satellite box, needs to detect dial-tone before it would attempt to dial out). These new land-line replacement systems do give dial-tone when you go off-hook with your "normal" phone that you plug into the wireless box. But even the advertisement from the wireless companies say it will not work with alarm systems or satellite boxes. I'm wondering if they're saying this just to cover themselves as the land-line phone is still more reliable than wireless?
