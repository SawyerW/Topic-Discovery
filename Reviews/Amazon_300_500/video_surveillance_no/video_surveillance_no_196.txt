I have been using this security system for about 2 weeks now. It was very easy to set up and in minutes I was viewing the outside of my home  on my computer screen. The software loads so simply and the camera view screen pops up right away. It is wireless as in the system uses your DSL/Cable system and the wiring in your home. Each camera does require an electrical outlet to work. The line to the camera is quite thin but with the type of replacement windows we have it will not allow them to close completely for the outside camera so we are working to set it inside and still get the backyard view we require.The one we have been using is the one that comes in this kit. It is angled toward the front door. I can see who is there at any time of the day or night. The picture is crystal clear. I just had a visit to the hospital and when I got home I reviewed the still shots the camera took when I was gone. You can do that without taking the card out of the computer. It comes with an SD card adapter for the mini card to fit right into the computer. Reviewing the week it holds is a snap.You also get 2 stickers warning that the home is being protected. The only thing you need to be careful of is not aiming it at your neighbors homes, there are local rules in most communities against spying in this manner. I was able to sit mine sideways in the front window so it captures only my front door. This also would make it harder to cover should someone try to cover it up with a paper.I think next I will next try setting it to watch what our dog does when we are gone. I have a good idea but it could be funny. Overall I would recommend this item. Posting your camera's may be a step to give possible vandals a second thought. You can log on the website from your phone if you have internet on the phone and check what is going on at home. Also no one would know if the system is connected directly to the police station.Good Quality, Good Results.
