The Audio quality seems beyond bad. The spec's say "Frequency: 100~20000Hz" but the noise in the background is as bad as a very used 78 vinyl record. Low light with the Illumination on isn't that bad, I'm using the camera's in my attic and under my floor to watch for things. The Java video mode is also beyond annoying, you have to pritty much ALLOW aplug or else use another mode and the warnings seem to pop up between every mode change.If Trendnet would get the E-Mail send to work with my ISP SMTP authentication mode they might be a acceptable replacement for the TV-IP110's, which is kind of what I'm doing. Over a 110 I get WiFi and CRUDE sound. BE ADVISED..... NOOOOO ONNNNNN SCREENNNNNN DISPLAYYYYYY!, the clock seems about useless. Passwords are limited to 8 characters on FW ver 1.05.04 (2013-03-28) including the administrator. I am still not getting any sound on IE11 Win7Pro but most of the new Trendnet cams (672WI & 572WI) don't work well on my Windows IE, I pritty much have to use Firefox or Chrome which is ok by me but the old 422's & 312's want IE to make sound. Trendnet's camera line looks like they have been programmed by different programmers in different country's on different OS's. They seem to be a Hodge Poge of what it takes to get picture and sound on which browser.It all seems to be WINDOWS JUNK. Android seems to get it all working despite the camera manufacturers though..... What seems to be a step backwards seems to really be a step forward (at least with IP cams (I have had DLink, Trendnet, eSky, Asante, etc)), IP Cam Viewer GETS IT DONE when the latest and greatest and most expensive falls flat. I got a Quad core 1.6 mini PC running android for my cam viewer, it works.....
