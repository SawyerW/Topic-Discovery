I bought this Defender dvr along with three Defender cameras.Setup: As others have mentioned, setup cannot be any easier.  If you're not a technical person, do not worry as you'll have no problems.DVR: The dvr recorder "box" is quite small and easy to hide.  It's about the size of a man's wallet.  It also provides an additional sensor receptor for the remove control.  The cord for the additional sensor receptor is about four feet long.  The additional sensor receptor has a sticky side. So you can place the dvr totally behind the TV/Monitor, yet run the additional sensor to the front of your tv and stick it on the front.  Now point your remote control at the sensor.DVR menu system: Easy to navigate.Camera picture quality: Good enough.  Daytime quality is good. Nighttime infrared is good.Camera motion activated recording:  Definitely below par.  If the subject (motion) is not directly in front of the camera line, the motion is not detected.  Plus it will not record the first two seconds after motion.  So if someone walks past the camera, you're lucky to get a record of the person at all.Reception distance:  Not good.  I couldn't install the dvr in my bedroom because it would not receive two of the cameras.  I had to put the dvr in a room close to the three cameras.  ie, the reception does not go thru wall well.  One wall and 40 feet yes.  Two walls and 60 feet, no.  I moved the antennas all around trying to get reception in my bedroom, no luck.If you want to put a camera on your front door, and a dvr/monitor just inside the front door or in your living room, this is a decent and simple system.  If you want to monitor and record activity around your whole house, you must put the dvr/monitor in the middle of the house, and even then you might not get get reception from all cameras.
