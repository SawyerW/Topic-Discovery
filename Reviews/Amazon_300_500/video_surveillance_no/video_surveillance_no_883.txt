The camera works OK as a motion sensor camera, it's small enough to be hidden in day time, ah but the glowing Infra Red led lights beat the whole purpose of the hidden camera (not hidden anymore)The manual it's in well explained English, simple and detailed with some graphics to help you understand better the functionality of the device,also what the other guy said about the 5 seconds trigger video it's TRUE, the manual states 2-3 seconds (Lie) it's actually 5-6 seconds after the cam has been triggered to record somethingplus the glowing led lights, let me put it this way.You open the door,Motion sensor detects you right away(in half second IR led lights turn on) that doesn't mean the cam is recording.you have now 4 seconds to close the door and the camera would record just an empty room for the time you set the camera to recordThe camera worksVideo Quality is goodFPS are smoothAudio/Mic is good and clearTrigger time is 5-6 secondsCustomizable settings are just a few:Time recording:30,60,180/sVideo Resolution:640*480, 320*240Video Quality FPS:10,15,30FPSTime/date stamp on videoIndicator Green light On/Off while recordingDescription of the camera on video I guess (in case you have several around the house to see to which camera corresponds selected video)What it misses in the settings or should've been added too:On/Off IR led lightsSelect # of IR led lights to be activated on triggered cam: 0,1,2,4,6 or the whole 8,(seriously, the 8 IR led lights give great illumination to the night vision camera(more than enough I would say), but they show to the intruder the camera location and what it is at first sight)and that beats the whole purpose of the SPY/HIDDEN camera,so,NO, this is not a night vision "SPY" "HIDDEN" cam,maybe a daytime spy cam or just a motion sensor night vision camera,Battery Life is stated to last about 10 days,Haven't get thru that yet, I'll review that Later
