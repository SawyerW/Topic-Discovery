This monitor has great build quality and can take a drop to the floor without a problem. Make sure to place the camera pretty close to your baby in order to make sure the voice activated feature of the monitor kicks in, as the speaker's sensitivity is not too high. The clamp device for the camera works fine, you may even be able to clip it onto a shelf instead of the crib depending on how close your shelf is. It also has a magnetic base if you have something magnetic to stick it on.I really like the VOX feature which turns on your handheld monitor only when it senses sounds near the camera. This saves the batteries in the camera, if you are using batteries. Both the camera and monitor can be plugged in to the wall if you don't want to use batteries.Regarding the picture, contrary to the advertisements, you will not get a "clear" picture of your baby. You will get an adequate picture though, and that is all you need in a monitor. I really like the night vision feature-you do not need some bright night light to get an image. The unit has infrared LED's which are invisible to the eye but which enhance the night vision which comes on automatically when the room is dark.The handheld monitor comes with a clip which doubles as a stand. The monitor comes with rechargeable batteries and can be plugged right into a wall outlet. Great feature. You can also turn music on and off from the monitor if your baby starts to stir. great idea!I am not noticing any interference when using my phones, microwave, wireless internet. The range is fine for my place but the monitored room is close. I have not run any long range tests. I have also not been experiencing loss of signal problems.I recommend this unit. A lot of thought went into it.
