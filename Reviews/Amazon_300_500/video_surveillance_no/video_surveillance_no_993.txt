Set up is a pain and It isn't explained very well - the port forwarding doesn't work like you would expect. I am tech savvy and I had to call their tech support. They had to remote in to my computer and it took them almost 2 hours to get all working, and this is on a standard modem and router.Set up is only half the problem, the camera software is horrendous. Panning or tilting from the website was unresponsive and buggy. The voice over internet was inaudible and just sounded like feedback. The auto IR was annoying, it would click on and off all night while watching TV because it would detect the bright flashes of the TV and turn the IR off and then during the dark scenes it would turn the IR on.I bought the Foscam to test, if I liked it I was going to buy more. I missed the return period so I I ended up tossing the Foscam in a drawer and buying three new cameras from a different maker.Camera quality was OK. Nothing great and far less than other cameras I have seen.My friend is going out of town and wanted to borrow my Foscam, since I am no longer using it I told him he could take it. I also warned him that set up is a pain. He owns an IT service so he was like - I think I can handle it. Well, he called me and couldn't believe how stupid it was to set it up, HE had to call tech support and again it took them over an hour and half to get it working correctly with port forwarding  and email.There are so many great home cameras on the market and unfortunately the Foscam seems to be way behind the pack in terms of quality, function, setup and software. I would never buy any of their products again.
