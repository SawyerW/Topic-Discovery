I ordered this monitor after my Summer Infant Day and Night monitor broke (because I tried to use it overseas and the difference in voltage fried my A/C adaptor).  I wanted something reliable and this got good reviews.  Unfortunately this monitor is not going to work for us. There is no way to turn the audio completely off/down. When my daughter wakes up, if she is screaming I like to turn the audio off and just have the video so I can see what she's doing without having to hear her through the monitor (since she screams loud enough to hear her down the street anyway!)  Unfortunately the lowest volume setting still allows for some pretty loud noise if she is crying.The pan and zoom options are nice if you have more than one kid in the room, but since our monitor is wall mounted over the crib, I found that I don't use them.  I would also say that the picture quality on my summer unit (which is not digital) is far better especially in night vision than this unit which is twice as expensive! The only other complaint I have is that when the unit is off, but plugged in to charge there is a blue light that stays on, which casts a fair amount of glow in my dark bedroom when I'm trying to sleep.  That being said, you could always just stick a piece of electrical tape over it.To be fair there are a lot of pros.  The large screen size for viewing is nice.  There are a lot of options like room temperature, a lullaby, the ability to talk to your baby. This was also one of very few monitors that got positive reviews wherever I looked and didn't seem to have complaints about it suddenly not working after a few months.  I just wish the sound would turn off.
