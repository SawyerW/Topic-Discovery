I say this as someone who's generally regarded in my little world to have some idea of what I'm doing with computers. The user guide is awful, but if you have some basic knowledge of networking, firewalls, and port forwarding, then this is an excellent camera for the price. If you would rather have someone hold your hand through the process, you may want to consider another model. You should also have some tolerance of less than perfect written English.I had no difficulty setting up the device. I used the CD that it came with for a small part of the initial configuration to get it on the local network, but after that, I just configured the device from the web interface because it was so much easier. The camera is still working great to this day.As a quick tip, you can turn off the blinking green light that's always on by default. Just choose "been extinguished" from the drop menu under PTZ Settings. I found that constantly blinking light super annoying. Sadly, I haven't found a way to turn off the infrared lights.The speaker and audio features only work in Internet Explorer with the use of an ActiveX control. If this feature is really important to you, please be aware that it does depend on IE. The device provides the following viewing modes then you connect:1. ActiveX Mode (for audio features when using Internet Explorer)2. Server Push Mode (Works well for standard viewing)3. Mobile Phone Mode (Never used this)4. iPod touch / iphone 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4 and iPad dedicated (Self-explanitory)You can even configure separate logins for multiple users with different levels of access permissions, which is definitely a plus.Video quality is fair. It's not very detailed, but it works quite well. It does what I need it to do. It's not bad, but not great either. It satisfies.I would recommend this camera to someone with some networking knowledge and who is in the market for a cheap IP camera.
