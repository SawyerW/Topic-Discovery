1 star for this DVR system because it sucks! i only bought it because it was on-sale and affordable, and i needed something cheap & quick. Seems like the DVR system has some kind of defect. The bullet cameras that came with it is great. 4 stars for that. The DVR system however, is my real problem! Not user-friendly, very difficult to understand and use the system, the instructions manual is garbage. Needs serious vocabulary improvements. (ENGLISH DAMMIT, ENGLISH!!!). the fan in the DVR box is noisy, and it (the DVR system) runs slow like an old jalopy computer infected with virus. Some of the buttons on the DVR box doesn't funtion, and the remote doesn't work. I have to do everything by using the mouse that came with it. Also, the other issue i have is with the time. i've set it to regular hours and not 24 hours mode, but it still show as 24 hour. For example, when the time is 12:59pm, when it turns 1 O' Clock, instead of displaying "1:00pm", it displays "13:00". Even with the time & date set to normal. It will take a while for an average joe to figure out how to use this DVR system. Eventually, after having this DVR system for almost a year now and messing around with it, i understand how it operates. Also, Zmodo Customer Service is horrible!!! 1 star for that also. Everytime i have an issue with my DVR system and tried to contact support, i either don't get the help i needed, or, i just don't get help at all! it's like they ignore you while you're waiting on the phone for half an hour already. Same for the 24 hour live support online. They will ignore you and eventually will send you a page telling you to leave your email and questions and they will get back to you, well, in this case, they never returned my email. i do not recommend this DVR system from this brand!
