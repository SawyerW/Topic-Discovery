We had a rash of break-ins in our neighborhood during work hours. Having spent a small fortune on "professional" surveillance systems for my business, I wanted something a little less expensive, and I definitely didn't want a monthly fee attached to it. So I picked up one of these cameras to give it a whirl. I've got a little more experience than the average Joe, but the setup seemed easy enough. I was up in under five minutes. The toughest part was synchronizing it to my wireless router, but WPS makes that fairly painless. The quick-start instructions were pretty clear. Our remote access has been flawless. Both my wife and I have been able to watch (and HEAR) these cameras on our Android smartphones for several months without fail. The picture isn't as HD as I'd like it to be, but it's still not too shabby. It's clear enough to make out faces and details. The low light via infrared isn't too bad either. I did have one issue with the internal add-on SD card. I had to try two different ones before I found one that worked. It seems to hate the newer SD cards, but I believe a firmware update may have resolved that issue. I haven't done it yet, but the 8 GB SD card I have installed works fine. The e-mail notifications are awesome. I've got mine set up to send me five e-mail attachments with each motion detection. My favorite part is that I can move the camera nearly 360 degrees with my phone. My teenage kids think it's spooky that I can watch them from work and hear their arguments all over the house verbatim. No more he-said she-said -- I've got the truth now :) Overall, recommend highly. Mine has been in operation for almost 6 months, and no problems whatsoever.
