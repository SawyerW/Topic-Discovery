I am not one who typically reviews on Amazon, but I felt compelled to do so based upon the service of this company.  Other reviews have gone over the details of images, etc.  Know this: you can see your child or whatever it is that you bought this for clearly on your smartphone or tablet.  For most of us parents, that is the bottom line and the specs become somewhat overwhelming.  While I am electronics geek at heart, you don't need to know the technical details of this monitor: you just need to know that the monitor accomplishes what it sets out to do very well (see your child).The real reason to consider buying this monitor is the customer service.  What other company do you know staffs technical support after 5pm on weekdays and anytime on weekends?  My wife and I both work, and to have a company that understands this concept and has actual human beings you can talk to you away from business hours when normal people are actually home is phenomenal.  We have two of these monitors, and I set up a time with Gary (one of their tech guys) to call me at 730pm on a sunday night after my girls were asleep so that I could set up the monitors in peace.  He called me, was able to screen share within minutes (where they can, with your permission, log on to your computer), and helped me set up both monitors in less than 15 minutes.  There was no guesswork, as he was on the phone with me and fixing the settings on my MacBook at the same time.  For our busy life, it was perfect.There are plenty of other monitors on the market, and if you are tecnically saavy, check them out and set up your own wireless network and streaming.  If you are not, then WifiBaby will set it up for you and you are ready to start watching the kids.  It was simple, hassle free, and it works.
