This is a super product.  It is ridiculously easy to set up, and when I called the support desk for help in connecting it to my network, they were very helpful and courteous.  It takes pictures even when the room is dark, so even if someone sneaks in during the night, this camera will capture the photo if the camera is positioned properly.The problem came when I actually had intruders.  This item has a bright red light on it that anyone can easily see in a darkened room.  The intruders immediately walked over to the camera and just unplugged it.  I did get 2 shots before they unplugged it, one of which was of the guy unplugging the camerathus disabling it for any further photos; that one was really blurry..  I tried again a few days later by positioning the camera in a new and less visible spot, because it became clear that I did not have one-time intruders but actually people that had broken into my attic and were living there.  The second time, they just stole the SD card out of the unit.  No card, no photos.  Unless you happen to be viewing the video at the time the break-in occurs (I wasn't), you won't have anything to show for it with the SD card gone.  No point in putting the camera out anymore.  They will just keep stealing the card (or maybe even the camera).I need to call customer support again to find out how to conceal the camera better.  I may be able to conceal the red light without compromising the camera's function.  Currently it only turns itself on if it detects movement.  If I can figure that out, this will be a good tool to have in identifying intruders.  The still photos come out rather blurry and pixelated, but the video is excellent.UPDATE: I called customer support, and they explained how to turn off the red light.  Turning it off does not compromise the camera's motion-detection function.  You will still have to take care to conceal the camera, however, especially if you have a tech-savvy intruder.
