great product, very quick delivery - seems to be backed by a buch of guys who really care about their products. works very well, and the +4 and +7 timers are great .. what that means is that the unit will go on at dusk and stay on for either 4 hours past that (if the switch is in one position) and then turn off (e.g. like someone shutting off their TV to sleep), or go on at dusk and stay on for 7 hours past that (switch in the other position).  There's also a regular "on" setting for timer use or manual operation. the unit also lights an LED depending on the timer switch (one is red LED and the other BLUE LED) so you can confirm at a glance that you have it set the way you want it.the look is extremely realistic and the light is plenty bright.  and, the unit is nice and compact and the power cord is sufficiently long.one key is to make sure you can't see the unit directly from the outside. I ended up placing it on a window shelf in a 2nd floor room, and placing a box between it and the window, and then one on either side as well (I suppose I could just cut one side off a single box and use that as well, like a diorama would be) -- this ensured the light was not directly visible, and casts a shadow on the window that looks like the light is coming from the back of a TV.  I'm sure you could project it onto a wall facing the window, or other possibilities as well.sure it could be a little less expensive, but the price isn't prohibitive, and the company seems to promise great support as well (e.g. will send a new one if there's any trouble, etc).  and, for the money, it's a great additional deterrent and good value.highly recommended!!! (and I have nothing to do at all with the company, I just think they did a great job with this one!).
