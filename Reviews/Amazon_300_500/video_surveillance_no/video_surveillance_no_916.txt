Got the product in a timely manner, product was in good shape and all parts there.  As mentioned many time, instructions are poorly written using poor English.  I am a novice to web cams,  set up home network on my own, but that is no big deal.  I bought a new linksey 900 router also at the start of this instillation.  I followed the instructions and had the camera up and running in minutes wired.  Wireless is another matter,  the instructions say just unplug the cable (after doing the install for wireless) and you should be wireless.  but it did not happen over and over and over again.  I eventually discovered that even though it supposed to take effect in 30 secs,  it some times takes up to an hour before the camera is recognized.  I bought two cameras and after days of fussing I got them both working,  for less than a day.  First the front cam went out,  had to take it down and start over.  Then the back cam went down,  repeat and repeat.  I would think that once they are up and working they would stay working but that has not been my experience. Currently they are both NOT working.  I see a couple of options,  wire them which is not why I bought these and paid what I did to get them,  or send them back.  I am leaning hard towards sending them back. The back cam is 30-40 feet away from the router, the front cam maybe 50 feet,  well within the limits.  When I had them working they worked good and I was satisfied. It just didn't last long.  I had them so that I could see them on the web and of course the home network.  I learned a lot installing them,  hope I can use it on my next cameras,  any suggestions?
