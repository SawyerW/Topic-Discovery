Pros:Easy to install hardware - with a little planningLots of features - this is a pretty slick system that loaded with options ex. ability to block out motion from certain areas, turn motion detectors on only during certain days/times, email alerts, etc.Cons:Technical support. Have called Tech Support 2x and both times was a negative experience. The hold times aren't bad, about 12 minutes both times but the music recording is so crappy it feels like 10x as long. Got the same support person both times who has the inexplicable ability to ask questions about everything but the problem and answer questions without providing information.Example:me: Hello, I have a quick question about my systemrep: may I have your name?me: my name is......rep: may I have your phone numberme: all I have is a quick question, if you could just tell me....rep cuts me offrep: may I have your phone number?me: ###-###-####rep: I'm sorry I didn't get all of that, can you repeat?me: ###-###-####rep: Thank you. Is this the first time you're calling about this issue?me: I don't have an issue, I just have a quick question about my system. If you could just tell me....rep cuts me offrep: Is this the first time you're calling about this question?me: Yes. I just want to know if.....rep: interrupting: Ok, what kind of system do you haveme: (starting to simmer) I have a Pro-550. I just want to know if I can use a wireless camera with this system.rep: What model number do you have?me: #########rep: ok, just one momentI get the impression she's reading something. Then a brief hold.rep: Yes, ok. You must have a bnc to rca connector.me: So I can use a wireless camera on my wired system?rep: Yes, but you must have a bnc to rca connectorme: Why do I need a bnc to rca connector?rep: for the receiver, which plugs into the dvrme: Ok, makes sense. Which camera will I need to purchase?rep: You need to call Customer Service for that. They're open Monday through Fridayme: (boiling) You can't tell me which camera is compatible with my system?rep: I told you, you need a bnc to rca connectorme: Does that mean ANY camera with a bnc to rca connector will work with my system?rep: Yes. Any camera with a bnc to rca connector will workme: So do all your cameras have bnc to rca connectors?rep: Any camera with a bnc to rca connector will work.me: (giving up) Ok, thank you.rep: Is there any thing else I can do for you today?me: nopeI've resigned myself to having to go through all of the cameras to determine which ones have the same features as my system AND has bnc to rca connectors.
