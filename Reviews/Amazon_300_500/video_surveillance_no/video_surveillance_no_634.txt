I bought this adapter because it was recommended that I use a 12V..my old camera was not that powerful..but this new one is an amazing camera except for the adapter, it didn't come with one. Amazon had this adapter right next to the camera as a great choice for the camera. At night which is when I really need to record I get nothing but black lines up and down and a patch of color static across the screen. I have captured great stuff but hard to see with the lines moving up and down across the screen. I read from different sources that it could be the adapter. I am now in the process of ordering RG59 Siamese cable which is very expensive or ordering another 12V which has great reviews from customers who have the same experience as me. I will another 12V  first if it doesn't work then I will buy the RG59 Siamese cable and will update the results.Bottom line if you have a good camera powerful like mine I would not recommend this.UPDATE: Today may 24 i received the new adapter OMG is amazing..all this time trying to figure out if it was cables or camera ..slowly and gradually narrowed down to the adapter...but today when I received the new adapter and remove this one they sell Voila! no lines great clear picture ...night vision is amazing..just to be fair my camera is powerful though it was only $70 I got it from Amazon because of the reviews ..the best camera!!! but it needed a powerful adapter..here is the adapter i received today in case someone is suffering like I was ,..and it was less money than this one here..just $10 I am going to order more VideoSecu 12V DC 2A 2000mA 100V - 240V AC Regulated Power Supply Adaptor for CCTV Security Camera Home Surveillance System PW2000R 1LCgood luck for those of you Night Vision aficionados
