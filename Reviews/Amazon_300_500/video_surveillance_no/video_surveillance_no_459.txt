There is nothing negative to say here. I bought this monitor to use  in 3 different rooms of our home. We knew we wanted pan & tilt and we needed 3 cameras. Budget was an issue and to us, this was an investment. I did not want to have a wi-fi camera because I am on my phone way too much as it is, the battery would always be dead, and you cant talk on the phone and watch the kids at the same time. We use this in the baby's room, the toddler's room, and a play area in the basement so I can keep an eye on the toddler while making dinner. Other monitors have too many options and the blaring music going through the camera and all the buttons everywhere (lorex) but really all you need is the pan and tilt, the temperature, and the talk back. I use our talk back button almost every time one of them is asleep to let them know I am coming and it is ok. They will stop crying and stare right up at the camera because the sound is so clear. It is not scary. It is also nice when the toddler thinks it is ok to get out of bed and i can catch him and tell him "get back in bed!" without going in his room 1 hundred times. Turning the volume up and down is easy and scanning and tilting the awesome camera is just as simple. The best part is that you can actually SEE the kids and if they are asleep or their eyes are open. Both cameras are quite far from the beds and we have black out curtains in their rooms. ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM.  I recently had an issue with my parent monitor and Mae at Infant Optics made the exchange so easy and flawless. I had a new monitor in my hands the next day. You have no idea how amazing a product is until you have to live without it for 24 hours. totally worth the money, the sanity, your time, the customer service, and more importantly the peace of mind of watching your cutie pies sleep and play safely.
