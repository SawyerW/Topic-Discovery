ProsLooks coolHas a ton of bells and whistlesPic quality is good if you are on the same network the device is connected to.Has a remote for if you are local.has a headphone output so you can yell at prople on your property but i have not figured out how to use that yet and I have not tried lol.Great rotational rangeNight vision works wellshould have a 6db gain antenna instead of standard little nonsense.ConsNo ant-flicker like the cheaper cams have so it does not work well near HID lighting. This is my biggest complaintCan not adjust how far the cam moves at a time even though they have setting for it they dont save.The digital zoom is crap.Pic quality is not good unless you are on the same network the device is connected to. When viewing it across the internet the cam gives you a horrible small pic and even if you tell it to take a snap shot it gives you the crappy resolution instead of what you have the cam set to.Constant connection failures even on a hardline. I do not understand that. Tested on multiple networks and I am a tech for a living so it is not like I dont know what I am doing.To expensive for the quality it provides.(If they add anti flicker and fix the interface to have save points on every page of the interface it would be much better.It is supposed to be a hd cam but when viewing over the internet it is not hd and you have to use the zoom on your browser then it cuts of the control button on the webpage. very dissapointing!I have a logitech confrence cam that has much better quality and costs the same but the logitech does not have a web based connection for remote control as far as I know.
