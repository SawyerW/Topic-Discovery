We like this system. We've had a similar system that we had used as a nanny-cam when our daughter was younger. the great benefit to such systems is that there is no hardwiring required, but you also are not using wifi either - it uses the existing electrical wiring in your home to connect and communicate.Because of our positive experience with our previous equipment we were excited to try this system out and we were not disappointed. This logitech has a few features our older version doesn't offer, so we think it's pretty great.Advantages:Easy to set upUses existing electrical wiring for power and communication between camera and computerNO WIFI requiredCan view  the camera images "real time" from the internet (great for home protection or nanny cam)If your computer is off it has a SD card that it records video to which you can then download later.Can be set up to activate with motion, so it's not recording hours of nothing, but only when there is activity.Disadvantages:To have it always on and always able to view from the internet means you have to have it hooked up to a computer that is always on and always connected to the internet.Depending on how much video coverage you want it can get a bit pricey to add pieces.If you want one of the cameras outside it can be tricky to find an outlet in a good spot for the camera w/o having a long cord running up your wall (most outdoor outlets are down low, and you typically want your outdoor cameras up high)Need to be at least a bit geeky or net-savvy to get it up and running (or pay someone who is...)If you were able to hook up your own home network or wired/wireless router you will be fine.---------Compared to having a security company come and hardwire video monitoring in your home this is very inexpensive. However, you need to be a bit of a do-it-yourself type person or you may get frustrated. I'm that way and had no problem, yet I can tell my husband would have been irritated/frustrated doing it because he's not very techie at all (so bear that in mind...)If you want it as a covert nanny cam you will need to find an add-on camera that is hidden as a clock or something (which is what we had) as the cameras that come with are pretty obvious and not something easy to hide (unless you are a do-it-yourself type and get creative by stuffing the camera into something else as a disguise)All-in-all I recommend the system - it's a great option for those who want simple video monitoring or who don't want to pay the money for a hardwired system.
