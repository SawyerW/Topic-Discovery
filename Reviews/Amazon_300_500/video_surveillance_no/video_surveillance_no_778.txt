I have owned this monitor & camera for 1.5 years, and I purchased it through Amazon. I also have an additional camera. I have been pleased with this product for the most part. However, the power button on my monitor has stopped working, and Motorola customer service was terrible to work with. They told me to take the battery out for 10 minutes, and then put it back in. If that worked, great! If not, then too bad since I am past the 1 year warranty.They offered no suggestions on how to repair it. This blows my mind because the monitor will charge. It just won't turn on. There has to be a fix. They simply told me I'd have to buy a whole new unit. Oh, and they don't sell just the monitor...I'd have to spend $240 to get the monitor and camera even though I have 2 cameras that work just fine. Needless to say, I will never buy another Motorola product again. I am going to try to find someone to fix the power button as I have over $300 invested in this product between the initial purchase and the additional camera.Before having the problem with the power button, I would have rated this product a 4.PROS:* I love the pan, tilt, and zoom.* The night vision was pretty good, but I have noticed a slight decline over months of use.* I like the temperature feature. In the winter, I use a heater in my son's room. One time the heat setting was adjusted wrong, and it got very hot in the room. Luckily I saw the temp on the monitor and was able to go adjust the heat.CONS:* Like many other reviewers, I wish there was a clock and a mute button.* I also wish the monitor didn't power up with an all white screen. It is blinding in the middle of the night if I have to power the monitor on.* When the monitor is unplugged from charger, the battery life is not great. It is usually beeping low battery before my son gets up from his nap.
