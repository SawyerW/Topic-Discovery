I got this as a gift for my birthday.  I wouldn't have considered needing a video baby monitor but I LOVE it!  I have 3 other children and only used a Sony monitor for them, but this is great!  I can watch in my room and see if he is just making noises or if he is making noises and kicking his legs or turning his head (signs that I can go and give him a pacifier).  If he is just making noises and I get up and go in the room to give a pacifier and he is actually asleep--well, that's just annoying.  I mounted it up on the ceiling looking down into his crib.  At night the picture is black and white, but color in the daylight.  The resolution is not good enough (at the distance I have it from the crib---about 9 feet) to be able to watch him breathe, but I can see well enough to make sure there isn't a blanket over his face or if the paci is in his mouth.  The audio is sound activated only so it isn't on all the time---only if he makes enough noise.  I like sound on all the time when they are little (mine is 8 weeks right now) so I have a Sony baby monitor in there also and the two do not interfere with each other.I have my wifi Kindle fire within 2 feet of the monitor without a problem.  There are a lot of options for angling the camera that I didn't know about until I opened the instruction booklet.  :o)  Also, if you buy an extra camera they are super easy to set up, but do NOT come with the camera stand like this one does.  Also, this camera comes paired with the unit out of the box so no set up required.  It is super easy to pair additional cameras to the monitor though.  I got another camera for the 22 month old's room.  It's just fantastic!  Great purchase---been using for 4 days now.
