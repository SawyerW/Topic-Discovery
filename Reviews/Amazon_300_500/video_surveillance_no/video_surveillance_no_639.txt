Five stars for being just right for my needs.  The system works well as described. Easy to install and run. The picture quality is good and the software is user friendly.  I had a tech question on a Saturday night.  The tech team answered right away and got me through the issue in less than a minute. I have nothing bad to say about this product.  I am very pleased with the ease of installation and use.  The most time consuming part of installing is running the wires.  Still very easy, it was a piece of cake. Also, you can add a high quality PTZ camera to the DVR as well and thats a nice feature, I will be adding one some day soon.I've been reading the other reviews and people never cease to amaze me.  If your looking for the absolute best quality picture in day or night vision, you have to be willing to spend the extra money for that quality picture performance.  You can pay for installation, but, this is a do it yourself, roughly $700, indoor outdoor, 8 camera servaillance system with night vision and DVR.  Its perfect for my needs and camera placement is a key part of the istallation process for best performance, so you have to read the directions :(  If your looking for the best, go spend $3000 and up for a better quality system and spend another $2000 having it installed by a professional.  Later, you can ad more cameras for $800 or more each to have an 8 camera home servaillence system.  In short, don't buy an ounce of silver if you expect a pound of gold, wine taste, beer budget, whatever.....but, people are just spoiled rotten to the point of irrationality. I know, I know, "but I can't afford that, don't I deserve a better...BLAH BLAH BLAH"....I'm sorry, but its sickening.Again, I am very happy with this and its a great product for the money.
