We have had this monitor for about a week and I love it.  I bought it to replace our Summer video monitor that we have been using for our almost 3 year old son since his birth.  We had gotten so used to the defects that we had with the Summer monitor that we really had no idea what we were missing!  The Summer had started losing sound a lot or only having static unless the volume dial was turned to exactly the right spot and had to be turned on and off sometimes to get the video to come back on.  We had been sleeping to a lot of interference and static every night.  We bought this monitor because of the split screen option with the second camera since we have another baby on the way.  The Lorex monitor seems to be just what we were looking for!  No interence or static - which has been soooooo nice.  I love that it has a docking station.  The video is good quality - a step up from our old monitor.  It beeps if you get out of range which is nice too (I tested it while letting the dog out) and is better than the increasing level of static I got with the other monitor.  The feature that I am most surprised to like is the intercom feature.  I didn't think we would use it and was scared that if I did my voice would sound like Darth Vader and scare the mess out of my son.  Well the other night he was supposed to be in bed and he got up and turned on his light and I decided to try it.  You have to talk softly because it is sensitive to volume - but my voice came thru clear as a bell and he jumped back in bed.  Yeah - maybe it's a little "big brother"-ish but I really like this monitor.  I can't wait to see how it does with two cameras.Oh - the one con and the reason I didn't give it five stars - I wish it had more volume levels.  It only has four volume levels and it would be nice for a baby monitor to have more.
