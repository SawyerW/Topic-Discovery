I thought this item was defective until I realized it was RF signal type receiver/ transmitter-camera and battery attachment (9V) dies quickly effecting greatly the cameras ability to transmit properly and I thought it was defective. It's also important to make sure clear line of sight between camera and reserved, even a chair or wall will effect it greatly so make sure they are close by and no obstructions. I also found some other types of electronics could effect its signal so keep them away but once you do all of that it's not a bad little setup giving you a better picture then say Uniden's choppy video quality setup for $199.99+taxes. The motion is great a clear picture once you also adjust the focus on camera in front. The mini wireless camera also has the ability to change channel with  very tiny flip switches on back (use a needle with care) but it's a shame it doesn't record night vision but not bad at night with some lighting outside. Although this camera is not intended for use outside, it works great, just try to protect it from extreme heat, rain and snow. The tuner receiver requires you to use the volume like knob control to find the signal and its very sensitive and you could easily pass your cameras signal plus I'm not sure just how secure your signal is against being pirated by other tuners. All in all this is a great very inexpensive way to monitor your garage, parking lot or outside porch, not for private recording inside because of security concerns. I use an old unused VCR with tape to record and works just fine although you can get a USB device to capture analog video and sound plus control other things on a computer. Great quick fix totally affordable and from a good supplier so I do recommend it.
