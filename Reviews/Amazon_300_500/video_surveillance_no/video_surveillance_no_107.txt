The Lorex LW2003 Baby Monitor performs out of the box as advertised. After plugging in both the camera and the handset, the handset had no trouble finding the signal from the camera. It had a range or approximately 35 feet through several walls and displayed a picture one would expect from a low resolution camera on a cheap small screen. The night vision worked reasonably well and the sound from the handset was more than adequate. The two-way communication feature did not work well at all. Sound from the handset to the camera was garbled and unintelligible, and possibly fightening to a child. We had not gotten around to trying the VOX or picture taking functionality, though I expect the photos to be near awful.We had no problems with interference from WIFI, cordless phones, and the microwave, though at the moment we live in an uncongested area where we don't have to worry about multi-home residences.The only unforgiveable problem with our unit was the low build quality which caused the unit to last a total of three days. The handset uses a USB-mini-b connection to charge its battery. This is not a problem, but after the three days of normal use, the female end of the usb in the handset broke free into the handset. This made the unit completely useless as we now had no way to charge the battery.I attempted to return the unit to Lorex, but since it was a baby shower gift we had lost the proof of purchase. This was no problem for Amazon though as their customer service gets five stars for providing a return shipping label and will refund the total since we had registered (and the unit was bought) with them.If you are much more careful than my wife and I, sure, get this product and you may be happy. As for me, I'm staying away from this brand.
