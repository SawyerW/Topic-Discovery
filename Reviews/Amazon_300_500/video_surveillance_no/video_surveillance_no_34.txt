These earpieces run circles around the boom headsets included with the Midland GXT1000! The earpiece itself is as comfortable as any bluetooth earpiece I've ever used, though it does get uncomfortable after long periods if you don't get it situated just right (not unexpected). The clear plastic part is very professional-looking if the wires are run a certain way. The earpiece stays in place fairly well even through moderate physical activity, but starts to slip easily with perspiration.The sound quality is excellent and met all of my expectations, though I was a little disappointed by the lack of a volume boost for use in noisy environments (such as a dance club where I do security). The microphone is okay, but not great. In quiet environments, it operates as expected. With a lot of background noise, mic transmissions quickly become distorted and you have to practically swallow the mic to get your message out.The length of the ear-to-mic wire isn't quite long enough to allow versatility in how you want to wire it (as some reviewers said, it can't usually be wired near your wrist unless the wearer is exceptionally short of stature, for example). The mic-to-radio wire is long enough to wear the radio almost anywhere on your belt without risking limited mobility or accidental disconnection.The durability of the coiled part of the plastic earpiece is unimpressive. After about 60 hours of use over the course of a few weeks, the coiled part has started to lose some of its elasticity (it stretches but doesn't readily return to its fully-coiled state). I fear that the same may be true with the over-ear loop, which seems to best fit in the right ear, and sticks out a little too much from the left ear.Overall, this is a must-have for the Midland GXT1000, primarily because the included boom headsets stink on ice. It's also a recommended accessory for other two-pin radios if you need a clear, professional solution.
