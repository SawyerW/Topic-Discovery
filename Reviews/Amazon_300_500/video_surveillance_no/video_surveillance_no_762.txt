We purchased this video monitor because our older Summer Infant monitor wouldn't hold a charge after a year and a half of use, so we always had to have it plugged in.  I read the other reviews for some of the other monitors and decided on this one because of its features.  The thing that sold me was the remote movement of the camera which is absolutely necessary with this model.The picture is clear, slightly clearer than the Summer Infant monitor, but probably due to the larger, crisper screen.  The hand-held unit is a nice, portable size, but doesn't have clip or anything to attach it to you when you're walking around the house.  The controls and icons are fairly intuitive.  I do wish the buttons would light up when you pick it up or at least had a little bump on them so you knew which button you were pressing, but it's not a deal breaker.  True, the volume is nested in a menu, but it's not hard to adjust and I don't find myself needing to adjust it all the time.The reason why the remote camera movement is necessary with this monitor is because the focal length is not very wide.  I placed the camera in the same position as the old monitor's camera and I could only see a zoomed in portion of the crib, so I do find myself moving the camera around when our son rolls around the crib.  The movement is pretty quiet and he doesn't notice when the camera is moving.The talk-back feature is pretty cool.  But it confuses the heck out of my kid.  It's kinda fun watching him scan the room when I talk to him, trying to figure out where my voice is coming from.  The remote music feature is kinda lame as the sound is not soothing (think old 90s midi) and is a little harsh sounding.I do think this monitor is a little over-priced, but not a waste of money.  Hoping this will last us until the next kid.
