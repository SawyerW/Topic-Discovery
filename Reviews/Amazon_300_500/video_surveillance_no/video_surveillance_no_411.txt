Found these in a two pack at my local Costco and $25 OFF.Took them home and unpacked just one to see how things went.I worked on trying to get the this camera hooked up to my Wifi for 30mins and was on hold with customer service that long too.  Their C.S. line kept saying at the beginning I was 12th in line and then eventually 6th after 30 mins.  I didn't want a call back I wanted results now.I Finally got a view from the camera.  Once I took the network wire off and pressed the Wifi button on the back the light was green and my computer said the "Camera was unstable... unable to connect. "  I did this three times and got the same message.I then dug out the second camera in the two pack and programmed that one the same way.  Same problem and error message.I use a MAC and thought it might be a MAC issue so I dug out my old PC and it made no difference.Both cameras would say... "Camera was unstable... unable to connect. "It sat on a counter top the entire time never moved it except to get it to work!I finally gave up and placed them both in the packing to take back to Costco for a full refund.I was excited when these went on sale for a package of two and thought these would work great.  Not!I have a Dropcam that I bought last year and will be buying another one again soon!  They take 5mins max to hookup PC or MAC!They do NOT require a network cable to program or find your Network or Wifi!I often turn the Dropcam OFF when home and turn it ON remotely with any of my devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook... etc).They come on in an instant!I hope they come out with an all weather version someday.  Would be nice to have one outdoors as well.The best price on the Dropcam is from them directly and they cover the shipping it's FREE.  Their Customer Service the two times I called about simple inquiries was fast and top notch.  They were very kind people too! They are state side and all speak English perfectly!!!
