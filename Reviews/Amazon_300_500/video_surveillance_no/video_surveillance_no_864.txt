I have been using this monitor for about a year now, and have recommended it to everyone I know who is having a baby.  The product is very nicely priced compared to other camera systems.  I have a two story house and my daughter lives on the top floor in the back and am able to go out well into my front yard without any issues.  The camera is very clear and I LOVE the night vision. I'm actually able to take pictures of the video monitor on my cell phone and they are still clear in both day and night.  I have not used any other camera system so I can not compare quality, but for less that $100 this camera is amazing.  The best feature is the auto screen off (VOX on/off) that after a certain amount of quiet time the screen blacks out until noise is detected.  This makes my room stay dark at night and is a good indication if you can't be right by the camera all the time.  I recently took it camping and was able to set it up inside and see the screen flicker on if my daughter woke up.  You are able to set up four camera but I do wish the cameras were a little cheaper (one camera is as much as the whole system) so I haven't tried this feature. This unit does cause interference if you are an Xbox gamer using Turtle Beach headphones (which probably doesn't apply to many of you but for those it does the interference is annoying but manageable if you move the two systems around), but I don't even know its on with other WiFi using electronics.  This also has a one year hassle free warranty (my unit recently stopped working and they sent a new one out very quickly even before receiving my old one) which is pretty good and the customer service representatives are so very nice and friendly.  If you are looking for a good quality camera for not a lot of money, this is definitely the one to buy!!!!!
