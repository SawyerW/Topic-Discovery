I bought these primarily to use on the windows and doors in my basement.  Crime is very low in our area, and I didn't feel the need to buy an expensive alarm system or to add a service.  These sounded like they would fit my needs well.  I will say that in alarm mode, these little units put out more sound than I thought possible... they do work!  The small units are designed for use with windows, and they're ideal.  They simply stick on with double-sided tape and they're small enough to place out of sight.  A switch allows you to turn them off as necessary, too.The unit with the keypad for use with a door is a bit different.  It's substantially larger and the siren in it is indeed louder, but the keypad function just doesn't cut it for me.  Too often I've turned the unit on instead of off, or the buttons failed to work when I entered the code, and the alarm goes off and is difficult to turn off.  I ended up tearing the unit off the door (which is easy because of the double-stick tape) and smashed it on the floor to shut it up when I couldn't turn it off.  It went into the trash.I did have an extra window monitor, so I placed that on the door.  With the switch, I can set it to act as a doorbell of sorts, chiming when the door is opened.  That's perfect for my needs; more useful to me than the alarm. For that reason, I'm giving the system 2 stars... there is value to the system for this use, and considering the low price of the system, I feel like I got some value from the purchase.  Other than for a use like this, I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
