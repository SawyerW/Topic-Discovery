I bought this thing after considerable research.  I wanted wireless hookup so I didn't have to inch my 300lb body around in my 130 degree crawl space running wires everywhere.  This product shines on all counts, EXCEPT that it will only record one camera at a time and you can't surveille the other cameras while recording.  Very disappointed to find that out in the instruction manual AFTER the purchase.  I don't remember seeing any reference to that little tidbit of info in the manufacturers write-up on Amazon.  My wife has been attacked twice by our neighbor's loose pit-bull while she was walking our dogs on leashes in front of our home.  The neighbors deny that her injuries were caused by their dog and now have declared war on the block.  I needed at least two cameras to monitor and record the 100 yd stretch just in front of our house, so when it happens again it will all be on video.  With only one camera recording, my wife only has about a 100-150 foot range to walk the dogs.Otherwise, I'm very pleased with the set.  Super easy set-up, easy hook-up to TVs with component inputs.  Cams provide a nice picture and good sound and the infrared works great.  Get at least a 16 gig SD card to use (I found one at local electronics store on sale for $25.00).  That way you can record up to about 48 hours on the card and then save relevant footage to your computer's hard drive, external drive, etc.  Would have given it the full 5 stars, but not too happy about the one-camera-record deal.  Now I will have to buy another whole set just to have two cameras recording at the same time.  Doubled my cost for this project, but my wife's safety is paramount.
