I spent some time researching entry level quality DVR's and this is what I ended up buying. The cameras are kinda cheap and clunky and have the "convienence store" quality video, but its a lot cheaper than a IP camera. It would be nice if the cameras were white to match the soffits on 90% of the houses out there but I suppose you can always paint them. The setup within the DVR is clunky as well but it works. I would like to have seen a mobile app that would let you change some of the settings remotely but not yet. The key to remote viewing is to have a uPNP router, so much easier than port forwarding. Swann also offers a free DDNS service which gives you a dedicated domain and IP address. So far the DDNS service has been pretty reliable. The length of the cables are about 60 ft and I bought some longer cables for cameras further away. You can configure each camera individually. I have some cameras with motion detection turned on when I'm away. You can set up active zones for the motion detection so if a car drives by or the dog walks by it wont trigger an alarm. The alarm email function sends a picture of the "motion " it detected. The instructions give examples for Gmail accounts but any email provider can be used. The only other thought I can make is that you need to leave yourself plenty of time for running cables. Give yourself at least an hour for each camera and take your time. The DVR should be hidden but accessible so that you can easily make changes to the alarm schedule.I've only had this running for about a week and will update if I get any new information.
