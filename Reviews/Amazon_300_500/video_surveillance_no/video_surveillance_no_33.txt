I have an older set of Midland G-11 two way radios and they still work great.  I wanted something that you could wear that was unobtrusive and was comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I ordered these and they are really very good performing headsets.  The acoustic tube in your ear is so comfortable that I actually forgot that I was wearing it.  I was shocked at how good the sound is and it is actually much better than using the speakers.  The control works great and allows you to use the PTT button in a hand held situation or wear it on your collar.Plugging in the headsets into the G-11 makes adjusting the volume /on/off knob hard to turn but that situation is workable.  I am a big tall guy and the control/microphone can be ran down your sleeve and clipped to your cuff.  My dress shirts are 36 inch long sleeves and cuffs (or longer in some shirts) and the wire is too short to work comfortably going down my sleeve.  I am going to have to splice the wires if I want to use them in that mode.The VOX works but whichever person pushes the button and releases it has control of the VOX until the other radio has its button pushed.  I prefer just using the PTT mode and they work fine.  I saw some complaints about plastic collar clips but mine are made of sturdy metal and work just great.Overall I can only highly recommend these to you.  The voice transmission is loud and clear while also being discrete. You can even hear whispered messages clearly which was impossible when using the two way radio speakers.  You can also use the volume controls set at a much lower level than ever before.  They are very comfortable and for the price they are a great purchase.  I still gave them 5 stars even though the wires are short for me as the other benefits are outstanding.
