Seems like they made a product replacement or sent me the wrong unit, but looks like I got a slightly more expensive unit, so what the heck, I thought I'd checked it out.First COMPLAINT, the manuals are very very poorly written. I had to navigate myself to get the wired and wireless feature to work. I was unable to get port forwarding for the WAN feature to work. Upside, I got the Iphone with 3G capability to work. You almost need a PhD in electrical engineering with expertise in network engineering just to get the damn thing to work for these simple features. That is for someone in the know.Iif u are totally clueless, you'd likely return it and charge it to "the damn thing does not work !"The manual recording works. However, the scheduled recording works intermittently. Which means, getting it to start and stop the scheduled recording was a BIG problem. I got it to work only ONCE. Sometimes, if I manually started the recording it will stop at a scheduled time. For the most part, the start-stop scheduled recording never works.It is strange going to the Camera setup, the camera time is different from the PC. Like my PC is set at Pacific time. To get the time to synchronize, I had to set the camera to mountain time. I don't understand why this is so. There is no option for daylight savings.Spelling....they spelled scanning as "scaning"....now u know it is a made in China crap. That explains why the manual is poorly written and the software is also poorly engineered.For what's it's worth, it works about 50%, but key features. like scheduled recordings need to always work not intermittently, If  I have to figure a get around, this is also BS.If u don't need all the features to work, then for the price, it will be ok. If u are trying to max your use out of this, u aint going to get it !!
