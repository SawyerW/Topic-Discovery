We should have bought this in the beginning!  However, we got an audio monitor that we also love.  We decided to get a video monitor for our son (who has never been a great sleeper) when he started moving around in the crib.  Sometimes he would cry because he didn't want to go to sleep, but sometimes he would cry when he backed into the crib and would get his leg stuck.  We needed a way to tell the difference so that we didn't go in his room at every cry.  This monitor did the trick.  It was a breeze to set up once we decided where we wanted it.  Another plus:  although it plugs into the wall and runs off of electricity, it continues working even when the power goes out.  Our audio monitor has to be turned back on manually once the power comes back on, which would wake our son.I should mention that I am not crazy about the button that allows you to talk to the baby.  My husband thinks it a great toy and talks to our son.  He has scared him more than once.The range on this monitor is not great, either.  We have a large, two-story house.  My son's room is upstairs, at the opposite side of the house from the front porch.  We cannot use the monitor on the front porch.  However, since our audio monitor has a very large range, we were not concerned with that when considering video monitors.UPDATE:  We bought this monitor in March 2011.  After having it just under a year, the part that plugs into the charger broke off inside the monitor.  The company didn't give us any trouble about sending it back.  However, we were without a monitor for over a week.  In addition, I think they just fixed the old monitor instead of sending us a new one because when we shook the monitor, it sounded like a piece was broken off inside it.  Now, just six months later, the piece is broken again, and we cannot charge the monitor!  I just ordered a new system and am going to see about sending this one back!  This is rediculous!!!
