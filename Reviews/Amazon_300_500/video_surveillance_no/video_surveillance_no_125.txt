I have read reviews here stating that the light is not very bright. I dont know if they were reviewing a faulty unit, but mine is so bright you would see the tv lights on during daylight.The unit has 4 settingsoffondusk+ 4 hours anddusk+ 7 hoursThe dusk settings work with an ambient light sensor so you want to ensure that it can see daylight where you place it so it will be off during those times. Its operation would be similar to night lights you might have plugged in around the house. When you have it on the dusk + 7 hour setting, it has a low blue led always on to indictae that it is in that mode. If you choose the dusk + 4 hours, the led is red. Very useful setting to now that the unit is operational when you set it and leave the house.If you do not like those options you can set it on a timer plug and have it set on the always on mode so when the plug switches on, the unit will go on.For power consumption, the unit barely registers on the killawat in standby mode and when its on, it consumes less than my 40 inch lcd tv (granted, if it was an led tv, my tv consumption would be even less).I checked it from the outside and the light switching is random as if you were watching some intense action flick. At moments its super bright and others its quite dark. I have always used lights on timers and some timers are even a bit more random than just turning on at specific times (anyone remember home alone where the burglars knew the times the lights to deter burglars would go on?). But this technique is well known and the fake tv is not. As for the fake tv..well people will often watch tv at the same time to watch some regular shows, so even if one knew about the fake tv, they couldnt be certain it was that.So overall I am glad I purchased this and added it to my security system.
