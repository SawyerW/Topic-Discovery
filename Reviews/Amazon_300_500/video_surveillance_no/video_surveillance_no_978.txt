Note that these reviews appear to be for any camera in this series and are not specific to each camera. I purchased the BB4325X and was overall disappointed. It's possible that, had I purchased another unit, my ratings would more closely reflect the average users' opinion. Do make sure the ratings you're reading apply to the monitor you're considering.Pros- I found this very easy and quick to setup as a standalone baby monitor (not using the wifi features)- The camera has a large range of motion from side to side and up (but not down)Cons- The marketing imagery is totally deceptive and doesn't at all represent the image you can expect to see on the unit's display, perhaps even with a camera studio.- Range of motion down is what's needed, because invariably you're trying to look down into a crib. This camera doesn't angle down far enough to do that well, so you need to rig a way to mount it with a tilt.- The zoom is awful, whole unusable. When you zoom in (digitally) it always defaults to the top left corner of the frame as a the full frame image. Unfortunately, only the top left corner isn't lit by the infrared illumination, so you see a black image (or something mildly better). To make matters worse, you can scroll to the center of the image, but the scrolling is so slow, it makes it a 60 second process to zoom.- Wifi android app is very poor. Be sure to check out the reviews on the android market if you intend to use this functionality.- The wifi is overall very limited. I found this feature didn't at all support my needs and I would have been better off with a standard baby monitor that was either cheaper or outperformed this one in image quality or range.
