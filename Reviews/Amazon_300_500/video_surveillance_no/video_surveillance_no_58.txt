First trail cam purchased/used AFTER a lot of research ..USE-on 1-2 acre open food plots so trigger time is not quite a critical as one a few feet off of a travel lane BOUGHT MORE-I bought 2 TC35's for my 2 main plots ...they have been in service for over a 6 weeks ...set on picture,10 second interval and 3 shots per event I have one camera I am removing 2-300 pictures every 4-5 days and on the other one 4-800 ...the first over clover,second over turnups/rape ...so already 1000's of pics and battery life is at 75% on the heavy use and 85% on the slower one ...pic quality is great or certainly good enough to determine deer quality such as an astounding number of button bucks,fighting big bucks etc ...bought a third one a month after the first two for my corn field ...used copper top duracel on the first two and evererady on the 3rd one which is producing 1-150/4days and it's battery life is already down to 75% ...so until I change the #3 cam batteries to duracelI cannot say duracel for sure but beware! ...for the $$ and my use these cam's are proven winners ...life span I cannot say ...one last point on trigger speed ...it will catch a running deer ..example...with deer at 30 foot distance ,running left to right,1st frame of three deer is right of center,second frame deer is on right hand edge, third frame empty ...walking as in a fast traveling deer ...again left to right ...first frame deer on left,second centered,third on left ...walking or grazing deer appear on the side they enter from ...one last concern ...shutter noise when taking a pic ...yes it is there ...now if I can figure out how to keep the deer from licking the camera! [slight pull of your leg there] the deer acknowledge it, sort of unsteady,quickly learn to ignore,but it does aleart me to NEW deer as to how they react ...regulars keep feeding,big mature bucks more stand offish and new deer unsteady but then graze ...I have actually had a six point buck get face to face ..like a foot or two checking it out ...good luck!
