Mother of very active twins and I needed a camera to see them when they go to bed and naptime - their room is far away from our master and sleep is a premium.  I would hear sounds with the audio baby monitor and go all the way to their room to find them just rustling in their bed... I got worried that I would not check out a sound and it would be serious.  So I tried several video monitors... this was the only one that could detect the camera in their room.I now have one in their bedroom and their bathroom.  It is wonderful - for me the pan and tilt is worth the extra money in the bigger screen model.  I love the ability to talk to them - I pretend I am Buzz Lightyear's Star Command.  And when they start to do something that I want them to stop before I can reach their room (stuff tons of TP in the toilet, squirt toothpaste at each other, etc)  I talk to them over the monitor as I am going to the room.  They immediately stop what they are doing and jump in their beds...2 drawbacks:1 -the price - ouch - but I could not find another camera that would detect the camera in their room - not sure if it is the distance or the soundproofing in the walls...2 -not being able to mute the sound entirely as stated in other reviews.  But the benefits far outweigh that.... It also does not do split screen, so when they split up into separate rooms,I will need to get a second parent unit... more $, but maybe I won't need it by then and I can use this as a security camera for our back lanai.  The reception is great and the quality of my sleep has been greatly enhanced.
