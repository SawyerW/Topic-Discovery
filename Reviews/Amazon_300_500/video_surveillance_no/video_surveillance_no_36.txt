We recently moved into an apartment as we are building a new house.  I rented a garage as well, since I don't like scraping frost off of my car windows for 30 minutes before driving to work each day.  The landlord handed me a Linear three button remote clip-on variety that attaches to your visor.  This remote is useless to me for a couple of reasons:  #1 I have Homelink in my car so I can use it to open the door and #2 I have to remove the three button remote from the car each night so I can close the garage door with it.  The is no other garage egress.So, of course, just about every other morning I take the 1/4 mile walk from the apartment to the garage and forget the 3 button visor mount remote.  I try has hard as I can to keep it in the pocket of my jacket, then the next day I select another jacket to wear!  I walk/job back to the apartment to get the visor mounted remote to open the door.  If my four year old is with me, I get to hear a very Homer Simpson-ish "Doh!" followed by a mountain of complaining as we make the long, cold walk back to the apartment.Fed up, I found this KEYCHAIN transmitter on Amazon for under $20!  It's about the size of my Prius keyfob, maybe slightly less wide.  It took about 10 seconds to set it up.  Push the button on the garage door opener til it starts flashing, hit the button on your keychain transmitter, and test.  Now I ALWAYS have my garage door opener, unless I forget my keys, which is rare.  I hate to spend money on temporary apartment accessories, but this was affordable and makes life that much simpler.
