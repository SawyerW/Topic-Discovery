We originally bought a Samsung monitor for our first child and it completely stopped working after 15 months. Long story short- Samsung refused to do anything because it had been over a year and I will never buy anything from them again....Okay, now onto this product. I researched every monitor on the market after our bad experience. I'm having baby #2 so I knew I wanted two cameras. There really is no perfect monitor out there but I bought this after reading good reviews several months ago and so far we've been very happy with this one! Video monitors make life with babies much easier! I can make sure my toddler isn't climbing out and my infant is sleeping sound. The picture is clear- no it doesn't look as clear as the box shows but I don't think any of these monitors do. I still have a good view of my toddler and know exactly what he's doing in his crib. I know some reviewers have complained about button placement/size but this hasn't really been issue for us. I think over time you just get used to where the buttons you need are but some of the placement is a little odd. The zoom feature is pretty worthless so don't let that feature persuade you at all.There is no mute button but there is a volume control.I do wish that the battery life was longer. It's fine if I remember to keep plugged in at night but with little ones my memory isn't that great and it doesn't last the whole night. I also don't like how if monitor is running on battery the screen shuts off after several minutes to save battery and you have to keep pushing screen button to return to screen. This is really just a small annoyance and if left plugged in it's not an issue.Other than that little peeve this has worked very well for our family! This may be obvious but just wanted to point out for newbie parents who may not know... the monitor itself is wireless once charged but the actual camera for babies room is not wireless. That has to be plugged in at all times.
