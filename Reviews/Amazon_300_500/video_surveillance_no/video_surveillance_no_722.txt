The camera and the monitor are of great quality during night and day. The viewing angle of the camera, while can be a bit wider, is very much acceptable for most rooms and in par with competition. The quality of the video is significantly better than others I've seen. The batter life of the monitor is very acceptable considering the size of the screen.The sleep function can be setup to "wake up" the monitor on noise. I didn't play with it much, but it appears to be working if you take enough time to tune the sensitivity on the camera itself.The two way communication feature comes handy when one of the parents take care of the baby and the second needs to relay some information. Not so much for "speaking to the baby" as the quality of the speaker is mediocre. Since it's a secondary function I am not worrying too much about it. The "singing" function is useless as it plays very soft and, as mentioned, the speaker is mediocre. Once again, I purchased the set for camera and sound communication FROM the baby's room which works excellent!The one thing that seems to be problematic is the temperature sensor that always shows the temp about 10F higher than it actually is. I tried two different cams and they seem to all have that problem. I learned to live with it, but because of that I can't rely on temperature alarm function which could be useful otherwise.Distance wise, with the antenna extended I was able to get out of the house and move to a significant distance while still getting a good signal. With antenna closed, it still covers the whole house just fine.In short, highly recommend, but be warned that you may not be able to rely on temperature sensor.
