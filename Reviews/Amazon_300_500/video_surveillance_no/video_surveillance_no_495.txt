I've always been curious what my dogs do while I'm not at home.  The DCS-5020L finally ended my curiosity.Setting up the camera was a lot easier than I expected.  I plugged it into an ethernet port and my computer quickly found it on the network.  I logged into the camera itself and played around with some settings.  From there, I created a Mydlink cloud account so I could easily log into the camera remotely.  I estimate the set-up took about 20 minutes.  The 5020L comes with screws so you can permanently install it somewhere, but I opted to just set it down in the location where my dogs usually sleep.The fun part of this camera is that I can login from work and see what my dogs are doing during the day.  The software also sends me an email when noise or movement is detected.  I found out what I long suspected - my dogs sleep almost the entire day.  The fun part about this camera is what when my dogs do walk around, I can follow them with the pan/tilt feature.  I can also zoom in to get a clearer idea of what they are doing.The image quality of this camera is an issue for me though.  The camera has a very difficult time picking up the details of my black dog.  She just looks like a black blob.  I can't make out her eyes or nose or anything else.  With my red and white dog, I can see her face clearly.  I know cameras of all types have difficulty with black dogs, but the lack of detail in this case is extreme.My other concern about this camera has to do with privacy.  I unplug the camera when I'm at home.  I couldn't find anything on the Mydlink Cloud site that specifically addresses privacy when it comes to the camera.  Specifically, does anyone at Dlink have the ability to login and see anyone's camera?Overall, I recommend this camera.  It offers a lot of interesting features - such as pan/title and email notifications of motion/noise.  It's also simple to set-up and access remotely.
