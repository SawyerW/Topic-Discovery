I ordered this because we run a small business out of our home and would like to have more security.  My husband and I set it up ourselves, and we have about average technical ability, haha.  We noticed that the users manual is VERY user friendly - it has written instructions as well as great pictures and charts if you are a visual person - and they automatically include a spanish manual too.It took us a few hours to set up, with our average technical ability.  It was tedious at times.  If you prefer there is a card included giving you a phone number and information to pay for a professional to install it for you - it's your choice.We think the 500 gb hard drive is very nice because of vacations - there is enough space on that hard drive to record for 15 days straight, or longer if you use the motion detection method.The HDMI cable plugs into the computer monitor or TV for viewing.  The other cable plugs into your internet router.There are 4 cameras included and each of them needs to be plugged into an electric outlet, as does the main unit.Each camera comes with a nice length of wire - I didn't get the exact length but thought it was a generous amount.There is no USB cable included, but if you want to get a USB cable you can use it to connect and backup to your computer.  Or you can also use a large flash drive.We have it set up to record video only but it seems like there would be a way to set it up to record audio as well although it would require additional purchases.We've only had it a couple weeks and fortunately there have been no prowlers or break ins but we are pleased with it and glad to have it.  We would recommend it for other small business owners or home owners.
