I've had this camera at home for about 2 weeks and I am almost to the point where I am ready to return it.  On the surface the product works well, the picture and audio are fine.  The external viewing capability is not as easy to get working as other reviewers have indicated, so that is still on my to-do list.  The major problem i have with the camera is the fact that it hogs my wifi network and interferes with server-to-server connections I have at home.  I am in the middle of copying a whole bunch of files from one PC to another, then I turn on this camera and the connection is lost.  Also, if the camera is running and showing a picture and audio is coming in normally, then I start to do something else on the network (not necessarily on the wifi network) the picture will freeze and the camera no longer responds.  I have lost track of the number of times I have had to restart the camera.  I have upgraded the firmware, reset to factory settings and have not found a solution yet.  I am a day or two away from giving up and sending this camera back and going with another vendor.  I will update the review if I find out what the problem is later.  If I could get passed this issue, I'm sure I would love the camera and give it 5 stars.--Update:  I fumbled around with the settings a little more and have managed to get everything working.  It seemed that I had an IP conflict with two other devices on my network that was somehow causing the camera to freeze - since I have resolved that the camera has never stopped.  Also somehow the internet viewing capability is now working too, although I am unable to move the camera when viewing it remotely - I get "error on page" when using the navigation buttons.  I am now raising this from 3 stars to 5 stars - and hope that I can figure out what the remote nav problem is soon.
