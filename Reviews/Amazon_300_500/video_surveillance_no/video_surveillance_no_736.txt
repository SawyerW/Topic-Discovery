If you're in your mid-30s, then you grew up in a time when you you could spend your hard earned money on an electronic device and have an expectation that it would last for longer than 3 months- and if it DID stop working, the company would stand behind it- regardless of whether or not you saved the sales slip- but as I mentioned, that USED TO BE a rarity.  Unfortunately, the world has changed and that is no longer the way electronics companies do business.This monitor worked great for about 3 or 4 months, then the screen went white.  It seemingly fixed itself then would randomly go white again.  Motorola has no email or online contact for their baby monitors, so it's phone only, and limited hours.  When I finally called to ask about a fix, before I even finished describing the problem, the Customer Service Rep told me how to fix it.  I asked how long the fix would last, and she told me that it would be permanent.  It was not.  It would work, then not work, then work, then not work.  I would estimate it at about 70% reliability.  Even with the white screen, the audio worked, but I could have purchased an audio monitor for 1/5 the price, so I wasn't satisfied.I called again to ask what my next course of action is, and I got the (now) standard, "no receipt, no luck" routine that companies use when they don't take responsibility for putting out flawed products.  As I said, I grew up in a time when you opened up an electronics product and it worked or it didn't, at which point you could discard your receipt.  The receipt is long gone, as is the box.  Not purchased from Amazon, where I'd be able to find it in my account, but rather from another site with A LOT of gift cards- it appears I'm out of luck. Save your receipt, or buy a different product.
