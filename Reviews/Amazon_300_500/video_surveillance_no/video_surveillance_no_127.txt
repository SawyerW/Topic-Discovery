I have 34 of these WD RE4 2TB drives in production at work, in Promise Vtrak J610 shelves connected via LSI SAS cards, and have another 26 about to go into production in new systems I'm building using SuperMicro cases and motherboards and LSI cards.  In big RAID systems you must use hard drives manufactured to support RAID operation, particularly in regard to error recovery timing.  Desktop hard drives take a long time to perform error recovery - which causes problems in RAID systems leading to data corruption and premature flagging of a drive as bad.  These WD RE4 drives use a feature called "Time Limited Error Recovery" to prevent a drive in error recovery from being dropped by the array.  Supposedly enterprise drives are built more vibration tolerant to handle the stresses of being operated in a drive shelf.In any case, over the past year one of the Vtrak shelves loaded with 16 RE4 drives behaved flawlessly and the other one lost 4 drives in a single episode over a 48 hour period about 6 months into deployment.  My experience is, thus, mixed.  However the price per spindle is dramatically better than using branded drives from HP, Dell, or the other major storage vendors.  My advice is to use RAID 6 and designate 2 hot spares per shelf.Other than this single episode with 4 drives dying in short temporal proximity, these drives have been fine.  Their performance is good.  In the large array they provide large storage at a decent price with acceptable performance.  Prices have risen dramatically because WD's Thailand operation was damaged by the Fall 2011 flooding in Thailand.  Prices will probably go up further until production levels are restored sometime in mid 2012 or so.UPDATE - after the subsequent review warned about getting a pulled drive I looked at my last one (purchased 12/11/11).  It is a mint sealed WD2003FYYS-02WB0 RE4 drive.  My recent purchase was legit.
