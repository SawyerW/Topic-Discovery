I looked at and purchased/returned several video baby monitors with a pan/tilt feature before I chose the Motorola MBP36. I picked it over my other favorite, a Summer Infant camera, because the sound quality of the Motorola monitor was superior. I could literally hear my child breathing if I turned the volume up loud enough!It really has a lot of great features: a speaker to let you talk with your baby, night vision when the room is dark, volume control (though a little annoying to get to), and of course the pan/tilt function. I originally had 2 cameras, one for each of my babies, and used the monitor EVERY naptime & at night. It let me get more chores done, take showers more often, and even spend more time with my husband.It worked great for 7 months or so, and then the sound started randomly cutting off and the picture quality was deteriorating. Eventually the volume stopped working altogether. I called customer service at Motorola and they were very professional and accommodating, only requiring me to have my original receipt and to send the old monitor/camera set back using a pre-paid shipping label they provided. They sent me a new set of 2 cameras with monitor, and the first thing I noticed immediately after setting it up was that the picture quality was deteriorated on the new monitor, much like my it was on the monitor I had shipped back to them. Otherwise, the camera worked great and the sound quality was back to normal. Then, after only a couple of months, the volume on the 'new' monitor started cutting in and out, so I called them back and was sent a newer model, which is the one I have now. Straight out of the box, this newest monitor had problems with the volume cutting off, and the picture quality is the worst of the 3 I've gone through. It's still usable, and I use it nearly everyday, but considering that I paid almost $300 for the original set I purchased a year ago, I am NOT happy with the outcome.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR.
