Paid a little extra for a well known name brand - Samsucks - shame on me! Samsung sucks big time.But if you have a lot of time to waste and get off on frustration then get this on rush order!The camera and monitor setups are simple but you will be richly rewarded when you try to set it up on the PC monitor! After a few rounds of getting a message that it it wsn't recognized (Windows 7)I finally got the message that the software had been correctly installed, but not to worry no image appeared on the PC screen. Must be a quirk with the Tosh laptop so I moved on to my Win 7 HP desktop. Same sequence of events, no luck, then apparent luck but finally rewarded with no screen image. Marvelous.Then the lightbulb went on, must need an updated driver for Windows 7! Almost downloaded a download program made to appear to be Samsung before I saw the $29.99 pricetag and veered away before I turned a bunch of gremlins loose in my PC. Finally searched around to find Samsung drivers download site but no drivers for SEW 3030, type in "security monitor" and you get a list of 6000 TVs they want to sell you but nothing for SEW 3030.I finally punted and went back to my old HP XP dinosaur thinking the problem was the lack of Windows 7 updates but to my delight it didn't work even with good old rock solid XP.Alarmed that I couldn't follow a few simple instructions to install what should be no-brainer consumer software I became alarmed and did some stroke tests and checked my head for massive bruises to see if I fell during the night but I was relieved to see it wasn't me - Samsung had truly released this product which does not work on any PC system.Just to complete the OS hat trick I'll try it on my nephews Apple just to confirm that it's false advertising to state that this works on computer monitors.
