I tested out two systems from Q-SEE.  This one and the Q-See QT4760-8E4-1 Surveillance System (Black/White).  They are at very different price points - this one currently at $2000 and the other currently at $700.  Here, I will try to outline some of the differences between these systems.  Even though they are at such different price points, hopefully this will help people sort out which type of system will be best for them.Some key differences:* To start, the QT718 is a much higher quality system with with HD cameras and full HD capacity.  This make for much more precise image quality.* The QT4760 includes a 16-channel 704x480 DVR with a 1 TB hard drive, while the QT718 includes an 8-channel HD DVR with a 2 TB hard drive* The QT4760 includes 8 high resolution cameras with 100 ft of night vision.  The QT718 has 8 full 1080p HD digital cameras with 50' of night vision* The QT4760 cameras have 4.6mm lenses which have a 50-55 degree field of view, while the QT718 cameras have 3.6mm lenses which have a 60-65 degree field of view* The QT4760 has 50 ft of standard BNC cable, while the QT718 has 100 ft of shielded RG-59 cable* The QT4760 has 3 recording modes: manual, motion detection and timed.  The QT718 includes all of those modes as well as an alarm trigger mode.Both systems have cameras that are weatherproof and seem to be quite sturdy.  They both use Q-See's apps for smartphones, which are convenient and functional as well as core software that is fairly straightforward.I haven't used it yet, but Q-See does claim to have lifetime customer support, which would be very useful for anyone setting up their security system for the first time.In the long run, these two systems are appealing to different consumers.  The $700 QT4760 has a good quality picture and is probably perfectly sufficient for the average home or small business owner that wants a functional security system.  The $2000 QT718 is for someone who is concerned with having extremely high quality images and much more detailed security image records.  It also happens to be one of the cheapest HD systems available.  I found both of these systems to be solidly constructed and to work well, and either is a good choice depending on your needs.
