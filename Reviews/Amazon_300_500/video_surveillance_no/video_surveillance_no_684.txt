Double-sensor alarm? Fantastic! I'll be extra safe. Heck, I'll take 2! One for the main floor of my home, and one for the basement! I am awesome for getting such a great piece of safety equipment!Such were my thoughts for the first 3-4 weeks of having this smoke detector installed.And then...One night a very steamy shower sets off the smoke detector, which is in the hallway outside the bathroom. I chide my husband for his ludicrous amount of steam and scoff that it's not possibly the fault of my precious new smoke detectors (did I mention they have dual sensors? DUAL SENSORS! I'm so safe and awesome). Maybe he shouldn't take such prissy showers!Then I took a shower the next morning. And fearing mockage, I kept the shower a little cool, and secretly opened the window to fan out all the steam I could before opening the bathroom door. I was ready to be smug about the perfection of my smoke detector. Door opens, and BEEEEEEEEEEEEP! The thing goes off. Crap. I swear, take the thing down and put it back up later that day.Next morning I shower, cranky, grumbling about the smoke detector, and while I'm still in the shower with the bathroom door closed, it starts going off. BEEEEEEEEEEEEP! Double crap. The thing's broken and getting worse.Husband is kind and insists that it's probably just defective or a spider crapped on the sensor or something. And, look! We have another one still in its package that we can install, tossing out the "old" one. Hooray! Safety returns. I even forget about the smoke detector and don't even feel jumpy during my next shower 2 days later. Then just as I'm lathering the shampoo: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! Holy mother of crap!LESSON: These detectors are VERY sensitive to steam. I'm sure they also do a great job detecting fires, but in a small ranch-style house where there aren't many "ideal" places to put one of these things, this just won't work. Now I'm out money and a little freaked out about showering.
