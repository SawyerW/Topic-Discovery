Monitor works great but it essentially shuts down the wifi in my home when the monitor is in use.  I have tried what it said in the trouble shooting guide and it does not work.  I have manually moved my router to each of the 13 channels available on the 2.4GHZ spectrum and it still hasn't done anything to alleviate the issue.  I read a bunch of reviews where the monitor did not interfere with the wifi and I have a feeling that it's probably because of the design of my house.  If the router and camera were on opposite sides of my house it would probably not be an issue for me but as it stands they are in rooms that sit next to each other.  I have a newer router that I purchased on amazon (medialink 802.11n) so I don't think it has anything to do with the routers age or the firmware that's installed on it (which is up to date).The wifi interference doesn't show up as wifi disconnected or the inability to connect to your wifi network.  When the monitor is on the wifi signal strength remains the same as if it were off.  The interference shows up in the form of packet loss.  Doing a speed test with the monitor on yielded an initial burst of 3Mbps which after about 3 seconds degraded until the test fails to finish.  With the monitor off the speed test comes through at 18-20Mbps and the test completes as it should.  Anything that taxes your connection or attempts to consume a constant amount of bandwidth (downloads, gaming, streaming, speedtests) deteriorates the connection until it is unusable.  Standard web traffic for the most part goes through just fine with some noticeable slowness but it still loads most pages.I have contacted Infant Optics tech support to see if this monitor jumps channels and have yet to hear anything back.  I am guessing that it just has a very sloppy radio.
