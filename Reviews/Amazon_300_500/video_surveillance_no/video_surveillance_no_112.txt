I've had this camera in our nursery since our baby was born in January.  It is great when you want it positioned in a fixed place.  I actually have a tip for installing -- rather than using a permanent screw in mounting, I use museum putty.  The camera is so lightweight that the museum putty has it affixed to the wall for the last two weeks with no problems.  That way, as the baby grows, I can reposition the camera (it does not have zoom)to see more of the baby as she grows.Pros:1.  Great picture.  Better than I thought it would be from a wireless monitor.  One can easily see the baby from the portable monitor.2.  Small, compact monitor with range.  It's about the size of a cellular compact phone.  Easy to carry around with me and use both upstairs and downstairs in my home.Cons:1.  Not portable and difficult to position.  The monitor does not stand up well in a non-affixed position.  It really needs to be affixed to some surface.  This is not as useful in our situation where we are using a bassinet more often than crib.  Also, the camera swivel and angling feature is a little difficult to use -- definitely not something conducive to portability.  In all practical purposes, you will affix the camera to one spot and leave it there.2.  I didn't buy this as a camera, but the fact that you would take snapshots and be able to use them is laughable.  The camera resolution is not snapshot grade.  Don't bother with this feature.3.  Feedback from microphone when monitor is close to camera.  This is annoying -- remember to turn it off when you go into the room with the camera as the feedback can wake the baby when it is close to the camera.Although there are more cons than pros, the cons are minor in comparison.  There is no perfect baby monitor, and this one is functional enough to suit our needs -- at least once the baby uses the crib more often.
