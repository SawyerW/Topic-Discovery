I have had this unit for about one week so I cannot attest to the units longevity which I have seen some complaints about. However, I am very satisfied with this units functionality and versatility.Setup is easy. I am not a computer wiz by any means but I can figure out my way around a keyboard ;) (google, youtube and zmodo forums help a lot) If you are not concerned about plugging it in to a network this thing is literally plug and play out of the box within minutes.as far as network compatibility before doing anything make sure that your firewall is not blocking you from accessing your DVR I had to fully uninstall my aftermarket firewalls windows firewall is fine just allow access.Network setup takes a little bit longer but there is a zmodo website that will help you set up your router every step of the way . the zmodo website has you pick the router that you have and the main menu type that is on your zmodo and walks you through everything including making sure your ports are open in some cases one must call their internet provider to ensure they can open ports.  The only issue I had was that the ports the setup asked me to use were already taken so I used different ones. Once this is finished you will be able to access your footage on a device (once software is downloaded on device ie Zviewer for the phone and NVMS for windows [i have windows 8 which NVMS did not work for but you can open it under "Windows XP (service pack 2)" found within properties] I found NVMS on the zmodo website under the dvr model page)Remote setup was a little bit more difficult there is a separate IP for this (also you must know your Command port number for NVMS in network under DVR settings) in order to set it up on a phone or computer for remote viewing.Do a little research, have fun with it. The product works, no matter which one you decide to buy you will have to deal with the network issues. This is a good unit especially for the price. It does everything you might want it to.
