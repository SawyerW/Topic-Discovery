It has been already about four days that I have been trying, from time to time, to place this camera, so that I can watch the feed through the Internet away from home. If you do not know much about dynamic ip and such, you will be going to school for a while if you try to do it your self. I have given up because I have a NetGear router model # DNG2200, and the menu to set the camera is not like in the instructions that I have read here, and I hate to call technical support, since the technical support for the NetGear is really poor and frustrating. I will have to call my ISP and go to the EasyN website for support information. However, if any one reading this can help me, that would be great. I am pretty sure that I am not the only one with this type of router.So the only part I could not pass through, is when it states "before outer access, please refer to your router's user's manual for how to open ports to allow Internet access to the camera." You have to really know what you are doing here.Okay, I finally manage to connect it to the Internet. Once it is connected, it appears to respond pretty good. So, I have no idea what is the difference between this ip cam and others that are more expensive. When it comes to working, so far I would give it five stars, exempt I do know how long these cameras last without any problems. I guess you could know that from other reviews. I really do not care that the colour is not very close to reality. It is an ip cam; no one is going to use it to take family movies, just for secutity and piece of mind.
