I bought this to use it to 'see' behind walls and ceilings, and it worked perfectly for that. Having an adjustable LED brightness was a bonus - although I typically used it at highest brightness to see as 'far' as possible ahead. There was insulation in all spaces I used it for, and that wreaks havoc with the camera due to reflections from the LED's, but I was able to work around this. With help from the camera, taped to end of fish tape, and nylon rods at other times, and 10-gauge copper wire for shorter distances, I was able to see and (1) fish wire and fish tape through holes, (2) see fish tape and grab it from 'the other end' (meeting in the middle), (3) check for previous wire or plumbing that I DIDN'T want to drill through (saw both, and was able to avoid drilling through), and (4) identify obstructions in blind spaces like wooden fire breaks and floor joist stiffening blocks between the joists. The display on my laptop was very good (close focal range on camera), and the software supplied ran fine, and included several image enhancement options (brightness, contrast, etc.) I solved the 'issue' some people complain about with these, of not being able to tell which way is up or down, by taping the camera to the fish tape or rod, with enough of the guide leader sticking out in front of the camera, so that it could always be seen by the camera. Then, I taped the camera to the leader while watching the display, orienting the camera so that 'down' was always towards the leader. Then, where I could keep the leader oriented from the 'push end' (easier with flat fish tape), it was easy and intuitive to tell up/down direction. In retrospect, I didn't need anywhere near all 10m of USB cable, but it doesn't hurt having it! I'll be using this 'tool' a lot, and only wish I'd had it long ago, when I did a lot more of this kind of blind work.
