The hardware is fine, the manual is barely sufficient in terms of clarity in setting up the internet connections, DDNS, and email functions. They need to hire a good technical writer to flesh out the manual with step-by-step instructions so that you'd know what the behaviour of the system will be with each setting. And certainly need to develop instructions for the non-plug and play PnP user and the PPOe setup....don't just say these items are for experts... tell us how, illuminate,educate.11/5/2013 - have finally gotten the system fully set up on the bench (dining room table, anyway). The Android phone app works fine on the data network as well as local wireless so I know it works from outside the local network. PC access on the local network works and the remote admin console works like a charm. Had my son access from another city and the console worked there as well. This has been an education. There are a few things that the manual never mentions....like having to set up your router to always assign the same IP address to the DVR via association with the MAC address. I actually intend to use this system without a PC attached so have had to re-flash a Linksys WRT54 router with DD-WRT firmware to get some really neat functionality, like having the router maintain the DDNS update between the Dynamic IP your ISP provides and my chosen  DDNS provider's host URL I set up on their system (embedded Inadyn software in DD-WRT). Since I have a DSL modem that freezes occasionally and a seperate router, will be ordering a two port power cycler that will power cycle the modem and router if a ping shows a host to be unreachable. The only thing I haven't fully ironed out is whether the email alerts will calm down once the cameras are mounted. I can currently see some moire artifacting of the image while the camera lies on the table and suspect it sees that as motion. Sometimes I get lots of emails, sometimes just a couple, with only a few being true motion triggers.
