A burglar is only interested in stealing your stuff and doesn't want confrontation. If there's somebody home, he'll go somewhere else. That's what these lights do!  Make it look like there's somebody home, watching TV.I also know, from experience, most break-ins are neighbors, or even (so called) friends who know your work hours, habits, or when you're on vacation. These blinking LED lights look just like TV lights flickering as scenes change, and have a sensor that turns it on when dark for 4 or 7 hours, or leave it on all the time. (I leave mine on all the time) I have a vacation house I only go to twice a year. When I get there it's normally dark. It always startles me when I pull in the driveway because it looks like someone's home, watching TV!  I've had four of these things for over a year now and they still work fine. I place them in different rooms and even move them around sometimes. Plus,  I leave them on when I'm there. They make great night lights.Tip: Place them where you can't see them from looking in the windows. (They tell you this too.) Buy six fake cameras too! They're cheap, and an electronic barking dog as well. (They're amazing)  I tell my friends the cameras are fake and they don't believe me! Lol...This may sound funny but they work very well for presents. I Just bought another for my daughter's house and she loves it. If you buy fake cameras, make sure you install them high enough, but where it's easy to change the batteries. (about every six months) I have a couple inside my house too. Six cameras, a barking dog, and fake TV, $175.00.Want to know who's visiting? Game cameras are about $75.00 these days and will take pictures for months. You'd be surprised who comes to visit when you're not home. Don't forget to put up a few signs stating "Video Surveillance."
