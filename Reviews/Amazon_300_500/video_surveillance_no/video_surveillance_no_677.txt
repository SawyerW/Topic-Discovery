If you plan to use the camera as an active video feed that you can access remotely then the item is perfect, day or night as the night vision works awesome.  If you are planning to use the camera as a security feature enabling the motion detection to send you alerts to an ftp or by email, then you are out of luck....like me as this was the main reason I purchased it.I tried with the settings....gmail...yahoo....comcast...all smtps...port 465, 587, 110...25...enabling virtual servers...nothing.  Since the camera doesn't have a test feature to check the settings on email or ftp forwarding I ran the monitoring view from the computer installed software (comes with the camera) that should detect and write on your hard drive.  Tested all normal, highest, lowest sensitivities, day and night, alarm 30 seconds, 20, 10...50....60....moved torwards the camera, away, sidewise, brought a hot pan with me just in case it works on heat signature...nothing whatsoever....so my guess is that this particular model B1....made in china....no labels at all (no branding name like in the picture but nothing....no green connector on the back for hard wiring to a recording device....manual in poorly translated english that looks like a hack from a Wansview user guide....I think camera is just a generic camera with less features than advertised.As I mentioned, with no motion alert sensor it will not work as a security device...unless you plan to have it in front of you in your screen all the time.  I am kind of perplexed with other reviews that claim email alert capabilities, etc...must have been another lot with another sourced cameras, not this one for sure.When I read the reviews I thought, nice, if I am away from home or at work, the system will detect movement in the house and alert me and if it is an intruder (picture or video) I can call the police immediately.  Not having this....waste of money so I am returning them all...got three and they are all the same so it can't be just a troubled item.BTW, in the typed in microsoft word manual it only tells you to go get updated drivers in the wansview home page....no customer call numbers...nothing.  Go to the wansview page and you will not find this camera.Hope this review helps you find the camera you will like...I will try another brand to see what I find or go to Best Buy if I am not lazy.
