This is the third monitor I have bought, and I can finally say I am finished with my monitor search. I originally thought I would not buy a baby monitor with video, but once we moved my daughter into her own room... I wanted the video. :-)We tried the Drop Cam, which was very easy to set up, and had a wifi connection. Unfortunately the delay on the feed could be up to a minute or more. Plus there was only two way sound which meant when you hear your baby she/he hears you too...So after a ton of research, I decided to go up in price and get the Motorla MBP36. We are so happy with this monitor.Here is the overview:The camera - Has clear a picture and the monitor is a perfect size. One thing I like is you can turn the camera portion on and off on the monitor, which is good for sleeping. The camera has a day mode, which is color and a night vision mode. The night vision mode is great! I can see clearly enough to watch my daughter breath, and I can hear her breathe too. Which brings me to the sound features.Sound Features: You can set the volume on the sound to whatever level you like, and I can hear everything that is happening in and around my daughters room (I love that I can hear my daughter breathe), so the mic is powerful & picks up a lot! Also - you can press a button to talk through the monitor and soothe you little one as well. There are a bunch of lullabies, which we never use but they are there and you can trigger them to play from the monitor.Pan/Tilt: We love that we can remotely operate the camera to focus in on wherever my daughter is in her crib. I love this feature and see it being very useful as my daughter becomes a toddler and is playing in her room. Totally worth the extra $50The monitor in general is very easy to use and to control everything. It displays the temperature in my daughter's room, which I love. Some other reviews said it would be nice if it had a clock and I agree with that.Overall the monitor is awesome and we are so happy we got it!
