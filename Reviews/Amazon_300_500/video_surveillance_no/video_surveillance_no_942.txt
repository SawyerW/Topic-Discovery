Got this since March of this yr(13') b4 I mounted the cameras I hooked all of them up in my back rm on the floor, to make sure everything was working. Only thing that was weird,  was that 4 of the 8 cameras, in the same room and same light, were flick off/on and go black/white. I would only get the color back if I faced them directly at the window(more light) Wasn't sure if that was a problem or not so I contacted Q-see.  They said the cameras are OK, but I could send them back if I wanted. Seem to much at the time for the shipping back/forth and all that, So I decided to install them. At 1st they all worked great, but after a few months, I started noticing the Dvr would show continuous recording and I wouldn't get any trigger e-mails from some of the cameras, when motion was detected.  No after having the system for 9mths, I'm starting to have more issues, with 3 of the 8 cameras, doing the same thing. I have to reboot the systems every 2 days to stop the cameras from continuous. It seems like from 5:30p to 7am next morning the 3 cameras would lock in record mode, without detecting motion, then when the sun comes up around 7am, they would stop, and work normal until around 5:30pm. Any1 else have the same issues? We been back an forth with q-see, but it seems they only work M-F, and chat only on weekends. Hoping to get those cameras replaced at least b4 the yr is up.However, other than those issues, the system is cool. The different ways you can set up/snap shots sent to your phone/email or some1 just walking their dog is pretty amazing. When everything works that is!!!!. I would recommend this to any1, just make sure and check out the cameras b4, and if U any issues, send them back.
