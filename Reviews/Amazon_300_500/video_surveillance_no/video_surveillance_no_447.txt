About 2 weeks ago I received my spy pen, then went to a local store and got a 16gb micro card.  All ready to get things going I dove into getting this camera cranked up... but the instructions didn't deliver what I had hoped for.  Taking pictures was fine, but getting the video figured out took a little work as my interpretation of what was written just didn't produce results for recording.  So, I contacted the seller and they were quick to respond to my inquiry and assist, which was very nice.Hopefully they will redo the instructions soon, or post improved directions online with a link in one of their follow up "tips" emails that they send after purchase.For those that get the same instructions I got, here is what I found was needed to get the pen to take pics and record:Once the unit is on in Camera mode:To take picture, press top button once quickly, then release (as the instructions say)To shut off, press until 3 green blinks followed by red blink, then release (likewise, as instructions say)To record in video (when on and in camera mode), press top button until you see the first green blink, release button immediately (green light will continue to blink for total of 3 times, but there will be NO red blink), light just goes dark, but video is now recording. (Instructions indicate the light will blink slowly while recording, but my light didn't blink at all)To shut off video, press top button until you see a green blink followed by a red blinkIf the instructions had been better written and saved a little aggravation I would have given this a 5 star rating since I love using this little rascal.  So handy to be able to carry around a video camera in your pocket totally discreetly and with such a light weight.  You never know when you might want to document something on a casual basis.  Oh, and the quality of the pics and video is pretty good as long as you have reasonable lighting and don't move around too much, just as with any camera.  Great product.
