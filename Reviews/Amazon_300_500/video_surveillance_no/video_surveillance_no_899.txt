Greetings fellow amazonians its been really slow out here at the carnival in eureka, nv this week so I have been upgrading my trailer with some recent purchases. I decided to set this up after my last security system had been destroyed by mongo running it over with his rascal. I felt that in a town like eureka with about 20 people here I wouldn't need it, but who knows where I will be next week and then it might be too late. Anyhoo installation was successful and easy. I couldn't wait to try it out and through out the day I sat and watched; swiching cameras and seeing people come and go. Then as night fell I noticed something peculiar. There was someone dancing in what appeared to be a horsehead and loin cloth around my trailer. He started on camera two then moved to three, back to two and finally stopped at one. There he stood staring into my camera with his dead horse head eyes. It creaped me out I had to get away from the screen. I tried looking outside but it was too dark to see and mongo and eugene went into town to celebrate the annoucement of a new star wars movie. I went back to the tv screen and the horse head man was gone from camera one. I started flipping through the cameras and he was on camera four so close to it that all you could make out was one giant eye! I started freaking out how was I going to get out of here; I quickly called the police. As soon as they heard I was from the carnival and that a man with a horse head was stalking me they just laughed and hung up the phone on me. right now I am hiding under the bed and I can hear the horse head man walking on top of my trailer. If I make it out of here alive I will let you know....
