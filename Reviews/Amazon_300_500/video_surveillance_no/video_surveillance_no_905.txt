I bought this camera after reading a bunch of the reviews, and I'm glad I did - the camera works almost exactly like I need it to - as a remote security camera.I have it hooked up at my "summer cottage".  It is configured to send me photos embedded within an email whenever it detects "motion", and it does a fine job at that.  It is connected through my wireless router over 802.11g (WPA-PSK/AES)... and that all works reliably.It is easy to get it to work remotely (over the internet) if you know the basics of topics like DDNS and TCP port forwarding through your home router.  If you don't understand these concepts, you might struggle a bit as many here seem to have done.  But the short of it is that yes, it can be driven over the internet, and it works fairly well - but the devil is in the details - or, should I say, in your home network configuration.The web user interface isn't very pretty, but it is functional and reliable... and with only a few grammar errors :-)  Like a lot of low-end devices, the software isn't easy to use, but one can easily figure it out with some knowledge and experimentation.The camera is 640x480 - which is completely adequate for my use, but it is far from being as good as your 2001-vintage digital camera.  The colors are particularly lousy, so don't expect too much.  The IR lamps really light up a room in the dark - they are quite capable.I can't get audio to work at all, but since that isn't my goal I haven't tried very hard.- Four stars for being a decent home security cam: good mechanicals, price, and reliability.- One star lost for mediocre software and my inability to get audio working.- Hopefully a software update will allow it to gain a full five stars!
