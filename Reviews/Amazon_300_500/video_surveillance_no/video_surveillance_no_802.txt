We've had this monitor just over 3 months and have not had the first problem with it. Overall, I love it and needs only a few minor improvements to make it perfect!PROS:- The picture is great - very clear, even with the night vision. There does not seem to be any delay. It needs a good bit of light to pick up color very well, but that's not a priority for me.- Great range and reception - We live in a 3000 sq ft, 2 level home and the nursery is the furthest room from our family room, where we spend most of our time. We've never had even a minor issue with reception. Additionally, we have a wireless router, wireless printers, cell phones, and other mobile devices (iPad, Nook, etc) and there's never been any interference between any of them and the monitor.- Crystal clear sound - I can hear it clearly every time he sighs or rolls over, even on the lower volume settings. Additionally, the lights along the top of the monitor that show sound are very responsive. You can talk to the baby using the monitor and it also sounds surprisingly clear. (Although my husband and I use it more to talk to each other than to talk to the baby!)- Good battery life - If I remember to turn it off between naps, it can stay unplugged all day. I'd estimate battery life (without the screen being on constantly - just periodically to check in) to be around 4-6 hours.- Although expensive, I think it's the best value when looking at video monitorsCONS:- I really, really wish this monitor had a mute function or that the volume settings went a little lower - Hearing every little sigh and grunt can be a little disruptive to my sleep! :)- Having a time display on the monitor would be nice- The lullabies are a bit worthless as they are rather irritating -- in my opinion at least.If 4.5 stars were an option, that what I'd give this monitor, so I just rounded up to 5 because I would definitely buy it again and would recommend it without reservation to any of my friends.
