If you are looking for an all-in-one-package instant security system, this is a good way to go. It comes with 8 cameras and a DVR. Q-See makes it very easy to setup with a quick setup guide and a "wizard" program on the DVR. All I had to do was hookup the DVR to a standard computer monitor and I was in business. The cameras come with very long cords that connect to the DVR and to a power source (one source for each 4 cameras), so the main effort isn't getting the system up and running, but rather the more thoughtful job of figuring out where to physically put each camera and its cord. These cameras are impressive, providing good images even without much light. They automatically switch to their own infrared light source when there's not enough external light. They are weatherproof and the infrared feature means you can use them night and day even outside.The DVR comes with a mouse, and an on-screen keyboard appears whenever you need it to fill in data on the screen. A mouse click takes you from viewing all cameras images at once to selected images. The DVR is very quiet. I did not notice a hum from the hard-drive, but my son could hear one with his young ears.You could stop there and have a good system, but this one also allows you to hookup the DVR via ethernet to your network router. If you do this, you can access the images from other devices on the network, or even away from your home or business. The DVR connects best if your router is "plug and play" or UPnP compatible, but if not, there's a quick start guide for updating your router to open the port number that the DVR uses. All the instructions are in native English (versus poor translations) and very straight-forward.As long as you can deal with corded cameras, this is an excellent system.
