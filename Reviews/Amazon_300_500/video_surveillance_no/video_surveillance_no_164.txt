I am not going to go into all the features in detail, other reviewers have done this.  I am going to say that I absolutely love this camera.  We bought two, the master and one of the add-ons.  I can access it via an app on my phone, I can access it through my browser on my computer, I can access the live feed from my ipad.  We have it set up to save the footage on my computer which I can view at a later time.It is, simply, AWESOME.  The quality is fantastic considering the price, size, and set up.  If kids are in my yard I can easily tell who is who.  If people are moving fast however, you don't get real solid tracking but anything I've wanted to capture (kids goofing around) was clear.We've had this set up for about a month now and I am completely pleased with it.  We caught video of two of the neighbor kids throwing things at the garage.  I had video of the older kids being bullies to my youngest child when I had stepped in the house for a few minutes.  We were able to see the two people that ding-dong-ditched the house at 11pm.  The night vision is decent but you probably won't identify anyone that way, especially if they are moving quickly.  However I love being able to find out 'what was that' because when I'm not looking, it is.I seriously get an absolute kick out of reviewing the footage to pin point certain events.  When did the garbage can get moved?  When did someone throw something on the driveway?  How often are people speeding down my street?  We're down the street from a middle school and we have not only massive street traffic from that, but absolutely tons of foot traffic I want to be able to see.  It's done everything I wanted a security camera for.
