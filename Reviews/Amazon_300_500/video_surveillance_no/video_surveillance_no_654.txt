Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  As others have stated, it is not as turnkey of a setup process as plugging in a mouse or keyboard to your computer.  You're going to have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work under the hood with the camera and probably your home router/gateway.  However, it's clear to me that the manufacturer is listening to feedback because there were tools bundled on the installation CD that auto detected the camera for both Mac and PC systems.  They also bundled other thoughtful programs such as smartphone apps for iPhone and Android.  That said, I have an Android and was happier with some of the third party options (I like TinyCam Monitor [...]).Once you get it set up, which I would say is a 'medium' level of difficulty (don't buy this as a Christmas gift for your Grandma and mail it to her to figure it out), the camera is VERY feature rich for the price.  The camera has an onboard server/camera control system that allows you to move the camera (up/down, left/right), adjust contrast/brightness, set motion alarms, configure email/ftp photo notifications, listen to audio, talk through the camera, and more.  These functions also work through third party apps like the one I mentioned above.Picture quality is excellent both in daytime and nighttime (IR) modes and both the resolution and framerate can be adjusted to balance quality with the bandwidth available in your network.This camera is an excellent value for the price and I would highly recommend it as long as you're comfortable with a little bit of set up.  It is not 'plug and play' but is not impossible to set up either.  I can view mine from inside my house or anywhere in the world.  I think that's pretty cool.
