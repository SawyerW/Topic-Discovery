I'm letting my daughter use this to watch her cat. I did something wrong in parenting my daughters because they both turned out to be 26-year-old cat ladies. All they do is talk about their cats and tell me stupid and uninteresting cat stories. Now one of my daughters is using this unit to watch and listen for her cat when it's in the backyard. Normally you wouldn't get any stories about cats while they are outside and you are inside. Not with this unit. She can see the cat, listen to the cat (even in the dark) and tell me more cute things her cat does I don't give a crap about. Thank God she hasn't realized that she can take pictures with this thing. If she does, she will start sending those to me, too. At that moment I predict this unit will have a "malfunction" and no longer be able to take cat pictures.If this thing works on cats, it should work just fine for babies or old people with dementia. I'm OK with baby and old people stories. Those are cute. But cats are cats. When one gets sick you can put it to sleep and get another one for free. You can't do that with people (unless you're in Denmark or something). My daughter even talks to her cat through this thing. Good God, where did I go wrong? The cat looks around for her and she thinks that's cute and then calls me to tell me that. That's not what cell phones are for. Cell phones are for things like, "Mom just burned herself making a Vodka drink. I'm taking her to the hospital, again." Cell phones are not for telling that your cat looked at the camera unit she you said, "Hey Grover!" I was in an important meeting when you called to tell me about your cat. I only answered because there might have been a chance your mother was on fire, again. So, in conclusion, this unit works for cats and most likely babies and probably old people with dementia.
