I bought this camera to put in a bluebird nest box about 90 feet from my house. I spent a lot of time comparing specifications of similar cameras and found all the descriptions lacking in the detail I wanted. In the end I decided to take a chance on this one and it worked out good.I specifically wanted a camera that was color, had sound built-in, and had LED lights for viewing the nest under low lighting conditions, and had a good picture. What I learned:1) Picture. The 380 line resolution is as good as an old analog TV. It would be nice to have a higher resolution but this one works okay. I get some diagonal line distortion in the picture that I don't like but can live with it.2) Lights. Some mini cameras have LED lights but this one didn't. It looks like it does but no, just black plastic inserts. And I wanted to find out how much heat LED lights would put out and if they were on all the time but there was no information anywhere. I even found the LYD website but their information was even worse. I think the LYD CM203CA has lights but it wasn't clear if it also sound and color. Other reviewers said their .....208CA had lights but mine didn't.3) Focusing. I wanted more information on focusing but again it was lacking. By twisting the lens right or left this camera can be focused, and it focuses good as close as 2 inches, a good thing.4) Sound. The cable I am using to connect to the TV is 100', and I get a medium grade hum. I haven't experimented with eliminating the hum yet by trying another cable or routing the present on around an electrical outlet. I just turn the sound down as it is not good. When the bluebird eggs hatch I will be able to tell more about the sound.Buying this camera was a low cost experiment (camera + cable = less than $34) and it has worked out okay. I will look to improve some of the features mentioned above with other cameras, but I am enjoying the nest box camera now that I have it focused properly.
