The "Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera" is a feature rich wireless network camera that was surprisingly easy to setup for both in home viewing and Internet access. I was slightly concerned after reading the detailed steps in K. Lam's excellent review (currently the top review for this product) but now think that it must be dated since the included software took care of all the steps, including setting up the Internet access and free viewnetcam account.The box includes the camera, power supply, various mounting hardware, a security cable, documentation and quick start guides, and installation CD.The initial configuration of the camera requires it to be connected to your router with an Ethernet cable (not included) so it can be discovered by the installation software. Setup is very easy once the camera is discovered, but you must know your wireless SSID and security settings if you are going to use this in the wireless mode (also remember to set the switch on the bottom when finished).Once the basic setup is complete, the setup for remote Internet viewing next. The scary part of K. Lam's walk-through was not needed as the camera software took care of the port forwarding by talking directly to the router and then connected me to the viewnetcam website for registration. Once that was complete, I had my own easy to remember URL for viewing and controlling my camera. Total setup time was about 30 minutes and no calls to the tech support line were required.You connect to the camera via your standard browser (IE 7, Safari, and Firefox worked fine) so no proprietary software is required. The interface allows you to Pan and Tilt the camera and change most of the options by selecting the tabs along the top. It is a fairly intuitive interface and is easy to navigate for even those who do not posses an IT degree.A quick tip, the display resolution defaults to 320x240, which shows a fairly small image in the browser window, this can be changed to 640x480 in the drop down window to show a much large image.Overall, I am very pleased the image quality, ease of setup, and ability to remote view and control the camera.Highly Recommended!CFH
