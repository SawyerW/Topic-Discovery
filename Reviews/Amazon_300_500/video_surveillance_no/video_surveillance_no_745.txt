If you're looking for a product to monitor your baby at night and not actually be able to hear any of the cries over a loud beeping sound than this is the monitor for you. My wife and I say it's the sound of our son transmitting information to the mothership. It's a steady beep beep beep, pretty rapidly all the time, you can hear it on the lowest setting... at this point even when I am not home and around the monitor all I hear is the beeping sound!  If you try to turn it up to hear what he's doing all the lights go red and you hear nothing but beeping.The monitor was great to begin with, but as time passed this faint beeping sound got louder and louder, not only 4 months later the monitor is almost unsuable! that's an expensive product to use for 4 months and not leaves us without an easy way to check on the babyAt this point we don't have so much time to be able to spend endless time on the phone with motorola in hopes that they will eventually replace it and in the meantime leave us with nothing.If that was the only problem I would say this is still an awesome product because it seems like we are one of the few to have this problem, but NO on top of that the stupid battery lasts less than a day, and that's only using it for naps, and the start of the night... somehow every night without fail it begins its very loud low battery beeping... then again during the day we have to charge it. Forget leaving this thing with your neighbors unless you bring them the charge cord... it's gotten to the point now where we just have to always leave it somewhere plugged in, and hear a constant beeping that sounds like the emergency broadcast system.UPDATE:  eventually the sounds quit entirely... then a few weeks later the video has gone out too.. this is just crazy for this expensive of a product to fall apart like this.... buy a different one.
