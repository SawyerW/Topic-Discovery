The specs on this camera looked quite good. One of the things I really liked was the built in thermometer that displays the room temperature along with the time and date (if selected) on a small banner on the image. I ended up returning the camera because of setup issues and nearly non-existent support. After waiting on hold for nearly an hour I was number 18 (I started at 32) in the queue and the automated attendant said my wait would be over an hour.I gave the camera a 3 star rating because it does have some cool features and others may not mind the short comings that I had issue with.Pros:720 HD videoSensitive mic for audioBuilt in thermometerIR cut filter (better night performance)On-board storage VIA microSD cardCons:No tech support unless you register the camera providing all personal information.Tech support has very long wait times.Set up seems to require you to use Lorex's cloud video server, (privacy issues?) I was able to access the cameras setup menu using a browser but never could get to view video in the browser. I also read that Internet Explorer is required because of the need for Active X. No FireFox, Safari, Chrome, etc. I was able to view the cameras video using the provided, proprietary L-View software.The IR illuminator is not very bright so distance is limited at night.The lens is not very wide angle (this could be good or bad depending on your needs).I have two other IP cameras that I use (different brands) and haven't had nearly the set up trouble I had with this one. I fully admit that the set up issues are likely due to my preference to not use the Cloud and not use Internet Explorer. I prefer to keep my camera's video on my local network not streaming around the internet. Maybe there's a way to do that but I couldn't get through to Tech support to ask the question.
