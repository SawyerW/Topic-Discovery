This is a great little IP Camera.It sets up so easy. I set this one up with just my IPhone 5s.Lorex has a great video online explaining how to set up this camera.The software that comes with this camera is also great. it supports 16 cameras as opposed to the old software that supported 4.You can record directly to the camera itself with a micro SD card. Or to the iPhone or to a computer that is hooked up to your network. This is what I do. I record to me PC. Then I have a upload stream to a cloud server just incase someone breaks in and smashes my computer.The motion detection feature is amazing. Best I have seen in these types of camera. I can set it to send images to my email address. and the sensitivity settings can be adjusted to low or high sensitivity.I used this camera once to try to capture a mouse that was in my garage. I set up a mouse trap and this camera and the motion sensor went off and the camera emailed me the image of the mouse being killed, it was great. The garage was in total darkness but the image and video were crystal clear and bright.Some tricks for set up.If you are having trouble having the camera stay connected to your Wi-Fi you have to log in to your router and changethe wireless settings for channel width to auto 20 or 40 Mhz. If you have it set to 20 Mhz it will just keep connecting and then disconnecting repeatedly.Also when setting up camera try to keep it level or even (not pointing down or up) Because at night in total darkness the infrared will be at an angle and not illuminate the entire seen. If its even then the entire area is bright and clear.
