The video quality is very good, clear and crisp.Set up is a breeze, easier than 3 other WIFI cameras I own.The design is near perfect.Now the flaws- You cannot use the motion detection unless you want hundreds of false alerts a day. It will detect minimal shadow casts through windows. Mine seemingly sends alerts without any movement of anything, light included. I had to turn this feature off because I would get constant alerts, you can't trust it. I have a Piper as well and it has a much better motion detector, the downside to the Piper camera is that the lens is infrared so it cannot detect motion through windows. So if you want to point it outside it will not detect motion, even if you wave your hands directly into the camera. I thought Dropcam would cure this deficit but it fails for the opposite reason, it's too damn sensitive! I have read many reviews and forums and its a constant complaint, but I do not see the Dropcam heads responding to this concern. It's a major flaw for those looking for a security camera. Do not buy this if you need motion detection alerts.The fee for cloud service sucks, I don't know who would pay for for 24 hour cloud service. If I wanted to spend that kind of money I would just hire ADP to fit my house with their over priced service. In a world where we as consumers are getting nickel and dimed for everything, the last thing I want to sign up for is more cloud service, at least not at those prices.One of these companies has to get this niche market right, Dropcam came close but falls short like the others. Piper comes close as well, but the video quality is not as good as Dropcam. These are the top 2 WIFI cams, a few tweaks here and there and one of them could be top dog.
