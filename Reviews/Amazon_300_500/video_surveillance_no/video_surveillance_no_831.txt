First child is on the way and we needed a baby monitor for the home - the Mrs. gave me the task of picking one out, and based on the specs, this one seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.Set-up was super easy - you just plug in the camera and the base charger, and the two instantly find each other. Picture quality seems good, I like the temperature display, and the ability to hear what's going on in the room with the camera.Now for my one gripe: I chose this particular camera in large parts because of the Skype integration. Our entire extended family lives at least 8 hours from us, so I really, really wanted a way for them to be able to log in and see the baby whenever they felt like it. After getting the camera all positioned, I went to set-up the Skype part on the computer. You plug the monitor portion into your computer via the included USB cable, create a new account, tweak a few settings, and viola! your camera is now broadcasting to Skype. BUT - it will only do that when the monitor is synced to your computer via the USB cable. As soon as you unplug it, the connection is lost and you can only see the video on the monitor.I was pretty bummed out when I realized this, to be honest. Yes, if grandma calls and says she wants to see the baby, I can easily hook the monitor back up to the USB cable, but that's not what I was looking for. And forget about the new Dad being able to just take a quick peek at his sleeping baby when he's back at work.I'm going to keep the camera for now, because I like everything else about it. But if I do find one that has all these features, plus real Skype integration, this one is going back.
