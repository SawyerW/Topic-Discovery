We ordered this after our last Q-See DVR stopped working after 6 years.At first, we had a lot of trouble figuring out exactly how it works lol. We are computer savvy here, but this thing took a lot of trial and error to figure out what everything does. Also, we had a bit of difficulty setting up the LAN to it. That might have just been us though.Overall though, this DVR is great! I absolutely love how easy it is now to review the playback. In fact it's actually kind of fun. Only recording when movement is sensed makes it SO much easier to review your video footage. Our old DVR didn't have anything like that, and reviewing footage on that last one was a nightmare. This one is superb.The video quality with HDMI is great too. We use it at the lowest available HDMI resolution and with our decent Sony camera's, the picture looks great. In fact, we had an event last summer where vandals destroyed over 90 mailboxes in our area, and our footage ended up on CBS and ABC. The camera guys for those networks couldn't believe how great our cameras looked. Here's a link to that video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzkPAJmRJ9AChecking out our cameras on our iPhones and Ipods is easy and quick, about 5 seconds from when you open the app on your phone or tablet.Also, I am amazed at how far back you can go with this DVR. We installed a 500 GB hard drive and we can seriously look over camera footage from early November and it hasn't wiped itself yet.All in all we are extremely happy with this DVR. We aren't professionals with this kind of thing, just a family that has had a series of events over the years that made us want to have surveillance... and this works great for that.
