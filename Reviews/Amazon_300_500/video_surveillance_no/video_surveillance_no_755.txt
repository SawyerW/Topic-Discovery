I am a child Care professional and operate a Family Child Care Home... I am very very pleased with this product. The picture is clear, and it has saved a lot of wear and tear on my knees. I bought 2 additional cameras and I can observe the children in different rooms. This is invaluable at nap time but I find it an asset when I need to do observations for periodic assessments.The set up is easy. I am not an Electronic wizard nor do I like any type of lengthy instruction manuals this was super easy to set up and you can use right away. The monitor has a high quality viewing screen even in dimly lit or dark rooms.At night I use it to watch my elderly dog. He has been needing more frequent "potty trips" And I can hear him as soon as he starts pacing the floor. As other reviews have stated a battery operated camera would be nice but if it takes away from quality of a picture then I can live with the plug in camera. I can hear clearly although when I use the speaker to talk my husband says it isn't clear. (I just think - he does not wait until I am done and it cancels out my voice -- like on a walkie talkie or cell phone. I have not had this long enough to evaluate the battery on the monitor. I will try and update this when I have had it awhile. It does an outstanding job!  I might have given it 4 stars because the music isn't very soothing - it is a little too music box type and not exactly calming music. But I am really IMPRESSED by this monitor so as far as the music feature - I just don't use it.
