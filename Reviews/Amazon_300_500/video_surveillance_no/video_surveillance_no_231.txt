It recently received my Logitech 750E along with the indoor camera.  Overall, I am very impressed and only have a few minor qualms.I will start with the video quality which is REALLY impressive.  My son noted that convenience stores should use this system as the video is far clearer then what you see on television when some thug stages a hold up.  I was not expecting much in night vision mode but even that works very well.Setup is is mostly quick and easy.  A software update was needed but that took place automatically.  The PC side of the software is very intuitive.  As someone else noted, the biggest deficiency seems to be the limited ability to schedule when alerts are sent (or more importantly, not sent).  One important note about installation is that while the systems is billed as wireless, you still need to run power to the cameras.  This means you need to have an outlet nearby.  This proved a problem for me given where I wanted to mount the outdoor camera.  I will eventually relocate it but it means I will have to run some cable (and also purchase additional cable beyond what is provided).  Not a huge deal, but something buyers should be aware of.One of the ultra cool features of this system is the available Android app.  This lets you view live or recorded video and it too works really well.I certainly wish I had this system a few years ago when some Landscape Rustlers made off with some newly planted bushes from right in front of my house.  The video evidence this would have provided, would have let me bring those varmints before a hanging judge!Bottom line is that this is a high quality product that is easy to install and exceeds expectations.  A few shortcomings with the software which will hopefully be addressed in future updates.
