This camera has been operating several months on two AA batteries.  I have it pointing at a door so the PIR sensor only activates the camera when someone comes in or out of the house.  It takes low light pictures but it does need light.  It is not infrared.  This is not a problem for me because I can leave a light on a dimmer for it to take pictures with.  This is an excellent backup to a more full security system.  If the security system loses power or lines get cut, this still will be taking pictures.  The pictures are clear and they are time-stamped.  The only thing that would make it better is some sort of wireless connectivity to view pictures from time to time.  But this would be a different product.  I am pleased with this purchase.After using this camera for some time I have a few area it can be improved.  1.  When changing the batteries it loses the time stamp and you need to enter it in again.  This is a simple thing to fix.  A 10uf capacitor will hold a charge for a minute or two while batteries are changed.  2.  It needs an indication ON THE FRONT of the device that the batteries are low.  Too many times the batteries ran out and I did not know. 3.  The thing stops working when the batteries are at 1.3V or so.  If you look at the energy profile of a battery there is still 90% of the energy if you run the battery to 0.5V.  This is a simple thing to do with a little boost converter chip.  4. The USB port is not recognized by my Windows PC.  I need to remove the SD card and put that into my computer to read the photos.  5.  The thing has an AC adapter input but no info on what to put there to use it.
