After having the front bumper stolen off my car (who does that?), and learning my old Samsung DVR froze up, I decided I needed an upgrade.I should have done this sooner.  Setup is a snap, the DVR includes a mouse and the User Interface is easy to navigate.  Wireless Monitoring setup has a few different options, just take your time and follow the instructions.  I love being away from home and being able to check the cameras around my house.  The motion detection system is designated via a grid of 15x 15 (IIRC) squares that you can select to indicate motion detection area.  This way, you can leave something like a sidewalk or street out of motion detection.  You can also adjust sensitivity between a level of 1 - 10.  Motion detection works decently in low life, but I would recommend cameras that handle your night vision needs to accompany this DVR.I setup a free e-mail address with Outlook.com strictly for the motion detection e-mail notifications, and because the Outlook Android app supports "Push" notification.  Within 15 seconds of motion detection, my phone beeps at me and notifies me of a motion detection message.  The snapshot that the system takes is in attachment form, but it's usually less that 10kb, so it downloads very quickly.The Q-See android app works well.  You log in to your router's public IP with the specific port you designate.  You save your login information so there's no need to enter passwords over and over.  There is only a 1 - 2 second delay in the live video feed over Verizon's 4G network.You can also view live feed from any computer with an ActiveX compatible browser.I used a 4-port Network Extender from Netgear to create an access point for where I installed the DVR.  This way, you don't need to install the DVR next to your modem or router if the location isn't best for you.Sure, I probably went a little overboard here, but I tell you--I sleep a lot better at night.
