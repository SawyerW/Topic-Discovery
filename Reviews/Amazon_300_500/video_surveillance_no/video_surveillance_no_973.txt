I like the form factor of the LorexBaby WL 3520. Landscape mode displays a wider coverage which is what I need to see more of  what the kids are doing in the room.  Unlike those low profile spherical cameras that sit on a base, this camera can be tilted at a much lower angle because it sits higher on a stick.  The kids sleep in mats on the floor so it was annoying that I needed to prop up the back of the old camera to tilt lower.I have no problem with the signal strength.  I live in a three-story townhouse with hardwood floors in between.  The camera is located at the basement and I have the parent unit monitor in the kitchen.  The resolution is good with a nice color contrast.  Night vision works OK even it is completely dark.I love the soothing sound effects.  You can choose waves, rainforest, rains, etc., and you can control the volume and selection from the parent unit.  No musical lullabye though.  You can snap pictures and record videos but you would need to buy a microSD card separately.Battery on the parent unit is a 3.7V, 1600mAh 504068.  Baby unit need to be always plugged to run.  Temperature is accurate 1to 2 degress plus or minus.  It can be set C or F.Pros:- expandable to 4 cameras- large 3.5 inch color screen- powerful battery that can last for hours- two-way communication- portabilityCons:- intercom is very difficult to understand on both ends.  You'll hear your kid making all kinds of noises but once you start to attemp real communiction, it is a struggle.- no inluded microSD card. Not even a built-in memory to shoot even a sample pic.- when the sound effects are playing, the sound can also be heard on the parent unit which drowns out the sound of your baby's breathing.- joystick is a bit annoying for navigating the menu
