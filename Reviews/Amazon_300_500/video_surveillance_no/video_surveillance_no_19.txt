I was looking for a better way to mount my camera in my vehicle besides a tri-pod on the floorboard and duct tape holding the stem of the tri-pod to the dashboard.At first, I was going to try a Chase Cam windshield mount costing twice as much, but decided to give the Panavise 809 a try after finding it here on Amazon. At first the camera (a Panasonic PVGS80) wouldn't work with the mount due to the arm on the mount being too short unless I wanted to mount the camera upside down. I did as others suggested here and called Panavise's 1-800 number and explained the situation. They were very friendly and helpful and after verifying that I had the genuine product, - understandable seeing as reviews here indicated that there are some knock-offs out there - they sent me an extension that works with the mount and gives enough room for the camera to be clear of the windshield while filming. An added bonus is that all I have to do with sighting the camera now is to point the camera straight down the mounting arm to get a proper view straight ahead.The first footage I shot with the new assembly was incredible. Most of my videos made with the tri-pod system had some shaking and moving of the camera even inspite of the camera's image stabilization system. The first time using the Panavise 809, even while shooting the footage, I could tell that the camera was hardly moving and the resulting footage showed that the Panavise 809 kept the camera rock steady even during a hard acceleration that had the car going from 35MPH to 80MPH.In summary, if you are looking for a excellent windshield (or any other window) mount for a small video camera, give the Panavise 809 a look. My only suggestion would be that they just go ahead and include the extension with the mount.
