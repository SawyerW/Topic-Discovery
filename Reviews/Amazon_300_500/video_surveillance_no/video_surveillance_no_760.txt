The volume on our Summer baby monitor stopped working (most likely because it was dropped on the marble floor a few dozen times) and I just bought this unit as a replacement after reading the positive reviews.The quality of recording unit is great.  Video is clear in IR and Color.  It clearly does not look like what you see in the product sample photo, but it is in line with a $200 monitor video quality.  No complaints about the audio capture.  The camera does not make any noise when rotating and the IR lights don't shine red at night.  Bottom line is that the camera unit is what I expected from a unit of this price.However, I did find a few issues with the monitor device.  Perhaps I have noticed these because we switched from a Summer monitor that did not have these problems.  So here are my issues with the handheld monitor device:1. Let's say you want to zoom in (digit zoom only).  The only way to do this is to go in to the menu, click the right arrow about 5 times, change the setting to 2x and then get out of the menu.  Then you have to repeat the process again to go back to 1x.  In comparison, our Summer monitor had a tiny joystick which you could click to zoom in.2. The display button is poorly placed.  The display button will be the only button you press when the baby is sleeping since it turns on the LCD screen.  It is also a button that you will use the most.  The problem is that the button is tiny and located right above the microphone button.  So, when you are trying to click on display (especially at night), there is a high chance that the mic will be pressed.  This is really a non issue after a few days of use since you learn where the button is located, but I just think that it is a major design fail.  The Summer unit had a large display button on the top of the unit resembling an alarm clock snooze button.We are going to keep the unit because we are generally pleased with its performance and because I'm too lazy to drive to the UPS store.
