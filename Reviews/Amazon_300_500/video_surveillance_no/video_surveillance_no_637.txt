So after many days and hours researching a mid priced security system, I said I'll try it. I am not disappointed.  We needed a system first and foremost as nanny cams as well as some cameras for outside surveillance and deterrent. I received it and had my alarm company rep install it for me mainly due to the heat in the attic during summer in Florida. What can I say I'm honest. I watched as he finished the install in 4 hours the wiring and programming as well. He attempted to sell me a 4 camera system at double the price and he is a friend who informed me that was at cost. He was so pleased w the system that he is recommending it to customers to buy themselves and he will install. Now I will say that the camera quality is the weakest part of this system but they do a good job for my needs. My wife and I can log in either by computer or on smart phone and see how things are w our 4 month old daughter. If you need a reasonably priced system for security and observance this is a great one. The picture quality is good on computers and monitors but it does get a little worse if you try to enlarge the view.  The cameras outside provide a good picture as well. Lastly as I type this review on my I phone the playback w computers is only compatible w a pc not a Mac but the app for the phone to watch live is great an easy to install. The support for set up is great and very helpful. Just have your receipt handy to scan to them for proof of purchase and you will be good to go. I hope this review helps. I figured if I ever fear for my life I could always upgrade one or two cameras for a crystal clear picture but not needed thankfully :).
