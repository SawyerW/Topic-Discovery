For a long time I would turn on a television and several lamps when I went out to make the house appear more occupied than it was.  I don't like wasting energy but who wants to deal with a burglarized home?  I was skeptical but pleased to find the fake television device.I use the device on the second floor of my home and, from the outside, it looks like a real television is on inside.  The flashing colors are completely randomized and fade in and out and resemble the workings of a tv.  One of the negatives of the device is that if you had the device on a first floor, I believe it would be much easier to identify that it wasn't the real deal.  On the second floor, however, it is not possible for someone to analyze the shape of the fake tv (which is quite small -- see image gallery for a better idea of what I mean).Another potential negative for users is the thickness of your curtains. My curtains are thick and thick curtains will obstruct the light from the fake television.  You will either need to open the curtains partially or utilize curtains that are of a less dense material.Yet another consideration is that the fake tv requires an outlet to operate. You cannot place batteries in the unit.  If you are going away for an extended period and the electricity goes out, the device is not going to be operational.Despite the issues raised in this review, I do like this tool.  I like that it saves electricity and that it is easily portable. Initially, I was annoyed that I spent so much on something so small but it does seem to fulfill what it is made to do. It has three settings of operation so you can set it and forget it.  I would consider buying this for someone with an unrented property or vacant/vacation home.This product is made in Malaysia.
