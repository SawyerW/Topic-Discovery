I just got this product today and it is already awesome! All I had to do was plug in and wait til the handset was fully charged, then I turned on both camera and handset and it synced automatically by itself. Before receiving the monitor I was worried by some of the reviews. The quality is GREAT! I am not saying you can see every single particle but I can see everything that needs to be seen. Quality is great and the night vision works awesome! Every little noise made is heard loud and clear and also shows up with lights on the handset. From the handset you can turn on different lullabies. No you cannot turn the nighlight feature on from the monitor but for me there is no complaint there. You can adjust the picture on the monitor darker or lighter. Being able to charge both camera and handset is great, no constantly running through batteries. Also from reading other reviews people said there was a delay in video and it froze, I have no delay but of maybe half a second and the picture does not freeze. My baby will not sleep unless she is in someones arms or a deep sleep. I cannot leave her by herself so when I need to do homework I have to wait for someone to hold her. Tonight alone I have been able to do my homework and she has slept peacefully with me watching the whole time. This is the best monitor for me. If you do not require such things do not worry but for those who want to view and hear their child as well as they can without being in the room this is the monitor for you! Five stars all around! Truly for me is something I do not know how I have lived without for these past 5 weeks!
