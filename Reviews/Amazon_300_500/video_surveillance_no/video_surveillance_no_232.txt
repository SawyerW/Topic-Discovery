This is a great camera and system. The software that comes with it is lacking but will do what the average consumer requires. I have a server in may basement and wanted to be able to use it to control the cameras and store the video. There is no API for programmers to support the cameras and add features, which I think is the biggest downside. These could really have more of a following if they offered an API. I have had a few cases where the camera stopped working. Once it was from the cable going bad, another was due to an ice storm.  I warmed up the camera and it starting working again, I really think it was just the unplugging and replugging that did it. I did have a camera completely die on me and Logitech replaced it for me. It has worked well since.There are days the camera stays in night vision because it thinks it is night time. Might be the cloud cover or shadows that make to too dark.I have missed recording some important situations because I have setup motion zones that were not where the motion occurred. This was because I didn't want an alert for every car that drives by my house, but that meant the one car that does crash into the yard won't be caught either.So it is a balance of finding the settings that work best. Rain and snow cause me to wake up to hundreds of email alerts.Installing and running the cameras is easy, streaming on the Logitech site, on mobile, or at home is easy. Everything is easy, except for getting the settings exactly how you want them. The balance between security and too many alerts.I think that the command software forgets what files are videos and goes past the limits you set to the max amount of video that can be saved, but I can not confirm it. It happens sometimes and I don't know the cause. I have a 1 Terabyte drive so it doesn't matter too much for me,  but it seems strange.I put 8gb sd cards in each camera to be safe.
