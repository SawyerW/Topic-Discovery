This HooToo Camera Works Great. The set up was easy(For Me) This is my third networked camera and one 4 cam DVR system I've installed & configured via Wifi, or Ethernet, all with DNS and Android smartphone App working. I started out clueless and now I'm a Pro. The supplied CD and assorted software made the install and config of the camera much easier than earlier cameras and the DVR system. I also found very helpful the setup videos included on the CD. If I only had them with my first camera!! Thanks HooToo!! If your a first timer with some basic network knowledge, these videos should be a big help with your basic setup and operation. The camera operates as promised without trouble, all features work well. I have had a couple hiccups with Explorer 10 wanting to open the HooToo browser. What's New!! Firefox & Chrome work fine. The picture quality, color, and focus are good and acceptable. Night vision works well, I'm able to see the entire area 30'x30'. The audio also works well my dogs keep running around looking for me when I speak through the cam.I purchased this cam for the low price. I wanted to see what a $60 Plan/Tilt Cam delivered. It delivers all the same features and benefits of higher priced cams in it's class.Pros:PricePan/Tilt angles good, smooth operationEase of setup (included software) & Setup VideosEasy operation- integrates well with other brandsWireless operation or Wired installation (both work well)Good picture quality day or nightAcceptable audio qualityCons:Non-Stop Blinking Very Bright Light below lens (my fix a dab of black paint)This blinking light issue allows me to only give 4 starsUpdate 07-16-2012:The MFG. HooToo contacted me about my concern regarding my blinking light issue. They instructed me to open up the IE browser, go to "system" settings, then to "indicator settings" and switch off the light. Easy fix and Done! Thank You for taking the initiative to contact me with a quick easy fix. I wasn't expecting to hear from anyone. Company's that make Customer Service a Priority are # 1 in my book!! 4 stars changed to 5 Stars as my issue has been resolved.
