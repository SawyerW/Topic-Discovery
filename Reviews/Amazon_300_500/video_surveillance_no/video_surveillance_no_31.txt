The design of these headsets intends for the user to place the mic/ push-to-talk button down a sleeve and attach the clip for the acoustic earpiece directly behind the neck in order to conceal the hollow coil from front and side view as much as possible.In order to accomplish this, the wire from the acoustic earpiece has to be long enough to reach from center-neck to about four inches beyond the wrist. In this way, the user activates the PTT button using thumb and forefinger and speaks into the cupped palm.Here is the near miss aspect of these units: The length of the wire from the earpiece to the PTT switch/mic is 24 inches. Twenty-four inches is almost laughably short for those who have arms longer than twenty inches. I don't know anyone, outside of children, who might have arms that short.After plugging these in and running the wires, it immediately became a matter of finding some appropriate microphone wire to use to splice in a 15" section of wire to make these actually function as intended.Once that was done, the units were ready for use. Well, almost. The next thing that had to be done was to replace the little slippery plastic clothing clips with steel security-badge clips so the pieces would stay in place during actual use.Now we were ready. We found that the earpieces actually sounded better than the radio's speakers and the push-to-talk buttons were crisp and positive. The mic's have no wind shielding so users need to be advised that they need to speak across the mic instead of directly into them, and keep them a couple inches away from their mouths. Operated that way we obtained very good results.Too bad, for the want of a couple of dollars' worth of more wire and pro clips, these would be outstanding accessories. As they are now, they are somewhat of a starter kit waiting for final assembly.
