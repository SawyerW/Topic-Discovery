Let me just begin by saying that we couldn't be happier with this monitor.  With a family of 8 (4 of which are kitties :) it is safe to say that we are on a budget.  After reviewing for weeks all the different video monitor options out there, I was hesitant due to the price of the Lorex monitor but figured at least we spent the least we could if it's not what we are looking for.  The customer reviews for this monitor were better than any other that I'd looked into for what is important to us. I wasn't excited about it not being some sassy designed piece of equipment but everything else seemed to check out so I bought it.  Since having this monitor we have not had 1 single complaint or problem.  We live in a 3 level townhome and this monitor is exactly what we needed.  The range is not great outside of the home.  It works on the deck which is over our driveway but it starts to lose picture about 20 feet from the house which is about  40 feet or so and 3 levels up from the camera, a total of about 60 ft and 3 levels.  I wouldn't recommend this monitor if you own to large of a home, but for us it is perfect.  The picture is better than the summer brands I've seen my friends have and the nighttime vision keeps this "paranoid" mom at ease.  If I feel comfortable (one who still checks my 8 month old for breathing when she's asleep) then you know this picture is awesome.  SO... In a nutshell, if your looking for a no-nonsense quality monitor and don't care much for perfection elsewhere then this is definitely a monitor you won't regret investing in.  The talk-back feature is awesome and sounds real time.  We are now going to buy another camera for our family room.  I gave customer service a 1 because the reviews say the customer service is awful, but fortunately for us we haven't had to use them and we've had the monitor for about a month now.  Set up was also easy and painless and the initial charge took a lot less time than said.
