Overall, the product is decent for the price. The cameras have good quality during the day, but at night you can not see anything unless a light is nearby. The cameras do not have a wide view if that is what you need. The monitor that is shown in the picture does not come with the system. It is not listed in the included part, but does make it a little confusing. The cameras are not audio capable, but you can buy a camera with audio or a microphone and hook it up to the system.The instructions are not clear and have technical terms. I would describe the directions as a brief overview of how to set it up. I recommend calling the company to help assist you to set it up correctly.In order to hook this system up to your computer, you will need to buy two Ethernet cables. One from your router to your computer and one from the router to the DVR. For you to use the mobile app you will at least have the router connected to the DVR with the Ethernet cable. The mobile app is very easy to use, but again you should call the company to set it up.This surveillance system does include a hard drive, which you need to record any video/audio. You can not just use a flash drive to save data. The flash drive can only be used for a back up. The hard drive costs anywhere from $50 and up. Without a hard drive you can only view the cameras on your monitor.I don't know if I would buy another surveillance system from Zmodo because of how difficult it is to set up to the computer and mobile app. I am very good at setting up stuff for the computer and not illiterate in that area at all. I can normally figure it out myself, but I could not figure this system out at all! Other than that it is a pretty good system.
