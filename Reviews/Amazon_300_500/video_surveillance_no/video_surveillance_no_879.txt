This camera looks very well built and sturdy, so my hopes were high when I unpacked it. There are no printed instructions, only a PDF on a CD. That wouldn't be a big problem if what's in the PDF was useful and intelligible. The PDF also doesn't allow printing or copying. And you get things like:"This method does not use frequently, when you process machine write parameter or program shift, we suggest you to use the first connect network method to process the modification of machine parameter."The instructions tell you what should happen (if you can decipher them), but give no advice on what to do if things don't work as planned. All in all, not very useful at all.An even bigger problem is that I couldn't get it to stay connected for more than a few seconds at a time. This is using an Ethernet cable with no fancy functions enabled. I did get it to momentarily connect wireless, but that was a very short lived event. I've been trying for days now to just get back into the built in web interface. I've tried with Safari and Firefox on a Mac (OS 10.6) and IE and Firefox on a PC (Windows 7). It will randomly connect and then a few seconds or minutes later just disappear. It can then go hours until it somehow allows you to connect to it again. If I can't even get it to connect long enough to set up and check a few parameters with a wired connection, how can I trust it to stream video wirelessly for security purposes?It's sad because it seems there is a lot of potential with the product. The actual video wasn't bad for 640 x 480 resolution and the night vision worked quite well. As with so many products these days however, the weakness seems to be in the documentation and software.I'm an electronics engineer with over 30 years experience. Although I'm not a networking guru, I have designed a lot of computers with both IBM and Apple. It really shouldn't be this hard to get a product to work.
