Over the last few days I've tried using and placing in different areas the Izon camera. The camera is an incredible idea in theory, unfortunately it doesn't work the way I would hope. Whenever Night Vision turns on in the evening, the camera starts to record 30 second clips every 2 minutes. These clips are supposed to record whenever the camera senses movement. (Also these clips begin recording every two minutes with the sensitivity meter turned all the way down.) Unfortunately there is a limit of 25 videos per day, and since they are recording faithfully every two minutes, it fills up after an hour or so. Afterwards it takes screenshots every two minutes until dawn. This defeats the purpose of getting an alert that there is movement when I'm away from my home.I bought the camera in preparation of a vacation to watch my pets, but due to its inability to detect motion successfully, my quota of videos are taken up within the first hour of the 24 hours in a day. What's the point of having it?Considering that this was a "user error" I changed where the camera detects motion, the motion sensitivity, and I've place the camera in three different locations- no success. When I called tech support I was told to unplug it and plug it back in, then after a long silence, I got no further advice apart from an "I'm sorry" when it didn't work. (Great customer service, I'd say!) The problem seems software related since I noticed the Night Vision seems to refresh every couple minutes as well. Just to be sure I wasn't crazy I checked my wireless connectivity and I'm streaming top notch.Another problem I've had is that though notifications are turned on in the app, and in my iPhone's settings, I can only see notifications when I open up the app and check them manually. I wish this would work the way I had hoped, but unless a type of update to fix the problem I'm having comes out, I'll have to return the 100.00+ Product, along with its' mediocre customer service.
