I've ordered several of these kind of cameras before (Foscom clones) and once you've installed one you've done them all.  I like the controls, the activeX file installs perfectly on Windows 8, and typical settings found in others (FTP, alarm, etc).  What I found as a nice surprise is the ability to setup a local storage location (or network) that becomes a repository for captures images and videos.  The price makes it a potential 5 star product.HOWEVER, there is a really dangerous feature that is on by default.  The camera automatically ships with a DDNS entry connected to Kaicong's DDNS registration server.  This easily allows me to find the device by entering the URL listed on the camera, but also means that Kaicong is registering every camera to their DNS server when it leaves the factory in China.  Whenever I hear of stories of someone "hacking" these cameras in the news, this is exactly the reason this happens--there is a DDNS entry that leaves a hole in a home network and, therefore, exposed.  After gaining access to the configuration pages of your camera, the first thing done should be changing the password.  After doing this, clear all settings and set a port number of 1  (since it won't allow a blank number) to break the DDNS connection back to Kaicong's registration servers.Another concerning feature in relation to the DDNS entries is I was unable to change the primary DNS server IP address away from Google's default DNS server (8.8.8.8).With the instructions arriving in Mandarin Chinese, plus the above "feature" described, I can only recommend these cameras if you've had experience with setting them up before (instructions are useless), and are knowledgeable around configuring a SOHO network.  That being said, the price makes them a steal if you know what you're doing.EDIT::::I am returning these camera's as I discovered they are not supported by my Micasaverde.  Even after attempting to manually add them to my home network, an image isn't displayed.
