I read a few reviews that said everything worked after the cd setup program.  No way.  The setup program did setup the camera right away.  But, getting the internet viewing and email notification set up took a lot of time and research.  I am an IT professional, but I don't know very much about networks.  A neophyte has NO CHANCE of setting this up correctly.First, I had to figure our how to forward the ports (1024 and 5000) for a new router (ASUS RT-N56) I installed a few months ago (replacing a Linksys router).  It wasn't hard to figure out the IP address of the camera, but the setup program for the ASUS router had a drop down for the IP address in the port forwarding tab that didn't include the camera IP.  Finally figured our I could just type the IP address into the field (what a dummy).It wasn't too hard to figure out how to make the camera IP static.  Then, I got a stable IP address from [...]([...]) to solve the dynamic IP address assigned by Comcast.net.  Voila...my camera finally shows up on the internet (at last....).Then, it took another night to get the email notification to work. When I tested my setup (test email button), all i got a failure.  After much research, I discovered you had to enter the SMTP address of the outgoing mail server for Comcast (not Hotmail or my own mail server on my domain).  When I set the outgoing server to [...], sure enought the email worked, and so did the motion detector.I still need to get the camera to record to my NAS server, but after all the above how hard can that be???  We'll see.If you aren't comfortable dealing with your router setup (I almost switched back to my linksys router), you probably shouldn't even attempt to do this setup.  Pay someone else.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the camera.
