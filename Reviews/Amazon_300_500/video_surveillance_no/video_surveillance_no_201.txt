Having dealt with some supposedly easy-to-install electronics, I approached this system (which uses the household electrical wires for transmission) with a bit of skepticism. However, I have rarely been dissatisfied with a Logitech product so I gave it a whirl.Installation turned out to be relatively effortless. The connection of the cameras through plugs to the electrical system was painless, and the signal is strong to my Windows 7 PC which is located one floor above. This particular kit came with one interior and one exterior camera, both of which produce bright, clear images. When motion-activated (they are quite sensitive), they record activity on a local SD card in the camera. The images can later be loaded into an archive on the PC if you wish to take up that much disk space (the amount that can be assigned is adjustable). The night-vision of the exterior camera is quite good.One problem that arose shortly after setting the system up was that the exterior camera began dropping out. Sometimes it would re-establish contact with the system, and sometimes it had to be manually refound by the software. This wasn't usually a problem except that you had to check to see if the camera was on or not, and it could be off for hours before discovered. Later, a software upgrade seemed to reduce or eliminate this problem and the system has remained stable ever since.The system can be configured to send you an e-mail through its server every time it detects motion, but due to the sensitivity (the exterior camera reacts to passing cars that are in its peripheral vision), the annoyance of so much vigilance caused me to turn notifications off.I use the system to monitor activity on and near my front porch, and inside the front door. Additional cameras can be added, though they are a little pricey. Overall a good product.
