After months of researching and trials, we decided to settle on this baby monitor.  The image is by far the clearest and the camera unit pans and tilts to cover almost all corners of my son's room.  Also the camera pans and tilts without making any noise which is essential for our light-sleeper.  The battery charge is reasonable I guess - I can have it on for about 6 hours without video (audio only).The reasons for a 4 star rating are:- No clock!!!!!!!!  Seriously???  I think I read someone else's review about this but I agree.  It probably costs 50 cents to add a clock to this monitor.  I don't know why Motorola didn't think it was a good idea.  I didn't think it was a big deal at first, but once I started to use it, I realized it could be very annoying to have to look at the monitor then a clock (at 4:00 a.m. and without glasses).- No mute button.  Even when I have the volume at the lowest setting, it is still loud, loud enough to keep me up.- The monitor power on/off button is soooooo tiny.  For the reason stated above (having no mute button), I keep the monitor power off at night (I use my old audio monitor at night as a backup) but when my baby wakes up and cries, I cannot find the power button!- There is no volume control on the camera unit so if I want to play a lullaby, I have to first change the volume on my handheld unit.  It's too much trouble and the quality is not worth the hassle so I don't use it.- There is no temperature alert.  It monitors but it does not alert if it's too hot or too cold.Since our primary need is to monitor our son and to catch him when he does something cute in his crib, this is our choice of baby monitor.
