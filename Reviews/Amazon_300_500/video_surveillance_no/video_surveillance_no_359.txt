I purchased this camera to complete my home security system and to date it has performed very well. If you have some basic understanding of home networks setup is rather straightforward. I had the camera unboxed and installed in under 10 minutes. I am a Linux user so I cannot comment on the installation cd, but in my it my opinion it is not needed.  I read alot of comments on wireless issues but people must understand that wireless and throughput issues are largely a function of your router, not the camera. I have this coupled with an e4200 linksys router so disconnects and throughput issues are non-existent.Low light sensitivity is very good however the motion detector doesn't seem to work as well in low light conditions. Video quality is satisfactory but not excellent. However, I did not purchase this camera to watch my front door in 1080p.For those of you having difficulty setting up the motion detector email functionality use port 587 as your smtp port and you will have no issues.I cannot give the camera 5 stars as there is one severe issue with this product. Some important parameters for the motion detector require Active X to tweak them. This means you are required to use Internet Explorer only. For a Linux user like myself (or Chrome, Firefox users) this means when you want to change the motion detector sensitivity and you have to go hunting for a PC with Internet Explorer. Why these features could not have been coded into the firmware like the rest of the settings is beyond me. The days of Internet Explorer dominance are over, Linksys/Cisco really should offer support for other browsers. The power cord for the camera is also far too short making installation challenging, make sure you buy an extension cord with this product.Despite this one deficiency this is an excellent security camera, you will be happy with your purchase.
