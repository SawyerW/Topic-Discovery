The first thing I will say about this is the price; a bit high. I think it should be about 7 to 10 dollars lower but I think the company that bought this product really wanted to make a lot of money and who doesn't.I will post photos later on. There are 4 modes:Off -- Dusk + 4 hours -- Dusk + 7 hours -- ON all the time.I go for the latter option. When I choose any of the other modes, I notice that it is not consistent. I am sure someone will be bound to correct me on this. It would make more sense to have a random mode, such as the person is watching TV, goes to bed, gets up for a snack, watches a little TV, goes to bed. From the outside, I would think this person really needs to have a sleep study.The manufacturer even recommends plugging this into a timed outlet, such as the one I bought from (can't believe I'm plugging them . . . GE  . . . . blah!) but "GE 15154 Random On/Off 7-Day Digital Timer, White"  I haven't used this yet but I hope it does work . . .AMAZON. You in theory, set a time like 5pm on the GE Timer and have this little puppy already plugged into the GE plug and turned to the ON position. At that time, the Fake TV starts blaring away and the burglars are tricked into thinking you are an avid TV watcher.Though, if I saw this from the outside, I would think, 'Great, they're too busy watching TV. I can go in now and they won't see me' Just Great!I also bought for my house AutoChron for my light switches and lots of IP cameras from Panasonic. I think you can't go wrong there.
