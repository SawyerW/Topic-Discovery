Bought this in early August 2011 and it was just what we wanted and it seemed to work great. Today the connector in the monitor broke that allows the monitor to charge (sit in the charger). Too late for a return so I am waiting on what Amazon will do for a warranty replacement.Still pretty disappointed that it broke in less than 60 days of normal use.I will update this review as things unfold.9/28/11 - Amazon just informed me they cannot accept a return since it is beyond 30 days. I expected this. They did provide me the phone number and email address for Lorex. Here we go.9/30/11 - Contacted by Lorax (after I emailed them)Asked me to send them my Amazon invoice, which I did electronically. They responded with confirmation of where the replacement monitor is to be sent. So now we'll see what shows up. So, far I can't complain about Lorax and their response (except that the monitor broke in less than 2 months).10/11/11 - Nothing from the company. No emails or RMA number or empty box or replacement monitor. Emailed the company today to the representative that accepted my purchase / invoice information and who told me my return was on the way for a return status update. This is starting to turn ugly. My expectations at this point is I am not going to get anything but a headache.10/15/11 - I have now sent 2 more emails with return receipt to the company representative. Both my emails have been read and I have received no response back. Its getting apparent that I am not going to get by replacement monitor or my money back.10/24/11 - Almost a month later, after too much effort and climbing their Corporate ladder (screaming all the way) I received my replacement monitor. Trust me it was not worth the bargain I thought I was getting when I purchased it. Avoid this company.10/27/11 - Today I received the shipping and tracking information I requested a week ago, 3 days after the monitor was delivered...pathetic.
