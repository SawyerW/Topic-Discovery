We purchased the MBP36/2 product after reading all the wonderful reviews.  We purchased this product before our baby was born because we were trying to spread out the costs of having our first child over several months.  Well, after taking the cameras and monitor out of the box and using it for six months the monitor stopped turning on.  We called customer service after a new battery did not solve the problem.  They then sent us a new unit after we provided the original receipt (was told they would not accept a copy) and jumping through a few more hoops.Well...fast forward another seven months and now this "new" monitor doesn't have any sound (seems to be somewhat common) and the colors of the monitor are way off.  I called customer service and was told they would not honor the warranty on the new unit because it was past the year from the original unit.  So, the replacement unit they sent us lasted less than a year and we are out of luck with a monitor that doesn't have sound for our daughter.  Not great customer service or standing behind their products.  They basically said, "Tough luck the monitor we sent as a replacement also stinks, but hey together they lasted longer than 12 months."  Asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they asked them and they would not do anything about it.I would like to give this more than two stars because it is a good product, but as long as they aren't going to honor warranty's and the Monitor only last 6-7 months being fully functional I can't.Pros:Video quality is very goodThe audio was very good (while it worked)Range seems to be good (putting the antenna up makes a difference)Like the zoom featureCons:Short working lifespan (a product that costs this much shouldn't have to be replaced after 6/7 months)
