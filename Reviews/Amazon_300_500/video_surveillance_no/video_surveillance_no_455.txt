The Lorex LW2731 security system is very simple to use.Plug the camera, plug the monitor, turn on the monitor and the camera gets detected if it is within range.This is true for up to 4 cameras. If it does not work right away, pairing is explained and it is very easy too.This kit was delivered with one camera only. I checked for the price of additional cameras and it is around $145 for each additional one. In turn, the quality is pretty good. The camera does a very good job at filming at night. Identification of potential burglars should be made easy with this.What I like:- Reasonably priced- Good quality night vision camera- Very easy to set up.- Good detection speed.- 2GB SD card provided. Sufficient for a while.- Intercom between monitor and camera.What I do not like:- Monitor and camera need to be plugged to power to function. No battery solution as far as I am aware of.- Monitor needs to be plugged to a computer plugged to Internet to work with Skype. The computer has to be permanently on.Conclusion:It is a very good starting kit for home security but it falls just short because of the need of a computer to be permanently on. In case of a burglary, I would not be surprized if the thief stole my computer and maybe the monitor in the same time. In such circumstance, the system would prove completely useless.As another reviewer suggested, the monitor should be hidden close enough to the cameras (to function) and close enough to a computer connected to internet to get skype. Not an easy install to do this as thiefs are usually good at finding valuables.So I would say forget about skype and hide your monitor as best as you can.I still give it 4 stars for the overall quality of the system.
