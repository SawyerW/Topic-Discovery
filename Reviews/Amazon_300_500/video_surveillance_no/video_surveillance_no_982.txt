Pros:Camera and monitor connected quickly and was working right out of the box.- Picture quality is pretty good.- The camera pans extremely fast which I do like.- The battery life is pretty good but we only turn the video on occasionally, so if you are watching video constantly, the battery life will not be as good.- Taking video and pictures is quick and easy.- User interface is easy to use.- Monitor seem to be built well but we will see how the joystick holds up.- Audio quality is good both in hearing from the camera and speaking to the camera.- Temperature monitor with alarms are nice and is pretty accurate.Cons:- You can lock the touch screen which is nice, but even after locking the screen, if you put the monitor in your pocket, it still presses the touch buttons and turns the backlight of the monitor, so you will drain your battery rather quickly which is kind of frustrating.- The camera seems cheaply made but so far works pretty well. Feeling cheap isn't really a con as long as it works though.- Wireless connection isn't as good as I would like, we live in a ranch style home and it works everywhere up stairs but if my wife goes in the basement to do laundry, she looses signal in the laundry room which is pretty disappointing. Our house isn't that big but is in the shape of an L so as far as direct line of sight, the monitor while in the laundry room would have to look through the ground in order to communicate with the camera, the straight line distance is only about 40'. So if that is a big deal for you, I would steer clear of this camera. For us, it's not that big of a deal and we can deal with this short coming.Overall I think this is a pretty nice camera for the price. I would certainly recommend it, but I can only give it 4 stars because of the reception issue.
