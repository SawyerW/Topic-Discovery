I am not a technical wiz.  Getting this to work with my television was difficult. Finally I just started plugging it in to every hole in the back of the tv. Then the tv had to be on the correct settings. Ugh.... We have 3 remotes for our tv. So figuring out what buttons had to be changed and then finding the correct outlet on the back of the tv was quite a process. Figuring out all the controls was pretty much trial and error too.  I do feel like I know how to work it now. You really want to be persistent to figure it out.  If you have low light it is very grainy. If you have decent light it works pretty good. It is not fantastic, but works well enough. I was able to see the person who was getting into my things.  It is pretty big.  Now I wish I would have got something smaller, but all that has to be exposed is the little dot at the bottom so if you can get creative you can hide it and just expose the tiny dot. I did cover the back buttons with some cotton and tape because with the little lights that come on someone could see it. The main issue I am having is I can't get the drop down menu to work on one of the selections so the only way I can view this is by rewinding.  Customer support over the phone is a recording and directed me to write an email so I wasn't able to talk to anyone. I had to email and they gave me one suggestion and then said to send it in because there is a one year warranty. Not much help, I would like to talk to a real person.....I think for the money you could probably find something a little easier to work.  It was fine and now I like it, it is just kind of difficult at first....if you can get it hooked up correctly then you should be okay....
