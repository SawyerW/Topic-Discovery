I wanted to add another camera at my house before I went on vacation. This camera does just what the ads say it does.This camera can be used with a wired ethernet (10base-T) or wi-fi. To set up the wi-fi will take a few minutes, but should not be a problem if you've ever set up a router before. Other reviews have more details.The tilt/pan function works well. You can preset 15 locations where it points to then select each position from a web page or phone. You can also control the movements on the webpage. It can be set up to scan up and down and back and forth.You can also take snapshots - just grab a picture from a bookmark. I use this to minimize the bandwidth full-motion video takes. Useful on my phone. This is the sequence:ipaddress:port/snapshot.cgi?user=username&pwd;=password(amazon doesn't allow full url's)I also have a server capture snapshots once a minute using the above sequence for later viewing.If you mount this camera upside down, there is an easy setup to have it flip the picture and scanning directions.I don't think it's waterproof - I would not put it in the rain. The infrared lights (LED's) work well out to about 20 feet (for night time viewing). After that the light falls off. Also, there is a strong infrared cast to plants - they appear a whiteish-grey day or night.The images it produces are not great. You would have trouble recognizing faces past 30 feet. The resolution just isn't that great.The motion sensor detection works very well. It can be set up to e-mail 5-6 pictures when something moves in it's field of view. You can have multiple e-mail addressesOverall, I was please enough to buy one more and am planning on buying a couple more in the next few days.
