We needed this item because of our isolated location and few windows facing our driveway/main entrance.In our location, the sensor/transmitter is mounted about 100 feet from the receiver and fixed to a tree about belt high facing the driveway. At first, we had several false alarms because of one thing... the method they give you to mount the sensor/transmitter.  There is one key-hole mount located on the back/top of the sensor/transmitter that you are supposed to hang it from.  I suppose that may work for some locations but NOT where you have a chance of getting wind which causes the unit to move back and forth (even slightly).  This movement can cause it to think something is moving in front of it and it triggers.To solve the problem, at least for now, I pushed the unit between two vertical tree trunks.  This did not allow it to move and that's all it took.  Trigger accuracy improved significantly however, if you plan to face it toward bushes or other foliage, you may get false triggers on windy days,  I wish they had a sensitivity adjustment.As I mentioned tree or bush or even bird flight movement will set it off.  If the area you are monitoring has an abundance of these, you may get more false triggers than you want.  I accidentally spilled some parrot seeds/feed on my driveway and the birds, and this alarm, were very busy for awhile.I understand from other reviews that the Sun may cause false triggers so I faced ours North which will also save the sensor lens from UV deterioration over the years.I also previously purchased a car back-up camera from Amazon as well as a "Fake" security camera.  I installed the camera in the security camera enclosure, mounted  it on the garage and we tune our TV to this camera when this Driveway sensor alerts us.  Works Great!Make sure that, when you install your battery, you keep the rubber battery cover gasket in place as you close the lid or water penetration may be a problem.So far, so good!
