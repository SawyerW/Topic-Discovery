Compared to the other major brand monitors the Samsung has far and away the best video quality of all the monitors (4+) that we tested.  The downside is that the sound alarm (trigger) function is fatally flawed.The unit has a sound level alarm which makes the remote unit beep (or vibrate).  At least I think it is a sound level alarm.  The alarm does not always go off when there is noise... it just seems to go off randomly all the time. With sensitivity up the remote will beep constantly.  If you set the sensitivity dial on the camera to it's minimum sensitivity setting the remote's sound alarm will still inexplicably beep every few minutes (there was no sound in the room).  You can turn the remote's alarm sound down but not off or set it to vibrate only which is actually louder than the soft beep.The remote also has a auto mute function which mutes the background noise that tied to the same sensitivity setting.  With the sensitivity turned down you will not hear anything short of all out crying.  With the sensitivity turned up you will hear normally but the remote's alarm will go off several times a minute.To get it to work acceptably, I had to turn down the remote's alarm volume and the camera sound sensitivity down as far as they could go and turned the remote's auto mute off.  This results in a monitor that relays all the sound, including the background white noise to the unit.  With these settings the alarm softly beeps a couple times every few minutes.Another negative is that while there is a volume control for the alarm, there is no way to control the volume of the relayed sounds of your baby.I do not recommend this unit for the purpose of monitoring a baby due to the flawed alarm function.
