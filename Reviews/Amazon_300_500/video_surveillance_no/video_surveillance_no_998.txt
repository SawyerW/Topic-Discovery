Okay, first of all I'm in IT -- so despite thoughts to the contrary, the last thing I want to do is to come home and play around with some difficult piece of unreliable technology.I'm happy to report, DropCam isn't on that list!I currently have an alarm system and pay extra to have video clips stored with my provider.  Their app to retrieve them is painfully slow and what I've found disappointingly is that on a regular basis the cameras either disconnect (and don't reconnect) or suffer some type of "burp" (yes, that's a technical term) when uploading their images to the provider.  On top of this the alarm co decided to design the clip to be 10 seconds after an event, so unless your Mr. Burglar is a charmer and when he trips the alarm is nice enough to stare steadily into the camera for a selfie your opportunity on getting a good pic is very limited.Not so with Dropcam.  Superb setup, easy user interface, very reliable and dependable.  I've had no disconnects that I can ascertain and when my internet service went down and came back up a few minutes later the camera cleanly reconnected.  My usage is limited to about 4 days to date but the image quality is spectacular, the wide angle lens really is great and the night vision is fine.  I don't have a problem paying $15/mo to get 7 days versus up video storage because I get 7 full days of storage and can go back and forth through a time span to watch an event (I just watched FedEx deliver to my house... and I'm at the office!  Apparently they delivered about 30 minutes ago and I was able to quite easily scroll through the timeline to find when the driver was on my porch).To help me from a security standpoint I connected an older Dell 9" Android Tablet up to the wall above my intercom and I run the dropcam app 24/7.  When someone rings my buzzer I have a nice video image of them and don't have to even ask who it is.Very happy with it, so much so that I just bought an additional one.
