I have used this product now for a few weeks, and I must say at the outset that the quality of video and audio on this product is top notch for a baby monitoring device. Our home is very vertically oriented, and we often stay in the basement watching movies/relaxing while the baby is in the 3rd floor. The unit performs under these conditions rather effortlessly. I have not yet figured out how to connect it to the TV; I am told that is possible, and I cannot wait to figure that out.Now for the ergonomics. One of the most common ways we use this unit is to monitor our child when we are sleeping--I have this unit connected to the wall socket/power in our bedroom, and reaching/feeling about this device from a weird angle while half asleep and feeling about the device is just not possible. I like to shut off the screen until I hear a noise from our child (who sleeps in the same room, but not visible from our bed), and then power the screen -- this does work, and there is a button there to turn off/on the screen, but it is impossible to locate it in the dark. And--the power button is indescribably poorly placed, and its position is not very easy to guess feeling the unit. Oh, the rubber pads have dropped off in the bottom, so the unit slides about easily on our bedside table.My wife and I have been surprised by the generally abysmal quality of items that are baby-related--I expected significantly higher quality from Motorola, but my expectation was clearly not warranted. We have been let down more than once in the quality of products made specifically for babies/parents. I chalk this one to the same problem. The manufacturer clearly wants to charge a premium because it is a baby product (I can buy a HDTV for this price today!), and clearly has cut many many corners in the design of this product. They should be ashamed.
