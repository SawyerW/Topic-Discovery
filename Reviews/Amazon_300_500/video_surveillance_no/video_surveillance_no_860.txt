Had this camera for over a year now. It was a baby shower gift. I really don't understand why it is so popular when there are MUCH better options out there for the same price.First off, this camera interferes with our wifi. That may not be the case for you, as every configuration is different, but very frustrating nevertheless.Design flaw #1 is the antenna sticking out. It will break. If you ever drop it, that thing will be the first to go.Next, we have battery. My goal isn't to talk anyone out of buying this monitor, because it works OK...I just want to give you a few warnings and tips. Buy an extra battery when you purchase this. I tried buying a replacement locally, and couldn't get one anywhere including battery only stores and Radio Shack.Cords. Buy half a dozen to start with. This monitor has the worst connection jack on the receiver.  Just from the normal charging, it will wear out every couple of months. I think I purchased 4-6 of these cables. They are cheap, and Amazon has them...so do yourself a favor and get a few to have on hand.The biggest feature lacking is the static placement of it, meaning you can't remote control to change angles. So, when you go in to move it so you can see...at 3am, you wake the baby (feedback in the receiver).For nearly the same price you can buy the Foscam FBM3501. No antenna to break off. The charging jacks aren't cheap so you're not buying cords all the time. You can remote control the angle, zoom in when you can't quite see something, set a reminder for feedings, see the temperature of the room on the display...not to mention the LCD is bigger and has better night vision. VOX mode also has three sensitivity settings, unlike the one on the Infant Optics.The angle stand on the Infant Optics is also complete garbage and it falls all the time (so that's when you break the antenna).Bottom line? We're talking about two totally different classes of monitors here. There's no comparison.
