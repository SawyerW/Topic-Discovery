I have been using this monitor daily since June 2012. We have had some reception problems that I think are related to WiFi interference but otherwise I have really liked the monitor. However, now that the baby is sleeping in his own room we have been using it through the night rather than just for naps. I was very upset to realize a few nights ago that the picture froze. Fortunately I realized it around 2 AM. I tried to remove the batteries but couldn't because they are attached with wires. I slept in the baby's room and the next morning recharged the monitor after allowing it to run down on it's own through the night. It worked. Cautiously, we moved on, hoping it was just a glitch. Last night it happened again, just a few days later. I did not notice until this morning and I'm very angry and sad to think my baby might have been crying for me through the night. After the first incident I called the Motorola Vice President (really?!) who has responded to other Amazon complaints of the same kind. As of today, about five days later, I have not received a response. Today I contacted Amazon to see if they will help me to either replace the monitor or get another brand. No device is perfect and I know a lot of people love this product, but a baby monitor MUST be reliable. A frozen picture of a comfortably sleeping baby when he is instead crying is totally unacceptable.11/11/12 - Update. Amazon handled this problem wonderfully. They shipped a replacement monitor immediately and allowed me to return, free of charge, the broken monitor. Thank you, Amazon! As for the new monitor, so far it works perfectly. Therefore I changed my rating from one star to three. If this had never happened I would be giving it five stars. I still worry that the new monitor will freeze but so far it has been great. I even recommended it to my sister. It really is a great monitor - when it functions properly.
