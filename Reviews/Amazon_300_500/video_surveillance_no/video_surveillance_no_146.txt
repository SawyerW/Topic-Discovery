There are a ton of reviews here so I won't repeat everything about the system itself, but here is the absolute best way to setup these cameras:1. Make sure your home router and cable/DSL/fiber modem are all connected to a UPS.2. Purchase a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch with enough ports to handle however many cameras you will be setting up.3. Connect the PoE switch to a free port on your router, and plug the power connection into the UPS.4. Run network cable from the new PoE switch through your attic, basement, etc. to each location where you want to mount a camera (drop it down through the ceiling for ceiling mount, through the soffit panels for exterior undermount, into a standard RJ45 jack enclosure if you want to just sit the camera on a shelf inside, etc.). Use bulk network cable for this and simply crimp the RJ45 ends on the cable at each end (or for a more professional setup terminate the cables into a patch panel near the PoE switch).5. Connect each camera to your remote cable location using only the network port on the camera (no need to use power adapters, in fact when you purchase additional cameras Logitech now sells versions that don't include the powerline network adapters. These sell for significantly less too!)6. Use the software as specified to configure the cameras... you're done!This setup allows you to easily place cameras anywhere in your house with no need to run bulky (and potentially dangerous) AC wiring or extension cords. The cameras are connected straight to your network for maximum reliability. Since the PoE switch is the only source of power, and since it is connected to your UPS, then all the cameras will continue to record even if the power goes out. Since your router and modem are also connected to the UPS you will still be able to monitor your cameras remotely when the power is out as well.
