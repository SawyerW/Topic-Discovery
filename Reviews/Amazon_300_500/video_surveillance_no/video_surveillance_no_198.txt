I bought this set, refurbished, from a deal-a-day site for a good price.  In general, the video quality of the camera is very good (as long as you have reasonably-good lightning).  Pretty strong fisheye effect from the very-wide-angle lens, so that takes some getting used-to.  I also discovered that the picture outside of the fisheye is prone to reflections from the glass (I'm using the suction-cup mount), so I taped a small piece of black construction paper (with a lens-sized hole cut in it) to the window, and placed the camera against that.Setup, in a Mac household running Vitamin D surveillance software, was a bit of a pain.  Had to fire up XP under VMware Fusion in order to configure the camera.  I put the camera's MAC address in my AirPort Extreme's DHCP reservation system, and was thus able to configure a "static" IP address for the camera.  I then pointed Vitamin D at that static IP, and it all kinda worked.  Turns out my house wiring isn't clean enough to do HighResolutionVideo, so I used a final URL of "rtsp://camera_ip_address:554/LowResolutionVideo".  It still gets behind ("low frame rate" in Vitamin D), where it never did with the 384 kbps feed from the Linksys WVC80N it replaced.I also purchased several of Logitech's LA700e outdoor POE adapters off eBay, and used one hooked up to a 802.3af splitter (the TP-Link L-PoE10R) to power/run a 10/100 switch (D-Link DES-1105).  The splitter's included power cord was the right size for the switch; this setup seems to work reasonably well.  I'll probably buy some more TL-POE10Rs, plus the right size of power cords, to eventually run my other security cameras (protecting the splitters from the weather may be an issue, though).Some final advice: if you have other HomePlugAV equipment, you'll want to download Logitech's software to configure the POE adapters (sadly, also Windows-only).  "Security" under HomePlugAV is pretty pointless, so I'd leave it all default access and live with it.
