Bottom Line Up Front:  I could highly recommend this camera if hadn't stopped recognizing that it was plugged in after less than two years service.  That's not a decent value for a monitor costing this much.UPDATE: After further investigating I found that the power cord had become damaged at the strain relief on the DC transformer. That's why the viewscreen/receiver would no longer stay powered. A trip to RadioShack yielded an appropriate 6 VDC 800 milliamp transformer with a tip that, while a bit too long, does work. So, I'm out a bit of time and $25 but at least it's back up and running. I raised the review one star.Pros:  We were generally very pleased with the baby monitor as far as the performance.  We positioned the camera on the wall near the baby's crib about 6 or 7 feet away from the mattress.  It has very good clarity in daylight, and the night-time picture with the IR diodes providing the illumination is sufficient to see what's going on with the baby.  Range is decent.  We have clear reception through two walls and 25 feet or so, and can even get decent reception through 3 walls and another 10-15 feet (35-40 ft total range with 3 walls).Cons:  The screen shuts off every few minutes if not plugged in.  I'm sure this is a power saving feature.  The motor makes some noise when moved to adjust camera, but it's not too noticeable to the baby, and certainly not enough to wake her.Show Stopper!!:  The problem is that after owning this for 20 months, it suddenly wouldn't charge when plugged in.  We've been pretty gentle with the monitor/cord interface.  It has been tripped over a few times.  I haven't spent much time trying to troubleshoot if it's the plug or something going on with the rechargeable batteries, but finding this out at our bedtime didn't encourage me to add any stars.  This is an expensive monitor, and it should last better than it has.
