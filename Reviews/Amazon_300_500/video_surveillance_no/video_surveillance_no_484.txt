This isnt a bad little camera. A couple things I dont like about it. The pan and tilt function is not continuous you have to push the arrow the way you want it move and if your lucky the app will take the input ( more often than not it dosent though) When it does it only moves a very short distance. (I have it set to the longest distance it will go) im useing it to monitor two areas in my living room and the adjacent breakfast nook ( and kitchen) its never pointed the way I  need and it takes at least 10 pushes to move it between the two areas. You can set up waypoints that it will move to quickly but the are not accessable from the mobile app that I use (when it works) 98% of the Time. My second complaint is the mobile app they work good when I am lucky enough for it to actually connect. 6 times out of 7 ( on average) it fails to link up. It tries for 10 or 15 sec to link then tells you its unable to. So you you have to keep pushing relink for 90 sec ( thats when I give up and call hopeing my mom will answer (She has  dementia which is why I try to  check in on her. She is easily confused) I actually have three of these cameras but at any given time usually only one will link up any do ( and it's never the one that allows me to see if she's ok or not) the setup was as easy as they say. If youre at home on  your own home network the cameras come in every time why you need to check cameras while your at home I'm not sure but it does work flawlessly then. I would probably go with the more expensive competitors which are harder to set up when they are they work 90 % of the time
