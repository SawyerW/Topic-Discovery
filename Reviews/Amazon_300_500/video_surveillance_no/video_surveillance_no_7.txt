We bought this because we have a late night prowler that we want to call the police for, but we never know when he's going to show up.  He's come into our yard at least 3 times in the last 10 days, and who knows how many more times before there was snow on the ground. Its very unnerving.  We find his tracks in snow in the morning but never manage to be awake when he's at our garage door or the neighbor's patio door (really creepy).  We got Driveway Patrol on Saturday night and tried putting it outside after adding batteries, but it chimed non-stop until we finally had to bring it in.  I was disappointed that we'd have to wait til Spring and more moderate temps (we're in Wisconsin.)  But we decided to give it one more try, and attached it to a nail on the outside of our white garage on Monday morning and it appears to be working consistently since then.  I'm not sure what the difference was: maybe putting it outside in the lesser cold of the morning vs. late night temps?  Whatever the initial problem was, it seems to be resolved.  We walked past it a number of times to test it, and at 1:30AM this morning we were awakened to its chiming.  We jumped out of our beds in time to see our prowler leaving our yard and heading down the alley - apparently unaware of the outdoor sensor unit.  Not sure if the police will be able to arrive in time to catch this creep if he's just checking doors and not spending time breaking into something, but its reassuring to know we can see what he's doing and try to get him picked up.  For less than $20, I say try it.
