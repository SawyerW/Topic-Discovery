This is a simple, easy to use surveillance color camera with built-in motion detector and programmable schedule.Stealth? Probably because it looks more like a light motion detector instead of a regular camera (although seems to be oversized for such a device).The covert DVR camera works either with 2 AA's batteries or the supplied AC adapter. If you want it as a permanent surveillance camera, you will have to use the included AC adapter. The adapter will work from 100V to 240V, 50/60Hz range, which can also be used in other countries where the voltage is other than 120V. NTSC or PAL compatible.It came with wall mount accessories, an extension, and some gypsum type board screws. The 2 gigabyte microSD card is good for 45 days of monitoring. You can get a 32G card for up to 2 years surveillance.You have 2 modes of recording. Record until the card is full (it will stop when it is ), or the continuous recording by automatically recycling/deleting the oldest recorded movies. Recorded movie are stamped with time and dates.  You can choose either 640x480 at 12 frames per seconds or 320x240 at 30 fps.Motion sensitivity can be adjusted to accommodate movements of curtains, etc.The format used is mpeg4 which is easily playable in your PC, you just need a memory card reader and a player like VLC.When you install it, make sure the pinhole camera is located at the bottom. Otherwise your image will be upside down.1 year warranty with 24/7 customer support.
