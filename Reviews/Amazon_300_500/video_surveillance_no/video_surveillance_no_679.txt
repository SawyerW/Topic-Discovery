I was disappointed that this camera's method of transmitting video is not a true video stream (such as accessible by RTSP protocol) but instead just uses DHTML to rapidly update a static image.  To the typical user this might be acceptable and it "looks" like video, but it means you can't send your stream to re-broadcasting services like Ustream or Justin.tv.Justin.tv's FAQ states that "IP cameras that you can watch using VLC are supported." With some research I was able to find that there is an HTTP URL format that does actually work with VLC:[...](where username:password is a valid account you have set up in your camera's configuration and n.n.n.n is the camera's IP address)However the frame rate of this "stream" is only around 2 FPS at best. Nevertheless, I found a video somewhere that shows how to stream to Justin.tv from VLC using a tool packaged as jtv.rar in which I just had to edit 2 batch files to provide my camera's URL and my Justin.tv broadcasting key. This worked, somewhat... The video as viewed on Justin.tv, in addition to being just 2 FPS or worse, was now VERY low-resolution and/or high-compression, making it entirely useless. When this is compared to the nice 30 FPS stream I get from a standard-def camcorder hooked to a video capture card and uploaded using FMLE, one can understand my disappointment.As for the camera itself, the quality is OK but doesn't adapt to bright lights well. We got this camera to view our second bearded dragon, and the lights in its terrarium and anything they directly illuminate are washed out to pure white on the camera, no matter what brightness/contrast settings I use in the camera configuration.As other reviewers have said, the pan/tilt features on this unit are nice. It's just a shame that the camera itself and the streaming protocols it uses aren't of the same quality.
