Amazon.com, shame on you! This is by far one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Amazon and I am amazed that Amazon would soil its name with a product like this. If the product description simply read "cheap lo-def motion sensor camera," it would basically be correct. Despite what the adverting says, this product is NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. Repeat: NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. The mini-cd that comes with this toy (and it is a TOY) cannot fit into most Mac slide-in disc drives. Also, even if you happen to have a mini-cd adaptor (or a DVD/CD reader that pops out to receive disks), once the program is uploaded into the camera, the programing software used to configure the settings cannot work on any Mac OS. So, "mac-compatable" is a complete lie in the advertising. As for the quality of picture this toy captures, everything looks like sepia-toned Bigfoot footage. Good luck getting any face, license plate, or useful physical features with this product. Other problems: The camera is COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE THROUGH WINDOWS no matter how clean the window is. So, if you're trying to capture something outside your home, you'd literally have to place the camera outside, where it could be easily discovered thus defeating the whole purpose capturing someone's activity unaware. And why would someone find the camera? Because, the camera CANNOT BE HIDDEN!  When the red night-vision lights activate, they can be seen from as far as 150 feet (So again, false advertising for this being a "spy" or "hidden" camera. Isn't this much false advertising illegal?). And what do you get with this incredible night-vision technology? NIGHT-VISION THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS FROM A CAMERA MADE INTHE 80s--grainy, unfocused, blurry. And the AUDIO SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT CHARACTER IN A PEANUTS CARTOON--words indistinguishable and incomprehensible. THERE IS NO 16-PAGE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. Yet another lie! There is one (1) sheet of instructions coming with the camera (as well as a completely useless pdf on the mini-cd--a whole three pages of 24 font size text)  full of pigeon English and confusing instruction. This product is obviously FOREIGN MADE AND PACKAGED.  The package itself is completely different from the one shown on Amazon. Also, THERE IS NO LIFETIME 1800 TECH SUPPORT. Yet another 'nother lie! There's no number or address anywhere on the product for customer support, and NO WARRANTY INFO OR CERTIFICATE. And, finally, the price. Are you kidding me? For nearly $120, I expected a top-quality product that at least delivered what it promised in the product description. In reality, this camera is worth about $29.99 and should be sold and described as such. Great for kids who like gadget toys, but useless for any type of serious surveillance. DO NOT BUY!WARNING! ATTEMPTING TO INSERT MINI-CD INTO SOME MACINTOSH COMPUTER MODELS CAN RESULT IN DISK BEING STUCK IN DISK DRIVE!
