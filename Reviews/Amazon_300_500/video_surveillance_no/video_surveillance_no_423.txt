I just bought this to my house. Its 3 floors, 450m2 just for you to have a dimension that I put sensors on the front and at the lowest level and all of them are working just fine , wireless.The system is complete, fully programmable. Comes ready to work, but you can still customize it. It comes with one of the sensors (08) ready for the front door, meaning its a delayed sensor for you to have time to open the door and disarm the system even when not using the remote, between 0-90s. But I have a second back door that I wanted the same feature. You just have to reprogram one of the sensors to a zone lower than 08 (I used 07) and after reprograming the sensor number, put it as a delayed one.I also loved the feature that you can have audio beeps when some doors are opened (you choose which). I put that on my front and back door, so now I know when my kids are going to play outside , and more than that, if everyone is inside house and I hear the beep (even when the alarm is off) I know that front or back door was open.Motion sensors are really good, the remote siren is loud enough for half block to hear it. System is smart enough to call you in case of any breach  and you can disarm it remotely. If you cannot pick the call, it can call other 3 numbers, play a message you recorded and the person can disarm the system or not. You can also call home and arm the system if you forgot to when you left.For its price I found it an amazing product and more than that, just loved the easy support you have on their site with dozens of how tos videos. I also sent an email to Michael to make the 2nd door chime, he replied it by himself with the instructions. Good job !So, I really recommend you buy this.
