This is the 2nd Dlink I have purchased. The first was model was the DCS-932L which is a decent camera as well but I really wanted to capture more of the room and the 932 has a somewhat narrow view. This 5020L model has a wide angle lens as well as other features such as pan, and tilt. I enjoy having those additional features more than I thought I would. Other reviews point out the negative of the camera having a fixed zoom lens which can be adjusted manually by turning the focus ring on the front of the camera. Sure it would be great if it automatically focused or even if you were able to control the focus remotely but honestly it's not that big of a deal for my uses. If the room was perhaps 30' or larger such as a banquet hall I could see this being an issue but not so much for an average size room.Pretty straight forward setup once you become familiar with their software. The included recording software isn't bad either. I've been in IT for 20 years and it's obvious to me DLink made a lot of effort to remain very flexible with its options and they have done pretty well. There are many options to have snapshots sent directly from the camera to an email address or FTP server. Same with video clips and all can be configured to do so by motion activation or scheduled. A feature I found very useful is the ability to define in the camera's view an area you can define to set the activation. Example: in both camera's while I can see the majority of the room I defined a small area on the entrance doors to be monitored. The result is people just moving around in the room do not set off the recording until the camera sees the door open or someone walks in-between the camera and the defined area.I do wish it had PoE (Power over Ethernet) so I could do away with the AC adapters, this is the only reason it didn't get the 5th star. But you do get a lot of bang for the buck in this camera and I'd recommend it for home use.
