I will start by saying that I found varying reviews (most decent) regarding this device, but I took the chance, given that at the time, they were sold out (new) everywhere, but everyone had been ordering more, so I bought this one used (with the seller offering a full warranty on it).Good: The device is very easy to set up.  I was expecting a need to hard-wire a junction box in the awning of my house to get me power, but the power cord is so stinking long, I just drilled a hole into my house and stuck it through, caulking around it.  I had no trouble picking up full bars from the receiver anywhere in the house.The only problem I had was trying to figure out the controls.  Being a guy, the manual came last, but it cleared up most of my problems.Bad: The remote is flimsy and needs to be of higher quality.  It feels and pops like bubble wrap pops, with each button press.Picture quality:  Is obviously best during the day, and at night I have two 150 watt bulbs on a motion sensor nearby.  One of the reasons I bought this was because of some shady neighbors getting "lots" of visitors that stay for less than 60 seconds at a time during the day -- draw your own conclusions, and I was hoping to pick up license plate numbers, but at even 20 feet, my wife couldn't read one with me holding one still, up to the camera.Can be improved:  I want this to be an inconspicuous item in my house, so I have the receiver hidden, but near a TV.  I want an on-screen indicator as to the status of the recording setting to indicate motion or schedule.  I had the receiver hidden, and couldn't tell without pulling out the receiver to check the lights on the box.All in all, good unit.  If it holds up, I will buy more cameras for it.Note:  This unit supposedly has audio recording capabilities.  I haven't tested it and can't vouch for it either way.
