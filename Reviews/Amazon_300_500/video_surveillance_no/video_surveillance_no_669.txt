Sept 16, 2012I got the unit, set up is pretty straight forward. I don't know what others are talking about the setup being difficult. I got it up and running in less than five minutes. I used a wired Network first to locate it using their software to locate the device. I entered a static IP and that was pretty much it. Read the quick set up guide.The Pro's:Relatively inexpensive. Microphone is a plus. PTZ (Pan/Tilt only) is relatively smooth. Quality is 7 out of 10 during the day and 8 out of 10 during the night. My coverage area is eight feet by three feet, by six feet it is located in a 16 ft by six ft wide by six ft high rectangular structure in the ceiling. I have an Android phone and using the program called "IP Cam Viewer", the free version works, but I bought the Pro for $3.99 because that is how I roll. Setup on that program was easy too.The Con's:No Location preset set. Available on in the H series (according to the manual). Email setup is proving to be difficult, as of today, I still can not get it to work. After pressing test, it gets stuck. I have read several sites on how to do it, whether I am using GMail's SMTP or GMX, still no joy. The scheduler is a pain, the hour block are broken into four 15 minute segments. Here is a hint, double click on the hour and all four sections will be enabled.The Bottom Line:For the price, you can not complain. I will be happy if it last for a year. I have it outside in my Chicken Coop to keep an eye out for my chickens. It is under a roof, so it shouldn't get wet. However, it will be exposed to the elements including plenty of dust.I hope this review helps.
