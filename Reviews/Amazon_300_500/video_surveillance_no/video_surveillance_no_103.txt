I almost never write reviews, but felt the need to say something on this one.  I'm not disgruntled or angry just want others to know what happened to us with customer service with Lorex.  If you are looking at two monitors that are relatively the same, you might want to go with the non-Lorex one just based on customer service.We ordered this product well before our son was due because it was on sale and it seemed like all video monitors had some issue or another.  So we picked one and went with it. When we put it all together when our son showed up, it was pretty straightforward and easy to use.  I thought it was quite logical and did provide some peace of mind on how he was doing without us going in his room. However, the battery would not take a charge at all.  So, it had to constantly be plugged into the base for it to work.  I contacted customer support - ultimately via email because getting them on the phone is difficult.  They did not respond to the first 3 emails either - until I noted it was a warranty issue (be sure to register it for warranty as soon as you get it). I then got a response a few days later asking for additional information (when purchased, etc.).  I responded. A week later I got the same questions. I responded.  A week later I got a request for me to fax the invoice to them.  I did that. A week later I got a phone call asking that I mail the product back to them for a replacement to be sent to me.  No information on where to mail it, what to include, etc.  And never once did anyone apologize for any inconvenience or even act like there was a human on the other end of the conversation.  I am no on hold with the company to find out how/what to send in.  The product is not bad, if it worked properly. The customer support, on the other hand is really awful.
