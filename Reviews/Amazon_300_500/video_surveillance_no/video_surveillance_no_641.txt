UPDATE: I have 4 of these, and they have worked fine for almost two years now.-----------Note that all security cameras with built-in IR illuminators suffer from a common issue: the illuminator picks up on dust motes and tiny insects floating in the air right in front of the lens and turns them into giant bright white blobs, triggering video-based motion detection (if you are using such). This generates numerous false alarms.Fortunately, the solution is simple -- turn off the IR on the camera and use an external IR source. This camera doesn't have a switch for that purpose, but you can simply unscrew the cylindrical case near the front, revealing the IR module surrounding the lens, Unplug the IR module, and that problem (at least) is solved. For extra McGyver points, you can remove the IR module from the camera, connect it to 12Vdc, and mount it away from the camera but pointed at the camera's view -- Voila! Night vision without the giant blobs. I assume that removing the module would void the warranty, but what does McGyver care about warranties?For the McGyver-impaired, there are nice 850nm IR illuminators available from Amazon for under $10 ("YY Trade IR30" OR "YY_IR30", ASIN B001P2E4U4). This is a good match to the built-in illuminator in the camera.For an inexpensive color camera, this unit has exceptional low light capability, and excellent IR sensitivity at 850nm, the wavelength of most IR illuminators. The IR functionality is pixel-by-pixel, meaning that you can have a scene that is partly illuminated by natural light and partly by IR, and the natural light portion will be in color, and the IR part in glorious monochrome.The 3.6mm lens provides an excellent wide field of view.The supplied mount is flexible and sturdy, although not a true ball-socket mount.The supplied 12Vdc supply is the smallest I have seen.The supplied security sticker... is a security sticker.
