My wife and I have had this unit for just over a year, and until recently it worked wonderfully (and I would have given them a rating of 5 stars).  That said, over the past 2 - 3 months the unit has dramatically went downhill.  It started with the unit not being able to hold a  charge, and there being periodic issues syncing the monitor up with the cameras to get the video to work.  In each of these instances, we would leave the camera off for a few hours and by the end of the day for some reason it would start working again.  Unfortunately however, these issues became more and more frequent and recently (last night), the unit went out entirely.  It will not hold a charge at all, we cannot get a picture to show at all ( it appears that the A/C Adaptor or charger now will not sync with the base at all ).  So, the monitor for the unit is completely useless..  But, here's the best part of this review...  I just called Motorola Customer Service (1- 8887- 331- 3383) and was basically got the following;- Motorola is aware of the "A/C Adaptor issue" with these units- There is nothing that they "can do" (code word for willing to do) in terms of switching out or servicing the unit (code word for - I will not stand behind by $250+ unit).I'm absolutely shocked that a company as reputable as Motorola would not stand behind their product.. I'm hoping that someone from Motorola will contact us and make this right (as they did with other issues or instances listed here). At this point however, I can truly say that the unit was great, it then went out due to no fault of our own, and we've received absolutely poor service from Motorola at this point..
