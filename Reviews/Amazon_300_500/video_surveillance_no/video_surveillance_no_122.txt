I was a little iffy about ordering this item, but since we are away from our home a lot I thought I would give it a try.  The reviews were all around the compass as to effectiveness, but they all said that the little light box works well.I can see how it is perfect for a two or three story home, and that it has it's drawbacks in a single story situation -- which is what we have.At first I was aiming the light directly at the front window (venetian blinds) and if I moved my head around a bit I could catch the flickering light in a direct view thru the little slits in the slats of the blinds.  However, around the edges of the blinds I could not see the light directly, and the flicker off the walls was an exact mimic of a TV set.So, I decided to turn the light toward one of the inside walls...90+ degrees away from the front window, and I placed a potted plant between the light and the window (sitting on a coffee table).  From the outside all I could see then was the flicker of the light as it danced off the walls, and the potted plant covered any direct view of the light.  It works perfectly...!!!A few days ago my motion sensing barking dog, REX, arrived from Amazon.com (read my review).  These two gadgets working together while we are gone will give us a bit more confidence that we will come back to our home the way we left it.  We think our neighborhood is safe anyway, but you never know.  It's good to have something like this to help "guard" the premises.I also have a fan in another room that is set to go on and off at various times with a timer.  It blows toward the drapes moving them a little.  Just a little more feeling of security, but the FAKE TV light and the barking REX are the real deterrents.
