This system is quite a surprise! It does a lot, is solid,  well built and meant to last. I had to read the installation sheet twice but after that it really was very easy to set up. The system has a box that plugs into your router and into your power supply, the cameras are then plugged into your power supply and the signals travel through your house wiring to the receiving box plugged into the router. I can now watch live video of my front yard and also my living room (I also have an interior camera) which I could also use to monitor if I so wanted to. The daytime video is close to HD quality, night vision is monochrome and acceptable.Some of the great features this system has is that the cameras each some with a  2 gig mini SD card pre-installed that record video whenever the camera detects motion. This video can be played back anytime (though the card will erase data as it becomes full and needs more space)But wait...there's more, if you create an account on the Logitech web-site, you can monitor your cameras from anywhere with  internet service. It comes with "apps" for some cellphones though it does not work on mine but it is possible to also monitor video right on your phone whenever you want, it can even send you alters whenever motion is detected!You can also pan the cameras a little to view areas just out of the cameras reach which is pretty neat.This system is not cheap, but is meant to last, a rarity in today's world full of cheaply made consumer products!I will be adding another exterior camera to cover my back yard though it can accommodate up to an impressive 6 cameras total!If you need a quality set of video cameras that you wish to install yourself, with all the described features, this would be a good bet! I really cannot think of any negatives... what nice deal!
