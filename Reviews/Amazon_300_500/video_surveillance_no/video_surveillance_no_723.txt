This video monitor passes all the tests. I have no "cons" to speak of regarding its capabilities. I have been using this for about 6 months.In daytime (semi-lit rooms) the color monitor is crisp and clear. In darkness the picture turns to pretty much black and white but still very clear. At least it is not neon green night vision.It has remote buttons for a light and and a talking feature, but we don't use them because our 9 month old pretty much sleeps to darkness and very loud sound machines (white noise).We always keep the camera plugged in near the crib but we dont always keep the monitor plugged in when we use it. When the monitor is plugged in there are never any lapses in the screen. When it is unplugged and I take it into my mancave (third floor down) it can lose picture and go black because its "out of range". And if you use the speaker function to listen to the baby, when its unplugged it can go "out of range if I go to the bottom floor of our 3 story.The ONLY reason I dont give this five stars is because of the price. Even though Amazon has a great deal ($160), I can't believe these video monitors cost so much. It's not a knock on this Samsung, all the video monitors seem high.All-in-all, this monitor is a great product.1 year Update: Our Camera stopped working! All of the sudden, no warning, the camera wont power up even when plugged in. I dont know if we used it too much or what. We use it every night, and two naps a day. And we always kept it plugged in and attached to wall. Too bad becasue we really liked it. And luckily it is within the 16 month return period so we can get our money back from Amazon.I guess we'll try a different brand since there are only 3 left for sale on Amazon, and now they are closer to $300.And I changed our review to 3 stars becasue of the defective product.
