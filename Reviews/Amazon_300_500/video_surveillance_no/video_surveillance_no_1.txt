This Driveway Patrol Kit consists of an infrared motion detector sensor and a radio receiver/alarm.  The infrared sensor works on line-of-sight.  In other words, it must be in the open where it can "see" the moving object.  When triggered, the sensor sends a radio signal to the receiver/alarm.  Radio wave goes through obstacles and, therefore, the receiver/alarm can be located behind walls.  Metal objects reflect radio waves.  Keep the receiver/alarm away from them.  The 400 feet range is quoted prominently on the box; I can't confirm that because my receiver/alarm is only 25 feet away from the sensor and, at that range, it works perfectly.  The sensor works on a 9-V battery, whereas the receiver/alarm operates on three 1.5V C-batteries.  There is a power-input socket on the receiver/alarm for an optional AC adapter at 4.5V (not included).  A switch at the side allows the user to turn the alarm off or set it on either "HI" or "LO".False alarms are frequent, but most of them are caused by environmental factors - loose object waving in the wind, swaying tall grass, or moving foliage.  Even direct sunlight and moving shadows can cause false alarm.  At night, it is mostly small animals - cats, raccoons, etc.  It is up to the user to eliminate these environmental factors as much as he can, like mounting the sensor high enough so that small animals can pass under without triggering the alarm, keeping the sensor out of direct sunlight, securing moving objects in the wind, etc.Some reviewers complain about early breakdown of the units, but that is contrary to my experience.  I bought a kit in a store close to 5 years ago and it is still working.  I just bought two more at Amazon and you can't beat the price.  Another thing that worth mentioning is that all three sensors I own work with the original receiver/alarm.  The radio wave must be at the same frequency.
