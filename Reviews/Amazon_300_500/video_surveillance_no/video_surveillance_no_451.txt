It installed and fired right up, I have not tested the remote viewing yet, the picture quality is okay, these are not expensive cameras, with not much night time range. A subject needs to be within 5-10' at night in order to be recognizable. I installed two cameras to watch the gates, which cannot be seen from the house, and also mounted two up high on the house eaves I now have the added advantage of being able to see bats close up, as they either live in the attic, or are attracted to the IR beams.You need to experiment with your placement outdoors, as including too much sky will darken the lower part of the frame, and the definition is really not much after about 20' anyway, barely enough to id a face.As mentioned, good value for money.I plan to find some older thrift store videocams, and install them in key positions. Or maybe a PTZ, as it does support that. My only one real  gripe was the camera mounts, they are a cheap ball swivel design and almost  have to be locked down by a gang of rail-road workers in order to lock the camera's position so it doesn't move.I found wrapping the ball ends in plumbers' teflon tape helped this, and  I also dug out two cheap camera tripod heads from the garage and used those instead.I also covered the cable connectors in shrink-wrap when I installed, as these are quite obviously not exterior connectors, and any rain or moisture will have a quick effect.I am happy with this system and the price I paid. It's at least as good as the average CCTV you seen in convenience stores, and does all the required tricks. The convenience of just flicking a switch every time the dogs start barking, instead of walking to each end of the house, plus the added security, and cameras visible to the outside world on large poles, make this a good buy for me.
