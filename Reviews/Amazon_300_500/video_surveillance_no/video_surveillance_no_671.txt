I give the camera 3 stars but i give the software and web gui 2 stars. I have written my own surveillance cam softawre so I know this area pretty well.The cam is good, clear, and I like the pan tilt. The angle is quite narrow so if you put it on your front porch you can't get a very good wide angle shot. Like in front of your door or them coming up to the door from 20 feet away but not both.The web interaction is good.The software is horrendous.The settings are in about 4 different places and its hard to remember where I saw a particular setting every time i want to change one. Some are different in the web ui wich makes it even harder.One big feature I am missing is some way for it to track movement with the pan/tilt when motion triggers an alarm. It does have programmable "cruise" and it does have a go to a predefined position after an alarm but then it stays there and there is no way to reset it automatically.Likewise with uploading to a web site, you don't have much flexibility with that and the description of the upload settings is very confusing and scattered through out the software.I am still getting pictures with incorrect times and not sure why even though it is supposedly synced to my computer.I like the sound and motion detection capabilities but wish i had more options on what to do during motion detection like how long the video should record, or how many pictures to take, or the interval. There is some of that but very limited.The night vision LED being on all the time makes the colors during the day look washed out. It should turn off in daylight ideally.Every time it starts up it goes to 16 window view and i have to change it to 1 window view.Its ok.
