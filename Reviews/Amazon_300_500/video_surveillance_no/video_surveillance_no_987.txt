Company doesn't actually exist.  When I emailed their support (because my camera was making a clicky noise every 5-6 seconds which fluctuated in noise level to the point where it would wake up my 2 year old son), I got redirected to some other company for support.  When I asked why they were helping me, they said the email came to them.  When I asked for help and restated my problem, they said I'd need to contact VeevoCam for support.  I forwarded that email to support@veevocam.com and it went back to them again and they told me the same thing - I needed to contact VeevoCam.  I asked how I could get in touch with them as their website doesn't even exist.  They said the only thing I could do was to replace the camera, but I would need to contact VeevoCam to do this.  (So they were avoiding the question on how to get in touch with VeevoCam).  I finally emailed a one line email that said "Please tell me how to contact VeevoCam's support" and then I got an email back from them which had 8 other people of different companies CC'd and all they said was "Please replace customer's camera".  I waited 3 days, then "replied all" to everyone and asked what the procedure was for an RMA or repair.  I never did get a response.  After a week, I decided to return it to Amazon and spend the extra money to get a foscam FI8921W V2 instead.  I am SO happy I did.  The foscam works in any browser, has a mount (which I thought I'd have to buy seperately), much faster, way better image quality, etc...The VeevoCam wasn't bad when I first played with it, I wouldn't have returned it if the clicking didn't wake my son up.  But I'm sure glad it broke so I could try out the Foscam.  When there is no company to stand behind a product, they shouldn't be selling a product.  <period>
