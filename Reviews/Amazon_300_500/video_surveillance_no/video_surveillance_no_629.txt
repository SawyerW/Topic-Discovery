I like this Swann security system.  I have found it was easy to set up and get running.  We are using it as perimeter security around our house and it does all we wanted and more (with it's Internet capabilities).  Not only has the system provided the needed recorded security we wanted, but it has become useful in other situations. Depending on how you aim the cameras you can monitor deliveries and/or monitor pets in real time (with the free phone app).  The key to all this is the camera placement.While set up is simple, we had to carefully consider camera placement in order to deliver the feeds we wanted.  Make sure you place the cameras in a protected location (like under the eaves). Make sure that nothing will obscure the view. Consider redundant camera angles (multiple cameras focused on the same location from different angles). Also, consider if you want to conceal the cameras so no one knows they are being monitored.For us, the biggest concern was wiring.  It is nice that Swann provides ample cable for your cameras.  A single wire will provide both power and video connection.  Each camera has two jacks (power and video), it is simple once you see it.  We did not want the wiring for the system to be visible (mostly for aesthetics). This meant drilling into the walls and running the cable through the attic, this is something to consider when installing. It took a few hours to set it up the way we wanted in order to give us the video feeds we wanted.I really like the system and I love the fact that I can expand the system to 8 cameras simply by buying the new cameras and plugging them in.  Replacing a damaged camera will also be a breeze.I would recommend this system to anyone who is looking for this level of security.
