I bought this to augment the security of my rural home. My place is fairly isolated and a good 15 min from any police patrols. A standard security system like ADT offers would do me no good since the intruders would have plenty of time to take off with my stuff and flee into the woods. This system provides a good deterrent to potential thieves. The cameras, while small, are still quite visible from a distance.Setup took me approximately 4.5 hours from opening the box to doing the final checks on the feeds. The supplied 60 foot cords were more than long enough for my mid size two level home. The hardest part of the install was crawling around the attic running the cables. Once connected, the cameras all worked flawlessly.The picture quality during the day is quite good and night views are clear. The box states up to 50' range at night but I would say its more like 30', which is perfectly acceptable for my application. When installing the cameras, be sure to avoid having too much of the wall visible as this will create a bright infrared reflection and greatly diminish the range and brightness of the rest of the view.The manufacturer provides their own mobile viewing applications, however like other reviewers, I had trouble getting this to work. I downloaded IP Cam Viewer and had it setup in under 2 minutes.My one complaint is the lack of Mac support for viewing the feeds on a computer. The manufacturer has provided a plugin that is supposed to allow you to view it with Safari, but I was never able to get anything other than a network error message. I was able to use the provided NetView application as well as Internet Explorer to view the feeds running Windows 7 in Parallels. Not a perfect solution but it works.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking for a basic, well priced camera system.
