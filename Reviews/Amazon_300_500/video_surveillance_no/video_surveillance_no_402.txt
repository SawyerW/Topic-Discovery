I received this a few days ago and it did take some research and trial and error to set it up correctly.  Setting up the cameras to the DVR is easy and took about five minutes.  Viewing the cameras with an iPhone (internally and externally) and through Internet Explorer over the web took a little perseverance, but I did get it to work.  If you don't know networking or computers, you will have trouble setting up the iPhone and viewing over the web, but you will still be able to record and view video through the DVR itself.  Use ZViewer for the iPhone (not sure about Android) and note you need to set up two separate devices inside the app: one for inside your network and one for outside.  I don't think many people realize that the IP settings will be different for internal and external viewing (though the gateway, port, username and other settings will be the same).  I have a Linksys Router with a cable modem.  I did not need my ISP to do anything or call ZModo for tech support, and I did not make any changes to my cable modem.  You will need to set up port forwarding in your router to view over the web.  The documentation is out there on the web (see ZModo's knowledge base), you just have to find the docs and be willing to stay with it.  Also, with the Web Client for EDVS/EDVR software (Internet Explorer through the Web) I have been able to save AVI files for viewing with Windows Media Player. I have not tried it with the USB port through the DVR itself yet, however.I gave this 4 stars because I feel like these systems, while they work fine at what they do, are not for the average user even though they are advertised as such.  They take some know how to set up and if you can't set it up and get it working, it's pretty much useless to you.  Feel free to post questions and I will see if I can help.  I would buy this again, since I know what I am doing.  Good luck!
