I am very happy so far with this set up. The fact that you can talk to people through the camera is a big plus, so that you don't have to open up the door if you don't want to.I like the alarm, which is loud enough to hear when turned all the way up, but not obnoxious. It's a fairly pleasant bleep, bleep sound.The camera does not turn on when there is shadow or tree limb motion, but it does when my cats go through, so that's a good thing. It seems to be able to figure out the difference somehow.Oh, and the set up was fairly painless, once I figured out to turn on the surge protector. :-D The person helping me put the camera up used the enclosed white toothpick looking thing to push in the pairing hole, and it connected right up.The video color is fairly good during the day, there are some adjustments you can make as to how bright you want the picture to be, and the resolution is good enough that you can recognize people. The audio is good enough, so all in all I'm very happy with this set up, for the price. The night vision is just about as good as the day vision, but in black and white which is to be expected with night vision.You have to manually point it where you want it, but if you just want to monitor a certain area that's fine. If you want a camera that you can point in different directions while being inside, this is not the one for you.Note added later: I got more cameras, and discovered that if you have them too close together their signals seem to interfere with each other, leading to the display not working right. I moved the second one further away, and now it's working perfectly. They were right next to each other, pointed in different directions, so I don't know how far you would have to go to not have that problem.
