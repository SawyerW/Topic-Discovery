Overall the camera works great, but don't expect to run too many of these over your wireless network. The problem is there is no way to control how much data the camera sends over your wireless network (unless you want to spend the time setting up QoS on your router) so the cameras will flood your wifi network until there is no bandwidth left for anything else.They cannot use the 5GhZ band, so that means you are stuck using the already crowded 2.4GhZ band which (unless you are using two channels) tops out at 54Mb/s. I live in a suburban area that has free public WiFi so that leaves only 40Mhz (two full non-overlapping channels) for everyone else, which isn't too crowded. If you live in a densely populated area you will be lucky if you can get one of these cameras to run over wireless.The camera's video stream is raw MPEG with no compression, which is why they are such bandwidth hogs. I have three of them and I started out running them wirelessly but because they flooded my 2.4GhZ network to the point where it was unusable by any other device and they fight each other for bandwidth, I ended up running cables to hard wire them. Another thing to keep in mind is that because the network is flooded, sometimes the cameras seem to give up and Blue Iris will loose video. If you read the other reviews on here where people are complaining they have to constantly reset the cameras, most likely their wifi is flooded and the camera cannot maintain the stream. Rebooting the camera will fix it for a brief period. Reducing the resolution or frame rate of the cameras does not seem to decrease their network usage.Overall, I like the cameras but keep in mind that if you have more than one you should probably consider running the CAT 5 cable or your wireless network will likely be unusable.
