I used this web camera for 25 days (as a baby and pet cam) before sending it back to Amazon. It seemed like a nice camera with good features but I just wasn't happy with it's reliability. I have a Mac and found the other Mac reviews here very helpful as far as setup. It was pretty easy to get set up. I was able to get the camera on my wireless network (apple airport extreme), configured the DDNS (Panasonic's viewnetcam.com service), add users and configure settings. I was able to pull up the video on my iPod Touch. Other users could log in and view the video stream and use the pan/tilt/zoom tools, but overall it just wasn't stable.The major issues which caused me to return it were:1. It would be working one minute and then 2 or 3 mins later stop working (light would turn from green to yellow). I'd unplug the camera and then plug it back in and and it would get back on the network. Sometimes it would stay up longer and work OK, other times it would be completely unresponsive from the onset. I just never felt like I could rely on it being up and working, no matter the platform (Mac, Windows, iPod, mobile phone...i tried them all)2. Audio only works on IE (I guess it uses Active-X controls?). I have a mac and i use Firefox and Safari, so this was annoying. I never tried to get the sound to work on a windows PC.3. I never got the camera to work properly with my mobile phone (LG Decoy) or my wife's (Blackberry 8300?).I will note that Panasonic's instructions don't mention anything about setting up with a Mac. The instructions in the Amazon reviews were all I needed though. I never did reach out to customer service (I usually don't for anything unless there are no other options). I'm going to try another web camera--maybe even another Panasonic. I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but this one just wasn't a good fit for me.
