I have several of the more expensive Panasonic POE cams. I got these because the whole set of four, with DVR, is half the price I paid for each of the Panasonic cams... they also have night vision, but lack pan, tilt and zoom. The Swann cams are very easy to install, set up, and use.  I did not even read the manual at all... it simply worked. I was easily able to view the cams within Internet Explorer and via the client software provided by Swann.  I do not suggest that people even bother installing any software on a PC, just use IE.  I have the system hard wired to my home LAN and that worked just by plugging it in.  I have not yet been able to view the cams from over the internet outside my home, but I plan on getting that up and running next.  I did try to download the viewer on my Blackberry, but Swann does not seem to support my model of BB yet.  There is no sound.  The video is average, but not sharp.  Night vision works a bit, but only in a very limited area.  So far it has only been running one day, so I don't have a lot to say yet.  But I do wish I got the model with 8 cams instead of only 4.  Not to have four more of these model cameras, rather, to add some better/more cams on to the 8 cam DVR.  Definitely worth the price.UPDATE:I am easily able to view the cams on my iPad and also outside my home.  I still believe this is worth the price.  I recently upgraded to a 16 camera professional model DVR though... not because there is anything wrong with this model, rather, because I needed more than 4 cams.  In fact, if anyone wants my old one, minus the hard drive and cameras, I'd be happy to give it to them for FREE.  Just send me a message here, you can pay for shipping, and I'll give it to you free.
