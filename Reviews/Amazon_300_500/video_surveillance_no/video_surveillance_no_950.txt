I bought this camera to use as a barn cam to view my cattle while they are calving.  It arrived in good condition and installation was tricky but acceptable for someone with computer/network experience.  The IP Camera Tool software that comes with the camera is useful for obtaining the IP address.  It is necessary to have DHCP enabled on your router for the tool to locate the ip address.  The IPCamClient software that came with the camera is good and allows up to 64 cameras to be attached, and port forwarding to view the camera remotely.  There are only 9 preset positions, but otherwise it works well.  I found an updated software version on the web that worked better than the version on the disk, which seemed to have some glitches.  The picture quality is quite good when there is adequate lighting.  Daytime viewing is in color which is accurate, but night time switches to b/w.  The IR led lights around the housing cast a limited amount of light in total darkness, but seem to help when there are some lights on.  The zoom is a useful feature but could be higher power.  Auto focus, white balance, and iris function are good. PTZ control is good wired but a little jumpy when used wireless.  Once you have your presets set it works well.  I have tried this camera in two locations.  The first was outside mounted on a yard light pole.  Daytime viewing was good, but nighttime was not bright enough.  The second location is in a 40X80 calving barn.  With several lights left on this camera is working well, but in total darkness you will only see shadows up to about 20 ft.  I purchased a Loftek camera after this one because it looked identical and was cheaper, but the picture quality has not been as good.  Overall, this is a good camera for daytime use and with supplemental lighting.  The lens is good quality and the camera seems to be well made.  It has been operating for about a week.  I will update after I have used it for a longer time.
