***UPDATE after 1 month of baby:the camera still works great and has been very useful.  The screen is excellent and controls are pretty intuitive, even late at night.  But I have a few issues I will highlight here:1.  I wish the buttons lit up or had some tactile distinctions--at 4am when my eyes are not focused I cant seem to be able to find the right button to zoom in.2.  It has a pretty wide field of view, but the downward angle is not great.  we have it stuck to the crib post--If baby rolls or is placed right under the camera you cannot angle it downward enough to see him.3.  Screen goes to sleep.  Just FYI, the screen on the handheld portion goes to sleep in about 2 minutes.  you just press a button to re-activate; presumably this is to save battery (see below).  Oddly, it does this even when plugged in.4.  Battery life.  The biggest negative so far is battery life.  I guess I just assumed that the battery would last through the night (especially because the screen goes to "sleep" within 2 minutes).  To my surprise, the battery dies after about 5-6 hours.  I guess its OK, b/c I just moved the charger to my bedstand.  For all practical purposes the battery will last for any nap when Im about the house/yard, but this is disappointing nonetheless.5.  Bonus!  The "walkie talkie" function has been fun to scare grandparents putting baby down for night who didnt know where my voice was coming from.  Try it.  seriously.In the end, I knocked one star off.  Its still great, but not excellent after 1 month of use_____________________________________I did a great deal of research on these things before buying, and this one stood out.  Now I know why: its a great product with some nice features and good build quality.  Its made by an electronics company, not a baby company like some of the competition...thats the first clue.  It works across our house and out on the deck without interference.  Wireless phones, internet, speakers, and all that dont seem to affect it.  The video monitor picks up very well in even complete darkness.  It does have a great microphone as well and has 2way capabilities if you want to talk to your baby (or spouse in another room).the one downside i found is if you bring the monitor into teh room with the camera/microphone, you get nasty feedback.  But I guess why do you need a camera if you're there?  Anyhow, just something I noted on my testing of an otherwise great product
