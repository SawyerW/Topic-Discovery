I chose this system over another I had considered, the Skylink SC-1000 Complete Wireless Alarm System, White. I chose this one for the ability to listen in to the sounds in my house if I was notified of an alarm via cell phone, which is a nice feature for the price. That one also only came with two door/window sensors and this system includes 5, plus an extra key fob, and the Skylink has only one motion detector and this system has two. My package arrived this afternoon and I spent about 45 minutes reading through the instructions and watching some of the videos at the supplied link.A couple of first impressions: one, I appreciated that everything I needed was included. I expected to have to purchase an extra phone cord but one was in the box.  Two, from the graphic on the sales page it didn't appear that any signage/stickers were included that would indicate that the house is protected by an alarm system.  Two large stickers were included in the box, which is great.  Perhaps as a separate sales item on the company website or here on Amazon you could offer an option for a yard sign as well. Any extra deterrence helps.It took about an hour to install the system and with the siren disconnected I opened a door while the system was armed. Within about 30 seconds my cell phone rang and the message I'd recorded was played. Pretty impressive.For those about the install this system, I'd suggest that you switch the arm/disarm notification tone on the main panel from 'chirp', which gives off an obnoxious, jarring little blast from the siren - to beep.While there is a wireless siren available, my only real concern with this unit out of the box is that the siren simply plugs into the main panel. Someone could easily unplug the siren in seconds, and while the call would still go out it's too bad that the siren component could be so quickly disabled.  That's probably a flaw in most of these DIY security systems, however. For the price this is an excellent value and works well.
