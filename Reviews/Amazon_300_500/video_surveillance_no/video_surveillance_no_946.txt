Bought 6 of these cameras, our small business has 5 different sites across the US. Now everyone at each site can see everyone else - this is a perfect solution for us. Researched a lot of cameras before buying this system. They really need to market this camera better.Pros:- They are super easy to set up - no messing with IP addresses, etc. You just need the camera ID and anyone with the camera ID/password can view the camera from the PC, tablet, or smartphone software from anywhere around the world.- Software supports up to 16 cameras on all at once.- Cameras can be deployed in any location around the world with internet access. Tested setup with both ethernet and secured wireless, both work fine.- You can configure each camera (internet bandwidth used, time stamp, etc.) from anywhere around the world- Base camera is relatively inexpensive and can be upgraded with speakers, microSD cards for storage and playback. You don't have to buy anything you don't need.- Camera has both day and night (infrared) mode- Camera doesn't have to be connected to PC to automatically record events (motion capture)- You can record to the microSD card on the camera and also to your PC- No monthly fees as with other IP camera video hosting servicesCons:- Camera has no point tilt zoom- max resolution on camera is not HD (not a problem for use as we set the camera bandwidth to the lowest setting to save on internet bandwidth)- Camera software is still somewhat buggy, still a work in process. Everything works though.Note:- Haven't tested video playback yet, heard there were some problems with finding the correct video playback files as well as with motion capture and recording.But we don't need motion capture and recording. For our purposes this camera is perfect!!!
