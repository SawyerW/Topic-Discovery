We ordered two of these monitors - one for parents and another for grandparents - at the recommendation of a friend who loves her. Unfortunately we don't love ours and the one purchased for the grandparents stopped working on the second use. Below are all the problems we've experienced:- Temperature gauge does not actually work - It consistently says it's 80+ degrees in our son's room which is not true.- Each time you turn the monitor off and back on, it loses the date/time settings.- There is a really annoying sensitivity setting that either beeps or vibrates constantly. You can't actually use this setting because it would be going off all night long for no reason.- There is no way to turn the picture off but keep the sound on in order to preserve battery life. We'd like to be able to hear our son while we're sleeping at night but obviously don't need the picture because our eyes are closed. But there is no way to shut the picture off while keeping the sound on. This means the battery dies quickly so we have to keep the monitor plugged in all night long. And the picture is so bright in a dark bedroom that we have to cover it or place it face down so it doesn't light up our entire room.The picture is great and you can literally hear every breath our son takes so the audio is great too. However, there are too many downsides to this monitor for me to recommend it for the insanely high price.The one we bought for my parents (our son's grandparents) stopped working on the second use. It made a high pitched screeching sound and had a fuzzy screen so we were stuck with no monitor for a night when our son was sleeping in a strange place. We are returning this one and will not be buying another one.I would recommend another brand because this one is not worth the money.
