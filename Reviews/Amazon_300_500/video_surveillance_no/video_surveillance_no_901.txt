I had IPCam up in 15 min.  The booklet nor the CD software tells you to connect cam to your local network with a wire on a 192.168.1.x network.  I notice on the box the box the IPCam had a 192.168.1.126 IP which would cause a problem of my network as it was set to 10.0.0.x.  Once I set my laptop to the 192.168.1.2 I was able to configure the IPCam to my network with a static IP of 10.0.0.126.Now after configuring the IPCam to your network you can log into the Cam to setup the wireless configuration which is not in the book clearly.After you are able to log into the IPCam, look for the wireless section and their should be a button to search for network.  Your network and others should pop up.  Choose yours network name and enter your security key or paraphrase.Once this is done the IPcam will reboot and take up to 5 min to restart then you should be able to connect wirelessly and control it.I received my unit March 31, 2012 I must say I think the unit on is great for the price!  Like i said I had mine up in 15 min and it has not dropped a connection so far. I connect to it directly and using Blue Iris which I am considering also.If you are going to view from the internet; you need to make sure you configure you Port Forwarding setting in your router or you will not be able to view from the Internet.I view from my BlackBerry Torch, Iphone, Laptop, and my wife uses her Andriod phone and laptop.Also, I put the IPcam on a battery Backup so it will not drop the connection if the power goes out.  I will still be recording at all times.  Good LuckI think for the price you can't wrong with this product.
