Overall I really enjoy this product. It is very lightweight like others say, but I have found that never to be an issue. It allows me to see my baby clearly. I have taken it with us on multiple trips. At home the camera sits on a shelf in our baby's room. When we travel I usually find another shelf to put it on next to the pac n play, or I use clear packing tape to tape it somewhere.At night, the monitor would come on when there was any noise (even a dog barking outside) and it would wake me up thinking our baby was awake. The only way for us to remedy this to a way that allowed us to sleep without thinking our baby woke up was to keep it on the setting where it is on all night long. I leave it plugged in during the nighttime and keep it on all night. That way I don't hear it turning on and off and it waking me up. I keep it at a volume that I can hear if our baby wakes up, but also that allows me to sleep. Our baby has a white noise maker so I hear that noise from the monitor, but it is masked by the white noise maker we have in our own room. Interesting setup but it works well for us!After about 9 months of use, the cord that plugged into the monitor got a small tear in it, exposing some wires. I contacted Infant Optics and immediately they responded to me, and shipped me a new cord at no cost. Their customer service is exceptional.I am pleased with this monitor. It allows for me to have peace of mind to check in and see how my baby is doing, and the cost is a great value!
