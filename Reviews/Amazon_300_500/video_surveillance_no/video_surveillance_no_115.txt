The packaging was very nice and easy to open. I especially liked the quick setup page, however did read the full instructions prior to initial use.The monitor was easy to set up and was already in sync with the receiver.The cord to the monitor and receiver chargers seem to be a little on the short side, especially since my crib does not share a wall with an outlet.The receiver had to be muted when I was adjusting the camera because it makes a horrible squealing noise if you get the two too close together, meaning in the same room. However, when the volume is muted the noise goes away.For the price of what you would pay for a monitor like this, I wish there was a way to remotely adjust the camera from the receiver. When toddler gets out of bed there was no way to adjust the camera remotely, and no way of telling where she went.The picture quality is great during daytime mode, ok at night. If baby gets too close to the camera at night it gets all blurry and you get a reflection flash in her eyes.For the volume settings, there are 4, but I wish it were more variable or more settings. With one setting we have to listen to her ceiling fan squeak all night in order to hear her if she wakes up, but if we turn it down to not hear the fan we cant hear the baby either.I like it that you can take pictures and put them on the computer, however the mini SD card is hard to remove, and when you upload the pictures they become inverted.Overall I am happy with the camera, and although I would like to see a few minor changes, would recommend the product to friends.
