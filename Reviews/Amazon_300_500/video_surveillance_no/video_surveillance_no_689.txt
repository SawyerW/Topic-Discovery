PRODUCT: THREE STARSAssuming that we get the two damaged cameras back with no further problems (see customer service), the system is not bad deal overall, but not really a great deal either. The set up instructions are clear and the included wiring is enough for what most people will need. The software is a bit clunky and we are still playing around with it, it works albeit less cleanly than you'd like. Reviewing video is a chore unless you have a specific time in mind. The cameras appear to be an older model camera. The ones that are not defective seem to work fine. If all of the cameras had come in working properly, it would be closer to a 3.5 star system.CUSTOMER SERVICE: INCOMPLETE (BUT SO FAR DISAPPOINTING)We tested all of the wires and equipment before running any wires. Which was a good thing since one of the cameras was DOA. So we contacted customer service to set up a replacement.(The instructions clearly tell you not to return to the store, but to contact customer service-I now which we had just re-boxed and done a return through Amazon.) They told us they would send us an RMA to return the defective camera, and to go ahead and set up the others. So we did.We had to call them back to get an RMA because they didn't send one as promised. Then when we took it in to get it returned and realized they didn't give us a shipping label. Upon further review they require that the Buyer pays for return shipping until it is 'proven' that you bought the item less than 30 days ago. Just as we get ready to send it in, a second camera fails. So now we are down 2 out of three. We are now past the 30 days and still have not received the replacements.
