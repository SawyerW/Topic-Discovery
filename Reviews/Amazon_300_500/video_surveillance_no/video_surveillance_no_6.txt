UPDATE - I lowered rating to 2 stars. I would not buy this again. Mine worked well until the first set of batteries were down, exactly five days after my Amazon deadline to return it! The sensor and receiver lights still come on but the alarm no longer works making it useless! Mine worked well as a motion alarm until the sound quit. This is not a quality made product. I'm going to try the more expensive one made by another company.I call this motion sensor system a limited good value buy due to its downfalls that despite the low price will be a deal breaker for many people. I'm a gadget guy and I'm budget minded in that I practice money management. I let go of my money at least as hard as it is to get it.To save a penny or two, someone (not "they" or the "company") decided to broaden acceptable manufacturing specs such that the motion sensor is enough out of round on both ends that a light wind will cause it to rotate and set off the Chimes.To hype sensor sensitivity or save a penny by using the most common off the shelf 180 degree sensor, usefulness is  reduced.I've been experimenting with this unit since I got it to see what exactly I can do with it. People can walk across my driveway on the sidewalk & not activate the chime but a car, SUV.or truck passing by the same way on the street sets it off every time.What many people want is a more focused sensor like mall stores had to compensate for having a wide open door way. More like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through. Like it is with hearing aids, the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution. The Chinese have a less MBA notion of profit. Guess I'll have to search Chinese retailers for the inexpensive, low energy, feature rich security sensor  digital revolution technology makes possible.
