I love this monitor. It has a great range to pan around. It has a big screen so I can easily see what my child is doing. It is portable although the battery life is not great. However I always leave the video on so if you turned it off and just used sound the battery would probably last longer. It allows you to talk to baby which is a great feature. It even plays music remotely although my child is not a fan. It tells the temperature in the room alsoThis is expensive but so far well worth the price. I don't know how we lived without a video monitor before this!!!UPDATED 2/3/14On 1/8/14 the speaker on my monitor went out. It didn't gradually go out. It just went out. This monitor was only a little over 6 months old. I spent almost 2 hours on hold with Motorola. They do not have any other means of contacting them- just to wait on hold on the phone. I finally spoke with Walter who said a new monitor would be arriving in 7-10 business days. I asked for it to be sent faster as I no longer have sound to hear my baby. I was told they were back ordered so that was not possible. HOWEVER amazon is still selling them so apparently they are only back ordered for replacements not for people who are paying the $250!After 11 business days I had not received the monitor so I called. I was sent to an answering service, told their office was closed, and I would be called back in 24 hours. I received no return call.I called this morning, almost a month after my first call, and was told they were having phone problems and I would be called back today.This was a great monitor when it worked, but If I cannot hear my child crying then it is useless. I am incredibly disappointed that it worked less than 7 months and I am even more disappointed that Motorola cannot get me a replacement in a timely fashion.
