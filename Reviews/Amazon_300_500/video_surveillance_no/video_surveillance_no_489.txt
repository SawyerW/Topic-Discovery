This camera has been up an running for about 4 months now pointing at our back door.  It has been sending me an 3MB avi video file attached to an email every time motion is detected in the sections that I asked it to monitor as well as 2nd email without an attachment to a different email just to say that motion detection has been triggered (for a faster response time).  I am using the web-interface built into the camera for the video file and MyDLink for the other email. It is connected wirelessly.  So far, only once have I had to unplug it and plug it back in again to get it working again.  It is working exactly as it should.  MyDlink for Android has been able to access the camera just fine.  Day and Night mode both work just as expected.My reason for only 3 star lies mostly in it's fidelity.I can tell who is coming and going only because I know everyone coming thru that door so far, however if a stranger were to decide to enter, I doubt the resolution would be of very much help in identifying that person.  However, if I HAPPEN to check email when I know that no one should be home and it HAPPENED to not be a false alarm, I could call the police immediately and catch them in the act, in theory.On the flip side If it were a full HD camera, these video files would be HUGE.I get much the same effect, but Full HD, with our webcam using BlueIris, but that would need to remain within USB cable length from the computer.The other annoying factor is the motion detection sensivitity.  I am getting a lot of false positives even tho sensitivity is set currently at 25% -- mostly it is changes in sunlight intensity or the neighbor's floodlight.  I also seem to be only getting an email about 90% to 95% of the time I know there was movement.
