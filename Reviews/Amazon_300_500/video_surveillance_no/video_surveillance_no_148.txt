I decided to order two 700e after having a 750e using POE for two weeks.  One unit was dead on arrival (when you 1st power it, the two red LEDs are on during daylight and they go off and the red motion LED and the LED next to microphone come on) and this routine didn't happen (the unit was also extremely hot to touch).  The 2nd unit worked fine during daylight but at night it looked like having something in front of its lens (or maybe the two red LEDs weren't putting out enough light), so the picture was not clear compared to my 750e.  I called the Logitech tech support few times and they were useless.I shipped the two units back separately for replacement.  3rd unit came back with the same night vision issue, then I got a 4th unit which behaved like the 1st unit (DOA).  I am now waiting for more replacements.Logitech software is extremely poorly written.  It takes the Commander 1-2 hours to download the videos captured in last 24 hours. The Commander also downloads the most recent videos first. This means that if I want to look at the videos from 23 hours ago, I have to wait for the Commander to download the most recent videos first, from the past 22 hours. In addition, during playback, it doesn't jump over blank areas and it counts the seconds down from one video-to-blank area-to-another-video (extremely stupid and wasting user's time). I like the wide angle lens, colors, and the idea behind the SD card but it should also allow saving automatically to a NAS or a FTP server (or let user to access the SD card via a file manager).  Overall, I still recommend this camera over my other IP cameras (Panasonic and Sharx).  If you are buying this camera for security purposes, then the face recognition range is about 20 feet during daylight and about 10 feet at night.
