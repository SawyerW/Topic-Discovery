I bought two of these, one for the front door, and one for the back door, and they both run off of the same frequency, which I didn't like at first, but, it turned out that I would rather that they did afterall.  I mounted one of the receivers on the stair railing upstairs, and the other one, I use downstairs, and I can move it around if I need to.  I was using them so I would know if anyone was on the front or back porches in the night when I would be upstairs or asleep, because you can't hear anything when you're upstairs, especially with the t.v. or A/C running.I was having a problem with the alarms going off in the morning when the sun hit them, and when it got especially hot outside.  I just need to figure out a better placement for them.  I turn them off in the daytime when I wake up, of course because of the false alarms from the heat, and running in and out all day, you get tired of hearing the alarms.  I like them, because they're portable, since they run off of batteries, because when I bought them, I thought that you had to plug the receiver into the wall socket. I can take the reciever to different rooms in the house, and they're helpful if you're expecting someone, you can tell when they arrive since I don't have a doorbell, and I can never hear when someone knocks on the door.I bought them, because there have been a lot of break-ins in my neighborhood lately, and I don't really want to pay for, or have the money for a security system, and although it's not a state of the art security system, it does give you a layer of protection, by taking away the element of being suprised, and you just have to have a plan on how you're going to deal with the situation, if it ever does happen.When I leave for work, I leave one of the receivers by the door, the alarm is loud enough that you can hear it outside through the door, and it has a red light that goes off that you can see through the curtains, so hopefully that will be enough to deter someone from breaking in if they hear it.  For what it's worth, they serve their purpose and I'm getting just about what I want and need from them.
