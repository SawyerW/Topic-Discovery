This camera has not received a fair review so far, partly because it is Samsung brand and Android technology which Apple users love to flog. They also compare this with professional grade IP Cams which cost several hundred more.Here are the facts about features:1. Works in WiFi or Wired mode2. Uploads private video to YouTube and images via Picasa to Google+This is good as no disk space is used, no CPU hogging and from safety perspective. (What if your PC is stolen along with the camera?)Many people have raised security questions about this. However, these postings are private, in fact people have made them public and are proudly sharing. Just search Motion Detection on YouTube.3. Your router password is stored by Samsung. (Is that a big deal?)4. Two way talking works like walkie-talkie. The voice quality is very clear from the speakers at the back of camera. You need to press an icon to speak and release to listen. But, cannot do both at the same time.5. Requires Samsung Techwin plug-in. You may have trouble watching in your own web browser. Try to update to latest dot NET for Microsoft PC's. Despite that I still cannot see video on my PC but on Laptop I can. That does not preclude you from managing the camera.6. WiFI connection drops.It does if WiFi or Camera has a glitch but usually reconnects in an hour or so.7. Video quality640x480 at 30fps under ideal conditions, frame rate drops but video quality is still very good compared to competitors.See my video at:[...]7. Night visonThis is awesome. I have not seen any camera coming close to this.8. InstallationSamsung could have made this simpler. Installation is not intuitive and frustrating. Requires 3 passwords: to log in, manage camera, manage camera remotely.9. Pan & ScanNot available.9. Over allGood bang for your buck. You may want to consider D-Link DCS-932L or Lorex especially dome shaped with Pan&Scan; and antenna. Be prepared to shell-out extra bucks for these features.
