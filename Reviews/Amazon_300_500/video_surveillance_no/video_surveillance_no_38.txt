I have to say it less than perfect but does work the majority of the time.  It is just so frustrating that no one else makes these in a high quality design!  Schlage claims it can't be done for residential stuff due to poor alignment of so many deadbolt installations and the amount of force needed to through the bolt. I say that is hogwash! If this company can make one that pretty much works most of the time and sell it for peanuts then I KNOW it can be designed with a larger housing inside, stronger motor, more battery, and/or more reduction ratio or whatever the term is so that the same amount of force is multiplied only slower ...like 1st gear on a 10 speed bike rather than 5th gear for instance ...yes it already is kinda slow and it would be slower still but have mor ummph!  So a company like Schlage or kwikset or Baldwin or whoever is without excuse! It could be done absolutely and we could also have the keypad and cel phone/ PC interface to provide access to someone even though we are accross the country etc etc.  The big guys have these bells and whistles but they cant even give you a motor like this company did! People that have the Schlage for instance can only go though Schlage web site to allow someone to turn the bolt manually RIGHT NOW THIS SECOND to unlock the door, and then all over again to RELOCK it! That has to be a nightmare! Oh I know if we wanted to shell out thousands of dollars we could have commercial stuff installed but I am talking about real world homeowner two hundred buck maximumish ...this is state of the art, like it or not ...at least they make the effort and it helps some of us.
