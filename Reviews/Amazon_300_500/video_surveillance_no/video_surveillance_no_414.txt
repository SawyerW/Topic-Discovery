The first reviewer posted a couple of the same complaints I have with the product, and a couple I don't.  So here goes:Complaints:(1) The website is slowish, but that's forgivable. Just a minor nuisance.(2) The email function (sends captured video - noise and motion - to your email) is too complicated to set up.  It requires your email address and password, along with other information that I cannot find and really just don't know what it is.  Thus, my videos are uploaded to YouTube as private. Which works too, but I would like e-mail notifications and not just phone notifications.(3) The YouTube upload also requires your username and password.  As the other reviewer said, why are we giving out our passwords to strangers???(4) If the camera detects motion/sound, it captures a 30 seconds clip about 1-2 minutes apart.  You cannot view more than 30 seconds of previously recorded video or combine multiple 30 second clips to view one continuous video. There is no function in which you can go back in time to view continuous video beyond motion/sound detected in 30 second intervals, 1-2 minutes apart.(5) The camera should be $99. Just my opinion.Pros:(1) The website is easy to navigate, except for setting up your e-mail notification as I mentioned in (2) above. Otherwise, the site is fairly simple.(2) For the price, the video quality is good. It has good color and night vision.(3) The phone app is handy and works for me (Motorola Droid Bionic). Motion and sound notification are sent to your phone. Again, see (2) in complaints regarding email notifications.(4) The YouTube function is handy and the videos are uploaded as private.(5) You can log on to the Samsung website or the phone app and view live video.  (This is the only way to view video beyond 30 second intervals.)
