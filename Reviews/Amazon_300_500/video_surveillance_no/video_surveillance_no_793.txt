This is a great video monitor.  The video is very clear and the night vision works really well.  The pan/tilt is an awesome feature.  The zoom is nice but it appears to be just a digital zoom so it's usefulness is so-so.  I can see the baby breathe through this monitor which is really nice though.  The microphone and lullabies are nice to have but I rarely have used them so far.  The sound can be turned all the way off or turned up in small increments.  It is VERY sensitive when turned up high, so that could be advantageous if you happen to want to hear every little noise.  The lights along the top indicate how loud the sound actually is in the room so you know what the noise level is even if you have the audio turned off.  The wireless range is excellent, I have three floors at my house and it works everywhere.  I can even take it out into the back yard. Haven't experienced any issues with WiFi interference except to say that if the monitor is very close to a computer or smartphone the audio might blip temporarily if there is a large data transfer (like a webpage loading).  Just move the monitor a few feet away if that happens and the issue disappears.  Overall the monitor does everything I expect it to quite well so I am totally pleased.*UpdateOne minor complaint that I did find about this unit is the volume sensitivity.  The microphone is very sensitive as I mentioned above, so much so that on the lowest volume setting you actually may hear more than you want to.  I had wanted to turn it low enough that I didn't hear stirring or small noises and only heard crying, but on the lowest level I can still hear all the noises baby makes.  I'm a light sleeper so if I have it next to the bed then pretty much every noise wakes me up.  A minor thing worth noting.
