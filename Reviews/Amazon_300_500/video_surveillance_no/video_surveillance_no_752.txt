The product is disappointing for the price and the customer service is extra disappointing.  I am home alone with two small children and it is very frustrating that I bought what was supposed to be a top-of-the-line product and it continues to break down. I have had to call in 5 times now to get a replacement and I've only had it 9 months. Sometimes the sound just stops working, other times it will no longer charge. I take perfect care of them -- it is either on my nightstand or the kitchen counter, and had never been dropped, spilled on, anything. Today makes the third day in a row that I've had to call and follow up because a replacement never came even after I called and reported the problem. I keep having to leave a voicemail because they're "experiencing higher than normal call volume".  They say they'll call back within 24 hours and that definitely doesn't happen.  I'm very disappointed in this whole experience. It's been 15 days now since I called in this most recent one and still do not have a replacement. Personally, I feel like they should be shipped overnight when it's an obvious manufacturer problem. I paid good money for a product I hardly get to use...I would hate to add up how many days I've been without a monitor from the 5 different times I've had to ask for a replacement. Of the 5 times I've had to get a replacement, this is twice now that they don't even send one out on time.  It always takes at least a week for it to come even if they do send it when they say they will.  We have a 3 level home and without a functioning monitor that means I have to stay where the kids are when they are sleeping instead of being able to get things done around the house. I'm very disappointed with this product and Motorola's customer service for this product.
