After having my Summer Infant Bestview Handheld 2.5 monitor for 3 years, the power cord on the handheld unit broke or the connector in the handheld unit broke, don't know which it is.  This is the second time it's happened this year, so it was time for a change.After reading the reviews on the Motorola versus the Summer Infant's newest model, I was torn.  Summer Infant did better than I had expected, so even though I had cord problems in the end, I was happy with the product overall.I was a little afraid of some of the "cons" that some reviewers mentioned.  We've had it about a week now, and it's been great!  I have had no problems trying to maneuver my way around the menu/buttons (volume, display on/off, changing cameras) at night.  I think it would be a benefit if Motorola found a way to have these buttons backlit, but so far, I've had no problem.  I was concerned that you can't mute the volume because we have white-noise machines in our kids' rooms, but this monitor only seems to pick up the noise coming from the kids.  I can hear the white noise, but it's dull and in the background.The video during the day is great!  The video at night is similar to my old camera.  It's a video monitor, I'm not looking for HD quality, so it's what I expected it to be.I love that I can tell my son to get back in his bed without having to go into his room.  It also gives my husband and I a giggle watching our son's reaction to us catching him!So glad I decided to go with this monitor.  Besides, if it does end up being a piece of junk, I bought it with Amazon's 365-day return, so I can return it and try the Summers Infant.  But right now, I'm a happy mama.
