To start off, let me tell you my credibility:I have a B.S. in computer science with an emphasis of networkingI own a small business that is related to this fieldPros:Features/Price of the unit: for a unit with this many features, the cost ratio is very low.Easy of set upCons:Noise:This unit is loud; contrary to some reviews here, this unit makes a lot of noise. If this unit is in a storage closet, this is not an issue, however, I installed this unit in a quarters where there are living occupants and they can notice the difference from their prior QSee unit. The cheap fans are the cause of this and they had to be replaced to accommodate their needs.Build Quality:The casing is a flimsy piece of sheet metal which was not a concern for me (as a supplier and for the consumer) since the unit is going to be stationary for the entirety of its life, however, this may be a concern for some.User Manual:This is essentially worthless. The manual is written in elementary school English and contains many mistakes. You will learn more by "toying" with the unit than reading the manual.The unit buttons:The buttons on the unit are annoying. after about 30 seconds of navigating the user interface on the unit will make you appreciate the remote control. The unit makes a very obnoxious sound when buttons are pressed on the actual dvr. Fortunately, this sound is not made when the remote is used.Overall:I would recommend this unit if:Either the fans were replaced or it is stored in a location where noise wouldn't matter.If you are looking for a low cost to performance ratioOther Thoughts:This unit does not come with a hard drive. I used a 3.5 inch desktop drive, however, I had to install it sideways in the unit due to space limitations; if you are planning on installing more than one drive, I would recommend purchasing 2.5 inch laptop drives.
