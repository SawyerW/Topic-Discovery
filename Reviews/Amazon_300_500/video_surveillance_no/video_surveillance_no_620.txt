When I ordered this from Vine I wasn't sure what I was getting my husband into since he does the drilling duties etc. and i am definitely not into ladders. As it turned out, we both read the instructions and they were easy to follow. Written in plain english, everything made sense and was not even remotely confusing. I connected  this to my flat screen through the HDMI port. We planned where the cameras would be mounted. I observed and handed him tools,etc. while my husband attached all the cameras in strategic places around the house again following the manufacturer's easy to follow instructions.The DVR is unobtrusive and slides in easily with all the other home electronics. It is also super quiet. When we were ready to test this out we set up an iPad, iPhone, and computer to access the DVR via softwear provided by Q-SEE. The pan and tilt camera is easy to use and provides great coverage. Ditto for the bullet cameras provided.The night vision capability of the cameras offers a clear picture without additional light sources. Overall, I am impressed by the Q-See's modest price given its performance. It does what you want a home monitoring system to do without costing big bucks. Whether you are monitoring your home for theft, covering the nanny or babsitter's activities, or checking up on the teenagers, this is a great way to know what's happening. While I have a professional home monitoring system which I pay a monthly fee for, this unit is a welcome addition for extra protection.My only gripe is that my home is on the large size at 2600 sq. feet so I wish this particular configuration came with more cameras. I am thinking of looking into buying additional cameras to cover the upstair areas. This particular configuration as is would probably be better in a smaller home that covers one floor and less overall space.
