I Received zmodo 8 channel camera quickly from wennow. Amazon shipping took too long. I did a lot of research around and finally decided on this security camera system because it has 4+ star rating. The previous reviews were positive about this product. The setup is easy and it is ready to be used out of the box. For 8 camera system, 300 dollars are very good price, compare to the same system which will cost around 600 dollars.  I installed this system in my little shop. The camera quality is good, works ok during the day. The camera works best when the object of recording is within 5 to 10 feet range in a bright setting. It is not that clear for anything 20 feet away. Maybe the outline of the object is clear but you will not be able to tell the license plate number more than 20 feet. The night vision works better if a illuminating light source is used at the same time. For the price of this system, the image quality is acceptable. This system can be used as baby monitor. For its value, it can beat other baby monitor products valued at 200 dollars.  I will give is system 5 stars only if the network setup can be easier. The system didn't have detailed network setup instruction. The Manuel contain little information on how to use this system. It is very difficult to setup the network if you just looking at the Manuel and doing tons of research online. For beginners if you like to view your camera from you computer over the same network, you need to install the software from the small disc and do the ip configuration too. There is a more detailed instruction from YouTube which tells you how to setup the network locally. I gave up the wireless network setup because it is beyond the ability of a college graduate. There is no instruction on that anywhere in the package.  Anyway, it is a good system for its value and the network setup instruction sucks!
