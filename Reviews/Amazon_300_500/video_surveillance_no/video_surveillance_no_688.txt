I bought this system about 4 months ago.  It was to replace the latest in my attempt to be cheap for a system, Harbor Freight was my latest system of disaster.  These cameras and DVR unit are far Superior, have simplistic straight forward setups and are very feature rich.  The fact the camera angles are 62 degrees is more than a plus.  If they don't tell you what the field of view is, just keep on looking because most are around 34 degrees and are horrible for view and color/contrast.  These cameras are easy to install or can be professionally installed by Swann contractors. The DVR has yet to have a glitch and has been running on top of a hot Cable box the whole time.  IR distance is 65+ feet which is great since most cameras are mounted under the second story eve. Greens are green, blues are blue, reds are red and my dog is not a pixel shadow creature any more.Update 2/20/13Not a single issue to date and the system has been on 24x7 for almost two years.  I have a UPS on the system and it's never been unplugged.  Camera optics are just as clear as day one.  I have had to remove some spider webs 3x over this period.  Upon my inspection I have noticed the black housing has turned a golden color.  No pitting or rust but like shiny brass underneath.  I live in the Midwest were we get some pretty crappy weather and wind.  These cameras are in the full elements or rain, ice, snow and direct sun. Mounts have held firm for all this time and that's incredibly important as I would have to drag out a 32' 100lb ladder.  I check the system 10-15 times a day just to see my dog, front door, back door, fence gates and driveway.
