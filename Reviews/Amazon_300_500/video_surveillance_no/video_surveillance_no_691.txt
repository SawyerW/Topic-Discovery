I should have listened to the 1 and 2 star reviews.1- camera quality is horrid. This is not at all what they were selling based on what I read. My old cell phone camera had ten times better resolution and clarity. In my house, brightened room, was fuly grainy and looked like 1980s low quality video.2- Although they say it is for outside and inside use, the camera attachments are not rated for outside and the elements at all. I would imagine putting these outside would require replacements fast (south florida, lots of humidity and rain). I was going to use these outside. Not able to do that.3- software is rather ancient looking and feeling.4- backup is available...not through the ethernet cable....not through an external drive...but ONLY allowed with a USB flash drive. Right. I am going to get my 64gb flash drive and start manually moving 500gb worth of vids..5- manually move vids...yep..gotta pick one and select to backup to your usb flash drive. This would be awesome in 1997. Too bad it is 2013 where most devices use ethernet, wireles, or allow a huge drive, like a 3TB, to be connected for back ups.6- That is as far as I got. Once I reread all the issues about no support and inability to get repairs...I realized this unit would be heading to the garbage bin in 6 months. And due to the poor pic quality would be nothing more than a novelty to show visitors (who wish they would be able to see themselves more clearly in the vids).All in all, I am glad for the other reviews making my mind up to return this. It seems like an older type of system dressed up as a new vibrant state of the art. It is not (in my own opinion).Will move on to other items.
