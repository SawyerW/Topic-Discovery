We bought this to replace our mobi that constantly had battery issues, charging issues, etc.The samsung feels and looks like a very nice, heavy duty monitor with lots of features, butTemp : way off. Max of 10 degrees, sometimes as little as 4 degrees. Always on the high sideSensitivity alarm : No way to turn off the alarm. You can adjust the sensitivity from the camera but not mute the resulting alarm from the monitor. Basically this becomes an annoyance and you will turn the sensitivity all the way down, yet still get some random beeps when baby is sleeping and no sounds in room.Auto mute : Best I can tell this is intertwined with the sensitivity of the camera. Since you have to turn down sensitivity all the way to rid yourself of the annoying beeping (or vibrating), automute stays on short of a tornado warning in the room.Skype : If you have a computer on, monitor connected to computer, computer logged into skype and set to auto answer,  external camera selected as the video unit within skype ... then you can call said computer and SEE your baby. no voice supported either way. kinda gimmickyScreen - Large screen is great in the house, brightness is lacking outside on a cloudy day. To adjust the brightness you must enter the menu. Not a big deal in my book, just one extra step.Range - Works great in my house and yard. Cuts out in the exact same spot as the mobi did. I assume they all get the same range being on the same frequency, etc.In summary, it is almost a great unit. I would definitely recommend it on build quality over other $150 monitors. With that said we will be returning and buying the motorola. If Samsung fixes the annoyances in a future model, it would be the one to buy.
