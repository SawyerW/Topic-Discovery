We bought this monitor for our toddler when she transitioned to her big girl bed. Being able to see her seemed important to know whether she was staying in the bed or had crawled or fallen out. She also sometimes cries out in the night but very quickly puts herself back to sleep so seeing her on the video allows us to judge whether we need to go into her room or whether she is fine on her own.I did not want to pay $250+ for a video monitor so I opted for this version after reading many reviews online. You get what you pay for, and this is one of the more inexpensive options in video baby monitors. The reviews that say that this monitor has a cheap, plastic feel are absolutely correct. I worry a little about the stand on the receiver snapping off. This version has a VOX mode, which allows the monitor to go to sleep when there has been no sound above a certain decibel for 3 minutes. I really appreciate that feature because it means that we don't have to contend with the light from the screen in our bedroom at night. HOWEVER, we have found that the monitor does not always wake up from VOX mode when our toddler cries. The battery life is also very short. We absolutely have to keep the monitor plugged in overnight.The night vision is blurry but adequate for our toddler. We can tell if she's lying down in bed, sitting up, or out of the bed, and that's about all we care about at this point. If you really feel like you need to see more detail than that, buy a better monitor.Overall, I don't regret buying this model. If our daughter were younger, I would have bought something more reliable, with clearer night vision, and a sturdier build with a couple of receivers (one for upstairs and one for downstairs), but at this point, she is mostly beyond needing to be monitored.When our daughter was an infant, we used the Sony Baby Call (no video), and that worked fine for us. Great battery life and long range.
