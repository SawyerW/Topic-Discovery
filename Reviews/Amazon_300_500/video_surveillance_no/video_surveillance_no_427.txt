I bought 2 of these for my home security to be used with a Uverse 2wire router. Setup was easy per the instructions. Picture quality is very good in good light but night vision is only fair with difficulty in recognizing people/objects beyond about 10 feet. There are several Utube videos about setting the camera up for motion detection, email alerts and remote viewing. I spent several days on remote viewing setup unsuccessfully until I added static IP through my ISP. Now that works fine, but I still haven't got the motion detection/email alert to work yet. Wireless coverage has been good throughout my home and garage. I tried 3 apps for my iPad/Iphone and IP Cam viewer works best for me. Foscam includes a builtin DDNS address for each camera which I ended up using for remote viewing instead of a third party address.As a baby/pet monitor this camera would work fine either in home or remote (once you get it setup). For surveillance detection alerts, I'm looking at other software solutions (i.e. Vitamin D) if I can't get the Foscam email alerts to work for me. If you're not an IT professional be prepared to spend a lot of time getting familiar with your router and port forwarding. When my ISP (ATT) sent someone out to set up the static IP, he had to call tech support to walk him through it. Even had to wait on hold like everyone else.I would recommend the FI8921 camera as a good DIY alternative to an expensive wired professionally installed surveillance system. Amazon service was excellent as always. Be sure your camera has the latest firmware (Feb) as mine didn't.EDIT:  8/30/13Both cameras quit working after a very brief power outage. Foscam community forum indicates this is a common problem with no ready solution. If yours are still working - great. I will replace with wired IP cameras of much better quality.
