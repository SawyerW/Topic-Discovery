It took some time to find exactly what I needed and fortunately this little gadget fit the bill precisely.It works exactly as described. It's early days yet - but it seems to be robust and well made to last a long time.The short videos it creates are time stamped - which is what I was looking for - and can view something in absolute darkness.The videos are a bit over exposed as they need to be to catch the tiniest of light sources. I don't intend to do anythingexcept keep track of animal movements at night - so the videos are just fine for me.The instructions are clear. But, they tend to assume that the reader is completely aware of what they are referring to.In order to set the time and date stamp (which works very well) you need to create a small .txt file and transfer it intothe folder of the camera.For those confused by this - on a Windows machine (sorry can't speak to what is needed on Macs, . .) in the 'Accessories'folder in the programs of the Start Menu, you should find 'Notepad'. This is what you would use to create the .txt file with thecurrent date & time. (The text you type in and save is completely spelled out in the instructions, . . .)Once created and saved - you drag and drop it into the camera folder after you have connected the camera to ]your pc. That's all there is to it.One note - this may be tripping up some trying to set the time and date - The time that needs to be set is based on a24 hour clock (which most of the world uses, . .) as opposed to a 12 hour clock that we use in the States. So 5PM iswritten as 17:00.  This may be one of the reasons setting the time hasn't worked for others.
