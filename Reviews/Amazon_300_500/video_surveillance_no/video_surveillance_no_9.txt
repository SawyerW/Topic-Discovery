I Bought one to signal to receiver unit near the front door so it works when someone is walking up.  Sunlight makes it go off. A little squirrel made it go off one day. I went back and bought two more of them. Now I have one on a tree in my yard, One on railing steps down to my house and one pointed at my garage door.  I put one of the three receivers in my front window on the inside, out of the rain and another one inside the garage hanging on a previous nail in the wall.  When two chimes go off, I know someone of my family has left the house and is going into the garage.  The mailman never sneaks up on me anymore. People visiting in small Golf carts alert me in the driveway (tree) and when they start down the steps.  By having three of these cheap transmitters I can figure out from what goes off, the person(s) coming to see me even when I am in the back of the house. One caveat though.  Be sure to buy the extra $15 power supply (costs as much as the device, huh?) because the 3 "C" batteries do not last a week in use. AND I put only the one INSIDE the house on a timer so it cannot wake me at night. Dumb, but I sleep well.  It cuts on at 7am, off at midnight. The garage is on all night and day.I may buy another one to put somewhere else.  If I was going to rob my house and I heard all this on the outside I may decide to go somewhere else like on the edge of the house, I would figure if they had this much crap going on they have a house detector as well.  And they would be right, ...because I do. Over all rating Thumbs up.  Not five stars because of the range, but, hey, it's only a $15 item.
