After reading reviews on Amazon and other sites I ordered this video monitor delivered to my home in Mexico. It costs about 30% more after shipping+import fees but there are only two or three flimsy video monitors available here so I opted for one with better features and quality.The package arrived in good conditions within 3 days with AmazonGlobal Expedited Shipping, and it shipped earlier than I expected.I have not yet installed this camera in our nursery (baby still sleeps besides our bed) but I am satisfied with the audio quality and night vision mode. For normal video quality (color mode) the image is not as crisp as I thought it would be but then again Motorola never promised full HD or retina display for this product, right? I opted for a camera monitor with a display after reading all the connectivity issues with wi-fi monitors (I had considered those to use with my iphone) and I think I made the right choice since it is fairly simple to use and I don't have to worry about synching issues or the iphone app closing on me during the night. Both the handheld display and the camera look robust and I believe the rechargeable battery included can eventually be replaced. I'll update this after using it a bit longer.Pros:Looks solidSimple to useNight vision mode is good (can't use it from too far though)Display runs on batteries and chargerOffers 5 lullabies that you can turn on remotelyCons:Normal camera mode not exactly high definition. If you want better image quality you need a LOT of light. Night vision mode kicks in automatically.Also, it offers two zoom levels or settings: 1x and 2x. It is definitely not a security surveillance camera, so keep in mind you won't be able to place it too far from your basinet (watch for the cord on the camera).
