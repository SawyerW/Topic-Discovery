I got this trail camera for a small test I am conducting monitoring a game feeder, and the backyard experiments I have run are as follows: Camera wake up on some movement is about a minute. For fast moving animals this does not work so hot, but for game that is eating around a feeder, it should work fine. It will take images in 1, 3, or 5 round bursts, or video, but I really don't know how helpful the video would be vs. a 3 round burst shot. Seems to take images a few few seconds apart. There is a delay setting that pauses between shots and that is good. Downside, for me is, the camera seems near-sighted. Subjects standing only 20 feet away are out of focus, but up close, it's fine. The night time images seem fine for a camera in this price range. Flash works up to about 30 feet, but my camera sees the IR flash is over to the right hand side, not in the center. Images seem more clear in the IR mode than in the day light mode. IR images are 1.3 megapixel vs. daylight images that are 3.0 megapixel.The motion of trees and small animals is enough to set it off. It has a sensitivity setting that helps. The SD car slot is easy to remove, and reset on the camera, and all you need in the field to view the images is a laptop [PC or Mac], and a SD card reader, or camera with a SD card reader. The camera has a nice slot for a cable lock, and  MasterLock Python cable lock works great.I did not test the video mode, so I will not comment on it's function. Switches control the camera settings, and the whole thing is easy to set up date/time etc. About as hard as setting an alarm clock. For someone who wants an entry level model camera that does a good job, this is a good choice. Very easy to use and set up. There are more expensive trail cameras on the market, but for my needs this will work. I only wish it was not so near-sighted.
