So we first purchased this video monitor in july 2011. We loved it until it started malfunctioning 2 months to the day we got it. The product started making a loud buzzing/beeping sound and also the camera would cycle on constantly at night when it was in the VOX (sound Activated alerts) mode. When in this setting the screen should only turn on when a noise such as crying turns it on. Well ours was cycling on every minute or so even when the baby was sleeping in his quiet room. These issues were affecting our sleep so I contacted Lorex customer service for a replacement.Lorex makes you jump through so many hoops to get your product replaced! I spoke several times to customer service reps and and emailed back and forth with my product info and finally recieved permission to return product for replacement. I sent the product back on my own dime and after 3 weeks of dealing with it, i finally got a new monitor. Except it wasn't new. It was broken right out of the box. The usb port on the monitor was broken and rattling around in the monitor so there was no way to even charge it! I was so mad! I tried calling Lorex but it was a holiday(columbus day) so decided to call amazon.Amazon's customer service is the shining light in this situation. Customer service rep Andre was so helpful! I told him my problem and he told me they were sending me a new monitor free of charge and second day shipping. He also said I didn't have to return the old monitor and could dispose of it at my conveinence. You better believe i took a baseball bat to it, Office Space style! We received the new monitor as promised and it is working so far. This product is great in theory but the quality is just not there. Iwould not reccomend this product or brand to my friends. I gave it 2 stars because we are happy with it when it works. I will definitely buy another brand if i am the market for another monitor.
