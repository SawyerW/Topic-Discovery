The main reason I purchase this monitor was for it's interference free feature, but that's about the only thing that really worked. The moment we received this monitor and test it, we noticed already that the sound comes in and out. Since we cannot find this at any of our local stores, we decide to live with it since we only use it for naps (our baby's crib is in our room).So basically our video monitor only has video but not reliable sound, and then after a couple months, the video started to go too. The video quality got so bad I can hardly make out my baby's face!  I called Levana support and the operator sounded like she did not believe the video quality has problems, told me a couple of times that I need APPROVAL FROM THEM before I can pay for the shipping to send it back and wait up to 6 weeks for them to test it. I asked them what am I gonna do without a baby monitor for 6 weeks, and they basically told me it was my problem. Soon after that, even the poor quality video went in and out.  So we gave up and pay another $200 for a new summer infant bestview monitor and call our internet provider to reroute the cable so to minimize the interference with our wireless router.  We're extremely happy with the summer infant monitor, the sound quality is excellent and we love that we can remote control the camera and zoom to look for our baby without going in her room. (she rolls around a lot!)I read some really good reviews of this product before I made the purchase, and I believe that had I got one that works, I'll be quite happy too. So buyers be warned, if you buy this and has problems, you'll need to get approval, pay for shipping, purchase an additional monitor while you wait for them to test it and decide whether they are going to fix the alleged problem.  All in all I think this is quite a risky choice.
