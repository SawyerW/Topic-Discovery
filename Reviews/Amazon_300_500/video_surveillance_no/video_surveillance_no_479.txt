I was impressed with the DVR functionality and video quality. I didn't have to read the manual etc the interface was pretty intuitive and easy to configure for motion recording. Overall it has a quality feel to it and the layout of the connections on the back \ front are easy to deal with. Some may find the spacing on the BNC connections a tad close but this is with all DVRs I've encountered.I could hear the hard drive click on occasion and this was a little disconcerting but I would have swapped the HD for a SSD HD if I had kept it anyway.I used the 4 supplied Swann cameras in conjunction with 4 "AVTECH AVC462B 6MM 1/3" H.R. Sony Effio 35 IR 6MM lens Outdoor Weatherproof IR Cameras" I bought last year from US Security Solution. The difference was dramatic. The Swann cameras performed so poorly that I returned the whole package to Amazon. I put the camera quality and LOUD $#@! CLICKING NOISE on the same caliber as the Night Owl cameras I bought from Frys.The tests were conducted by swapping out the Swann cameras in place with the AVTECH and also the cables and the problem was definitely the Swann cameras only.What I really liked about this DVR besides the true full D1 @ 30fps PER channel, is that you can export \ save the video directly to .avi format as individual channels one 1 step. So if you want ONLY the videos for channel 1, you can get that! The files will be listed as time stamped names on the thumb drive and easily browsable and playable in Windows.You can not do this with the US411ZS DVR from US Security Solutions at all, ever. Bummer :((US Security Solutions has great customer and tech support and can be reached by phone in the USA and they have been very good to me as a customer)1) I prefer this Swann SWDVK-830004-US DVR over the US Security Solutions US411ZS DVR.2) I prefer the "AVTECH AVC462B Cameras" over the Swann supplied "high resolution" cameras.So 4 stars for the DVR and minus one star for the poor camera quality. I would def buy the DVR again.=====================================================================================================EDIT: I DID buy this DVR again (roughly), I bought the Swann - TruBlue DVR8-4000 8-Channel Network-Ready Surveillance DVR with 1TB Hard Drive. It was on sale at Frys and BestBuy priced matched it with their Low Price Guarantee. I removed the hard drive and replaced it with a 256Gb SSD drive for low power consumption in the field. The particular model I received was Revision 1 so no external drive capability. Revision 2 - chipset 8107 gives you the ability to use external storage. Both give you USB and eSata BU and the spare USB port can be used to pwr an HDMI\VGA to Composite converter if needed.This unit with the SSD drive consumes only 96ma and with 8 cameras the combined draw is still @ 1.75A.
