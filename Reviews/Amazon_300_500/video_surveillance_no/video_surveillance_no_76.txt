This is the second system we purchased, having used the Summer system for 3 years to monitor our two kids. We didn't like the Summer system because it gave a lot of feedback and static, and we had to carry too monitors around.  This one seems like the design was all in the right direction, but execution just did not follow through. We'll be returning this system two and probably moving to a different Summer system or a regular security camera system.Pros:Compact Size-Cameras can run on batteries (but why if you are mounting them in a room?)-2 way speaker is cool (I like telling my son, "Lay back down!" LOL)-Many cameras on one monitor-VOX seems like a nice option-Price was great compared to other systems (sometimes you get what you pay for though!)Cons:-Gives terrible feedback - a very annoying cricket-like noise despite which camera you are using and where you put system; we have moved them to every possible place, turned off every electronic gadget that could provide interference, and still the crickets persist. You just can not sleep with this thing on (see other reviews also)-Monitor doesn't hold charge very long-There is no visual volume (lights that indicate noise, so you can have it on mute and see if there is noise coming from the monitor)-No way to upgrade system (via computer) for bugs, software upgrades-Monitor froze within first 5 minutes (showing a stale view on the screen) and the only way to restart the thing was to take the battery out and start again.-VOX seems nice unless you have a child who snores, talks in his sleep, turns over, cries out, coughs, etc. Then the monitor screen will be turning on and off all night in your face.-The volume at it's highest level is so low you can not hear much of what is going on. My son got out of bed 3 times last night and we didn't hear a thing until he was at his open door yelling for us (previous monitor we could actually hear him moving covers to get out of bed!)-The monitor (if not in charging base) does not stand up on any type of easel. So if you have it on the table in front of you, you will not be able to see the screen because it has to lie on it's back (or end but it's too narrow to stay upright and falls over constantly)-There is a great deal of choppiness and slight time delay in movement from the real thing to the monitor.-Cameras do not swivel from side to side much so if we mounted it in desired location, the view would be sideways. Had to alter where camera went because monitor would just not turn in right direction to get proper view.-Cords on cameras are VERY short so you don't have too much choice in where to mount it if you want to keep it plugged in (barely reached to ceiling height)
