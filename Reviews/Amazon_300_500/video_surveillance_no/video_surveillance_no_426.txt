I was previously using a 2.4GHz wireless monitor to watch our infant son, but it was creating havoc with our wifi network. I wanted a wifi device that I could display on my computer monitor, iphone, ipad, and access from the internet. This cam fits the bill perfectly at a very reasonable cost. Much of my experience with this is in relation to my two other cameras: IP cam Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera System with Night Vision (961-000337) and baby monitor Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871)What I like:* More than one person/device can access it simultaneously. My wife and I both like to keep an eye on our little one. Also, sometimes I'm watching him on my computer screen, but then I want to run downstairs so I can continue monitoring on my phone.* With additional software, it integrates well with other existing IP cameras.* Participates in my wifi network, instead of destroying it.* Pan and tilt are great features that I never had before.* Night vision is bright with great visibility.* Very nicely priced when compared to other wifi/internet cams.* Wide screen field of view is very appreciated after watching my Logitech Alert cam for the past couple of years.* It's portable enough to move it from room to room, but also versatile enough to permanently mount in the corner of a room.What I don't like:* Much more difficult to configure than a typical baby monitor or consumer oriented IP cam. They aren't too bad for someone with any kind of home networking experience, but if you don't it may be a little intimidating.* Apps for mobile devices require an additional purchase.* Included software is not good at all in my opinion. I'd highly recommend purchasing Blue Iris to manage it, especially if you have other IP cams.I made sure to update the firmware to the latest (v1.1.1.13 at the time) the day I received the cam. Issues previous reviewers had with the camera may have been resolved by it.
