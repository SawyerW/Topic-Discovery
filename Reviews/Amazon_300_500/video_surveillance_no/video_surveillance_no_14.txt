I bought several of these for our home and my mother's home.  Super loud, and will stop or at least make it difficult for a door to be opened wide enough for an intruder to enter.  I tested one out on my husband by placing it at the door he normally enters through.  It stopped him, scared him and did just what I hoped it would do.  He kind of got mad at me and hollered a few explicatives but it was worth it! We have one door that is on a raised threshold so I set the door stop alarm on a book and the door hits it squarely when opened just a little bitty bit.  It's loud - ear piercing loud and that's good as it should scare the bejeebers out of a bad person.  On doors that have windows through which the unwanted guest might peer through and see the doorstop, just by placing a light weight towel or papers over it disguises completely.  They'll just think your a slob and leave newspapers on the floor.My mom was thrilled with her doorstops.  Anything to help parents stay safe is money well-spent.Be aware of how all of your doors open since they won't do any good on doors that open to the outside.  The 9 volt battery was a tad difficult to install but I'm not complaining.  For my mom I had to write in big letters with a felt permanent marker ON and OFF so she could easily turn them off when not in use and not waste batteries or scare her by an accidental alarm.  We'll be taking some of these with us on vacation.  These are really great!UPDATE:  December 1, 2011 - I have bought several more of these because they are so practical and good at what they do.  I've learned to pick them up by holding the sides of them lest I accidentally hit the metal plate on top and hear it's ear-breaking scream.  I've taken at least one of these on overnight trips to put against the door in our hotel rooms.  It makes me feel a lot safer knowing this thing will scream if someone tries to break in.
