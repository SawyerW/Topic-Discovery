This is my 1st time working with video surveillance equipment, but I've been building my own PC's for 15+ years and installing home & car audio even longer. So I would say that I'm not an electronics/network/PC beginner nor am I a highly-skilled Pro.I purchased the Defender PX301-010 security system to watch over my driveway and cars during the night time hours. This system was extremely easy to set up - just plug in the camera and LCD monitor/DVR to suitable power outlets, turn the LCD/DVR on and it's ready to go. The included PSS software - which I intended to use to record and review video clips - was challenging to get going to say the least. I eventually gave up and just monitored the camera through the web interface. Video quality was good during daylight hours and even better at night. Motion sensor worked well and the camera only lost the signal during one time while I was testing it - and that was when the camera and LCD DVR were at completely opposite ends of my house. The camera itself seemed solid and well-built while the LCD monitor/recorder was just average in terms of build quality.With all that said I did end up returning the product due to it's video quality - it just wasn't sharp or detailed enough for my needs. To be fair the camera is only 640x480 (which I knew prior to purchase) and it performed very well for it's price in my opinion. It was more than easy to get it running (if you don't use the PSS software) and should be seriously considered if the buyer has little or no experience with configuring a home network and/or FTP servers. I replaced the system with a Q-See QCN7001B  720p camera that - by itself - costs as much as this whole system. In addition to the 720P camera I also purchased (and recommend) Blue Iris Professional monitoring software.Even though I decided to return this system in the end, I would definitely recommend the Defender PX301-010 system to others on a tight budget.
