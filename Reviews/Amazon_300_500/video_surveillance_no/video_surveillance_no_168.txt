This system is used as a backup for a dedicated 4 camera DVR setup that was a pain to transfer video onto a disk to give to the police.  This setup took about 30 min total including software setup, and iphone app.PRO:-easy to setup, if camera is not recognized by computer try moving transmitter unit closer to router receiver (camera should start with pink blinking light then turn green under camera near mic).  Yellow and blue flashing or solid yellow indicate error.-iphone app is limited but neat feature.-easy to burn movies onto CD or DVD for police use-internal microSD card can upgrade to a 32G card several weeks worth of video with no sound with computer off.CON:-easily noticeable at night has 2 infrared lights to each side of lens and under is a bright red blinking motion detector light can can not be blacked out.-microphone sucks and is useless past 10 feet away on any setting, would have liked a plug in for an external higher quality microphone, even cheaper units have this feature.-noticeable fisheye distortion on mid to wide angle settings.-would like a more secure camera... technically if my neighbor bought the same camera system, if my camera was within ~25 ft of his computer he could link and view my camera.  should be like garage door openers where you do the first setup close within 1-2 feet.  Then it will initialize and make it unique to only my computer setup and not others.-really should include better CAT5 cables with more insulation, some video interference if you use a vacuum or hair dryer in same outlet as your video transmitter.-compared to a $300 panasonic PTZ with night vision cam on dedicated DVR system, the video quality of the logitech is noticeably lower.  not sure if this is post processing software issue or H.264 vs MP4 format issue.-needs a additional PTZ dome cam option, the tilt of the PTZ 750e camera is very limited, the pan and zoom are all digital, not really a zoom lens.I am pretty happy for the price and ease of setup I would want to invest in a hidden clock or indoor cam for the front door.
