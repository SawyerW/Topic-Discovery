The good news:The first one I absolutly LOVED!! The product works great! I love how you can talk to your child from another room, and have multiple cameras! I have one set up in my 1 year olds room where I can watch him sleep safely in his crib and also watch him play during the day. The second camera I have in my 8 year old daughters room... She used to be scared of the dark but after I installed the camera and I showed her how I can watch her and hear her all through the night she no longer felt the need for lights in her room!! In the morning I also use the 2 way communication to play her favorite songs in the morning to wake her up and I can see when she starts moving. I am able to not yell through the house to tell her when dinner is ready and we absolutly love it!The bad news:It breaks!! With no warning what-so-ever!! One day it works great and the next day you go to plug in the monitor and the port where it goes in is no longer there... It has gone inside of the unit. You can hear it jiggle around inside. It just came loose one day! That happened about 8 month after I first bought it and could not get it replaced because I was in the middle of a move and just didn't have the time. So after living without it for about 6 months I bought another unit... And for 2 1/2 months was very happy again! And then... IT BROKE!! In the exact same spot! The charger port went inside itself and I could no longer charge it! I am right now in the process of foing through Lorex to get a replacement since Amazons 30 day refund is up. I'll have to come back with an update and let you know how my experience goes with Lorex... Wish me luck!Conclusion: I would not but this product again! If you read other reviews you can see that other people are having this same problem. Great product! Horrible manufacturing!!
