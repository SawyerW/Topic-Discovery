We had a Summers Infant day/night video monitor that we (ab)used for almost 2 years before our kid decided to toss it in a bucket of water. It was a great product, thoughtfully designed and with the exact set of features needed. Unfortunately that product has been taken out of the market and the  Infant Optics DXR-5 seemed to be a good replacement. We have had this for about 2 months now and it seems to be adequate for our needs. Having said that, I'm not comfortable giving it more than 3 stars for a few reasons1. Price: Definitely the #1 reason for purchasing this product, There are hardly any sub-100 day/night video monitors out there2. Design: Pretty nice looking, but does definitely feel flimsy and rather lightly constructed. One annoying quality is that the camera has a pretty limited degree of motion because of a rather strange hinge-like contraption that holds the lens. It is a little annoying to position it right and get adequate coverage of whatever you are trying to cover (the crib in our case).3. Picture/Sound: Again, these are pretty adequate and the night time is definitely a lot grainier than our old monitor. My wife sometimes calls it the ultrasound picture (to be fair, it is not that bad :-) ). The sound (very) occasionally cuts off and then comes back. I'm guessing this is more to do with connectivity between the camera and the monitor4. There have been some comments in this thread about how bright the camera is on account of the night-vision. Frankly we have not seen that nor has out kid been distracted/disturbed by this. We have a relatively bright night-light in the room, so he may be used to some light5. We turned off the other features like Vox, power-save shutoff etc. The manual has clear instructions on how to do so. I have seen quite a few negative ratings on account of this. I cannot comment on the features themselves since I turned them off, but they are easy to turn off and (atleast IMO) should not be the deciding factor against this
