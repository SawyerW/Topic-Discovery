After a lot of research I decided to buy this baby monitor. I wanted one with tilt, pan and zoom, and MBP36 does that like a charm. The setup is a piece of cake (completely plug and play), both camera and display are tiny, light and (why not?) pretty. The operation is very easy, very intuitive, there is no need to read the user manual.Despite of its size, the display is awesome. The video quality is excellent and you have a great view of the subject. The infrared works perfectly, I tested it on a windowless room with zero light and I could see the smallest details of the room.The microphone has a great quality too, if you max the volume you can hear the baby breathing (of course if the camera is close to the crib). I liked a lot of the two-way intercom, so we can talk to the baby without going to his room, what is good in some situations where he is half awake and just need to hear our voice to calm down. The camera also plays a few lullabies, what is nice too.Another plus is the temperature sensor on the camera. It works perfectly, we tested it with the air conditioning and it was very accurate, so we can check if the room temperature has changed too much without getting out of bed.There is only one thing that disappointed us: there is no way to find the AV cable in the US (to connect the monitor to a TV and see the baby on the big screen). We had to order one directly from Binatone (the real manufacturer, Motorola just distribute it) in United Kingdom. This was very easy to do, they were very helpful and polite ... the hard part was to FIND them, since there is no mention on Motorola (or any other) website. The cable didn't arrive yet, so I cannot comment about it, but it seems to be plug and play too.
