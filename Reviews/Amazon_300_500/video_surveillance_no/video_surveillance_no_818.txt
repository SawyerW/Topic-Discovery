I'm writing this review for people wanting to use this camera on a Mac. I am running Mac OS 10.5 and 10.6 so it will work on both operating systems BUT, you pretty much NEED a PC or PC emulator software to use the set-up software and make any changes to the camera. You also need a PC to setup the wireless. Safari, Chrome or Firefox will only allow you to view the camera image and use the tilt/pan functions from a mac. You can't adjust image size or use advanced alert and FTP settings directly.Fortunately I have a PC desktop as well and once I got it up and running I was able to set things up. The most difficult part of the set-up was setting up the camera to work remotely. Through the help of a website, portforward.com it walked me through setting up the camera for my particular router and I used the settings from Foscam and that worked.I had problems getting one of the two camera I am using to work wirelessly and thought it wasn't working but restarting the router solved the problem.Once I had everything set up on the PC I, I realized that I needed a decent IP camera software that worked on the mac. I decided to purchase Vitamin D software. There is a free version that supports 1 camera but in order to do advanced features such as defining an alarm area and adjusting image size you have to purchase the software. It doesn't, at the moment, control pan tilt, but you can do that from a web browser on the mac (Safari or Chrome, the image never displayed on Firefox).The camera quality is exactly as expected based upon the earlier reviews. I will say that I wish the camera wasn't so bulky. But for the price, it is something that I can live with.Knowing all I know now, I probably would prefer a camera with integrated Mac software. But if you have access to a PC to get things up and running you will be ok!
