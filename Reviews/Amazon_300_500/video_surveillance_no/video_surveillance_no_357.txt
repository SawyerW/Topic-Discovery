You can buy this same wireless cam refurbished--it's cheaper and it's a perfectly fine cam, same as a brand new one. People return it because they are having trouble setting it up. The way i see it, they will have the same trouble if they buy from another brand. Products like this has essentially the same technical requirement and knowledge. So if you are not in IT, you might want to get your IT friend to help.Most of the difficulty will come from port-forwarding, or dynamic dns, or motion detection/email/ftp.1)port-forwarding. If you have a Linksys wireless router, this cam can automatically setup the wireless router for you. You will need port-forwarding so you can view your cam from anywhere on the internet. If your wireless router is not a Linksys, most of other router can do port-forwarding.  help: google port-forwarding2)dynamic dns. You don't have to use TZO as your dynamic dns server, it cost $$ after 3 month of free usage. Sign up a free account at dyndns.org, and use your wireless router instead of the wireless cam to update your dynamic dns (if your wireless router supports it). Once you are done, use[...] to see your cam on the internet.3)motion detection:a)you can set up sensitivity area, so the cam can monitor only part of the picture for motion detectionb)Email: setting up SMTP server is tricky. If you use hotmail or yahoo mail, you probably need to use your WHOLE email name to login instead of just the username. I kept getting "fail to send email" when doing "test email". Later I used my own SMTP server and it worked fine.c)ftp: find one of the free online storage service (usually give you 1GB free space), MAKE SURE they support FTP upload.4)I don't use the desktop utilities. I prefer getting an email with motion detection.Now that everything's setup, I got an email with 5 second video clip every time UPS guys came deliver my stuff, or the neighborhood kid who try to steal my goodies.Awesome.
