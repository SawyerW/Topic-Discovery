I got two of these to keep tabs on my cats whenever I'm away. They're easy to set up (though it's kind of ridiculous to require a smartphone to do so). The picture isn't fabulous, but it picks up sounds well.One thing I can't stand, though, is the interface to view the cameras and events. These cameras weren't cheap for me, so I had hoped for much better.- You can't view video on your smartphone on 3G, while YouTube seems to hum along just fine on it, so not sure why this company can't stream that way. So you need a wifi connection.- There's a 5-minute limit to viewing a camera, whether you're using your smartphone or a computer. So if I want to monitor my pet sitter's visit, I have to refresh 5 times.- I wish there were a way to save video besides whenever an "event" (motion) occurs.- Nighttime motion detection is pretty bad. Sometimes even the daytime motion detection is bad. My oldest cat is small, but she's easily distinguishable as a black object against a light background. The camera often didn't detect her, even when she'd walk close to the camera on the ground. I turned the sensitivity all of the way up, but it only captured some of my pet sitter's movements, not the cat.- The video is hit and miss in terms of actually loading, particularly for "events."- There is absolutely no way to mass-delete videos. If I know that the entire first page of videos is all of my youngest cat adjusting her position in her cat tree, I can't select all ten and just delete them. I have to click them one by one and wait for the page to reload.- If something had happened while I was gone, there was no indication that I could save the video (and it "expires" after a week). I stumbled across it while idly clicking around.I'd also prefer to be able to stream this to another server instead of their interface, and while I knew this before I purchased the camera, if I knew how frustrating it'd be to use, I would have chosen another camera.
