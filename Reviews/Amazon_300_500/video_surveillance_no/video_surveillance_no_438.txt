After my in-law's home was broken into (while they were on vacation) and none of the neighbors saw anything, I became nervous about not having any surveillance system in my home.  Although it might not prevent burglars from breaking in, at least there is some evidence available to help find them (as long as the NVR is not stolen as well).This system has everything you need in the box.  Four HD cameras and all the cords needed to setup.  I love the POE cords since you don't need to find a power source for each camera (they are all powered through the Ethernet to the NVR).Setup was fairly uncomplicated following all the directions.  I did have issues with the port assignments, though, since I already have IP cameras in my house (used as baby monitors).  I was using port 85 for one of the other cameras and when I went through setup, it overwrote the other camera in port 85 so I had to go in and change the port setting of my other camera.  I could not see a way to change the port setting for the NVR as I was doing the setup and that was not in the directions.To me the most complicated part is finding the right location for the NVR.  Instructions say that it needs to be plugged directly into the wireless router (I actually went through a hub and had no problems, though), so you need room for it wherever that is.  I do not have a TV or monitor where my router is, so this caused a little problem (hence why I went through an electrical outlet hub to the other room).  Also, since all the cameras need to be wired, I need to be able to get all the wires through the house and to the NVR.  That is more complicated as it requires going through the walls.I setup viewing on both my computer and the iPad with no issues.  The iPad app is a little complicated, but overall very nice.I'm very happy with this setup and feel more secure with it.
