I had to come back and re-write my review (and upgrade it to 5-stars from 3-stars) after having these cameras for a couple of weeks.  The whole system is pretty good.  Initially I was having some difficulty with poor camera performance at night.  But I figured out one of them was being blinded at night by the reflection of the IR LEDs right back at the camera.  I relocated it slightly to move it further from the white surface it was close to and the picture at night was much improved.I finally got a second camera wired up and added and noticed its picture was significantly better than the first camera.  I tweaked the camera settings on the first camera and bingo!  Picture on both was outstanding.Setting up access to the recorder on my network was the easiest I've ever seen.  I've had a lot of wifi cams and helped co-workers with similar DVRs to the Swann unit, but this one was by far the smoothest to set up.  Mobile access is good on my Android phone and I'm very pleased.The ability to set specific areas of the field of view of each camera to detect motion is fantastic.  The "alarms" are good, and it definitely emails out screen captures when it detects motion.  I had to set it up to use Gmail (which Swann recommends) as the SMTP server...I was never able to get it to work with my Comcast account.One other useful thing I discovered is that the camera mounts are a perfect match to the threaded portion on most floodlight fixtures.  I unscrewed the mounting base that came with the camera and threaded it into one of the empty positions on my floodlight fixtures already on the house.  Made for a very professional look and was easy to mount...no drilling required.
