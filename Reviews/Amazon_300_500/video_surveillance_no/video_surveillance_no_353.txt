The reviews of this camera are lacking the very glaring omission that full features of remote viewing will not be available to the Mac community.The software interface for running this camera with full control is Active-X dependent (IE), basic viewing is there for any browser, Safari, Firefox, iPhone.So, once it is set up, and the ports are forwarded and the correct IP address is entered, you can view your camera on your Mac or iPhone but it will be without sound.I hope someone has a workaround for this, as there are many iPhone users out there, which I'm sure would like to see and hear what their IP cameras are broadcasting.The install was not seamless, and I am a fairly competent Mac user.  The install disc did not want to work on OS 10.4.x, it did work just fine with OS 10.5.x and the install proceeded until it asked for the WiFi network password, which for security purposes is >10 digits and a mixture of alpha-numeric.  The camera setup software would not allow the entry of a password greater then 9 digits.So it was now time to contact Linksys, which was very responsive and worked to sort things out.  The first phone call only confirmed that there was a problem in the setup program.Fortunately I have a Linksys router so they were able to show me where to create the port forwarding info and that accomplished getting the camera on the network.Remote viewing on iPhone Safari, works well, but there was no sound.Even though I had enabled the microphone in the camera, there was no sound.So another couple phone calls to Linksys and another hour, to determine that only Active-X capable browsers (Internet Explorer) are able to control ALL the features of the camera, and that Mac browsers like Safari or Firefox will not.Now Linksys does say if you can access the camera using a RTSP:// URLthen you should be able to hear sound.Well, this only seems to launch Realplayer or Quicktime on my Macbook and there is still no sound.So, high marks on the Video portion of the C80, albeit set up could use some Mac specific notes and support.Also a little more description about setting up the port forwarding info, which would work with any router.I have yet to undertake the email portion of the setup, as I have spent enough time on the phone with Linksys - who are generally helpful.But I had one incredible Tech - Andrew who was spot on!!!!
