I professionally install DVR Camera systems and was tasked with installing this system in a residence. I chose to mount the DVR in a central room (kitchen) with a dedicated monitor, and run cameras to several indoor and outdoor locations. The DVR box is great, and is easy to install and setup. There are a plethora of options to choose from and I no problem setting up even the most advanced features. The power adapter for the cameras is very sturdy, requires mounting a box, and is adequate for the job. The 1TB hard drive was excellent and already set up for use.The cables were long enough to reach all locations needed from the central control room when ran through a wall and into the attic. The cables are BNC on both end, with power jacks, and the cameras are also BNC.The camera mounts have a large footprint, require four screws, and are very solid. This is an excellent dome camera mount and very easy to adjust. They are capable of hiding the cable under the mount and are vandal proof. This makes it impossible for someone to just grab the cable and unplug the power, disabling the camera. I was very impressed with the picture. Overall these are some of the best cameras I've gotten with a kit. I would recommend these over bullet cameras in almost every situation.The camera signal is ok during the day, but at night under poor lighting you wont be able to see much unless the camera is close enough to it to illuminate it with IR. That's about 15-20 feet. Anything beyond that under poor lighting will not be able to be seen, which is normal with IR illuminated night vision cameras.The system menus were very intuitive and easy to set up. Networking for internet and web browser usage was very easy also.Overall the install was very easy, taking less than 2 hours for two people to install. This kit was purchased on Amazon, arrived in two days, and was a great value. This will be my go to kit to sell to residential customers in the future.
