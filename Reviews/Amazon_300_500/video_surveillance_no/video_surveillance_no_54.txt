I have several scouting cameras from a variety of manufacturers.  My favorite is by far the Reconyx, but I just can't shell out that kind of money if I want more cameras.  As much as I love that camera, I almost wish I had taken that money and bought 8 Truth Cams so I could cover more ground.  Almost.  Right now, I think this is the best value of any of the cameras I have.For the money this is a great camera.  It easily performs as well as some $200 cameras out there.  My Reconyx takes better night pictures, and more of them, but I also spent a lot more money on that camera, almost 10x more.Some pictures are a little blurry at night if the deer are moving fast, but it's really not that bad.  You can still clearly make out the number of points on the antlers unlike the Moultrie camera that I have which just shows a white blur.Daytime photos are awesome.Couple of things to be aware of:If you put it in the woods with a heavy overhead canopy, you will occasionally get white out photos.  This camera is much better suited for more open areas such as fields or food plots.  When I put it on the edge of a field, I do not get white outs.  Also, if you do place it in thicker cover, don't set the sensitivity on high.  You'll get lots of great pictures of trees.  Every time a branch moves it will go off.  Nighttime flash range is much better in open areas as well.I've had it out in the field now for 2 weeks.  It's already taken over 500 photos and the battery is at 98%.  I'm using industrial D-Cell batteries that I special ordered so I expect them to last longer so take that with a grain of salt.I can't give it 5 stars though.  A Reconyx is a 5 star camera.  This is not a Reconyx.  Compared to one of those it's probably a 2 or 3 star camera at best.  However, considering the performance/price ratio, it gets a 4.  It is NOT the best camera out there, but it IS the best camera if you're on a tight budget.
