Easy to setup, easy to use. I get false alarms sometimes as we are in Florida and have Lizards, Frogs which sometimes move right onto the Sensor unit outside (and of course set it off). Outside sensor does have a cheap rubber gasket around it but I sealed mine as well with Silicone as the gasket does not fit well and it has not gotten any water into the unit yet :)It picks up around 30 feet from the outside sensor and the inside alarm unit is LOUD with two settings for loudness and will work at least 150 feet away from the outside motion sensor as that is how far mine is placed away so I know this.I put my sensor unit in a used Plastic Coffee can outside on a Pole and it does NOT catch the blowing leaves (we have 300 trees in the yard) and sees Straight ahead and to the sides a little bit (which is what I wanted it to see).I have it setup in the can so as NOT to see our Cat but it DOES see mid sized Dogs (which are problematic here). I have a Solar light on the same pole (just above the alarm sensor a couple of feet) which also comes on about the same time the motion sensor picks something up (except lizards, frogs, etc).When it Does go off, I pick up my pellet gun (.25 cal pellet gun) look out at the area (which is now lite up with the solar light) and if it is a roaming dog, raccoon, opossum, PERSON, etc I have options at that point to Deal with it. This type of alert system is something Everyone should have for protection as well as security.Put it onto a Pole in the ground about 3 feet high on the pole, put a Solar or battery powered light near the top of that pole also equipped with a Motion Sensor which turns it on and you have a decent Pre Alarm, notice type of system for those things entering your property or getting into your Trash.
