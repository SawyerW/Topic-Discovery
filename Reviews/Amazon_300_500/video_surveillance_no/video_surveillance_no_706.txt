I purchased another DVR surveillance system from ZMODO; and I just could not get the router settings right.  Mind you that I am tech savvy.  So I got frustrated after calling their tech support waited forever to talk to someone and just gave up and returned it.  I logged onto my amazon account and found Swann had the best tech support and the reviews said it was easier to set up.Upon receipt of the system, I went straight to setting up the router and remote access.  With the UnPnP it was a breeze compared to what I was dealing with before.  It took me all but 30 mins to configure the remote access and cell phone (android phone) viewing.Setting up the cameras is a bit of a pain.  You need to dedicate time and energy on this effort to make sure that you have the cameras in the right spot and cable length can be an issue so plan on that too.  You might need the help of someone else when doing this which is my suggestion.  After about 1/2 day of planning this out and running the wires in a hot attic space I got it all homerun to the DVR and that was it.  I logged on to the DVR and set the motion detection settings and I was up and running.  The remote log in is quirky because it is linux based but read the manual carefully and do exactly what is says.  Also internet explorer is REQUIRED when you do the remote log in via PC (Firefox, Chrome will not work - I tried).  PLEASE FOLLOW STEP BY STEP on the settings if not you are hosed and will get frustrated.I ended up having to return 1 of the cameras because of focus issues.  It was a breeze too.  Swann has excellent customer service and tech support.I would highly recommend Swann products to anyone.  I ended up buying another 2 different types of cameras to augment my system and it was a breeze to add on and setup (1 of which was a Pan Tilt (no zoom)).  I can't say anything else but good things.If you need an easy to set up system and also need tech support, then Swann is the product for you.Happy shopping.
