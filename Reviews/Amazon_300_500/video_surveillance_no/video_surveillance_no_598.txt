I looked at a lot of systems and manufacturers befor settling on REVO. I was concerned that my ability to interface the DVR and my computer would be a problem based on numerouse comments online. However, it was really quite simple. The hardest part is selecting a location for the camera where you get the best coverage. I ran a cable from the DVR to the camera and taped tha camera to the wall/ceiling, as I doing this alone. Once the location of the camera was selected, running the wires through the hot Florida attic was a chore, but having both an access location for the DVR and snaking the wire into the eaves made the project easier.Once all cameras were plugged into the DVR, the LAN cable from the DVR connected to the router, and the DVR connected to a monitor, the setup program checks compatability and identifies ports, IP address, etc. Despite getting an affirmative response from the DVR, I was having trouble connecting to the website for remote viewing. One phone call to REVO, with a short wait time of approximately 5 minutes at 5:00 pm, and I was connected to Manny, who walked me through a program whereby he accessed my computer set all the parameters, and in the end told me that mu LAN cable, which was not new, was the problem, and to push the cables in again. Once that was done, I was up and running, although the Revo remote website is a little confusing, the manual is explicit and helpful.The cameras provide great daylight and evening pictures, the DVR was easy to setup, and thanks to Manny at Revo, the software setup was pretty easy. I just need to buy two more cameras, as it seems you can always find another angle to cover with an additional camera.Overall, I'm pleased with the system and the lifetime tech. support, and can not cite any cons at this time.
