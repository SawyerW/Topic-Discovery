got this for my PS4.. and so far.. it has worked perfectly!!I haven't compared load times vs the original (heck it might be the same specs but just bigger storage). but if you are looking for more space with a tested HD.. this one I can say so far it's worked....go online and check for method to exchange, it's pretty easy.... but here are just a few pointers...You need a USB that fits into the PS4 with at least 1 GB.. download the file that is like 800 plus MB (not the one that is 400)... the bigger one is the one for hard drive exchange.. (JUST READ THE INFO ON playstation.com; don't just download the first thing that you see DOWNLOAD)...you will need to format the USB FAT32 (if I'm not mistaken), I had downloaded the file onto two USBs, it wouldn't read one then I tried the one I had formatted FAT32 and it worked... (double check on this, it worked for me)....I assume you already did all the necessary back up... (you can use USB or online storage with PS Plus)make sure you turn off completely the PS4 (no stand by) and unplug...just, take off the cover, unscrew one screw, then remove the metal base (or however you call it).. then remove the 4 small screw that is actually holding the HD and replace (don't lose the screw)....replace, put the screw, the cover and turn on!! you will need the USB cable to connect your controller.. insert the USB and it should all work....PS: now you will have a 500GB drive and what can you do with it?? I found a Hard Drive Enclosure, that lets you put your hard drive into a metal case and use as an external (link below)... you will have to know how to format the HD and all that but you can put it to good use.. not sure if you can format it for future use on the Xbox One, because it's a 2.0 USB.. but  at least you have it and you can use it with a computer :)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E362W9O/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1
