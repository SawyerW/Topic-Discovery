The camera works well.  But there are major design flaws.  I'm pretty sure there were no actual parents involved in testing the design. The monitor is slightly bigger than an iPhone, which to me is neither here nor there.  There are control buttons around the edges of the monitor.  So you may grab your monitor to try to get a good look at your sleeping baby and accidentally push the light button - no more sleeping baby!  the worst issue with this monitor is the terrible alarm that happens anytime the camera detects any noise?  This is awful!  There is already audio, so if the baby makes noise you can hear it.  It is not necessary to be subjected to a BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ every time there is a slight noise in the nursery.  As most parents know, part of creating good sleep habits is letting your baby learn to self soothe.  That means you can't go running into the nursery with every peep from the baby.  With this monitor, my baby is self soothing and falling back to sleep while I've got a buzzer going off in my bedroom all night long.  The point of a baby monitor is to help the parent get sleep knowing the baby is fine.  If I wanted buzzing every 2 hours, I would just set my alarm clock.  Not to mention that while it is buzzing, the actual baby audio cuts out.  So in order to determine what is going on with your baby, you must wait through the 4 buzzes.  Also, the temp sensor is not accurate, so if that is a deal breaker, look elsewhere.  I think the feature, had it worked, would be very nice.  But it has been way off since we got it.  Other than that, it works just fine.
