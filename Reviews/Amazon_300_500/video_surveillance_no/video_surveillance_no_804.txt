This is an all around GREAT monitor!  After returning my last video monitor I was worried that there wasn't a video monitor in existence which would meet my needs/expectations. My last monitor was great excluding one major deal breaker: it would lose signal constantly and only had a visual not auditory indicator that the signal had dropped.I did hours of research and read numerous reviews on other monitors before purchasing this one. I am so happy with its performance. The signal strength is GREAT, it can go places in my house that were completely off-limits to my other video monitor. Even in the rare situation that this monitor loses signal it will give me a visual and auditory indication. So if I were to be sleeping at night and the monitor loses signal (power failure, etc) I would be awakened by a beeping noise.This monitor has tons of great features and completely meets and even exceeds my expectations. I was looking for a good, basic reliable video monitor with the ability of expanding to two cameras in the future. With this camera I got more features than I bargained for and now I can't live without them. The pan/tilt function is great for locating my toddler in her room if she gets out of her bed at nap time (she can be very quiet and sneaky). I also like the 'intercom' feature, I tell her to get into bed and she does it immediately. She actually minds me better over then intercom than if I actually went into her room!! Her bedroom is upstairs where it gets pretty hot in the summer, I love being able to see the temperature at all times so I know when its too hot without constantly running up and down the stairs.I would buy this monitor again and again. I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it!
