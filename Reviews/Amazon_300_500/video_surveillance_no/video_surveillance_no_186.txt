I also have and use the Wilife camera system and even that did an ok job with everything. My biggest problem with the Wilife system was the poor video quality, no night vision or audio and not being able to remote view on my phone. All of this is changed on the new Alert System, The video quality is 5x better then the old systems and its great, you can now see faces and cars with ease with the system. It does even better in low light which is huge plus. I use the android app and It sweet to be able to view my cameras from my phone now.I was leaning towards getting a Mobotix camera system to get the 3mp high quality I wanted in IP security, but starting at around $900 for one camera Mobotix was just a little too expensive. Considering you can get a 6 camera indoor and outdoor system for less than $1600 with the Logitech Alert Systems.As for the first reviewer that gave it one star just on the fact it there is no ipad or itouch app, Logitech never stated or advertised there was an app for either before hand. That user should have just done his research and figured out before buying that it didn't do what he needed. Logitech's website listed all the specs and what apps were available and on what. As did many of the reviews posted online including Engadget's. Taking 5 mins with google and any could figure out that the only apps currently out are for Iphone & Android. Simple.Anyone else who wants a good quality system that is affordable and has tons of features I would suggest this system. The only con so far that I found is the limit of 6 cameras per system. I would love to go as high as 12.
