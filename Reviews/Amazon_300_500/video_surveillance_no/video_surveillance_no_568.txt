I just installed this and it let me explain my usage.I have a 2 year old child in a room 40 ft from my room.  I want an alarm that goes off if her door is opened by someone that isn't me, or by her.If you set it to chime, it's ok if I'm awake but I could sleep through it.If you set it to alarm, it will wake you up, which I want it to do.If you set it to alarm, and home, it goes off instantly.  You can't set, and leave thru the door.If you set it to alarm, and away, it goes off on a countdown.  You can set, and leave thru the door.But...In my usage, it is installed inside her room.  If it were installed outside the room, it could easily be disabled by someone with bad intentions.From inside her room, I set the alarm to away, enter the code to arm the alarm, open the door, exit close the door.  If an intruder were to open the door, it makes a beep.  It then goes to a 45 second countdown before the alarm goes off.  The intruder has a window to disable the alarm.  You could easily crush this with your boot, drop it in water, muffle it possibly.  Either way, if someone knows of this alarm, or can think quickly, it will never go off.The other reason this isn't for me - say I want to enter her room to check on her while she is sleeping, while it's armed.  I open the door, close the door, press the disarm code.  Pressing these buttons is pretty loud and wakes her up and anyone in a room nearby.What I have learned is I need an alarm that goes off in my bedroom or wherever I happen to be in the house.This review isn't critical of the product, just merely stating I bought the wrong produce for my needs.  I'm replacing this with this:http://www.amazon.com/45142-Choice-Alert-Wireless-Control-Center/dp/B0013V1T2I/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_text_c7This item will let me arm it or disarm it remotely.  I can set it to instantly go off without the countdown by keeping it on home, instead of away.and thishttp://www.amazon.com/45138-Choice-Alert-Wireless-Signal-Repeater/dp/B0013V58QG/ref=pd_sim_hi_5
