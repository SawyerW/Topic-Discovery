I use this along with a Door Jammer / Portable Door Security Device when I travel. I use them both on the room door if there is only one door for the room. However, frequently when I travel I get a suite, and for the inner door for the bedroom, I put this doorstop/alarm, while I use the door jammer on the actual door to the suite.The door stop/alarm is very loud, and will easily wake you up, and will likely scare off a burglar (you're rolling the dice on whether it would scare of a criminal intent on something other than robbery/burglary, though).The door stop/alarm uses a 9 volt battery (not included), and requires a SMALL Phillips head screwdriver to install the battery. I would advise you to just go ahead and pack the screwdriver along with the unit, as I tend to unhook the battery and flip it around when I don't intend to use it (such as when I am packing it into the suitcase) -- thus preventing accidental alarm sounding during transit.To use the unit, once the battery is installed, simply flip the switch to armed, and then press the device under the door so that it is in contact with the door. When I set it, I am usually traveling alone for business, so I KNOW that nobody should be in that room but myself, so I wedge the thing under the door as far as it can go, without it actually setting off the alarm. It has a rubber bottom, and it has a little bit of heft to it, but on linoleum or tile or wood, I would be worried about the device catching properly and thus activating the alarm. Hence my wedging it under the door as far as it will go, so that it is basically on a hair trigger.Final note, if there is a large gap under the door you want to use this on, it would be trivial for anyone but the dumbest/drunkest of thieves/burglars to see the device and push it carefully away from the door without triggering the alarm. So, you should have a backup plan with you in case the door you need to use this on has too high of a gap.4 stars.
