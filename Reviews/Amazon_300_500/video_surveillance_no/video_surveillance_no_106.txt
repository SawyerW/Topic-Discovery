This video baby monitor is not perfect but we love it! We have had it for about a month and here are the pros and cons.I will start with the cons:1. If the baby's room is silent then there is a slight humming noice. (if you have a fan running in the baby's room, or near the camera, then you hear the fan but not the humming)2. If you don't have the camera docked it is hard to see the screen and hear the sound at the same time because you cannot stand the monitor on its end. (But we have gotten around this by putting it into a smaill cup. Plus we don't leave the video playing all of the time so it's really not a big deal)Pros:1. Both the camera and the monitor run on battery so if the power goes out then you can still hear your baby cry.2. The picture is very good even in the dark.3. The monitor is small and easy to take with you around the house.4. If you don't leave the video showing all of the time both the battery in the monitor and the camera will last for quite a long time (some reviews said it wouldn't last through a nap, on the weekends during the day it lasts through multiple naps plus the time that I forget to turn it off).5. The sound is as good as if not better than the sony audio only monitor that we had but we also have the video.6. The cost is reasonable (we got it on amazon for $120)7. You can add up to 4 cameras (we have one right now but we will be adding more as we have more kids).The pros out weigh the cons and the cons have some easy work arounds. We are really happy we got this camera and we would not go back. We would definately purchase this camera again.
