After much research I bought this monitor for my second child and have used it for about four months.  It was a great monitor so I added another camera to use in my son's room as well.  About 4 months in the parent unit completely stopped working with out any warning.  I woke up to a picture of my daughter still and quite when in reality she was awake, screaming, and moving around....and I had NO CLUE!  Obviously I was upset and very disappointed in this monitor.  We'd used it for four months, and had been very gentle with it.  It never fell or was treated roughly.  I contacted Amazon and they replaced the monitor.  (UPDATE:  per the comment from Motorola below I contacted them.  Their "fix" for this issue is to have me pay to send in my defective monitor, and then once they received it they will mail me out a new one.  So I'd not only pay to ship it, but I'd also be waiting a few weeks for a replacement.  Really, that's the best you can do?  Not impressed.  Thankfully I bought it from Amazon and they stand behind their products.  More so than Motorola.)UPDATE #2.  The new unit I received from Amazon seemed to work better.  Then about 13 months in one of the child unit cameras stopped working.  I contacted Motorola about this and reached a helpful rep who sent me out a new camera.  Great, we were back in business!  Now a month later my parent unit suddenly stopped working.  I turned it off after nap time today, and when I went to turn it on for bedtime it will not turn on.  UGH.To date I've had 2 parent units break - one after 4 months, one after 14 months.  I've also had a camera break after 13 months.This is so frustrating as the monitor and cameras work really great while they work.  But they suddenly stop working.  I also have a summer infant monitor from 2010 that is still working great and has seen some abuse.
