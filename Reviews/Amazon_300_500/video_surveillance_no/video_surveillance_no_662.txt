The camera works perfectly.  Night vision is really clear and the audio it picks up is pretty damn good considering how small it is.  I use an app for my iPhone called Foscam Pro to watch my dogs and hear what they are doing while I am at work.  The camera can turn left and right almost 360 degrees and up almost to my ceiling and down.  I like being able to easily view from any webbrower and my phone.  I am thinking about ordering another for my front door.  It comes with two way audio, but requires you to attach a separate speaker for that, probably can pick one up from Radio Shack or use any old school PC speakers that don't require amplification.Pro's:- Rotating camera, silent motor- Excellent Audio and Video- Nice nice vision- Ability to turn off the green activity led flasher- Does not require DMZ to be enabled in your routerCon's:- Bad manual, directions are a bit scarce of good description, so I looked up a different manual online.- DDNS, is confusing and requires you use a third party website to use (just do port forwarding in your router if you plan to access the camera outside of your home network eg: cell phone or from work).Advise:- Attach the camera directly to your router via provided patch cable to start- Use the searching tool and change your port number from the default 80, to anything over 8000 - I used 8098.- Set up port forwarding in your router to the local IP you assigned and port number you chose- FTP set up for recording, and email snap shots isn't too bad either.I have not used the motion alarm just yet on it, but plan too in the future if I add another camera to my front door.I would buy this product again.
