The main reason I got this sucker was because one of my orders from amazon went missing after ups said they delivered it. It was an inexpensive order and Amazon is replacing it but I don't want that happening again.The installation was as simple as it gets since the camera and base station both plug in to your power lines, which they also use to transmit data.The picture quality is very good at 960 x 720 it's the highest resolution consumer security camera I know of. It's very light sensitive so it works well through dusk but not at night. (The outdoor version has night vision)The camera comes with three mounts, a suction cup, a stand and a metal arm that screws in. I went with this camera over the outdoor because I rent a house and didn't want to work out running a power line or drilling a hole to the front porch, instead I just stuck this to the front window.I used the suction cup for a day but then switched to the mounting arm which I attached to the window frame with picture hanging adhesive strips.The camera is very wide angle (120 degrees) so it sees more than you think it might which can actually be a problem if you want to use the camera as a theft deterrent, as a thief might think the camera can't see them. However there is a little blinking light the flashes when the camera detects motion and turns on and that is intimidating.The biggest downside of this camera is that the supposed Android app for it doesn't exist so if you are planning on using that, don't. I can't speak for the iphone or blackberry apps.Another downside is that the motion detector can be too sensitive, when it gets windy the trees set if off. It'd be cool if it could use a learning algorithm to figure out what you wanted recorded.The last downside I can think of is that it tends to split what should be one long recording into several smaller sections, this is only really an issue if you are trying to save them. It should have a threshold for this.My main wishes for the next version would be slightly higher resolution, the ability to save entire days and the ability to schedule recordings whether there is motion or not (for example to prove that a delivery driver wasn't there.)I'd also like to see a version with wi-fi just in case your power lines are too noisy for good transmission.My final suggestion is that I'd like to be able to tilt/swivel the camera on the suction cup mount.
