Let's start with the good:  It's very easy to set up; I thought it was going to really hard as I have setup security camera before and it can get tricky.  The video quality is great but you can get ghost images when something move really fast in front of it.  The night version is awesome even in complete darkness I can see very clear images.  The quality of the camera is excellent as it has a metal shell protecting it and it's weather proof is a plus.  The alert is great and viewing it through my phone or desktop through their website is pretty cool.Now, it's the bad:  After paying about $350 for just 1 camera, Logitech stick it to you with another $80 yearly subscription fees for "premium service" which, I think, suppose to be included already with the software.  The software is very limited as you probably want to use a different software to view it.  I was recommended to Blue Iris but I haven't tried it yet.  Since the memory is in the camera and all the recorded video are recorded on there, if someone takes the camera, you have no evidences.  The $80 yearly subscription is just for you be able to view your recorded video but I wish it would able to save it onto Logitech server so in case the camera get stolen.  Sometimes Logitech server goes down and you wouldn't be able to view what's going on and have to rely on the recorded videos and you can view them when you get home or purchase the $80 subscription.I am debating either to keep the camera or not since it's going to get really expensive and I don't think their "premium service" is worth the $80; $30 I can see but sticking it to their customer at $80 is a bit much.  I would recommend purchase this camera so you can try it out yourself but make sure the store you purchase have a good return policy.
