First of all, I agree this camera is very easy to setup, literally in about a minute or two, you can have the camera up and running.  I bought it because it was a Samsung and I have had great success with their products.  I also bought it because, it optionally uses a wired setup to the router and since I intended on placing the camera in the room with the router, I might as well have a wired access for faster more reliable use.If you intend on using this as a baby room monitor or other room in the house that you occupy within the wireless router then, it is a great camera.However, if you want to use this camera as remote monitoring, using Samsung's website then I say beware.  If you want to view the camera with the website, then you are stuck in "relay mode".This means that you are limited to 3 minutes of use and very slow, grainy response since your video is passing thru Samsung's servers.  I called the toll free number that was included in the package.  The explanation given was that I am using 2 devices prior to the camera.  Namely a cable modem and a router!!  Samsung support indicates that they do not support live remote monitoring unless you are connected directly to the modem, not the router!!  What's the point of having a wireless camera then?Samsung clearly missed the mark on this productupdate May 23, 2013Apparently last night Samsung did an update on their website for monitoring this camera.  In the process, the deleted all the registration information and I have to re-register with the serial number from my camera.  Well, I'm not sitting next to my camera, that's the whole point.  Customer service cannot give you your serial number over the phone and they don't know why camera registration's got deletedStay away from this camera-
