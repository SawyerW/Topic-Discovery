Overall, the cameras are good, the software is excellent and the ease of setup is pretty good. The weakness of this system is in the limitations that it imposes on installation and the powerline over Ethernet setup.I understand the niche that Logitech is trying to serve, but unfortunately, it falls short for me.I need a good reliable, fully mounted, outdoor video system. The Logitech install doesn't allow for attic installation and an extension cord is not an option to mount the unit on the corner of my house.The main problem is that any security system is usually going to need to be mounted on the corner of a house or the corner of a building where an outlet (to connect the power) is no where to be found and is usually directly installed via the attic, or a high ceiling.These limitations make the camera more of a spot surveillance system instead of a dedicated serious unit.I would recommend a little more robust system for the money spent, if you are looking to simply spy on your teenage daughter and need a night vision camera that points in one direction, then this camera could fit the bill.The ability to record without the PC being on and the ability to stream to your iPhone make it a good teenager or simple spy camera to catch the neighbors dogs pooping in your lawn at night. In that regard, the software is really easy to use, the camera video quality is excellent, although night vision can be a little grainy ... I think this is due to a slightly underpowered IR light on the camera ....Other wise it is a solid build with easy hook up and directions. Logitech customer service has always been good (I did not need them for this product - but I have called them before for other things).If the camera had a more flexible install range - it would be a 4 star .... maybe 5 review.
