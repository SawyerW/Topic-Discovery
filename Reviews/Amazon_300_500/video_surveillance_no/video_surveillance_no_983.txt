We had an awesome Summer monitor from about 2008-2009 but eventually the pieces begin to wear out and we needed a monitor for a new baby, so we tried a few different models.1. The Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White completely borked our wifi.2. The Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision just felt really cheap and we didn't like it (I know we returned it, but I didn't write a review so I can't remember exactly what we didn't love).3. The Lorex LW2004 Video Baby Monitor with 2.4-inch LCD and Automatic Night Vision had wonky connection stability, lots of beeping, super low volume, poor touch capability...So I was eager to try out this Lorex.PROS* Works right out of the box--you just plug everything in and it works. I didn't even need instructions...even for the Settings.* Decently clear picture.* You can have up to four cameras and view them all at the same time (vs. the Summer's two cameras where you had to flip the A/B switch).* I got a signal at the far back of our yard (at least 40 yards). It did blink to "out of range" but then popped right back up. Be sure to put the antenna up!* It picks up sound well--I had it in my son's room upstairs and it picked up my daughter crying downstairs (which I heard when I was taking my test walk into the back yard).MEHS*We didn't need a night light so I didn't care about this...but if we did, it's really close to the baby since it's (obviously) on the camera which is placed close to the crib. So it's not like you could use it for changing a diaper across the room.CONS* Plastic units feel cheap.* The pan/tilt function is manual.* The kickstand for the monitor is almost useless--it doesn't lock in place so turns easily and the unit falls over.Overall, I give it four stars for an "I like it" rating. It's definitely not perfect, but it works well enough for our needs.
