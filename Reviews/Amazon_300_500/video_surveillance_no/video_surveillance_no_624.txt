Pros:* The low price.* Quality of construction.Cons:* Limited to 120 degrees field of view compared to 170 degrees offered by other action camera competitors.* Limited camera mounting options.* Grainy Low light capture.* Limited after market accessories like waterproof housing for submersed activity greater than the rated 30 feet.* cannot charge unit while in use.Because of the low entry price the camera is good introduction to Action Camera's but in my opinion it is not as good as the comparable offerings made by Contour or GoPro or Sony Action camera.It looks similar to design to a Polaroid XS100HD HD action camera.The biggest negative for me is the limited field of view of 120 degrees. I tested it on a bike ride, car dash camera and on AR15 rifle and the narrower field of view kept me wanting more...!!!Color is not corrected and can prove drab, flat and subdued in certain light conditions. In bright day light the colors are great.Configuration is minimal and requires connection to a PC or TV via HDMI port. There are instructions on how to do it without using a video monitor by clicking on the power button but that would be hard to do for the uninitiated.The auto orientation only works only 2 ways. 0 degrees and 180 ( upside down) . It does not correct at 90 degrees or 270 degrees like the Polaroid.I had trouble hearing the sound using Windows Media player and I thought I had a bad camera, but after searching the web and emailing MonoPrice tech support I downloaded another free video player called MPC-HC and the sound problem went away.As opposed to the other reviews sound capture is acceptable. It definitely does not cancel wind noise though.I initially planned to use to scuba diving at shallow depth less than the rated 30 feet ( 1 atmosphere) but I see no noticeable O-ring at the cap covering the rear outputs that I don't think I will even attempt it. I would only do it with a underwater housing.For my needs, I would have preferred it to have wider field of view and an available underwater housing option.I honestly cannot give this unit a 5 star rating even for it price point. It would be between 3-4 stars.
