I recently installed a cheap Zmodo DVR system on my home. The cameras that were bundled with it are terrible, with incorrect colors (black displaying purple, and green displaying brown) and awful IR performance. I bought this camera as a replacement for my driveway cam and wow, what a difference. The daytime picture looks good, but the IR is 100% better. The IR illumination has great throw. The wide angle lens works well to see the larger area. The Zmodo power supply couldn't power this camera, so I did have to use the included power supply by hooking it into the Zmodo wire bundle I already ran, which worked perfectly. I'm going to purchase a few more of these to replace the junk cameras that came in my kit.The only reason I deduct one star is because the dinky mounting screw supplied with this wouldn't let me attach the mount to the top of the camera. There is a threaded hole there, but the screw isn't long enough to thread in. Other than that small complaint, this camera is good value for the money.Update: After almost 4 months about half of the IR LEDs have burned out on this camera. Deducting another star for this. Still not a bad camera for the price, as there aren't many alternatives in this price range. No fogging or leaking problems, but my camera is mounted under the eve so there is no direct exposure to precipitation. We'll see how it handles cold winter temps. I'll update my review in a few months.Update: I have three of these cameras mounted now, all for just over 1 year. The IR LEDs have almost completely failed on all three. The LEDs seem to be arranged in 4 banks/quadrants. None of the cameras have more than one functional bank of LEDs. Surprisingly, they still have good clarity at night even with minimal IR illumination. The cameras themselves are functioning well in all other aspects.
