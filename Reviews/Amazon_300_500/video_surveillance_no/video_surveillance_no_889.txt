The control software is not at all user friendly.  My biggest gripe is that it doesn't allow you to scan the alarm log (motion detect events)  for a specific camera or a time period.  So you are forced to start at the beginning (or end) of a possibly large log for a certain day, and  shuffle through it by clicking "next" (or "previous"), 8 entries at a time.  There is no indication in the log for the camera that caused the alarm, so you have to look at them all.Another example  of poor design decisions is in the interplay of "full time" and "alarm only" video recording.  If a busy camera is set to record all the time during the day, and then only on alarm (motion) events after hours, you still get many many alarm events in the log during the day.  And these are mixed in with alarm events from other cameras that are only operated by motion.  It makes it hard to scan the log for meaningful events from these alarm-only cameras.  It would have been much better if the logging of alarm events during "full time" recording was a user choice.  Even just identifying the camera causing the alarm (see above) would have helped.In one situation, the control software is really clumsy.  If you are setting up a camera to record on a schedule, you select "schedule mode" on the "recording" screen for the  camera, and then select "schedule" to actually set up the schedule". Even though you may have been configuring camera 3, you are always presented with the schedule for camera 1.  You must select camera 3 again.  I have mistakenly set the schedule for camera 1 on more than one occasion.  Not a big deal, and it was my fault because I didn't pay close enough attention.  It just is not intuitive. even though everything is labelled.On the other hand, the connection to the time server is easy to set up.  The time server is absolutely necessary because the internal clock drifts.
