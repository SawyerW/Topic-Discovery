We purchased this monitor to keep an eye on our twins while they slept.  The first thing we noticed was the exrtremely short battery life.  The monitor only lasted, at most, four hours before the battery was so low that it beeped until we turned it off or plugged in the charger.  Due to this, we were never able to leave the monitor on through the night without having it plugged in to the charger.About six months into owning the monitor, the screen began to display green lines through it and eventually the entire screen turned bright green rendering the device unusable.  I called customer service which was a complete joke!  The first time I called I was 17th in line (the message stated).  After four minutes I was disconnected.  I called back and was then 25th in the que.  After a length of time the system gave me the opportunity to leave my phone number and someone would contact me back when my place in the que came about.  three hours and NO CALL.  I called back.  When I finally did contact someone, they stated that someone would contact me after i filled out the email that they would send me and I also had to scan my receipt and attach it to the email.  He would not tell me when I could expect a call back.  As I write this it has been over two weeks and no response from the company.  I have sent emails following up on the service which have gone unanswered.  I have called and have yet to get ahold of anyone in the service department (I have yet to be lower than 27th in the que and the auto call back feature rarely works).In summation, this device works well when it works which, in our experience, is rare.  We have had nothing but trouble with the monitor and the company.  The customer service is HORRIBLE!  I truly believe that the support a company provides customers tells a lot about the company and this company DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO ITS PRODUCT REGARDLESS OF STATED WARRANTIES.  Stay away and purchase another brand!
