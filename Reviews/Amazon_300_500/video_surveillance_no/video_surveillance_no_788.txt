When this monitor works it is AWESOME. I wish the product was more consistent. I would not continue to buy this monitor if the customer service department at Buy Buy Baby was not so wonderful. Unfortunately, the customer service department for the actual Motorola baby monitors is AWFUL. If I had bought a cheap monitor I would have expected to get what I paid. However, I bought one of the most expensive monitors on the market. Naively, I expected the monitor to last at least 2-3 years.* I was told by one agent that at least I got a good year out of my monitor.* I was lucky they extended the warranty from 1 year to 14 months. However, they would not replace my new monitor with a new monitor but rather a refurbished one. They said if there were any problems with this unit they would not send me another one.* This is a paraphrase: Essentially they knew their customer service was bad so if I was so unhappy I could go buy a different monitor.Negatives:* The first one I bought the camera at night and even during the day was extremely fuzzy. I simply thought this was something that was normal. This was also the one that broke after a year. Bought a 2nd camera for our new baby and was astounded by the picture difference. The 2nd camera was crystal clear.* Battery life is not great and only continues to get worse as used. I have had this brand new one for less than 6 weeks and it will not hold a charge longer than 2 hours unplugged.I really wish they were better quality. Right now I am unsure if I am going to keep the newest one I bought from Buy Buy Baby or return it. I am still waiting for my refurbished unit from Motorola. I really had high hopes. I know there is no monitor that is perfect, but great customer service goes a long way.
