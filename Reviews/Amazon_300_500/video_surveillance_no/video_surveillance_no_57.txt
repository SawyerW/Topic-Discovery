This camera has given me a good idea of what goes on in my back yard at night (lots of rabbits, a coyote and a stray dog).  I don't need it for daytime photos but since I can't switch off daytime photos, I just have to delete them later.Note that the daytime shots are 3.1 megapixels whereas the nightime IR shots are 1.3MP.  This makes the night shots grainy.  However, since I was looking for what was on my lawn, not for shots to show people, it is sufficient.The manual says that the IR detector detects both motion (as with your flootlight motion detector) and heat.  But both are not required as motion alone will trigger photos, like blowing branches.  For night shots, both the medium and sensitive settings are triggered by motion outside the range of the photo.  However, I keep it at medium as the low setting results in few photos.The night lighting is made by an array of IR leds which illuminate about 20' range as can be seen in the photos as light on the lawn.  For some reason this lighted area is not seen if the camera is put into Video mode, and the videos seem to be much darker than the stills.  I can only see the eye-reflections of the bunnies, whereas the still show the bunnies.I would say the ideal application of this camera is by a trail where the target will pass by within 10'.Another thing I've noticed is that at night the the illuminating IR leds are partially in the visible red, i.e. when you walk by and trigger the photos, you can see the led array glowing red.  My dog seems to notice it (though it could have been the camera she noticed).The four D batteries last for thousands of still pictures in cool winter.UPDATE:  Lasted 6 months.  Turn switch on and nothing happens, no readout, nothing.  Batteries should be OK but replaced them anyway - no joy.
