This DVR is full of features.  I bought DVR and no cameras.I already had 8 or 9 cameras from eBay.I upgraded from a PC with security camera video capture card.I spent about an hour reading and then seutp the mouse/DVR on my monitor.Went through the simple 6 or 7 step initial setup first.Next, I got it a static ip address for my home network and found the correct port (85). I then swapped over to my laptop for rest of the configuration.You can NOT set the static ip address or DNS from the a computer on the local network, it is best done with the DVR mouse.Once I figured that out, I was good as gold.I then hooked up my cameras and configured them.  4 cameras are setup for D1 resolution and others are setup for CIF resolution.  The D1 is almost 4 times more pixels than the CIF, thus better picture (assuming your cameras will provide such a picture).  There are 2 audio ports so you can record on 2 channels.  There are 3 video ouputs (Hi-def for LCD or LED TV, computer jack for computer monitor and a BNC output).The iPhone app is neat.  Some app reviews say the new upgraded iPhone app is sad.I found that it worked great.I can also sit at my desk in the office at work and watch my house and the pets.Even with my "lame" internet connection.  I am 1.5 download and 256 upload.Thus, from my house to work computer is only 256k connection.This sure was alot easier than learning Linux and Zoneminder.I tried Linux/Zoneminder and it kicked my aspirin right out of the bottle for 2 weeks.Cons...  there are options available to the new user of Q-See that are not fully explained in the manual.Pros.... easy setup and lots of uTube videos and there is a support structure at Q-See.  The knowledge base is very useful and searchable.I picked this one over the Z-modo because of the price, favorable reviews and D1 option.These are the specs from 1 of the 4, D1 cameras that I have hooked up.Since I only have 4 hooked up they seem to record at D1 with a framerate of 29 FPS.I only have 4 cameras hooked up right now and the rest of my cameras will be CIF.===Recorded Video File specs===Complete File name  : C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\Security DVR\CAM04_20140223104311_928205406.aviFormat  : AVIFormat/Info  : Audio Video InterleaveFile size  : 124 MiBDuration  : 12mn 22sOverall bit rate  : 1 405 KbpsVideoID  : 0Format  : AVCFormat/Info  : Advanced Video CodecFormat profile  : Baseline@L3.0Format settings, CABAC  : NoFormat settings, ReFrames  : 1 frameCodec ID  : H264Duration  : 12mn 22sBit rate  : 1 399 KbpsWidth  : 704 pixelsHeight  : 480 pixelsDisplay aspect ratio  : 3:2Frame rate  : 29.970 fpsStandard  : NTSCColor space  : YUVChroma subsampling  : 4:2:0Bit depth  : 8 bitsScan type  : ProgressiveBits/(Pixel*Frame)  : 0.138Stream size  : 124 MiB (100%)=================================================
