My first impressions of this Wireless Pan and Tilt Camera were good.  The Mac install wizard was looking good, and the physical quality of the unit, along with included accessories, was better than other cameras I've reviewed in this price range.I quickly ran into trouble trying to join my WPA2-encrypted wireless network, though.Likes:- Audio works with wireless!  Out of 5 wifi webcams I've tried, all have bad interference noise on the audio when using WiFi.  Not this one.- Compact and well-built compared to other Pan/Tilt webcams in this price range.- Web GUI and setup wizard are fairly polished and work good (except the WPA2 issue I mention).- Impressive low-light performance for this price range.  This thing could make out images in my very dark basement.- Comes with ethernet cable.- Includes decent vertical mount system with a drilling template.Dislikes:- I could not get this camera to join my WPA2 wireless network.  I tried the web gui as well as the Mac install wizard.  Multiple times.  No go.  The only other device I've ever had this problem with was another cheap pan/tilt camera (by trendnet).  Not sure if this is a coincidence, or if they share some buggy firmware components.  I have some theories about this but no fix.  Perhaps it is because I have a bridged wireless network configuration.  Or, perhaps it is because my WPA2 passphrase could be interpreted as HEX or ASCII.  I did upgrade to the latest firmware (1.0.1).  Hopefully DLink addresses this.(I did get it working on my WEP network, buy using the web GUI to set the wireless settings, then saving, pulling the Ethernet, and unplugging and powering back up).I will update this review as I continue playing with it.  If I can find a way to join my WPA2 wireless network I'll explain my workaround.  I'll also continue to try new firmware revisions.
