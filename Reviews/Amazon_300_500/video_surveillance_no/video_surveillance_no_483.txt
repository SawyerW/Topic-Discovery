I wanted something like this mainly because I just wanted to keep an eye on things while I'm out of the house. I'll be honest, I was curious about what the dog does while we're not there (short answer: very little). If I find a good way to use this thing as a security camera, then that would be its eventual purpose.  But for now, I'm just intrigued by the wireless camera technology.Unfortunately, in practice it leaves something to be desired.  First of all, 640x480 has not been an acceptable resolution for ANYTHING since 2002. I can't possibly see how it would be difficult to bump up the resolution to at least four times that.Secondly, the focus ring in front of the lens is twitchy.  Yeah, you can get a pretty good focus on it but just by taking your finger off, it shifts the focus.  It's really tough to get it just right.Third, the software is frustrating.  I've tried panning around on my iPhone 5 and on my iPad (3rd gen), and in both cases it's really slow.  Click the button, wait several seconds, click the button again, etc.  It's slightly faster on wifi, but even LTE is rough. Sometimes the software just gives up on me and it won't register my presses at all.Updating the firmware for the device cannot be done over a wireless connection.  You need to uninstall the device from its location, bring it to your router and connect it to your network via ethernet in order to do the update.It's not all bad... I mean, the infrared night mode works surprisingly well, the wide angle of the lens is excellent -- I can see the entire living room by panning only twice. Maybe I'm just expecting something that's beyond this price range. But I feel like I should WANT to use it, but in reality I dread it because the image quality is poor and the mobile software makes you want to tear your hair out.
