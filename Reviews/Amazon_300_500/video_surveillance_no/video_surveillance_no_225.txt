I am disappointed. I bought the Alert camera system and installed it and my outdoor camera only worked for a month. It was too late to return through Amazon so I contacted Logitech's warranty department. I was told I would be eligible for a replacement and that a shipping label would come to my email in 24-48 hours. None came.I had to then contact support (again) where they told me they couldn't generate a label without my address, which no one asked me for (or notified me they did not have). Finally I get my label and I return my camera.I am then notified it has been received and that I should be getting notification of my replacement camera's shipping info. Nothing comes. A few days later I get an email that my issue is closed. Nice.It's been well over a month now that I've not had a working camera - not a very effective security system with a non functional and now a non-existent camera. I contacted support today concerned that my issue has been closed and yet here I am without my broken camera or any news of receiving a replacement. I am now told the cameras are backordered and I will not receive one for several more weeks. I was only told this because I contacted Logitech myself, no updates were given to me without my calls to support.I guess Logitech expects their customers who trust in their ability to provide security (through an expensive camera system) to just wait patiently for their replacements for weeks on end. In the meantime I am using up my valuable warranty period (clearly I've lost confidence in the ability of the cameras to last and work properly for a long period of time) with no camera at all.If you buy this, I hope yours works more than a month. And if you have to replace it via warranty - I hope you actually get a camera back!
