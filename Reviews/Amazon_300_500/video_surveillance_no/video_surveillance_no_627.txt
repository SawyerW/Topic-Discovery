This is a very nice and complete home or small business security system.  I have the 8 camera package but I notice it also comes with just 4 (which would have been enough for my home).  The 500GP hard drive DVR unit needs to be located in a central place since the cameras are hard-wired and will need to radiate out from there.  The cables for the cameras are about 50' long, and are included with them.  I think I would have preferred wireless, which would be much easier to set up, but that would probably be more expensive.  The DVR can be connected to a computer monitor or HD television and comes with a mouse which makes it easy to use.Setup wasn't difficult using just the color manual, but there are also online videos if needed.  Cameras can be set up to either record during certain hours or use the default motion detection feature.  You can even set it up to email you when motion is detected.  This might be a very useful feature for a business but turned out not to be useful for the cameras I set up at home, as I was getting too many emails.  There is also an app for the iPhone that allows you to view the cameras and a cable is included to connect it to your router, but I didn't try it.  But overall, the computer interface is very easy to use.The cameras are very good and I was impressed with the quality of the picture - even better than the Defender Digital Wireless DVR Security System I already have been using.  Picture is in color during the day and the nighttime vision looks like b&w.;  But since it is not wireless you need to put some thought into where you'll be locating everything and where to run the cables.  But for the price, this is a very good and quality security system.
