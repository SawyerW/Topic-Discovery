I don't understand why this product has so many negative reviews.  Those reviews had me searching for alternatives for about a week.  In the end though, I decided to give this model a try primarily because of the Linksys name (same as my router), ability to easily record to a hard drive, WPA2 security and wireless-N capability which is rare in this price range (most are wireless-g.)Setup was a breeze.  I inserted the disk, followed the directions and was up and running in minutes.  The only thing that slowed the process down for me is I never remember my router password.  So after resetting my router, setting up my network again and creating a new password, I completed the configuration process.  Once that was done, I was quickly able to view the camera via the software console, web console and even safari browser from my iPhone.Viewing online has been nice with plenty of basic settings (image size, quality, framerate, recording settings, etc) editable on-demand.  The image quality is better than I expected both in light and in low light.  It is also nice that the camera is fully functional without a computer turned on at my house.  Of course, if you want to record, you'll need to leave a computer or some device turned on.I've only had the camera a day so I have not tested recording, scheduling and motion detection, but those will be tested very soon.  Should any issues/problems come up, I will update this review.  For now though, I couldn't be happier with my purchase at this price point.  As a side note, I considered other more expensive models (primarily Logitech Alert 750i Indoor Master - HD-quality Security System(961-000329)) but decided that was more functionality and too pricey for my needs.I had to come back and update my rating to 4 stars because I had trouble getting the recording working.  I was never able to get a scheduled recording to start.
