We bought this camera for our kid's playhouse, which is about 60' away from our house and wireless router.  It took me a while to get it functioning (the directions are kind of cryptical) but is now works wirelessly in the playhouse and serves as a great child monitor.  There is a growling on the audio but I can still hear what the kids are saying.  I hooked up a speaker to it and now they can hear me talking from my laptop.  My wireless internet is kind of slow, so sometimes the audio does not work too great, and there is about a 2 second delay on the video, which is no big deal.My kids (now only 4 and 7) think the camera is great, and looks like R2D2.  I'm sure their opinion will change if the camera lasts a few more years!The night vision is impressive.  We have trained the kids to turn the camera on with a powerstrip when they enter the playhouse, and turn it off when they leave, otherwise the camera is on all of the time and the red led's are on all night, and I am hoping they will last longer if we only have the camera on when we need it.The pan and tilt is very wide-ranging - we can look out the playhouse window back at our house, and scan the back yard also.  I had to mount the camera in the window of the playhouse to get adequate wireless communication with the camera.  My wireless router is in our basement.This camera has more functions than I will ever use, including e-mail notification, remote computer sign-in, alarm, etc. which would be great for security purposes if you have enough technical savvy to set these features up.This unit is legitimate, definitely not a piece of junk.  It works.  Don't expect great video or audio quality, but the video quality is just as good as some public webcams you can view, if not better.  Highly recommend this camera as an economical, multi-featured wireless webcam.  We have been running ours on and off for about two months with no problems.
