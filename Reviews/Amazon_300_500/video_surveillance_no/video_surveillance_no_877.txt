I purchased this and the Kare N7502JV. I prefer the Kare N7502JV at a $20 savings.  This camera was not as easy to setup, the menus are a little clunkier than the Kare cam.  It has an excellent picture for the cost.  Night vision works well in the chicken coop.  I was able to identify the culprit killing my chickens the 1st night.  The mount is adequate but only works on the bottom of the camera, therefore it is only mountable above a surface.  It is impossible to mount under an overhang.  Frame rate is slow over wireless but acceptable.  Using LAN cable improves performance but defeats the reason I purchased it, ease of deployment.  The documentation is poor at best and both cameras came with cracked CDs that still worked.  The guide on the CD is actually for a different PTZ model.  The internal web server works great.  DDNS us not usable if it is on your home network.  I was able to change the port to 8081 and put the port forward in my router and can access the camera via my android phone over the internet with ease.  The included software is confusing at best.  I played with it for about an hour trying to figure the new camera out but soon abandoned it for better software.  I prefer to use the free version of Vitamin D for alarming and triggering although it reduces the resolution. I am considering the $50 for 2 cams full resolution.  I have also found that ContaCam (open source) works well.  Lastly,  the Agasio has an internal alarm triggering connection and 2 way microphone jacks.  I did not use them so I cannot comment on the performance.  All in all, the camera is ok but I prefer the Kare camera in the same class.  I am considering purchasing another Kare for my monitoring needs.
