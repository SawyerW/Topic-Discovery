Have not used wireless webcam function so this review is just re: simple physically seeing your child on screen...PROS:1. The screen is a decent size. You can get a good view of the entire crib.2. Wall installation is relatively easy.CONS:1. The light and music buttons are located on inconvenient places around the screen so you need to be extremely careful whenever you touch the screen. Cannot tell you how many times I adjusted the monitor and accidentally turned on the light and/or music.2. The adaptor will probably break. For those of you who have the constant annoying beeping alert problem I recommend checking your cord. After 3 sleepless nights of continous beeping found a tear on the cord close to the actual adaptor. Basically the unit was not always being charged so the unit would then turn off and on all night. Every single time this happens it triggers an alert. No sleep! Just purchased a new adaptor today and am writing this review hoping to help those of you missing sleep because of this super annoying alert problem! Will not purchase another Samsung product but trying to make the best use of what I have until I find a replacement...3. Last and most important... the customer support is terrible. Rather than trying to explain here are the actual responses received cut/pasted directly from email correspondence.Re: Date and Time constantly resetting 2010-6-10 12:00 when the unit is turned off (email sent 1 year ago)Return correspondence: "We are aware of this bug and a firmware has been completed to remedy this issue. However, it is currently being tested and will be available for download soon"Status: After 1+ year no response... spent all of 2012 with no date or time...Re: Temperature display being off 7-12 degreesReturn correspondence: "unfortunately, that is an issue with the hardware and we cannot fix the problem"
