Right out of the box, we loved this monitor. The picture and reception are very clear, the sound is great. The night vision capability is mind-blowing. We tested it when the baby's room was totally dark, and I was shocked at how much we could see! I love that you can do so many things from the monitor itself: the two-way intercom feature, so you can talk to your baby without actually going into the room, the nightlight that you can turn on remotely, the various (albeit sometimes strange sounding) lullabies that you can also play remotely, all are fantastic.Two cables are also included: an RCA cable that can be plugged into the back of a TV, so you can see your baby even bigger, if you so choose - which works very well. There is also a USB cable that is supposed to make it so you can use Skype, or various other instant message programs to view your baby on your computer. The computer feature was attractive to my husband and me, mainly because my husband works from home and to be able to click a window and bring up a picture-in-picture image of the baby seemed an obvious (and very cool) choice - but it doesn't work - at least that we know of. We both installed the software on each of our computers - his is a Mac, mine is a PC - and we've tried several times to get it working to no avail. We did conclude, though, that since the actual monitor has to be plugged into the computer for this feature to work, it's not the end of the world. The image and sound may not pop up on the computer like this monitor boasts, but it's not like you can't just pick up the monitor, which can't be more than a couple feet away, and see and hear your baby just the same. It's just kind of a bummer that one of the coolest features that this thing claims to have doesn't deliver.Still, I wouldn't shy away from this product. For the price, it works extremely well, and as long as we keep the monitor plugged in and charged, we'll be able to see our little baby girl whenever we like, day or night.
