Not only does this have great picture quality (even in the Black & white night mode)they are both crisp and clear, very impressive and you can even zoom in (*it also displays the room temp!)and with the "Two-Way Talk" feature I can speak directly through the monitor's built-in  mic.! This is perfect for Gramma (aka me!! LOL) as I worry more now that my hearing (and eyesight) isn't as good as it was when my kids were babies.Another cool feature that I use to create "background sound" to prevent a rude awakening due to a phone ringing etc is the "Sleep & Soothe Sound" feature which has 5 background sounds from nature (the beach waves and rainfall are my faves) to help lull them to sleep.My goodness, I can even add a "Lorex Baby Wi-Fi Cradle" (*this is bought separately) it is an accessory will transmit your camera's video feed online so you can also connect with a pc, smart phone, tablet etc and even take pictures and save on my devices (you'll need a microSD card for that but they are cheap these days, if you don't already have an extra one), you can also expand the view to 4 rooms at a time if you need that by buying extra cameras! I only need the one right now but I can see when they are getting into the toddler stage where this may be needed to keep an eye on them in all rooms that are open to them (I have an open floor plan)I can also switch to a "power save" mode (It turns off screen and keeps mic on to hear your child's breathing sounds so you can monitor how deep they are sleeping w/out keeping the picture turned on!)I like that as if I am quick I can get back in there and rock the bassinet gently to get them back to sleep or turn them on their other side. I like the night light it emits, I find it just right for my older eyes.There are loads of other features you can play with but these are the main ones that I am over the moon about!Oh, forgot to mention the battery will last me all night (the book says up to 8 hours and I think that is pretty close from my experience, but I usually switch it off video to sound only when I go to bed) although I usually just leave it attached as I don't move it around often. If you keep it on video all night I would just be sure to keep it (the usb charger) plugged into the monitor to be safe.FYI, It also feels nice and solidly made, not a lightweight cheap build like most things these days, it feels like it will last through many grandbabies (if I'm that blessed!) ;-)
