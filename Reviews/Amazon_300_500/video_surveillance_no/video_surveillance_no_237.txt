Love the camera works great 99% of the time, it went off line this morning at 8:o1 am for no reason had to unplug all and reinstall power to all, why???  The customer service is very poor and the people that answer the phone like Alfonso T need to go back to school he did not know what my questions were and kept responding with soom off the wall answers. I finally got my answers for a computer programmer friend.  Why can I not access my camera live feed from another computer??? I don't care about the allert system as much as having a live feed (say at work or staying at kids home for a week or over the holidays) an wanting to see that the system is up and running and all is well.  Why can we not have FTP output to another computer, cust. service said you need web cam for that not a secutity camera, well I have 2 Foscam cameras and they are live on my web site to I can watch them anywhere in the world that has internet access.  So Logitech need to get with the program and fix this.  An hire cust service people that can do more than answer the phone and give people a bunch of crap and then want us to write a good review on them (good luck on that).If you are going to sit home and watch feed or spend all that money on an Iphone with the high monthly bill for service for motion view that does not show much and get alerts of bugs or bats, etc. flying in front of camera I would not buy another. Would buy if Logitech got in line with other secutiry camera co'c. and have software to view live feed on any web site I want not just logitech's.
