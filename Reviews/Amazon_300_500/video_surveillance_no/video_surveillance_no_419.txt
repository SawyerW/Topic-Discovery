Just recently we had 2 separate break-ins in our neighborhood, and even though we had never had problems here before we decided it was time to do something to help stave off the potential of falling victim to these guys. We didn't want to get locked into a long contract that would have us paying $30-50 per month to a security monitoring company, so I looked into how I could set one up myself.After searching high and low through every local store in our area it became very clear that the only way I was going to do this was to buy something online and pray it would work since it's such a pain to buy something online only to find out that what you bought is no good and you may or may not ever see your money again if you try and ship it back. After reading all the reviews regarding various wireless security systems and seeing that this company had rave reviews (which at first I suspected could only be written by the company itself), I finally took a chance and purchased the Fortress S02 A security system after calling them to see if they could deliver it in time before we were suppose to go on vacation. I spoke to the owner Michael this past Friday and I received the system yesterday which was Monday. When he heard my concern about how long it would take to get here he went above and beyond what his delivery schedule states of 2-3 business days and had it rush shipped from Washington state to North Carolina.When it came to installation I couldn't believe how simple it was to install, and yet how effective it was when I tested it. All the windows/doors sensors and motion sensors came preprogrammed so all I had to do was put them where I wanted them and program the phone numbers I wanted it to contact into the base unit and I was done in less than 1 hour. The instruction manual was incredibly simple to understand so everything went like a charm. When testing it I couldn't believe how loud the alarm was so I have no doubt that not only will all my neighbors hear it if somebody tries to break in, but the thieves will most likely retreat as quickly as possible when they realize that they are not as stealth as they thought.
