Once you have this camera up and going, it does an excellent job. It's got good picture quality, good night vision, works wirelessly, etc.BUT... getting it up and going is will be a nightmare if you are not technically inclined.I consider myself pretty technically savvy and I still found it somewhat challenging.  The included instructions are essentially useless.  Instead, search here for the review by jammendolia which contains step-by-step information for getting this camera set up. Without it, I would probably would have sent this back and gotten a refund.That being said, even the instructions by jammendolla aren't fool proof. They start off by advising to install the software that comes on the included CD, which is supposed to auto-run and walk you through installation.  It doesn't...I tried two different PCs - one running Win7 and one running XP.  The disk wouldn't run on either.  I opened the disk tried double-clicking on the installer as well as other included applications, and each time I got an error message that said "this is not a valid Win32 application," even though it had a .exe extension.I finally gave up on the CD, and did a google search to see if I could download the software. The one program you really need is "Search IP Camera," and I was actually able to download it from the EasyN website. (It's a .rar archive, so you'll have to have a program like WinZip to unpack it.)The downloaded version worked just fine.  But bear in mind - getting this software is just the beginning in a fairly involved process.There is no excuse for shipping an installer disk with errors, and there's no reason it should take a degree in computer science to install a freakin' webcam! I probably should have given this thing 2 stars, but like I said, I was pretty happy with it, once I finally got it going.
