I did a review back in January where I was less than thrilled with this camera.  Some things have changed to convince me to update the review.  I purchased two more camera, identical to this, but a different brand name.  The first had a lens so distorted it was unusable, the second was dead on arrival.  The people at HooToo took my review seriously, I have never seen a company in 50 years of mail ordering that was so interested in customer satisfaction.  I received a call a week or so ago and was asked what they could do to make things better.  I asked for a tech support guy to call me.  Which he did, and in about 10 minutes it was decided the camera (not so much me) was defective.  Picture quality is excellent, customer support could not be better.  I am changing this to a most positive review and would recommend this camera and company.From January 19, 2013:  I don't know how many times I gave up over the past two weeks trying to get this thing to connect wireless.  Only to try one more time.  I just managed to do it, not sure just what setting on the router or camera did the trick.  It sure was stubborn.  If it ever disconnects, I'm probably screwed.  Anyway, it can be done.  It is a nice little camera for the money and probably a bit more.  I have a long network cable, hard wired in, it works fine.  And probably not a big deal, there still needs to be a power supply cable anyway.  But it was the principal - its supposed to be wireless.  A discussion one day of the virtues of Google vs. Bing (I'm a Google fan), led me to try Bing and found much more information.  There is some free software out there called Ispy (Google it), that is amazing for setting up monitoring and actually recognizes and supports this particular camera surveillance purposes.  Much better than the factory software.  My wireless connection was done through the factory software, however.  Would I buy another one?  No way.  But it has been a learning experience.
