This is a great buy and I am impressed by the intensity and volume of the alarm.We had an intruder in our back yard and prior to the police arriving he was tapping on my daughters window.  She became scared of her room because she worried someone might be able to open her window.  We talked with her about what might help her feel safe. One thing she suggested was an alarm that would sound if someone tried to open the window. I started looking for window alarms and found this package.  For three window alarms this package was very reasonably priced the bonus is the included door alarm that has a code to disarm.When the package arrived we tried out the alarms, the chime is very loud and simply signals once that the door has been opened. We can hear the chime from any room in the house if the windows are opened.  In the alarm setting there is a constant alarm until the window is closed. It is very loud and can even be heard by our neighbors (all of the plots in our neighborhood are about an acre so it is impressive that the neighbors can hear it). We do have attentive neighbors and they will call the police and investigate if they here an alarm.Though this is not a monitored alarm system (we live in a very rural area where there aren't many options on monitored systems and the ones available simply alert the police and unfortunately a call from an alarm company does not rank as a high priority call, though a call from a home owner that there is a trespasser will bring a very fast response.) the alarm is loud enough that it should scare off an intruder.  If you are only looking for something that will quietly chime to notify you that a door or window has opened this will be too loud for you.
