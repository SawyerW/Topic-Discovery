I bought one of these 4 seasons ago hoping to get a single season out of it.  I've been hunting for decades and have experience with dozens of trail cams, mostly bad.  Most of the low to mid range units seems to malfunction after a season or two (if you're lucky) or be completely drained of batteries long before it's time to go back and check them.The Primos Truth Cam 35 is a tank!  It's big, ugly, bulky and weighs a ton (compared to the little tiny ones out there) and that's good and bad... The good is that trespassers will think twice about stealing it (size and weight, had someone snag the incriminating memory card once, but they left the camera), It takes 3 full seasons for the batteries to die (you can leave this thing up all year) and the 3 mega pixel pictures take up very little space on the memory card (you can store thousands of pictures.)  The bad, is that's it's big, bulky, heavy and uses lots of D batteries.Picture quality is good enough for the purpose, day photos are good, night photos really depend on the outside temperature, the colder it is, the better the pic but the game is recognizable in the heat of the Florida summer nights and the blur is acceptable for moving game.The camera range is good during day light (about 30 yards) and acceptable at night (10 to 15 yards at night.)The motion sensitivity setting is something I now can't live without, If the camera is set up at a funnel such as an opening in a fence it can be placed nice and close (10 yards) with a low sensitivity setting, if you're facing an open field, set the sensitivity to high.  Remember to face the camera North or South so it won't be blinded by the sunrise or sunset.I now own 6 of these and have no reason on the face of this earth to even think about buying a different make/model.  8 Gig memory cards are cheap, and if you buy the micro ones that fit in a full sized adapter, you can pop that card in your phone and transmit the pictures to your favorite picture sharing location in the "cloud" for all to see back at the camp instantly (3 MB pics won't abuse your wireless data plan as much as the newer formats.)I gave this thing 5 stars based on value and reliability.  Good luck and good/safe hunting.
