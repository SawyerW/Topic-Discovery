I bought this and an add-on 700e outdoor camera. Both were easy to mount with the provided hardware. The kit even comes with screwable guides to tuck the ethernet cable to the power supply. Having a drill would be handy to pre-drill the screw holes for mounting the camera.After downloading the software via Logitech's website I was able to update the firmware on my two cameras and was up and running in minutes. Video quality is excellent. It is easy to setup where to store your videos and how aggressive you want to record the areas being monitored. You can also adjust the field-of-view of each camera to avoid having to manually move the camera.The downsides to the system is Logitech's $80/year fee if you want to use their web-based system to view recorded videos or to adjust the camera settings. You are supposed to install the desktop software only to one computer. The free version of the web-based software lets you view live feeds of all your cameras. That's it. Price seems steep to me considering the price premium of these cameras compared to competitors.Still the ease of setup and quality of the video counts for alot.If your interested in buying the cameras I would check Logitech's website as they have changing promo offers. I was able to pick up an outdoor master camera and 3 add-ons for $760. I ended up returning the cameras I bought from Amazon after I was declined a price match.Edit: one major problem is that if there is a temporary power loss (i.e. the lights turn on/off for less than 5 seconds) the cameras will lose contact with your computer. The only solution I have found is to reset the cameras by unplugging them from the wall for a minute, then replugging them back in. This is a major problem if you intend to use these cameras in a remote location that you do not regularly visit. Took a star off for this issue until Logitech fixes it.
