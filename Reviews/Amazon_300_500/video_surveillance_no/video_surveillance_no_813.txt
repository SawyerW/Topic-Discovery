We purchased this after are Summer Monitor no longer worked--due to the power button being unable to stay on.  There are some nice features on this like being able to talk to your child, lullabies, ability to purchase multiple monitors--to obtain multiple views on the child, temperature in the room, etc.However, it does miss the mark on some obvious things.  First, the screen is small--Summer and some of the other companies come in at 7" or twice the size of this little monitor.  If you want to puchase an AV out cable to put your child on your TV good luck with that.  Motorola does not sell anything or recommend any cable--you're on your own if you're lucky enough to find a cellphone cable that fits just right.  This is a boneheaded movie on the part of Motorola, or should I say Biannon, the actual manufacturer of the product.  You see Motorola doesn't even make this product, they just stick their name on it since it is well known.Clearly Motorola would be wise to sell the AV out cable which would mean more money for them and not leaving their customers hanging--by offering an AV out with no cable for it and none they recommend.  Finally, there is no mute button on this monitor.  Another bad move--provided your child is out of the SIDS phase, it is good if you can just look up at them and see how they're doing.  With the Motorola monitor the best you can do is turn the volume down to 1, so you will still hear background noises and other things which will wake you up.  On the Summer you mute the monitor but of course you will still see your child and also see the lights going up as volume increases.  Motorola, or should I say Biannon, should go back to the drawing board to make this better.  Because a monitor should be more than just bells and whistles.
