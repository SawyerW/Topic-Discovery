First off, I want to say that my boyfriend and I got in a huge fight over purchasing these cameras. Long story short, we have meth heads who live next door and make a living out of stealing other people's stuff. Thankfully, they are in jail now. But before they went to jail we were worried about our stuff unattended when we went to visit family over the holidays. So we were planning on paying over a thousand dollars to have a security system with DVR set up in our 2 bedroom apartment. I am so thankful I chose this route! The reason for the fight was my boyfriend had checked the reviews for these cameras and there are a lot of negative ones. But I told him I'd rather spend this little bit of money to try this camera than pay a ton or be unprotected. The people who left bad reviews of this product either got duds (I got one as well and sent it back for free) or are complete idiots and did not set them up correctly. I had no prior knowledge of networks, etc. before setting up these cameras but setup was still a breeze (with justchill's instructions). I learned a little bit about that kind of stuff during setup too, which is another plus.Basically I wanted to leave this review to tell you, like many others have, what a great value these cameras are! $100 for 2 cameras got us the security we needed during our outings over the holidays. We can log in from our phone (we use IPCam Viewer Free Droid App) or any computer to see, move, turn motion on/off the cameras, etc. We have set the motion alarm to send an email that hits our phones, which is awesome! Now not only are we protected from the neighbors, but we can see when our dog gets up while we are gone. We get an email every time she moves with 6 pictures on it.Needless to say, I still have to tell my boyfriend "I told you so" every once and a while.
