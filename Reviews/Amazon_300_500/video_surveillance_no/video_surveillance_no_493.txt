The D-Link Wireless Pan and Tilt is a nice enough home surveillance camera, and it has a number of nice features, but I do have to say that if you're buying it for surveillance or monitoring, you'll be disappointed, as it has no way to store recorded imagery or sound within the unit itself, or to a local hard drive.There are some very slight instructions for saving images to an FTP server, but honestly, only the most technically proficient buyer is going to do that. Your ordinary purchaser is thus left with a device that allows for effective live monitoring of sound and image, and for motion detection alerts that simply note that motion has occurred, without capturing an image to go with it.  That means that unless the cause of the motion is still onscreen by the time you log in to view it, you're not going to see anything.Some Pros and Cons:Pros- Easy setup- Ability to access camera/sound via Browser or Smartphone App- Relatively good video, arguably better sound- Ability to detect motion and send alerts- Ability to take photos remotely- Ability to increase or reduce the speed/scale of the pans and tilts via advanced settings- The night vision capability is for lack of a better phrase, COOL AS ALL GET OUT- The built in wi-fi extender could be a real bonus for those seeking to expand their home wifi rangeCons- The lack of recording capability is a real con.  So much so that if you can afford the extra hundred dollars, I would recommend the next step up from D-Link, the D-Link Wireless HD Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled, DCS-5222L (White), which allows you to "Record directly to your Cloud camera with the built-in microSD card slot".  That's a real advantage to the upgrade if you don't want to fool around with trying to set up recording to FTP- The moment I activated the camera for the first time, my wireless router got knocked out. Technically, there was no reason for it to happen, so I presume it was a coincidence, but y'know, the timing sure was odd.Bottom line?  It's good, especially if you just want to be able to view an area remotely from time to time.  But it isn't a perfect solution for surveillance. The lack of a built in recording capability is really necessary for that.
