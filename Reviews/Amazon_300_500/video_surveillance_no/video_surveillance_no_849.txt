I'm a new mom with very little free time but I have to take a few moments to tell how much I love this camera. It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't need a camera that could play lullabies or that I could talk to baby through the monitor. I just wanted to be able to see and hear her from the other room.I had one complaint which was that the stand the camera comes on tilts the camera up and I couldn't figure out why it was built that way. When are you ever going to need the camera to look up to see the baby? The camera can swivel left to right but I was propping the stand up on a rag to tilt it down. Then, yesterday, I realized you can tilt the camera down without moving the stand. (Again, new mom brain or I might have realized this earlier.) So the camera is perfection!I understand what people mean by "cheap plastic feel" but I really don't care. It performs well. That's all that matters to me. I'm not sure what people mean when they talk about the monitor beeping at them. The only time my monitor beeps is if I turn the camera off but the monitor is still on, which makes sense. If the camera goes out, you want the monitor to let you know.The only other thing I would note is that the monitor doesn't really give you a heads up on battery life. It just starts blinking and then within a few minutes it dies so you have to plug it in to turn it back on. I've just made allowances for this and make sure to plug the monitor in whenever I'm not using it so when I do need it I can carry it from room to room with me.So glad to save money AND get exactly what I wanted. Great picture and sound quality. Easy to use and at an affordable price. Highly recommend this unit.
