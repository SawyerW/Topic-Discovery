I am not in the habit of doing reviews, but this cam is about as good as one can expect for the price. I have dozens of similarly priced cams purchased over the past 10 years so I have  a lotexperience in this area. Most home CCTV cams do a reasonable job in day light, but too often fail badly at night.  What makes this superior is the excellent gamma, based on visual observation, not measurement.  At night, black areas are displayed a satisfying deep black, while whites are captured with the proper intensity.  Note that poorly made cams (most of the el cheapos) tend to blur a range of shades between black and white.  Running a quick A-B test on my older cams, it was immediate that this cam had superior fine details in its night mode.  As someone mentioned, this cam is rated at only 420 lines, but it out performed cams with higher line rating. It was the main reason why I decided to take a chance with this cam.  Over the years, I learn that it isn't the number of lines, but how linear is the gamma response.  You can have 520 lines, and poor gamma and end up with a blurring of details.  Swann DVR have some of the worst cams made, where at night, dark areas comes out flat gray, and bright white areas comes out a dull gray.  I am in the process of  replacing most of them.The wide angle lens is not just a plus, but is a must for good coverage when placed in a corner of a room.  With a standard lens, you lose about 30% of the view presented by this cam.  In some cases, I would need two cams to provide enough coverage.  Not anymore.  Also, the mount is a decent sturdy mount, compared to the flimsy mount found in cheap cams.One reason I am contributing this review is that it is nearly impossible to buy cams based on the specs provided.  As explained above, number of lines doesn't cut it. For lack of full professional specs, we are all buying a pig in a poke.  Thanks to Amazon user reviews, we now have a better chance of beating the odds.
