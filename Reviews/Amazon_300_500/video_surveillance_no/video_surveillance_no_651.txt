I bought this indoor rated camera to put inside a weatherproof barn owl box about 175 feet outside our home roughly a month ago. Since I had to run power to the owl box to power the camera anyway, I am using the camera in wired mode with Ethernet cable rather than wirelessly, so I have no experience trying to get the camera working wirelessly. It is not set up for power over Ethernet, so I am running two light gauge insulated wires carrying 120 VAC outside a shielded outdoor rated Ethernet cable and a 14 gauge galvanized steel wire (to add strength) all overhead and bundled together between the second floor deck of my house and the twenty foot high owl box, which is hanging from a tree limb.The documentation is skimpy and obviously written by a person for whom English is a second language. I am an intermediate level networking end user and not a networking professional. I sent one email to tech support with a question that was competently answered by email within 24 hours. I was able to get the camera to serve the intended purpose, which includes logging detection of motion within the owl box and day and night real time viewing of the owl box interior. The pan/tilt feature is nice for remotely aiming the camera. The software facilitates printing nice pictures of what I see when viewing.No barn owls have taken up residence in my owl box yet, but it may not be the right time of year for that. I am wondering if the night vision infra red lights will scare away owls who might otherwise take up residence, so I have decided to power off the unit at the house end of the cable bundle for a few weeks at a time, powering it up from time to time to check occupancy. An option in the software allows shutting off the blue light which indicates that the camera is on, which I have done to keep that from scaring away owls.
