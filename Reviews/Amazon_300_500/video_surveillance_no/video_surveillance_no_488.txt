Setup on a home network was pretty easy. Initially, I didn't use the setup wizard or software that came with it and had no problems getting the camera setup.  However, when it came time to setup a free DynDNS account (Dlink calls it something else with their brand but it's really just a DynDNS account), the only way to do it was via that setup wizard and I had to repeat all the steps again, via the wizard, to setup the camera just to get to the end where it offers the option to create an account.  Dorking around with the firewall settings and a DynamicDNS account in order to be able to connect to the camera from work took a couple days of trial and error but it wasn't too bad considering I had never done it before.Don't buy it solely for the motion detection if it is going in a room whose light is changed by the outside ambient light.  I setup motion detection and got a false alarm whenever the sun brightness level changed in the room.  I turned that off and just leave the live video open in the bottom corner of my monitor.The controls to move the camera are herky jerky. It does allow you to save preset positions (aka save and label what it is currently looking at,  selecting that saved position from the list returns the camera to that spot when it was saved) and the movement is pretty fluid when it's traversing to one of those.I also have to give Amazon some kudo's.  The original shipment was stolen off my front porch and Amazon sent a replacement without any hassles and even refunded my next day air shipping charges I paid on the original shipment!  They were not obligated to do any of that yet they did.  Awesome customer service.
