This security system is perfect for what I was looking for, with two cameras for various purposes (I wanted one outside the house so I can watch the kids in the front yard, while I'm cooking in the kitchen and I wanted the other to closely watch our two year old in her crib, since she had a seizure).  That's why I bought the system with two cameras.  First of all, it's the easiest thing ever to get started right away!  Simply plug in the cameras.  Plug in the monitor. Then you're all set.  SOOO easy!  Very good quality, too.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am happy with my purchase, but I have already found three downfalls on this system: I have two cameras, so I'd like to split the 7" screen in half to see both, but it only allows "quad" viewing (quarters each picture, even if you only have two cameras, rather than four).  Second downfall is that when you choose the "zoom" option, it applies to "all or none" (i.e. you can't have one camera zoomed closer for a small room (my daughter's bedroom), and the other zoomed further out (for outside on the driveway)).  It's either both or neither.  The third downfall is that I wish the monitor accepted batteries, instead of needing to be plugged in.  It would be nice to be able to take the monitor with me sometimes while I change rooms, but it's more cumbersome since it ONLY works when it's plugged in, so now I've got to unplug it, then plug it back in when I go up to bed, then again in the morning when I come back down.Also, two things were wrong when I received the item.  First is that it came without the SD card (it was nowhere to be found in the packaging).  Second is that one of the pieces on the mounting bracket was stripped (the screw was stripped, so it would never tighten).  I called Defender about this and after emailing him proof that I did in fact buy this item, he agreed to send me another mounting bracket piece.
