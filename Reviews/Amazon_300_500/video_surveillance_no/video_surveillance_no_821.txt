Took me about an hour to set up and get going on a Windows 7 system.  Documentation on the cd was adequate and I had no trouble setting an IP address for it on my home network.  The default IP was 192.168.0.145 and I reset it to 192.168.1.145 from my pc using the included network cable connected to a nearby switch. The thing about doing this that may not be obvious to some people is that if you have your pc network address on a different from default segment (e.g. xxx.xxx.1.xxx) you will have to set it temporarily to xxx.xxx.0.xxx before you will be able to see the camera.  Once you've changed the camera's IP to what you need, then just set your pc back to xxx.xxx.1.xxx and you're on your way with the rest of the camera configuration.I installed the camera in my attic to see what kind of critter had taken up a home there.  I thought it was a squirrel mom and litter.  Within about 2 hours of installing the camera it alarmed, I looked, and it was a raccoon.  I'm now keeping an eye on it to see when it takes the babies out of the house so I can seal up how it got in.It's great to be able to see from either the application on the pc or from a web page while I'm at work.  It works fine with the browsers on my Xoom and Android phone too. The camera's tilt and pan is controllable from anywhere I can access it.As far as color vs infrared, the built in infrared lights up my dark attic for about 20 feet easily.  When the attic light bulb is on I see decent color and if I pan you can really see when the infrared takes over.I haven't messed with the audio or the alarm triggering connection, but probably will before it's all over.For the relatively inexpensive price I couldn't be happier.
