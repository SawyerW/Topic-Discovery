I recently purchased the HGST Travelstar 5K1500 1.5TB 2.5-Inch Mobile 5400 RPM hard drive to expand the dinky little 500 GB hard drive that came standard with my second PS4. I'm not a big time gamer so I hardly need all the space. My brother wanted me to buy this just because; it have more space. I told my brother once that you should always buy the biggest hard drive you can afford for his computer so I gave in and did so.This HGST Travelstar 5K1500 1.5TB 2.5-Inch Mobile 5400 RPM hard drive installed with no issues at all. The PS4 seems to almost be made to accommodate this drive upgrade.  Just make sure you have the 872 GB version of the PS4*******.PUP Update file placed on a USB device that is formated in the Fat 32 file system. The The 312 MB PS4*****.PUP update file does not have the initialization protocols needed to install the update on a drive that has never been used in a PS4 unit.Make things easy on yourself use a USB storage drive with 8 0r so GIGABYTES on it. Your PS4 recognizes the Fat 32 file system. The Fat 32 file system is on most Microsoft Windows computers in the Format Windlows Explorer Menu.  Go to your Windows Explorer highlight your USB storage device.  Right mouse click and select FORMAT from the menu shown. Select Fat32 file system from the options provided.  Format the USB drive as fat 32 file system. Create folders as instructed by PS4 site and place the PS4*****.PUP file in the folder indicated. Install drive in PS4 console swaping out the old hard drive. With this hard drive installed in the PS4 place the USB device containing your FAT32 formated drive and the PS$ file structure awith its PS$******.PUP file in the USB port os your PS4 and turn it on.Make sure your controller is connceted to your PS$ by its wire since your PS4 is pretty much brain dead without an operating system. Press the PS button on your controller when instructed and the menu's will likely guide you through the rest of the process of initializing and setting up your new huge new 1.5 drive. Now do not be surprised when you have 1.3 TB showing on tour system you were not cheated.  Space is taken up by the PS4 operating system and disk management eats up some space too.  You will have over 1 TB of usable space with the successful install of this drive and thats the best thing. I've had no issues with this drive and found it awesome.
