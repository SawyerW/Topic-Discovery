where do i even begin? this baby monitor is not safe, that's where. our infant sleeps one level directly above us and well within the 150  foot range advertised. we have had several nights waking up to a monitor with video on but the sound off, or at best breaking up constantly (try to sleep with intermittent white noise, i dare you). so we would have an infant kicking and screaming but when you're asleep, you don't get to see this activity but rely on the sound to wake you; worthless. the camera also completely blacks out from time to time, meaning we can hear (sometimes) our infant but the screen is black. it requires turning off the camera several times until it 'reboots' itself and works; worthless. the VOX function, which is supposed to allow the battery rest while monitoring the infant and bringing the video and sound back to the monitor if sound is detected. this function doesn't work at all. never; worthless. upon attempting the 'live chat' function on the Levana website, i was told to return the monitor and have one of their technicians spend some time checking it and either repair or replace (2-4 weeks). when i requested a replacement sent immediately, i was told i had to purchase it until the defective one was ruled defective. the chat session lasted more than 30 minutes, with each customer service response coming around 3-5 minutes after mine; so, yes, customer service: worthless.when it comes to something as important as infant safety and adult sleep, don't waist your time or money with this worthless product. spend more money and get a better product; this is indeed one purchase no one should skimp on. after much advice, i've purchased the samsung safeview and am hoping for a much better experience than this one, which was worthless.
