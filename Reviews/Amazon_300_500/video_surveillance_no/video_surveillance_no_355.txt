ok, so the first thing that anyone should be aware of before buying this camera is setting up 'remote access' is not an easy task, depending on the type of router you have and the security policy of your ISP. i work in IT so i had an advantage going into this, but if you don't know/understand a lot about networking i would honestly say if you don't have a cisco router i would probably not recommend you buy the product.so the way this thing works 'out of the box' is, the cd that comes with the package prompts you at the end to sign up for a ddns service (dynamic DNS) which is basically a service that looks at your routers public IP every 'oh so many' minutes to see if it has not changed, that is pretty much all it does.so anyway, i don't have a cisco router and i use att uverse internet service and i got a 2wire router from them for like 100 bucks. anyway, setup with this router is a nightmare and this router will NOT WORK with TZO service under any circumstances..so i called my ISP and bought 8 static public IP addresses after connecting this thing to my network and opening ports 1024/1025 and 80 on the device i assigned the public IP to the device -> rebooted router -> and its finally working.it did not/will not work with TZO and to be honest after the 3 free months the TZO service costs more than a package of 8 public IP's from my ISP (they are only 15 dollars).anyway, in regards to the quality the video streamed is decent, better than some i saw with easier configuration that cost more.i am pleased with it now, but honestly the setup and documentation are lacking/and an utter nightmare.so the dope thing is its setup, and i don't even have to use DDNS :).good luck setting this puppy up without a ciso router. you are going to be in for a wild ride, and if you have no IT/Networking experience, unless you have a cisco router which they support -- its going to be very difficult to get it working.
