We had this monitor and it worked ok for a little over a year. The little attachment that hooks the monitor to the charging cradle broke, and will no longer charge. Here are the pros and cons of it, while it worked...pros:- pretty decent video quality, day or night vision- didn't experience any interference with any other wireless devices we had- able to hook up to 4 cameras, we've only tried 2 and they worked wellcons:- cheaply made, as I said, the charging piece on the monitor broke and is now useless- battery on camera is terrible, it would run out of battery power in the middle of the night. What's the point of a monitor that won't watch your baby the whole night?? We had to keep it plugged in all the time and mount it on a wall close to a plug, which meant that it was a little further from the crib than I'd like (harder to see baby).- vox feature that is supposed to only turn the monitor on if it detects noise. had it set per the conditions in the manual. the monitor just turned on and off at regular intervals- very annoying when trying to sleep while the baby is sleeping and not making any noise to turn it on.- features that added to the price that I did not find useful- camera (not great quality), talk to baby- I just found it weird and didn't think my baby would like to hear me but not see me, so I just never used it. We tried it once and it worked fine, it's just something I could do without.Overall, I thought this video monitor was good enough not to return for the year we had it. But I will be looking for another monitor now that this one's done.
