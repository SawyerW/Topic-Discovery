Updated Review - 1 year and a half laterIf I could give this monitor 0 stars I would. Our Third one of the LW2003 just broke and I am IRATE. The first one broke and i spent hours on the phone with their terrible customer service, but we finally got a new (refurbished) one sent to us a month later. That one broke and I didn't want to deal with the customer service so we just bought a new one. We actually had batter troubles with the third monitor, but using the old battery from the second in the new receiver worked...until we just tried to put the receiver on the charger and the little internal plug came loose!! It is made so cheaply that my 10 month old could probably break it with her little hands. I am now in the market for our 5th baby monitor in 3.5 years. Ridiculous. Not even going to bother with their customer service because it is so terrible.ORIGINAL REVIEWMy daughter is only 22 months old, and we have gone through two video monitors. The first was the Summer Infant Slim & Secure. It worked until she was 18 months old. The monitor itself crapped out, we got a new battery, but it still wouldn't charge.  So we got a Lorex. It was great for 4 months, but the screen on the Lorex just went white. I can hear my daughter, but I can't see a darn thing. I called the company, they told me that I had to send it back to them, but first I was to fill out paperwork that they would email me within 3-5 business days. It has been 7 business days. Their customer service is terrible. I was just on hold for another 20 minutes and didn't even get through to someone.While this monitor looks cool, it feels cheap. I would go back to Summer Infant if I have to buy a third monitor, which I will probably end up doing in the long run.I swear they make them cheap so you have to buy new ones yearly!!!
