This is a great mini-camera with limited abilities. However, a few things did go wrong with the one I got.First the good. The case is very strong, stronger metal than I expected. The lens is a wider lens than I had before, it even comes with a lens cap. I didn't try the audio/microphone so I can't talk about that.Now the bad. It is true that the infrared lights can only illuminate a short distance, but the image will show both the color image from both light and darker areas at the same time, or at least it seemed that way. But my biggest disappointment is that the color of the video image seemed to 'burn out' after about a week. The metal case can be very warm to the touch when in use, and I think that is from the infrared lamps (3 on each side of the lens). That heat seemed to remove the blue channel from the imaging unit, leaving everything looking yellowish brown and unrealistic.The one thing that is good after all this is, I didn't lose a lot of money. Paying less than $20 means that I feel no need to contact the seller about this. This was just for "playing around" with, and not for professional use. If I needed something more, I would've invested more money in an Infrared camera.If the video image hadn't degraded in such a short time, I would have rated 5 stars; it is a good camera for the price, but better in a colder environment and as nothing more than an "informal" video camera.Update: The cheaper, non-IR camera (not this one) that I use as a security monitor camera is still working fine after being constantly plugged in for months. The lesson I learned was that if I want an IR capable camera, I am better off paying a higher price. But for a dependable daylight camera, a non-IR camera (for about the same price) will do fine.
