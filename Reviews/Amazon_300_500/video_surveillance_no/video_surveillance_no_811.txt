We purchased this unit right when it came out with much anticipation.  Of all of the monitors that we reviewed it came the closest to having all the features we were after.  Like many noted it is lacking a voice activation feature (VOX) which is VERY important to enable you to keep the volume loud when your baby is making noise, but not have that constant white noise hissing in the background all the time.Unfortunately you get that with this model if you turn the volume up beyond the lowest level.  Fortunately for us our daughter has very strong lungs and we can usually hear her regardless of the monitor volume.  So we primarily use this monitor for its video features.I was VERY impressed by the video quality at both day and night.  Very crisp and detailed.  However, after a few months of use I noticed that the night vision started to degrade, I used to be able to easily see across the entire room easily and with great detail.  But now I strain to get a detailed picture of objects at night that are more than about 2-3 feet away.At first I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but then I read other reviews and multiple users are complaining of the same issue.  I also have a second camera and compared the night vision camera on that one to the original one that came with the unit.  It became VERY obvious once I did that, my second camera easily lights up the entire room with its IR lights and I can see across the room with no problem at night.  However, the first unit looks as if most of its IR lights have burned out, and its only able to illuminate a couple feet of space.BOTTOM LINE: If you bought one of the first units off their line, they had a few quality issues, and you should check to see if your night vision has degraded over time. If so, get a replacement!
