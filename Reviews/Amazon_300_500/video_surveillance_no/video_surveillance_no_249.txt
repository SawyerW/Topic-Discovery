VERY EASY SET UPI am not a technical whiz...nor do I have much patience when it comes to setting things up. But this was a snap!HINT: If you have Windows 8, download the driver directly from the Logitech Alert website b c the CDs in the boxes are outdated. After seeing the system was not working properly & calling Logitech right away, it was no problem uninstalling the outdated version & downloading the updated one. BTW, the Logitech guy was GREAT, PATIENT, & VERY KNOWLEDGEABLEIT DOES EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MUCH MUCH MOREThe motion detected e-mails that come to my cell phone contain a snapshot of the area where motion was detected.I can check my cameras from my IPhoneI can check my cameras from any computer by logging onto the Logitech Alert webstieI can adjust the motion sensitivity, the area of motion detection, and remotely control (move a little) the outdoor camera (haven't tried with the indoor version yet)THEY MAKE ME FEEL SO MUCH SAFER EVEN WHEN I'M HOMEIf I hear a noise at night, I can glance at my laptop that I sometimes keep by my bed to look at the front or back yard, or even distant areas of the inside of my house. The night vision is GREAT.GREAT DETERRANTI heard a newcast that cited a study indicating you're 70% less likely to have intruders when they see there are security cameras on your property.DON'T USE PHONY CAMERAS WHICH I ALMOST DIDI was getting a few phony cameras when my son, who has never been in trouble in his life, laughed saying everybody knows a phony security camera when they see them, even nice, law abiding young adults. Who knew?Now I feel like phony cameras are advertising to the world, "I FEEL VULNEERABLE, AND BY THE WAY, THERE'S GOOD STUFF IN HERE SO I WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF INSTALLING CAMERAS AROUND MY HOUSE, BUT DON'T WORRY THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY FAKE SO COME ON IN."I CAN CHECK IN ON MY PUPPY!He's a brat and I worry about him, but I can check on him now while I'm at workI know there's a lot more I'd like to say, but I'm out of time! If you have any doubts about this system, I hope this review helps.I found the cameras and computer do need to be reasonably close to the Logitech router to work, but that was before I installed the newer version of the software. I may be able to spread the system out more now that I have the proper software running.I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SYSTEM !!! Thank you Logitech !!!
