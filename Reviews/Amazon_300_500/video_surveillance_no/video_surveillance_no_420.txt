With alot of choices out there, it requires major homework as to what works best for you. Having a wired/monitored system installed by a pro is still probably the preferred system, but most require a contract with a small install charge ( $99 ) & monthly fees of $30-$50 depending on what's being monitored, ( smoke/fire etc.) More & more systems being sold to the DIY's are the wireless variety. Once you install the system, programming & operating are fairly strait forward. I basically chose the Fortress SO2 system, mainly because I have an Amazon acct. & the system seemed to have good reviews. ( which we all know can be slanted ) You have have to feel out each review & decipher the wording/phrasing etc. & decide for yourself if the review is authentic. Which is what i did & felt pretty comfortable. Also, at $130.00, it's three times cheaper than some iphones. Anyway, I bought it & got it & started to map out where each sensor would go & start the programming (which is not much as the sensnsors come pre-programmed by number. Here's where I stumbled a little. I think that the manual had some verbage that did not jive with the panel, so I cussed just a little & finally called the Support number. I'm sure you've read of  "Mike" the ownner. He personally answers most calls & knows the answer before you ask the question. I'm fairly competent, but I got stumped again on a couple progamming issues. Boom....called Mike & he walked me through some zone issues. Again........WATCH THE VIDEOS. Even prior to purchasing. They are very good. I had to watch a few over & over, & soon it all comes together. Knowing what I know now. I could install & program the system ( I have 8 window/door sensors & 2 motion detectors ) in an hour. It's a little complex at first, but work through it & nothing else can touch this system. A couple issues: 1} I have had one motion detector have three random trips. Mike suggested swapping it out , which I will. 2) When alarm is tripped, you cannot dial out on land line ( 911 etc. ) because the system is dialing out to stored number. Suggest call 911 on cell, ( I do not have mine programmed to dial out to police ) 3) I recently discovered that when my system trips (testing etc. ) it opens my neighbors garage door. Definetly gotta work on that tomorrow.  PS: EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS AUTHENTIC FROM EDMONDS, WA.
