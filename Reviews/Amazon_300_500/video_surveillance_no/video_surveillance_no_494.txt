This is a feature packed camera, which works well with the "mydlink" cloud service. I liked the overall feature set, and found the annoyances bearable. However using the camera without the cloud (especially if you have real privacy concerns) is a real pain.First of all, the setup with the cloud is very straightforward. If you happen to have a d-link router with the same feature, it's done at the router. If not, you'll have to use a basic installer from mydlink site (the download is not available on the main dlink site, though). After that you'll be able to use the camera from your pc, or a mobile phone.The first thing you'll see a vary blurred image. I do not know why dlink did not have a reasonable default for home room sizes, or even have a infinite focus, but it's fixable. It took me a while to get it correct, though. The small notch around the lens is used for the focus (yes it's manual), and it took some effort (I was afraid of breaking it).After that the image is actually very good. Bundled with the infrared mode there is good enough result in both daylight, and nighttime. The camera can be tilted both manually, and also to "bookmarked" positions, and the night mode can also be automated, manual, or on a schedule. Also you get limited recording support.However the nice things end if you want to use the camera locally. Given that many online services had been hacked in the recent years, it might make sense to want to keep your camera private to your home network only. However the web interface of the camera is plain awful for this purpose. And the bundled software seems to come from windows 95 times -- it requires UAC, which an important security feature, to be off at all times. So basically this is a cloud based camera, and do not expect to use it properly without that enabled.Pros:- Easy network setup (+wps)- Pan and tilt- Good night mode- Easy cloud access (from phone, etc)Cons:- Manual focus!- Not so useful without the cloud
