Logitech Alert 750i Indoor Master and the Outdoor 700e outside cameras are easy to install and set up. Set up is done through your router. All you need is one port on your router, and you're all set. There's a power/communication box that is connected to your router. Another power/communication box is hooked up to each camera. A total of 6 cameras can be connected per system. The outdoor camera and box are waterproofed. The instructions state that it's important that the outside power box be mounted vertically-straight up. The instructions make this clear, yet omit the "why".The installation of the software is a breeze. After the installation, the software connects to the internet for updates on both the software and the firmware for the cameras.The cameras record on motion, which is saved on a 2GB Micro SDHC Card. Longer record saves can be achieved by using larger storage cards. The videos that are stored on the card are only transferred to your PC when the Alert Commander is running. If the software is not running, then the internal memory on the cameras are saved and rotated when the card gets full. Older videos are replaced by the latest. The amount of storage can be allocated on your PC.The primary use for these cameras are for security video recording and they do pretty well. I noticed that my camera recordings are saved prior to seeing cars drive by.The motion sensors can be set to be triggered if movement appears in the entire viewing area or just on a specific section of the total view area. In addition, the sensitivity of the motion sensors can be adjusted. Factory default is %50.My primary desire for these cameras are going to be for video taping nature from my home. The security aspect doesn't serve me because I'm not attracting people who are out to steal from me (Law of Attraction).As far as zooming in on license plates, I haven't been able to select a zoom on the recording. However, a zoom can be done on a live video.
