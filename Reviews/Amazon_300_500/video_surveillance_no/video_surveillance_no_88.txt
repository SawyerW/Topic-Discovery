We got this to replace the Summer's that we were using.  I've been thru 3 Summers in 3 years- they always start out great but end up getting static and the battery loses charge.  So we finally made the switch to a whole different brand and we love it.  Like other people have said- it does interfere with the wireless internet making web sites load very slowly but only upstairs where we have it plugged in. Our signal is kinda weak up there anyway so it doesn't take much for the wireless to go slow.  When we have the hand held with us during naps etc there have been no wireless issues.  We have find this to be a very minor annoyance- the pros of the camera far out weigh this problem.We are using 2 cameras with one monitor and the split screen has been great. i LOVE being able to see both kids at the same time b/c sometimes your not quite sure which one coughed or cried out etc.  The visuals are great, sound is great- its what we've been looking for.  My only con is that the speaker is on the back of the handheld instead of the front. This is fine when the hand held is in the charger but when you use the hand held in other rooms or walking around, you have to lay it down on the table with the monitor side down or balance it on its side or else the speaker becomes too muffled.  Other than that- very happy with this purchase!EDIT FEBUARY 11, 2013:  Still using it and still loving it! No issues with it at all. We have packed them up and used them at grandma's and other places several times- sturdy camera's and monitor still looks and sounds the same as day 1.
