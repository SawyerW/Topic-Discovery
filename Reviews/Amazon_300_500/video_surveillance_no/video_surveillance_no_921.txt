Used with an old XP laptop - Just plugged it in and it worked.  I Loaded the file that came on the disk with it so I could record video -  Recording software was very easy to figure out.I figured out where the "top" of the camera was and marked it with a sharpie.  Then I Used electrical tape to tape the camera to the end of a sewer pipe fish tape keeping the mark on top.  I then wire tied the cable along the fish tape every foot or so.  The sewer pipe was not full of water but was damp with residual water along the bottom so I never really submerged the camera to see if it was waterproof.  I did a test run with the LEDs turned all the way up and they did not provide enough light.  So, I taped a mini maglight next to the camera and that worked well even with the LEDs on the camera turned all the way down so there was less reflection off the plastic lens.  I was able to see the problem - a foot long section of pipe halfway between the house and the septic tank that had the bottom rotten out.I looked at renting a real sewer cam (Ridgid See-Snake) but it was $350 for the weekend.  I figured I would try the method I used instead since the camera was so cheap and I already had a sewer fish tape.  It has saved me several hundred over renting and probably close to $1000 if I were to of had hired someone to do the inspection.  The resolution was good enough for this application.  I would give it five stars if the LEDS were bright enough and I did not need to use an additional light.I recommend this product if you need to inspect your main house sewer pipe and you want to save some $.
