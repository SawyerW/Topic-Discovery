Although I have an older version of these (at least I believe they're older - they look slightly different from the ones in the picture) - they work great.  My friends and I use them for crew work for our high school's theater productions.  In the past, we used to have to text each other, or run around to tell each other things.  Texting didn't quite work since it took a while, and since we were in the middle of a concrete & brick building, reception wasn't too good.  Running around was tiring, and sometimes you didn't have the time to do such, especially if it was in the middle of a show.  Now with these, in partnership with the LXT118 radios, we're able to run our shows much more smoother and better.  Whether it be light and sound cues, set changes, or simply just chatting - these work great.  Clear sound and everything.The only reason that I'm not giving it 4 stars is because of the length of the cables.  I clip the microphone onto the top of my collar, and to be able to have the wires hidden from plain sight, as well as having the earpiece running down the side of the head and down to the back of your neck, I would have to do an awkward stretch of running the wire from the microphone, around my waist, and then up my back.  It would just barely be under my armpit.  Being a fidgety person myself, it wasn't too much of an issue once you got it hooked up, and even hooking it up wasn't too bad.  Another slightly annoying thing was that it kept coming off of the top of my ear (the tube would), and I would keep pulling it out.  Then again - I do wear glasses - but still.  They're still great earpeices, and it's fun to walk around with them in.  I would recommend them to anyone who is interested in purchasing them.
