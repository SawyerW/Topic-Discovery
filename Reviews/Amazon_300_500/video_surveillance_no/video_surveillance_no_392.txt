After reading other reviews for the product I had the following thoughts ahead of time: you can't snake it by itself into anything too far without another contraption to guide it, the video and lights are lower in quality, and it may or may not work without the driver cd on some people's computers.I just wanted to take a moment to share my experience with the above 3 comments and a summary of my feelings on the product.-First, the cable comes in the box twisted up tightly, so yes, the camera continually wants to curl back on itself as you are trying to push it into whatever you are trying to push it into (in my case a 2nd story air conditioning vent), so I'm definitely going to need a sturdier snake of sorts to guide the camera.-Second, after reading the reviews my expectations were set appropriately on the camera and lighting quality (think grainy, but useful and only focused within 6 inches (which is all you'd need snaking it through a tight space anyway, overall good for the money and use of the product, plus the ability to adjust brightness on the usb section is a nice feature).-Third, I have a Samsung Chromebook (the $250 one with 16gb ssd, model 303c?? not sure) and after plugging in the usb, the lights came on immediately, and after I figured out that I needed to open the "camera" application that came with the chromebook, it worked just fine without any need for a driver install (which is good because the chromebook can't do driver installs to my knowledge :P).-Overall summary, I am happy with my purchase. I feel that, for the money, this device does what I expected it to do and I will probably have a good number of uses for it in the future around the house (or around my friends homes as projects pop up in the future).I give it 4 stars because of the pricepoint and features.
