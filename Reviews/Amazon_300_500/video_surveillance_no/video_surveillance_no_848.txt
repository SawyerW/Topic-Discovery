I read so many reviews on so many different video monitors that I was dizzy! Every one of them had different things that people did not like. In the end I felt best going with the Infant Optics DXR-5. I bought it "used" on Amazon for about $70...an AMAZING price! I read the different ones available that were "used" and some had a scratch or were not in the original packaging. Mine came without any defect, damages, and in the original box. I have been using it every day for two weeks and so far - I love it! The picture quality is great in daytime lighting - so clear! The night vision  is also very clear when focused only on the crib. I have the camera set up to where it views almost the entire room... so empty areas of the room are a little pixel(ly) looking, but it is clear on actual objects and people. (hope that makes sense). My son's room is upstairs and this monitor works even when I am all the way down in the basement or in the yard! It was also important to me that the line/camera have 100% privacy..I have read that some monitors have picked up other video from neighbors' monitors! - This uses digital 2.4 Ghz wireless transmission that says it is 100% private in addition to using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum for interference free connection. It also has an option that turns off the monitor when there is no noise (to conserve power) and it re-activates or turns back on when any noise is detected -  I should say I have not tried this. I have that feature turned off so that at night mine stays on so I can't say how well that feature works. The volume on the unit seems perfect to me - not too quiet- not too loud. As with any, there is a little bit of white noise when turned up high. That doesn't bother me because we sleep with a noise machine...Will report back if any problems arise in the future. But so far -SO happy!
