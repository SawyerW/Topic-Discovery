I am familiar with security cameras/DVRs including IP cams. The Vivotek IP8332 has some good specs but it's disappointing on review.THE GOOD:+ Megapixel image, 1280x720, good day image in average light levels. Lens is 3.6mm (wide angle).+ Outdoor (weather resistant) cam, with Night vision (12 IR LEDs)+ Cam has internal microSD card slot for local storage recording (You do have to disassemble the cam to access the slot).+ Works with BlueIris (3rd party software)THE BAD:- The biggest flaw is the night mode internal reflections - the IR LEDs reflect on the plastic front lens "glass" and spoil the image. Other cameras solve this problem by having the LEDs well outside the lens area or isolating the lens from surrounding IR light and I see no reason why this camera should be different. The fact that the front "glass" is plastic and not quality glass is an indication that corners were cut here, but this is a critical part of a camera! I have verified that the front plastic is the problem by disassembling the cam and removing it but obviously you can't use the cam in an outdoor setting like this! Shame on you Vivotek for crippling an otherwise good camera!- The external cable is a thick black cord that splits into separate connections (for power, ethernet, etc). The dumb thing is that this cord is only about 6" long and is annoying because for outside use you will need an IP56 rated box or enclosure within 6 inches of the camera! Why they couldn't give you 12" minimum?- Firmware has been buggy for this cam, with newer firmware giving image & other problems. As of this writing latest firmware is v2.00 but firmware 1.05-1.08 has been known to be problematic.- This is not a PoE (Power Over Ethernet) camera - you will need to supply either with 24VAC or 12V using the included power adapter.OVERALL I am not happy with the flaws considering the price of this camera. It had the chance to be one of the better outdoor megapixel cams that I've tested.I hope you find this useful!
