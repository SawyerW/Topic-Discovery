Purchased these for indoor as we've just hired a nanny and we wanted a simple setup to keep an eye on our little one. The camera setup was pretty straightforward - the only hiccup was setting up a mobile user for use with the iPhone and iPad app. Apparently you can only have one mobile user and you configure this user separately to the other user accounts. Go figure. Lorex tech support were helpful (if a little abrupt) and I managed to get remote viewing access pretty quickly.I probably would have happily given this product more stars if not for two things - the cameras aren't really "wireless" as you still have the power cable running from the cameras. The bit that's wireless is the video communication back to the DVR. While that is still helpful and much cleaner, the issue is that Lorex don't sell extension cables for the power supply, so you're camera placement is limited to within 6ft of your power outlets which is not ideal for all rooms in my apartment. I've seen an extension cable that might work, but nobody has used it for the wireless cameras so I'm trying to get Lorex to confirm before I buy them.The second issue is the user interface on the DVR itself. It has a bunch of useful features (you can set it to record only if it detects motion, set up motion alarms, and you can even configure the space that it detects the motion in)  but all of these features are hidden behind the most unintuitive menu options. Even playback of video is camera by camera and a little painful. This is one of those devices where you HAVE to read the detailed user manual page by page, or call tech support to find out how to do the one thing you're trying to do.The cameras themselves are good (if larger than I expected), the video quality is also good (although it needs a fair amount or light before it will switch to colour), and I would bump the review up to 4 stars if I can get the power cable extension sorted.
