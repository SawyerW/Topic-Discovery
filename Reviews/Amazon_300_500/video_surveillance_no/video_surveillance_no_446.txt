I've tried several other spy cameras over the past year just for entertainment and I have to say the quality just doesn't match this Spy Pen Camera. The lightweight and stylish form is one of a kind and blows the competition because this one just is obviously better crafted and of higher quality.This Spy Pen Camera even has a tiny dvr recorder that supports 16gb SD card I have and was easier than any other to use. I do not recommend you drop it but as a matter of fact this little gadget fell out of my child's hand and to my surprise did not break. That is obviously a plus I did not expect but can live with.has multiple functionsAnother thing is after I use the video camcorder, I playback the footage on my laptop and since I love to use it for still images, the images are all very crisp and clear plus the video is even better with the quality in picture and sound.I am glad I set eyes on this Spy pen camera and appreciate the fact that it has way surpassed my initial expectations and has delivered considerably more that I could imagine-could you believe that it includes the usb cable also which without would have cost me a long trip to the mall. I'm starting to love this spy pen camera and actually have it on me all day because of it's easy portability and discrete nature.If you're on the fence or simply undecided on purchasing a spy pen camera then I sincerely believe your worries are over with this one; it's compact, lightweight, easy to handle, discrete, durable and low price are what makes it stand out above and beyond the competition. Last but not least, I feel comfort that if for some reason it stopped working I can get a refund. So I've got nothing to lose with this purchase.
