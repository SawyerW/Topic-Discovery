I am a lucky recipient of the Logitech Alert 750e Security System with an Indoor camera add-on through the Amazon Vine Program and am happy to report the following:Everything Logitech advertises about this system is true: it installs easily in minutes and works like a charm. I am very thorough when reading instructions so it took me longer than it will take most to install this system. You can easily install the system using only the quick-reference sheet included but I read the instruction book cover to cover. Even at that I had the entire system installed in less than an hour.Part of the time was updating to the latest version of the software (which updated automatically) and then once I fired up the system the cameras received a firmware update (again automatically). Both updates took approximately 10 minutes over cable internet.The indoor camera comes with a variety of mounting methods included: window suction cup, wall/ceiling screw mount, and a desktop/shelf stand (the method I chose).The power cable to camera and the ethernet cable from power supply to the router were plenty long enough however if you need longer cables they are available from Logitech.Once the system was running - everything in the software was very self-explanatory. I was able to adjust the area my camera recorded and was able to get the entire living room in the shot. The video quality is very good and has an option to record audio as well. You can view the live camera feed from the software on your PC, or from a web browser on any PC, or even from your smartphone (separately downloadable for iPhone and Android) and all work perfectly.All in all I am very pleased with the Logitech Alert 750e Security System and can highly recommend it for quality, ease of installation and setup, and ease of use.
