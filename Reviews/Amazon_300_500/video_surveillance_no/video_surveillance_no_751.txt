Simply put, defective monitor and unit. It never worked right. After about 8-9 weeks it simply failed. The AC adapter slowly was having an issue charging the camera. Then i had to leave camera in a certain position in order to work, then i had to "tape" the charger to the monitor in a certain way in order to get it to work. And then it failed. No i did not drop it, no i did not go office space on it, and no my baby did not get a hold of it and smash it. When the camera worked it worked great but when the monitor failed, it REALLY failed! I read a lo of the reviews and i did not bother calling Motorola since their CC according to a lot of consumers sucks. Granted some reviews are/were kind of silly and stupid perhaps. Also, you may wonder why am i writing a review so late, in fact why am i even writing one at all? Truth... I just wanted to share my experience. I am not vindictive, i am not after money, i make more than enough. I ended up purchasing a diff model and been satisfied, for the most part. Is there a perfect model? No. Someone won't like something about this camera or that monitor, etc. Can we ever be satisfied? Probably not. Am i ecstatic about the new/old camera? No not really but it works. I can say this that or the other about it, the sound is poor and the cam will sometimes just freeze for 10 sec or so, but this is not about the other cam. Maybe my cam was built on a Xmas day when you've had a little too much eggnog :) ... Bottom line is, i got a "bad" camera. I gave it 2 stars because i am not happy with how fast it failed. If it had lasted more i would have been fine. I guess i am disappointed in the monitor quality, that is all. If i had seen the review for the gentleman who offered his # to call him (VP) maybe i would have called him and asked for help but too late now. So that is it. You can choose to like my comment, you may not. Not everyone will like what i said but it is the truth. I really am sad that it died so fast.
