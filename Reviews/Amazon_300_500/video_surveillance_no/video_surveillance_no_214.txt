The 700e is not the system you might believe it to be.  It has issues with motion detection that Logitech knows about and has been reported by other purchasers.  In most cases it will detect motion, but is unreliable at recording the entire event regardless of sensitivity level.  For instance, I setup several tests under various lighting conditions and in each case it would start recording at the first sign of movement, but then would not continue to record.  One person posted in the Logitech forum that their system captured some thieves entering the area and leaving, but did not record anything in between when they were actually doing the stealing.  My tests showed similar results.There are also no provisions for time lapse recording or continuous recording, both of which would be important and welcome features.The camera requires an electrical outlet to operate, so unless you are willing to install outlets high up on the side of your house or buy the extra long cables from Logitech if installing these outside under eaves I would stay away from this system.  It would not be a good idea to install outlets in your attic and plug the power supply into those outlets simply because you wouldn't know if there was a fire until it was too late.  The documentation shows running the cable from the camera down the side of the house to an outside outlet mounted on the lower portion of the house.  Very easy for a would be intruder or thief to simply cut the cable disabling the camera if you were to install in this manner.The camera does appear to be well built and the images produced are of good quality, even in total darkness.  But this is not enough to justify the price.  A better value in my mind is the Samsung SDE series, which is a much more capable system for the same or less money than you would end up spending to install the poorly functioning Logitech system with the same number of cameras that come with the Samsung system.
