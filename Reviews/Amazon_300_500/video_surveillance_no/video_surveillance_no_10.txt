I live in a moderately-sized suburban/rural area.  We are not known for our high crime, but we do have our fair share of drug busts and indigents (i.e. homeless people of questionable moral fiber).  I live on an acre, not far from Main Street.  My street does not have street lights or a neighborhood watch program...in short, it is a slightly spooky place to live alone as a middle-aged female (ugh, I hate using that term!).  I bought this device because I suspected that people were coming into my yard at night, as evidenced by hypodermic syringes underneath the oleander in the front of my yard(!).  I installed the Driveway Patrol at my gates, as shown in the tv commercial.  Within 15 minutes of installation,it was ringing regularly to announce the transit of neighboring cats across my property.  Since I do not suspect the cats of having left the hypodermic needles in my yard, this was of little use to me.I readjusted the directionality of the devices, but it still was sensitive enough to pick up pedestrians who were passing by, as well as alerting me to dogs and perhaps birds -- in short, it was going off with "false" alarms regularly.  Because there were no other vertical objects along my driveway to hang the devices (and since I really wanted to know if people were coming in through the gates) I was forced to abandon their use.  Additionally, the batteries ran down quickly, most likely due to the continual drain on them caused by transmitting the constant signal to the base unit, which was about 100 feet away inside my house. In short, this device will educate you about the amount of incidental foot traffic through the area of interest, as well as possibly alerting you to serious intruders -- but by the time you get a serious intruder, you are likely to be ignoring it because it cries "wolf" so much.  Not tremendously useful.
