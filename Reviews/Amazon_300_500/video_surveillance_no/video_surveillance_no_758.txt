Who knew that Motorola could make a video baby monitor that just rocks the other so called "brands" in the baby space? I was always skeptical of video monitors, especially those that are wireless - and I'll admit that seeing Motorola in the listing of usual baby monitor suspects made me scratch my head.  But I couldn't have made a better choice.  This camera is simply the BEST one out there.  If you want a reliable wireless video monitor, then this is the one for you.  It simply works and works flawlessly! From being able to control the camera with the parental unit (pan, tilt, zoom), adjusting the volume, talking to your baby (yes, the parental unit has a mic built into it! - it isn't 2-way though, but still a very nice touch!), playing soothing melodies, fantastic night vision quality in addition to color video, to having a kickstand to make the parental unit portable, this is one versatile monitor!Did I mention the awesome 3.5" screen? I can see why this one sells more than the smaller screens (that plus all the bells and whistles on the parental unit).  The mic on the camera is so sensitive that it can pick up sound from a floor above or below, which you hear through the parental unit.  The volume settings on the parental unit are plenty strong too - in fact, having it higher than a "4" just isn't needed.  Some other folks have said that you can't turn off the volume completely, which isn't a bad thing if you ask me, since the "1" setting is pretty quiet.From easy setup to phenomenal functions, you cannot go wrong picking this monitor up.  Nothing else in the space can remotely compete.  It is worth every penny (I paid $235) but if you can get it cheaper, then it's practically a steal, haha!
