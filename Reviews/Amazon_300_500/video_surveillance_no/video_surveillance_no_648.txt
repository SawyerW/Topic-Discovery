SHORT REVIEWTotally worth the money spent.  Will purchase another and different version.LONG-WINDED RANT & SARCASMListen, if you are expecting to buy a P/T/Z, WiFi security camera that will hold your hand, give you a warm hug and tell you everything is OK for around $50, please give us a break.This camera is for people who have experience setting up devices from Ethernet interfaces, those who are familiar with UNC protocol and those comfortable using IP navigation methods.  If you have to look up those two acronyms, then you might be disappointed when you buy it, BUT.....Call your nerd friend (you know, the one who is really geeky or talks about Linux or setting up a domain at his/her house) and they can can come over and get it running for you in about 30 minutes.It has a self-explanatory GUI once you are able to address it, and all is configurable over WiFi once configured by wired connection to your particular WiFi setup.I am truly impressed with the quality of the image and the update rate of the images, both daylight and night.  I am actually planning on purchasing and trying the exterior non-PTZ version of this camera to try out their multi-camera interface.All I can say is that I have had this camera for a couple of months now and I couldn't be happier.  BTW, did I mention that it has motion detection alarm features that will FTP or email or both?  Yeah, I know.  It also has a rudimentary scheduler that allows you to only detect alarm conditions during certain periods.  It also has an alarm input, which I haven't had occasion to test yet.If you are someone who complains about things being 'cheap' when you spend significantly less for something than the average price of competition products, then you will probably complain.  If you are someone who is impressed when you spend significantly less for something than the average price of competition products and get some great features and the item just plain works, then you and I would probably enjoy setting up a home network or flying R/C planes!
