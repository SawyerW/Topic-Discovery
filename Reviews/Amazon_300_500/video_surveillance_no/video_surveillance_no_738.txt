This has been a lifesaver for us especially when we had to sleep train our baby. She wasn't sleeping longer than 3 hours at 6 months, and now after a day of training, she slept half way through the night the second day and all through the night the third day. I was as attached to my baby as she was when we were co-sleeping, so having this available to check on her was such a relief to me. It curbed my urge to go in and make sure she was okay.  o far we have had no disturbances in the video.PROS:- This device gives an amazing image quality in total darkness without creating any added light in the room.- The image options are great, you can control the brightness and the sound.- The sound setting can be put pretty high which is great.- The movement of the camera is smooth and has wide area coverage.- It displays temperature of the room the camera is placed in- Signal is strong in a large 3000 sq. foot house double-story.- wire of charger is long- speaker button allows you to speak through the camera into the room, so I was able to give my husband instructions without having to be there- it has a button on the camera itself too to shut it off, so if you accidentally left the monitor screen still 'on' downstairs, and dont want anyone listening on your phone conversation, you can easily turn it off on the camera without having to go all the way down- it is sleek and not bulky, looks good, and quality is decent.- beeps when battery is getting low- button gives you option of keeping the sound on but video off, and if you tap it again, the video comes back onCONS:- Battery doesn't last long without the charger, maybe two hours or less with video on. But most of the time we have it with the charger on so it doesn't affect us much.- The other complaint is that it doesn't show the time on the screen.
