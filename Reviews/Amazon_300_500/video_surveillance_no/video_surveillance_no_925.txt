Another piece of hardware not supported well by the software but at least the folks have tried to help--seems like others are having their issues as well but basically the image doesn't appear to be much better than a cheap Foscam and in  order to take advantage of the higher definition it is unclear how to do that without trying to make their software work since manuf. tells you they are not supported by 3d party vendors.  But how does Robert Chou do great things for free with his IP Cam Viewer for smartphones, including listing Ubiquiti cameras as supported by him, for free, when others, including this software developer have trouble with more powerful Windows machines.  I don't understand it but a number of 3d party vendors do mention this camera....it's just that it doesn't seem to have that great of an image in low light levels or even daylight to differentiate it, cost-wise, from cheaper cameras plus it doesn't give you audio or PTZ.  I know this company does some good things with AP's, etc., but  manufacturers need to remember that when the average buyer purchases a complicated car, that seller doesn't expect the buyer to dig into the guts of the car to make the Goodyear tires work on the Toyota wheels with Brand X gas and Brand Y oil.  I've set up several different brands of wireless and wired DVR's, IP cams, servers, etc.  and this isn't one of the easier ones so i expected a significantly better image in exchange.  Disappointed. Software has issues with Internet Explorer, apparently, and favors other browsers, for starters, so that when you follow booklets directions, you run into a brick wall with installation / download.  From there it gets funner.  Improve the software and drop the price to match the image and features please.
