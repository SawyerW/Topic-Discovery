2/12/2012About 6 weeks ago I purchased a Logitech Alert 3 camera system, 2 indoor and 1 outdoor 700e. I have left them running all this time to search for any problems that I could find and all seemed well till the power went out yesterday.. However Poor/No night vision, Very slow motion (Frames Per Second ), the video quality is good. Of course no 2 way audio. Yesterday we had a power outage. The whole Alert system went out and NEVER came back up. I called Logitech Support for the Alert System  ( 1-888-469-4543 ) and after spending 1/2 hour on the phone with the tech I eventually learned that the Router Must Be Reset AND Each camera, along with the master Alert unit that drives the whole Alert system . For those of you that wish to use this in a remote application, e.g., a beach/mountain home where there is no one there, you are out of luck if the power goes out. Someone must physically go/be there to reset all the above  for the system to begin working/recording again. I have a remote home in Costa Rica where we have frequent power outages and would be totally out of luck with this overpriced system. If someone is always at the location of the cameras you should be ok. This system is still Very overpriced in my book as there are many other and better options. I sell video surveillance systems in the US and in Costa Rica [...] and what one gets with a simple 4-8 camera DVR, H-264 system, is a LOT better. When the DVR looses power and the power comes back on the DVR re-boots and continues to record. I have these all over Costa Rica and not one failure, plus they are per camera much cheaper... I contacted Logitech over 10 days ago about re-selling their systems in Costa Rica and still have not had the courtesy of a reply from them but at this juncture this is not a product that I would care to sell to my customers.. Also, guys, look at DropCam.com and Panasonic BB-HCM511A............... Cheers... Tom
