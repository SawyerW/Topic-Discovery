I was a little hesitent to buy this product since it only had one review prior to this one, but I bought 4 of them, and they all work.  Great deal for $33 with Prime.  The box and the instructions are pretty much all in Chinese, but the web interface is the standard one that you'd expect if you have bought other similar cameras before, and defaults to all English.I won't go into how to set it up -- there are many reviews of other cameras (like the $37 easyN camera) explaining that -- basically don't install any software on your computer...  plug the ethernet cable into your router, plug in the camera, then log into your router to see what address it was given, then you can connect directly from your web browser (port 81) and configure it.There are no relays on the back.  It just has an audio port, an ethernet port, and the power in port, so you can't connect this one to an alarm system or use it to remotely trigger electric door locks, etc.In order to get motion detection to work (via email), I had to turn on the scheduler (just set to "all on"). This camera only sends one snapshot per motion detect, rather than 6 like the EasyN does.Additionally, if you use CamViewer for iOS, the resolution support is screwed up. No matter what you set it to in CamViewer, these cameras will drop to 320x240. If you want to get it back to 640x480, you will have to go into the camera with a web browser and set it there (can be on your iOS device, doesn't need to be a computer). Then, don't touch the setting in CamViewer.  2 way audio doesn't work in CamViewer either.  I don't know if the camera supports this feature, as I don't use it.
