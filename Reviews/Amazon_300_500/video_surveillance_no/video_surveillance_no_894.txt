Most of the other reviews will give you an idea of what you are buying.  It seems to be a good unit for the money.  I use the Swann app on my Samsung Galaxy S III, not as intuitive as you'd like but it gets the job done for free.I would like to focus on some install and setup issues.For the phone app, if your DVR password is longer than 6 characters the whole password is not necessary, only enter the first 6 characters (this took forever to discover, very painful).  Also, the app/DVR only supports 4 cameras at a time for this model, so even though you get 8 cameras with this unit (2250), you can only view 4 at a time.  It's easy to switch to other cameras, but you get an error message when trying to access more than four at a time.I did set up port forwarding on my Linksys router (I ran a cat5 cable to the DVR), this enabled me to view my cameras on my desktop and will aide in setting up the more intricate details.  This .pdf helped with that process... do a google search for "swann view easy setup DVR8 I6-8500", should be the first to pop up.My wife has an I-phone/pad/pod (#ridiculous), so this should help those out there with "those" gadgets... google search "swannview for iphone"I ran all my cables through the attic, my daughter helped (small person). I connected the DVR RCA out to my 60" TV...so I can just switch the input and view my cameras if needed, no additional monitor necessary.Additionally, if all your cameras don't appear, or you see "signal lost"...you might have a power issue, try adjusting your DVR power supply setup.Finally, the manual that comes with the unit is printed poorly in black and white, many of the images are of poor quality.  Go to Swann.com, DVRs and Monitoring kits, then scroll down for the DVR8-2550...there are a few there, just find yours.I hope it helps, maybe it will save you some stress.  Best of luck!
