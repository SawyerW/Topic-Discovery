FOSCAM has discontinued this model, but I can tell you from experience that the QC at Foscam is non-existent.  The cameras have a very high failure rate and tend to go out about 4-6 months after purchase.  The most common event I have seen is that the camera can not be accessed with IP Camera Tool.  Without this tool, the camera is useless.  The chip inside the camera is not working correctly and this causes failure.  I have now gone through 3 cameras.  Now, let me tell you about FOSCAM's sneaky trick of not really covering you on the warranty.  After 30 days, you can NOT get a refund, no matter what.  However, you can send the camera back for a replacement that is a refurbished and defective model.  This costs about $20 using UPS and standard delivery.  Foscam then charges ANOTHER $10 to send a camera back to you that is probably going to fail again.Since I am on my third camera, my shipping costs now exceed $80 for defective cameras.  This is about the price of a new one.  The fine print of the "Warranty" does state that you have to pay $10 after a 30 day period.  I guess they have to make money somehow because if they didn't charge a fee, I am sure they would go bankrupt just from shipping new (Used and refurbished and defective) models back to you.I think the best thing is to stay away.  If you MUST have a FOSCAM, go to a local store like Wurst-Buy or Fall-Mart.  At least you can save shipping. Oh, be sure to buy extended protection because you WILL make your money back.Foscam is a lousy producer of crap Chinese (is there any other kind) cameras.  Your odds are VERY high you will experience a defective camera sometime in the next 5-12 months after purchase.Don't buy this product and do some shopping for a better camera with REAL warranty protection.
