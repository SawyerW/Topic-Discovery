Hootoo cameras require that you do your network homework. If your a novice; get a geekfriend who understands networks to help or email Hootoo support; there Awesome. Whenyou do the first initial setup make sure whatever windows computer your using has anupdated version of Internet Explorer 9.0 or above with all ActiveX controls enabled. Whenyou set up the camera to be recognized by the network its always done with a wired Ethernetconnection. Once you get all the credentials in the Hootoo administration site includingyour wireless parameters, you can go wireless from that point on. I recommend using aDynamic DNS service like DynDns to preset all hosts to one set host plus whatever portthe actual camera is on. I pay for my service, its only $25 a year and its makes DHCP headaches go away permanently. You also have the option of using Hootoos dynamic DNSwhich works fine as well. My cameras are setup to work with motion detection and theyemail images to whatever email service of your choosing. I had one problem with onecamera not performing its motion detection functions properly and hootoo sent me anotherreplacement in two days; these guys at hootoo are awesome. Once these cameras are setupthey work flawlessly as long as your wireless network is up. If you loose power they fireback up once power is restored. To view your cameras remotely use tinyCam Monitor orIP Cam Viewer Pro on android respectively, this where having your dynamic DNS willmake your geek life a lot easier. You can view these on an iPad with CamViewer howeverThat's only from your home network. Check the iTunes app store for hootoos app forIPhone or iPads . These cameras have very good pan and tilt capabilities with very goodnight vision and can be put on schedules to patrol and send programmed messages.They can also be set up with audio two way voice operations; however I have yet to ex-periment that far as of yet. Buy them and take your time to set them up right; you wontbe disappointed.
