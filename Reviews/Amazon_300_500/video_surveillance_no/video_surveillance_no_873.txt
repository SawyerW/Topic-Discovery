Pros - Great Camera for the priceCons - Software average  - Instructions weak  - Mobile App Horrible  - Web App DecentThis is my first IP cam, so I can't compare to other brands. I am a techie, so it was easy to set up, but the setup software isn't the best. I didn't use their DNS service and used port forwarding on my local router for outside access, so I'm can't speak to how well that works or degree of difficulty to get set up.You will need to hardware via the supplied ethernet cable to do the initial setup. Setting up Wifi was not intative, but worked without issue.The Web application works well via Internet Explorer. Remote Listening works well. I have not tried the 2-way audio. (I recently rearranged my office and have to find my microphone...)The Web app through Google and Firefox is a bit unstable and does not support any audio.The Web App via mobile browser is usable, but has even less features.The android mobile app is useless for external viewing, as it will not save cameras, nor will it allow adding a manual camera. For internal use on your local network, it's annoying but works.There are a lot of other android apps for viewing ip cameras, that will work with this camera. However, I haven't found one that has 2-way capability for this camera and there are no free apps with listen capability.Summary: If you have a little tech experience (or are willing to poke around a bit), use Internet Explorer as your browser and don't mind a slightly clunky interface this is a great camera for the money.UPDATE - Downloaded the app via the QR code on the box. Completely different app then the one in Google Play, with 2-way audio. Works well.  This is a fully open version of one of the other apps that I tried the free version (IP Cam Viewer).
