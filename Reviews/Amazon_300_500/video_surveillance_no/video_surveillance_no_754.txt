We have had standard audio-only monitors for a year and have constantly been looking and debating about getting a video monitor. I just didn't want to spend that much money on something you won't use that long.  I wish we would have got it from the beginning. This monitor is worth every penny and we will soon be purchasing more cameras to go with it.Our child will often wake up and cry for just a few minutes and then fall back to sleep.  For a long time we would wake up and just go peak into his room to make sure he was okay.  Now we can simply roll over and look.  We have love this monitor.Here's a few comments about specific features:*Video quality- very good. Even night-vision mode you can see pretty well.*Intercom- you can talk back to your baby (for us this will actually calm down our child without going in)*Range- we have a 2400 sqft townhome and we have not lost signal anywhere (the baby's room is on the top floor and even in the basement it works great)*Motion- you can move the camera around to see different areas of the crib or room (we didn't know if this was worth the extra cost, but it is. We use the motion every single night it seems)*Music- it comes with some built in songs to sooth the child which is nice and our son likes them, but they are kind of crappy quality. I didn't buy this product for the music so I don't really care, but don't buy it just for that feature.I researched these for a long time and decided on this one for many reasons and have been very pleased. If you want more info that I didn't include here please feel free to comment and I will add what I can.
