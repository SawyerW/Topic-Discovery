For a small price of about 50 dollars (shipping included), the camera has worked good. I am not an expert in IT but know enough to get things going by following directions. The camera was easy to configure and setup, the image quality is good and lots of functions as mentioned in the ad. I ordered two of these in order to monitor while we are away on leave or even when we are out for a whole day and want to see what our pet cat is up-to. I have not figured out the voice and sound feature yet, but according to the manufacturer's manual, it does contain this, so I am researching. The fifth star that this item cannot get is due to the fact that the manual is written by an expert who does not realize that not all customers are experts, assumptions are made I think that the reader understands fully when an abbreviated statement is made. Although a CD is added with a manual, the manual lacks in lots of information and I am now preparing to get on the reviews to gain access to set up information, i will not go to the manufacturer to ask questions since they have done enough putting together the manual that is hard to follow. The alarm and e-mail functions are yet to be set, so i don't know how these will function, i am sure once set these will be ok.Anyway, the camera has commenced working, pan, tilt speed control etc.functions are happening and i am glad that i can do this via wifii without any difficulty. My advice to the manufacturer, subcontract the manual portion so that a proper instruction can be put together with detailed step by step fashion so that this excellent piece of equipment can be more user friendly.
