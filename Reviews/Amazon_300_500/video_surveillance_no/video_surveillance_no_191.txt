First surveillance system for me. I did a fair amount of research over the space of a couple of days. This was super easy to set up. I only bought one camera to start with but will probably get more. Upon loading the software it automatically went through a software update. The software update took longer than the set up. Once the update finished and I started to hook things up it only took 5 minutes. I spent more time adjusting the camera angle but that was really easy using my smart phone to check the image. The ability to zoom in/out is terrific. I was able to get both the front door and rear sliding door on one camera so it worked out perfectly for me.The software is very easy to use and very intuitive. I am impressed with the number of options i.e. setting commands per camera. For the alerts it appears they are always on, unless I missed a setting. I would recommend a time of day feature so you can set it to provide email alerts only during certain times, like at work etc. Again, it may do that but I did not see that functionality during setup.The only complaints I have are more nuisance than material. They say not to plug your router module to a surge protector. I plugged this into my wireless router (which works sweet) and of course, I have everything on surge protectors/battery backup systems so had to re-arrange the plugs. The other complaint is the video cords could be longer. They are about 10-12 feet long so if you are going to run one quite a ways I would recommend getting a longer cord or extensions. I will probably get a higher capacity SD card as well. None of these complaints take away from the product.
