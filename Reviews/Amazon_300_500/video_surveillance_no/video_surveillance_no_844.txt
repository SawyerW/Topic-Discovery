Great clear picture anywhere in the house.  The VOX setting where it turns off the sound and picture after 3 minutes of quiet is unnerving at first, but seems to kick back on when it should.But I noticed my Apple TV was buffering really bad when trying to stream Netflix, and my wife's Laptop had dial-up speeds trying to pull up websites, with the monitor camera on.I have a Cisco E2500 Dual band WiFi router.  Using Speedtest.net app on my phone (and standing by the camera), I had 18mb download speeds with the camera off, and when I turned it on, it dropped to .20 to .50mb speeds.  Upload speeds were not affected and stayed around 3MB.After trying different settings on the 2.4Ghz band, I found that setting to Channel Width to 20mhz (default is auto for 20mhz or 40mhz) and setting on Channel 11 instead of Auto, did the trick to ovoid the conflicts.Channel 1,6,and 11 typically do not overlap and might work better then the others.  A 2.4GHz wireless network can have up to 3 routers working in a small area with no overlapping by using channel numbers 1, 6 and 11. If you have a lot of neighbors with WiFi (and who doesn't these days) this might help as well.EDIT:Well, the next night I still continued to have issues with WiFi in the house with the monitor on.  I was able to move my 2 iPads and Apple TV to 5Ghz N network, as the E2500 is a dual band.  However this leaves my Wife's laptop, Kids Laptop, and our iPhone's still with WiFi issues when this is on.Will see what workarounds I can find....EDIT:Well, it still creates havoc on our 2.4Ghz network when in use, but most everything we have can also run on 5Ghz so really a non-issue.
