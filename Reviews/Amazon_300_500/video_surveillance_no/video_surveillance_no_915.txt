This is my fifth HooToo camera and my first outdoor camera.  It arrived in a few days and in good shape.The setup is the same as the other IP cameras I have and took me less than an hour to set it up to my liking.  I use their IP Client software during the setup process. Their regular software to monitor several IP cameras works, but not the way I prefer.  I use IP View on my Android phone instead. It works very well and is mobile.During the installation I temporary installed the camera in three different locations.  I wanted to see how it performed with different outdoor lighting.  Like most cameras, it did not do well when the sun was in front of the camera.  I live in Nevada and we get a lot of bright sun.  When I installed the camera on the east side of the house, facing north, the video was clear and color good in the day light.  At night, the IR light was good (biased to the center like most cameras I have used) and the video is black and white.  The IR reaches 20-30 feet providing good video.The mechanics of installation took about 20 minutes.  The mounting plate could be a little sturdier, but it works.  The final place I installed the camera took less than ten minutes. It is about 60 feet from my router and the WiFi signal must pass through 4 walls.  There has been no loss of connection during the two weeks I have had this camera.  As far as construction,  it looks well made.  I will see how it handles our winters when the snow comes and the temperature falls to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.I rated this camera 5 stars because it does what I need very well for the price.
