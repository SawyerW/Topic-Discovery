I ordered three of these for a large garage area and the covered walkway approaches.They arrived in two days (Nevada to Washington State), were easy to install, and work fine.A few notes: they take 2 AA batteries (not included).  The units mount with two screws on the bottom (screws also not included, but easily available at a hardware store).  The battery compartment is on the bottom, so do not tighten the screws down too far into the wood, or you'll have a tough time when it comes to battery changing, as it's a twist to remove sort of thing to disengage the unit from the wall/ceiling. An alternative to screw mounting is two sided velcro (given that the units only weigh 5.45 ounces/155 grams with the batteries inside).There is an odd 1/2 inch open hole in the bottom of the unit that seems to have no useful purpose other than to let in moisture and bugs.  Plug this up with tape before mounting.Placing this unit in an area that is exposed to direct moisture (like rain), seems problematic as there are quite a few places for the water to enter along the bottom plastic globe dome edging, and under the base.The flashing red LED light is bright, and at a distance of more than say 8 feet in a darkened area, the units look similar to my much more expensive real cameras installed last year.These get a five star rating for usefulness for the purpose, and overall value.They also get a five star rating for the humorous use of English on the outside of the Chinese-made box: "welcome to use our camera!" "Inside and outside the villa installs the photograph function to play the better guard role!" "Emulational camera can be wsed both in front and behind cars!" (not sure I'd want to do that last one...grin).
