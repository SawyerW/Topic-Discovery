Jan 16, 2013 Update: I heard back from Motorola customer support that a different division handles Motorola Baby Monitor repairs, so I would need to contact another department than what's listed on the baby monitor itself. I've already spent too much time trying to fix this monitor, so I'm now just living with the defects listed below since I refuse to drop another $220+ on another monitor.Hopefully they've addressed these problems with their new units, although I've noticed that there are now more highly rated monitors on the market (such as the Samsung). If we have a 2nd child, I'll be looking into that monitor as a replacement and avoiding Motorola in the future._____________________________________________________________Feb 7, 2012 Update: This is the second defective unit I've received. I ended up returning the first unit and purchasing another since I thought it was defective, but the second unit is having the same problems. Basically, when I try to turn the monitor on it will display a blank white screen without any image or sound. The only way to fix this is to reset both the monitor and camera, which requires unscrewing the monitor case, unplugging the battery, then unplugging the camera and then reversing this procedure to reconnect everything. This is less than ideal since it requires waking my baby.I've downgraded my review from four stars to two until I head back from Motorola on a possible fix._____________________________________________________________Original Review:This is the first and only baby monitor I've used, so I'll keep this review succinct:Pro's:1. The ability to tilt and pan is great, and worth the upgrade from the 2.8" screen model if you're on the fence.2. The temperature reading on the screen is definitely helpful.3. The large LCD makes it easier to verify that our baby is breathing (my wife watches for chest movement to confirm).Con's:1. Every once in awhile it'll drop a signal (seemingly, it happens mostly in the middle of the night!) even though we're not moving the unit at all. It'll then let out a series of loud beeps which wake us up immediately, and is very frustrating.2. There's no time display on the unit, which would be nice for timing how often our baby wakes up or how long he's been crying for (we give him a few minutes to self-settle before entering his room).3. The display can be very bright especially if your baby's crib and sleep outfits are in light colors. Even on the lowest setting, the LCD will illuminate most of our bedroom if we have the LCD close to the baby. The brightness is reduced by placing the camera farther away, but then my wife can't see him breathing (see pro #3 above).I've left out some of the pro's and con's already covered by others, but felt the above items were worthy enough to call out for potential buyers of this unit.Bottom-line: It's not a perfect monitor, but it's pretty darn close!
