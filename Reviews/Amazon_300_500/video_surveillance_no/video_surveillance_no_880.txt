Agasio M105I Outdoor Wireless Wifi Waterproof Bullet IP Camera with IR-Cut Filter, Two-way Audio, Night-Vision, Email &I tried to contact Foscam support for the last 5-8 days through email and phone. I got hold of them couple of times after waiting on the line for 3--45 minutes and then I was told that our Sr. Technician will call back that's it. Finally I thought of writing the product review so at least future buyers will undertsand what they can expect the support.The camera works fine and easy to setup. I was able to make it up and running in 30 minutes. Some how I was not unable to view multi camera on one screen, so I called them couple of times but no luck so far. Finally, I gave up after several attempts.Next thing was the power extension, since I want to mount the camera atleast 15 feet away from the nearest power cord I thought of getting extension cord. I emailed support and I got the below message.************We offer a 10 foot extension chord cable. If you are looking for a longer cable you can find them at any electronic or hardware store. no specific brand is recommended.

I don't undersrtand why the support person told me to purchase it. I returned both the cords today and I didn't find any extension in electronic shops like [...] and radio shack. Perhaps it need a convertor set if the size is different. Today I called the support again to find out whether I can get the extension cord. I was told that they will get back to me later.
