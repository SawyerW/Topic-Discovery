The included software will control and display any number of cameras in a tiled window.  It will constantly monitor and record, or alarm and record on motion detection, among many options.  It will pan at a button push to 15 positions you set.  The panning control is very good, in that you can pan and tilt in tiny increments.The video is color in lighted conditions and black and white at night.  The color video quality is typical for a web cam.  The night vision is better than I expected.  The night vision works in zero light.  It is crisp black and white.  The frame rate drops in night vision mode though.  I'm getting 10 frames per second on average at 640x480 (15 is max) over WiFi G in lighted conditions, and about 4 FPS at night.  The video is equally good indoor and out.  There is an outdoor setting you must use for outside use.The audio input is pretty noisy, but you can understand someone talking.  I have not tried the audio output.The motion detection is a little slow to start recording, so it will miss a car going by, but not a person walking.You can monitor using Firefox (worst) IE with an included DirectX plug (better) or the included software (best).  When you connect with a browser, it has a smartphone option.  It works okay on my Droid X.  My computer is running MS Windows XP SP2.A good quality adjustable wall mount is included, as well as an Ethernet cable and software CD.The documentation is hilariously Engrish.  The software registration code is on a sticker on the last page of the manual.  That took awhile to find.Bottom line:  I paid $57 for mine.  The price keeps going up, as at the time of this writing the price is $68.  It is worth every penny of $57 and probably $68.
