Love this Home monitoring detector system full motion detection & Now I feel much safer knowing mother has that extra awareness, we installed a few of these around house to notify my mom of intruders or visitors & man it works fantastic & as planned!We bought the whole kit!FYI, I was a full time caregiver for four years taking care of my loving grandmother of 98 in her last days of life which just happened I did such a good job she lived 4 years longer than everyone expected her to! Vanilla Ensure and Yogurt and Vitamins is what I have her daily! Onward to suggestions, I had gotten a few things to help in the quest to prevent my Grandma when she would get up by herself to go to bathroom she would fall often! I hadn't any rest or private time or peace of mind constantly worried about her to the point we connected in time. I could feel her breathing properly or not. a personal thing between the both of us!  SO I tried a few things and created a INSIDE CAMERA SYSTEM in various places in the house were she liked to sit and like to go, It worked for a while watching all the Recycled cellphone android IP Cameras streaming to a TABLET that displayed 9 cameras full time! In time the android Tiny monitor cam pro app worked and got better and better with an amazing DEV at the helm! Todays Tiny monitor cam PRO has motion detection built into the actually monitor app so no longer needing Motion detectors, Just needing really good camera at this point! Als I tried pull string alert systems that did in fact help me to arrive to grandma in time to help her to her destination! Looking back now though I would of have Much preferred these motion sensors in the long run with the full kit telling me where I need to go check out movement etc!In all this stuff is to help bring a caregiver peace of mind and help make easier to live alongside giving care to loved one!Enjoy Hi5 I hope anything I shared with you all may help you one day!Justin CramDyingJedi
