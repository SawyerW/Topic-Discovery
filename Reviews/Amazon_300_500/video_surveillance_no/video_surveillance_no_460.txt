I've used my monitor for four months, and I love it. They've changed the problematic beeping as of March 2014 so that is no longer an issue. A few weeks ago I tried to plug my charger chord into the monitor screen (apparently a bit too hard) and the connecting piece came loose, fell into the monitor, and it would no longer charge. I called the company, and they returned my phone call within 5 minutes from caller ID (I left no message) to see if they could help me. I told Mae of the problem and she had me send the monitor back. As soon as I had texted the picture of the package at the post office, they sent me a new monitor (which got there the next day) without even waiting to receive the monitor from me. The new monitor works wonderfully, and Mae followed up to make sure everything was satisfactory. I've bought many thousands of dollars worth of products on Amazon in the last year, and this is the best customer service I've received.Now what I like about the camera: The one thing I didn't like (the beeping) is now eliminated with the March 2014 version. I love that I can move the camera when I'm not in the room to adjust the view or to check something like if the baby's blanket is still covering her feet. It also makes it much easier to get a good view from anywhere not just one specific location. I also like the zoom function and the room temperature check function. The chord on the camera is really long so that I can move it all around the room depending on if the baby is in her swing, rocking sleeper, crib, etc., without unhooking something permanently fixed in one location, like over the crib. I can see if it's dark in the room or light without changing anything (although there is a brightness function if you want it). I'm a very satisfied customer and would highly recommend this monitor.
