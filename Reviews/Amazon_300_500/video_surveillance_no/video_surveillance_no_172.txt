The camera is excellent for a home systems. Setup was really easy, with detailed and pictured instructions.The beauty of this system is the software. I was able to install a 2nd hard drive for computer storage, and everything worked flawlessly. I was really surprised how well this system works, even though the network communication is through the house electric lines, the technology is perfected.The nightvision (IR) is pretty impressive, although the software does not allow for manually turning on Night Vision, the automatic control is fairly useful - you are able to manually turn off the night vision.I was really amazed of how easy the installation was. They included plenty of cable. All you need is a wired router with an extra port which goes to the master receiver, which converts the signal and sends it over your powerlines to the camera receiver. I planned for a full day of trouble shooting and playing around with the network - the whole thing took about 20 minutes, followed by placement and installation of the camera itself. I was even able to set up an account and watch my house on their Alert website, which setup was also a breeze (No messing around with DNS servers and complicated port forwarding).Video quality itself is pretty good. Its not 1080p, but it gets the job done. The audio is actually VERY impressive - you can hear conversations from at least 30 feet away. You can also turn the mic sensitivity down so that you don't pick up on neighbors or wind.I don't think this would be good for businesses as you can only have 6 cameras on the system. The other big reason is that the recording needs to go to a computer on the same network. While you can view the camera on their secure website, you can only store the recordings on a local computer, which could be damaged with an event which security viewing is needed.
