I decided to upgrade my old 4-camera slow-mo VCR based system to the DVR system.  When it was all said and done, I only used the existing wires to the 4 cameras.  My old cameras were shot, I didn't even know it (10 years old).  I only used the old system when we went on trips.  Anyhow, I now have 8 cameras up and running covering the back along with the front of the house.  The system runs all the time now, so no worrying with trips.  I have it set up on the network which did require running a cable to the wireless router.  So, I can view the cameras from my laptop via the network.  I can also view the system from the internet, when away, using the same software on my laptop.  You should be able to view the cameras from a smartphone, but I have not done that.  You don't really need a monitor on the actual dvr once you have the network setup.  There are some settings you can not get to without being at the dvr during the initial setup.  You will need to know or be able to figure out some networking issues but they supposedly have a tech support line to help.  I never had to call them!Update - 9/16/2013  Just found that the DVR was not recording.  Called customer service for Swann, very nice but some communications issues!  Sending unit back for replacement cost me $18 to send back, not happy about that.  Hope the next one lasts more than 2 months.  The problem I have with this unit, is it gave no indication it was not recording.  I have the unit hidden for security issues and without seeing the red HDD light not blinking, you don't know.  I was viewing via the Intranet and nothing alarmed me to the failure.  I just tried to pull up some old video and found it!  Right now I would down grade to 4 stars, if the next one doesn't last I will change it then!
