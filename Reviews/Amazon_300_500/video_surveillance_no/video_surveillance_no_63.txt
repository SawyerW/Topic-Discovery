I LOVE the TruthCam 35 and I'm having a blast with it.Besides seeing all the critters that visit my little farm at night, including the $#@# coyotes that keep stealing my chickens, it's great to see who comes up my driveway when I'm not home. Usually just the mailman or UPS but I have had some wood stolen in the past and next time I hope to see who the thief is.I get a lot of videos of bunny wabbits jumping all AROUND my Havahart traps.I also now have PROOF that my neighbor's two big dogs are regular visitors to my property. They have also helped themselves to my chickens and my garbage cans and he promised to keep them off my property. He adamantly denies that they still run loose. But my TRUTHcam has revealed the TRUTH, along with the time and date!My ONLY complaint is the MINIMUM Ten second delay before it starts recording video. It is so ANNOYING to see videos showing only the tails of animals or no animal at all because they've walked by the camera, setting it off, without the courtesy of stopping to pose for the camera. A car can drive by and start the video AFTER the car is already out of sight.I can understand the reason for a delay but give me the OPTION of a shorter one or NO delay before recording video. Ten seconds is a long time.One bit of advice: Don't aim it at tree limbs or bushes that blow in the wind or you'll get a lot of videos of limbs and bushes blowing inthe wind <G>.Another caveat, for reasons of cost and LEGAL prohibitions in some states(to protect the privacy of people, not deer), this camera does NOT record audio. Still a LOT of fun and a GREAT tool to see Who Goes There!
