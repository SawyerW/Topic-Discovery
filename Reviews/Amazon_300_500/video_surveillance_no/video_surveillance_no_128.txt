I was running out of space on my RAID 10 drive which was 4x640gb WD Caviar Blacks so chose these as replacement.  They are running on a 3Ware 9640SE raid card fine.  In my case, they run about 91 degrees F, your results will vary obviously depending on your case set up.  These are a tad noisier than the previous drives, but not enough to be a concern, hard to hear them over the case fans which are not super quiet on my system.All the drives ran when I received them, no DOAs but 1 did fail the WD drive tool test.  I contacted Amazon and was cross shipped a replacement at no cost, received in 2 days.  This is one very good reason to buy drives from Amazon vs other online computer hardware companies which will charge shipping for replacements.  I highly recommend using the WD drives tool on any WD disk you buy prior to setting up on your system.  Use the short and long test.  My drive passed the short test but failed the long test.If you are upsizing an array that will auto rebuild, just replace 1 at a time letting it rebuild before replacing the next drive.  This worked great for the RAID 5 drive on the MB ICH10R.  Using the Intel Raid Management tool (free download) I resized without losing any data after all 4 drives were in place.  The RAID10 on the 3Ware card would not upsize using 3DM2 tool so I contacted LSI who wrote a script to upsize the array.  Ran the script as directed but it only upsized half the array, so it became corrupt and I lost the array.  Fortunately I had just made a System Image on a single disc (2TB WD Red) and was able to quickly restore the image using the Windows 7 disk.  If you have a RAID card, there's a pretty good chance the Win7 installation will not have the RAID drivers included, so make sure you have those available on a USB or floppy before getting into a position that might require you to restore an image after losing an array.
