I purchased this camera a month ago but wanted to try it out for awhile so I could give it a fair review.  Here's what I noted.  The camera itself works excellent.  In daylight it takes color pictures or videos and at night time, it takes black and white pictures or video.  If you are using the picture format, you can select that if it detects movement, it will take 1, 3 or 5 pictures in sequence and you can set the time frame between each picture taken.  For video, you can set how long you want it to take the video for.  The pictures come out brighter than the video but both are of high quality.  There are only two things I noticed negative with this camera.  The first is right at dusk or dawn, when it should be doing nighttime recording, it is on daytime recording so the pictures come out dark, but that occurs only over a short period of time before it switches to the appropriate day/night setting.  It seems like the daytime setting stays on too long at dusk and comes on too early at dawn making the pictures in that time period dark.  The second problem I noticed is that when the battery starts going down a bit, the pictures start getting darker.  I guess the infrared lights dim down as the battery voltage drops.  I guess that makes sense though.  In the one month I've had it, I've caught all sorts of animals both in photo and video.  I definitely would recommend this camera.  One final note.  When removing or installing the SD chip, be sure to use the rubber sealing piece to keep bugs out of the unit. If they get into the chip area and you push the chip in, the bug will get crushed and then the chip will not make contact to work.  I did have this happen to me but it was my fault for not closing the rubber sealing piece.  Luckily I was able to clean it out with a small eyeglass screwdriver.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Primos Truth Cam.  It's worked great for me so far.
