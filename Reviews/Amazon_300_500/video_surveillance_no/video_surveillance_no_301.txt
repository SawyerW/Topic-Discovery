This is a simple kit you can use to quickly set up digital monitoring with motion-detection recording. You can even get started without reading the manual. For a simple system test, I simply powered up the camera and monitor after plugging in, and the monitor immediately showed video and audio from the camera (don't get them too close or you'll have a bad case of feedback). You can then set the date and time. The 2GB card is a micro-SDHC plugged into a full-sized SDHC carrier. All features worked as advertised (video is recorded in AVI format) and I was able to monitor the remote camera more than 100 feet away (from back of house to the front).I did not test this system with multiple cameras.However, no system is perfect, and I do have a few beefs:- detailed specifications are lacking; there is no indication of the maximum size SDHC storage supported- only two recording resolutions are available- the mini-joystick is too small, causing inadvertent, erroneous menu exits- the camera is not weatherproofed, and there is no way the SMA antenna connector will remain corrosion free in my local weather- the camera's power cord is a 7-foot pigtail that simply exits the camera body - this makes for an awkward install- the camera's pigtail connector has a diameter three times the pigtail's diameter - this means an unnecessarily larger hole for installs- you are limited to a 15-foot power connection for the camera (unless you plug the wall-wart into an extension cord)- this system's use as an intercom is extremely limited, as the camera's speaker is quite small with tinny output- the Web page did not offer any hints, tips or other detailed information about the system- a power outage will reset the date and time - not a good thing in my area w/its frequent outagesYour biggest problem will be finding an outlet for camera power with this system. And before I do my install, I'll need to build a weatherproof box for the camera - it will cease to function after several months due to the salt air in my locale.
