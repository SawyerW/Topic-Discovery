I have 2 of the Night Owl Apollo's and they have been a good value.  I needed a 3rd security DVR and I went looking for another Apollo, but they have been discontinued and apparently they were replaced by this unit. So I bought this unit thinking that Night Owl may have done an upgrade/improvement over the Apollo to keep up with the offerings from the other guys, but I was wrong! Night Owl really cheapened this thing out compared to the Apollo. They took off ALL the buttons on the front of the unit, now when you want to do an instant record/stop you just can't push a button, have to find the remote (now when I push the record button on the remote all 3 units start recording when I only need the one to record!!!!). They took away the instruction manual that told you how to install the hard drive first, on units that didn't come with one and put in a Basic Quick Setup Guide, which doesn't even mention installing the hard drive (in fact the install manual on the CD doesn't mention the hard drive installation either). Speaking about the hard drive they took away the hard drive bracket and now you install the hard drive through 4 holes in the bottom of the case (cheaper that way) and the SATA data cable is so short it barely reaches the connector on the hard drive. I could go on and on, but I think you get the message that they went as cheap as they could and still get it to work and I have to say it does work, but I will say one more thing and that is I would have gladly paid more money to get an Apollo instead of this cheapo thing and it is needless to say I'm very disappointed in NIGHT OWL!!!
