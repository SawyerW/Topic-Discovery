I purchased this monitor for our third child as all of the other video monitors we have purchased (one for each of the previous children) broke.  On the old monitors it was always the monitor device that broke and not the camera, so I like that this doesn't even have a monitor device, we just use our iPhones & iPad.  The camera is very sturdy and works great.  The picture is great quality, and the sound is good enough for a baby monitor.  I read some reviews that the sound quality was not great on this monitor, and I think as long as you aren't expecting to be able to listen to music from your baby's room on your phone and have it be the same quality as in the room you probably won't be disappointed in the sound quality.  I did have to pay for the app to use this on my phone, but it was only $13 and covers all of our Apple devices.  I just factored that into the cost of buying the camera.I was initially able to get the monitor to work as long as our devices were connected to our home network but couldn't figure out the technicalities of getting it set up to work outside of our home network.  I filled out the customer service request form on Wifi Baby's site and was able to schedule a service appointment with Gary from Wifi Baby the same day.  He did a screen share and got everything set up perfectly for me.  It was an awesome customer service experience.  It really is very technical to set up the out of network viewing, so it was nice to have Gary just take over my computer and set it up for me.  I'm not tech savvy and trying to follow the instructions for the set up over the phone would have been very difficult.  I was really worried about not being able to get this to work based on other reviews, but it all works great after having customer service set it up for me.  Overall I really like this product, and the customer service at Wifi Baby is awesome!
