This is a suction cup mount for very small point and shoot cameras. It arrived in a box with a sheet of instructions. You press it against clean glass, push the air out with the PRESS button, and pull the locking lever. Then attach a camera, and that's it. I use it for a small fuji point and shoot all weather camera in my Toyota Yaris. Works as described.Pros: low cost, ease of use, versatile.Cons: short mount arm - almost impossible to use on windshields, poorly written - contradictory instructions, flexible = added camera bounce.Summary, this device is intended to be used on nearly vertical or horizontal glass, not a sloping windshield. The only way it can be used on a windshield is if the camera was upside down. It is designed to be used only with tiny lightweight digital cameras.On my car, on the windshield, when the arm is extended up for a normally positioned camera mount, there is not enough clearance between the top of the camera mounting screw and the windshield for any device. Maybe your vehicle windshield has less of an angle than my Yaris and it may work for you. And use on a door window doesn't work because there is not enough clearance to see around the roof support column to look out the windshield. It might work from a sunroof or a bathroom mirror, but only for a tiny point and shoot camera. I should try mounting it to the car hood. I did try once mounting it on the outside of the car on the windshield but feared I would earn a ticket for doing so.additional comment: After trying a few other suction cup mounts, I revert back to this one because of it's short size it adds minimal camera vibration. However, the camera you use on this must be very small because it is difficult for the camera mounting surface to give enough clearance from the mount itself to put much of anything on it. This is a great mount for the Ego digital camera. I have never had the suction cup come off even once yet.
