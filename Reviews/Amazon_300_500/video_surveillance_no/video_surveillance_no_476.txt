Let me start by saying my intial experience was not so good. I ordered this item to monitor my business and upon arrival was quite shocked that the unit I received was not intact. The cover was loose and in fact was not even attached, nor were the screws even in the box. Despite this defect, I fixed it and proceeded to connect it because my other unit was old and had crashed. Despite the units battered arrival, installation was super easy and I had it online and running in no time. It was at that moment that I realized the unit was a stand alone unit, which means it does not include the hard drive. The description was a bit misleading in the details because it mentions all its wonderful ability to record videos etc. While this is true, it can only do this with the addition of a hard drive, which must be purchased seperately. I ended up buying one and installing it and the DVR malfunctioned and failed to record. I contacted the company and they agreed to replace the DVR  after I shipped the defective one back. I requested through Amazon a return and the company keeps sending me emails with their return address. I explained it has to be initiated through Amazon but they keep sending me direct emails with their address and not a return through Amazon. Because I cannot have a lapse in monitoring at my business, I bought another unit from them until the defective return could be resolved however to date nothing has been handled through Amazon. Given my experience and the fact that I am a technical gal, I have decided to just keep the defective unit and repair it myself (although it looks refurbished already) and cut my losses. I am giving the item 3 stars because I do believe the product itself is a good one, but is more of a seller issue. They were very nice but the issue was never resolved. On a better note, they do ship quick and with the second shipment, the packaging was much better and that unti worked just fine after I installed the hard drive.
