I now own this monitor for almost 4 months as a replacement for a previous Summer Infant. We decided to upgrade the older monitor mainly because of the multi-camera capability. After these first months of experience my impressions are:PROS- Multi-camera capability: it really works. We have one camera in our daughters room and another one in our little son's. It works perfectly- Crisp picture (althought the screen is a bit too small)- Portability- 2-way audio: perfect with our little daughter. I can ask her to lay down without having to enter in her bedroom.- Infrared led: it does have a good range and you can see the whole bedroom even in complete darknessWHAT COULD BE IMPROVED- Range: it's amazing I did not see too many reviews putting it as a CON. Our unit fails at only 15ft of distance between the camera and monitor! The product description says the range is 150 feet indoor (clear line of sight required), however 15ft is a joke! This is mainly the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars only. One thing that may explain the difference between my (bad) experience and the average of the other reviews could be brick walls versus dry walls... My apartment has brick (thicker) walls and it may be the reason why the coverage is a disapointment for me...- Vox: does not really work as expected. The screen and sounds blinks intermittently, regardless of the sound level- Battery life: cameras and monitor need to be charging if you want them running all night. Battery lasts for about 3 hours only.Bottom line: if the range were at least twice wider I'd give it a 4 star. With such a low range, all the nice features become pretty useless, since I cannot use it from my bedroom. If you have dry walls, give it a try.
