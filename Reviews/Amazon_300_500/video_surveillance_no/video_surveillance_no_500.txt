Well, I really tried to like this one, I really did. In the end there were just a few minor things that didn't work out for me.First, the night vision works GREAT... inside. I had my camera aimed out the window from inside to monitor the exterior where the window is lowest to the ground, this way I could see if anybody was coming up to the window. During the daytime the video was easily viewable and clear as long as the camera was focused, but at night the LUX turned on and reflected off the glass of the window, and that's all you could see; just a series of highly illuminated dots.So, we moved the camera to the main hallway where it could monitor both that window and the front door with the simple left and right motion. This is where I got a little irritated. I thought I had seen somewhere, a YouTube promo video perhaps, that you could set preset locations, so that all I would have to do was click "Front Door" and the camera would move, automatically, into position to monitor the front door. No, doesn't have that.Second, there is no way to flip or rotate the image. To get a clear shot of the front door the camera was all the way to the left, in which the image was 90 degrees CCW. To monitor the window the image was 90 degrees CW. The head tilting got old.I also wasn't too keen on going thru D-Link's web site to view the camera. I just didn't like the idea of us walking around our house comfortably and the camera running.In the end I took it down. Besides these cons, the camera was a breeze to setup and still got some great images. But, it's just not what I'm looking for right now.
