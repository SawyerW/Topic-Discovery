I bought this for home use about 2 1/2 months ago after several unlocked cars in my neighborhood were been "broken into" and had change stolen out of their ashtrays.  We figured it was neighborhood kids due to the things that were not stolen -- i.e., one guy left his wallet (containing cash and credit cards) on his front seat but they only took the change in his ashtray.The included instructions were minimal but clear and had plenty of color pictures to guide you thru setting up the cameras (which you really could figure out without the manual.)The first thing I did with this was swap out the 500 GB hardrive that it include with a 2 TB Western Digital Green drive I bought at the local Best Buy.  That was just as easy as opening a desktop computer and swapping out a drive plus, it greatly extends the amount of video you retain before old video gets overwritten.I added 4 more cameras and have the system recording 24/7, except for a weekly automated reboot).  It took about 9 weeks before my initial video was overwritten.It has an on screen menu that allows you to setup up each camera, motion detection, alerts, etc. according to your preferences.  I figured that out without instructions but it would have been nice to have a comprehensive, full color manual that explained things in a little more depth.I did not try connecting this to the Internet and configuring it for smart phone viewing so, I can not speak to the ease or efficiency of that process.  Besides, why would you want the NSA looking at video of your house? :)The most time consuming part of the install, was running the wires from the cameras to the dvr.  I looked up "how to fish wire" and "how to install security cameras" videos on YouTube and that armed me with enough information to tackle those tasks.This is the first dvr system I have owned/worked with so, I cannot compare it to other systems.  Nevertheless, it has functioned reliably for me and more than fulfilled my expectations.
