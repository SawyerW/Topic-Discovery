I am writing this mainly to warn potential buyers of the issues that I have encountered after several weeks of use.Here are some details about my setup. I am running a Netgear 6300 wireless router and minus the update I needed for the camera, setup was a matter of linking the two wirelessly.  Once you register directly on Dlink's website, you were able to access the camera via online. I later downloaded the app on my iphone 5 and found several issues.The app does not allow the transmission of voice and sound simultaneously. I need to press the mic on to speak and then press the mic off to hear. By the time the mic was off, the person on the other end was already halfway through their sentence.  The mic works better than average and is built into the camera base.  There are no built in speakers, so keep that in mind. The auto day and night vision works as advertised.Another issue I found was the inability to pan and tilt with one continuous motion. Can you imagine trying to view a burglar on your property? By the time you get from one end of the house to the other, he or she would be gone.The sound begins to skip/pause after an average of a minute so the need to press the sound button to refresh is required.Once you setup the different viewing qualities, you are given the ability to change between them on the app. This feature would be great if the higher quality settings didn't lag as bad as it does, which really renders it useless.Accessing the camera via online allows the user to patrol and store key positions for quick viewing but these features are unavailable on the app.Like the other reviewers have stated, this is still in beta and requires more attention.
