Already many reviews which I try to not repeat here.  I do like this camera and find several pros and cons which I have not seen documented and list below:Pros:1) Based on my calls, Panasonic offers fair technical support.  Perhaps those who where not happy with support should have hung up and called back.  I needed to do that a few times.2) All home monitoring camera's perform poorly in low light conditions regardless of the brand.  Bottom line: No light, no picture.  Some do better than others obviously in lower light conditions, but there is a general threshold in the evening where you must turn on the lights for the camera to operate.3) I have found no problem logging into and using the panasonic site (viewnetcam).  It has worked seamlessly for me and provides password security which has been just fine.4) The camera does have 10x digital zoom capability - use the scroll capability on your mouse if available.  Needed to do a web search to understand how to use this feature.Cons:1) There is NO ability to attach an external speaker, nor is there a speaker integrated with the camera.  When we were on vacation, our cat would come to the camera for the first week when we connected - must have been some mechanical noise the cat picked up.  However, the second week and onward, our cat didn't appear.  Had we been able to call out via a speaker, she would have appeared.  Our next home camera will have both Mic and speaker capability.2) Documentation is a bit lacking.  Web searches may be your best approach to capture general guidance on using the camera.Update on July 1st,2011: I changed my router and needed to reconfigure my two Panasonic netork cameras. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Panasonic provided telephone support even after I owned the product for more than two years! That is very cool and the tech support person was very knowledgable.
