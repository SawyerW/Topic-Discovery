I bought these and love the visual system though I would prefer a bigger storage capability. I guess one could have the DVR for a bigger capacity one, though for family use, this could be enough once you remember how much video storage timewise you can hold.  As is, it only records for 6-7 days and then it overwrites from the beginning, so I would go for a bigger HD if I could have a choice. I am doing an update to this review since I have been given very detailed customer support from the team in Lorex regarding a problem that I reported to their ticket system. As It turned out, I had changed some settings that badly affected the system's ability to make backups and I couldn't make a backup. I had a great response from their  customer service after I got their attention. My thanks and deep appreciation for their special attention to the problem I was experiencing. One thing that I still don't like is that they close the tickets without verifying that the problem had a solution. I say this because I am used to other systems,  TechSmith for example, maker of  several computer programs  that i have used in the past and present and all their tickets are closed once the user tells them that they implemented a solution and it solved the problem. i think they should wait for this to happen or investigate more.What can I say about the hardware? I am very satisfied with the quality of the video and the capabilities of the software to personalize the experience. An  8 camera system like this gets a big area covered with sharp and detailed LIVE video with the ability to review past recordings and make backups to USB. It also has the capability to set alarms, set motion detection, black out some areas so they don't appear on the monitor (though they are recorded) .  There are so  many features that I cannot remember now, so it is  very comprehensive system to have. So far it is a solid 5.
