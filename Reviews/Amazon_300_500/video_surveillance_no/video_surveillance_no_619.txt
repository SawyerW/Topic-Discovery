First off, let me start by saying, I am a Systems Technician and do install camera systems. Right now I am currently working on a 60 camera install with 40 PTZ's at a cost of 1800 per PTZ.I was looking for a system for my home but really didn't want to spend too much money on a system just for my house. So I began looking. I spend 2-3 weeks searching and going between 2-3 different packages and arrived on this one. It was a great price, and game with a tb hard drive and 8 cameras. Can't complain. So I ordered it.I wired it before it arrived at my house. I bought 4x4x2 crylon boxes and after I had all the wires in place (6 exterior, 2 interior), I mounted the Crylon boxes outside and mounted the Cameras to those. It looks really sharp. I have already gotten compliments o how it looks.I then bought a nice little 16 inch flat screen dedicated for my DVR. (It was 80 bucks). I set the DVR up which was mostly straight forward. A few options they put into places I'm not used too but no big deal there. All manufacturers have their own scheme. I really like the interface though and how it looks. BIG name brands like Samsung have clunkier schemes. I hooked it up to the internet and was viewing these bad boys on my phones and computers in the house within minutes. Easiest Network setup I have ever done.The only real "complaint" I have it that the 2 interior cameras have a really hard time staying in their color/day mode. Ill check at 3pm with ample light and they will be in dark/black and white mode. Kind of annoying but I will move them around and see if I can get better ambient lighting for them. Not really a big complain....just something I need to work on.Overall, I recommend this. And Q-See did a great job for an package system.
