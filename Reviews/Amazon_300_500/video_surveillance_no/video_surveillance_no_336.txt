Recently our neighbors had an incident where a CO detector went off in the middle of the night and perhaps saved their lives. It reminded me that our old detector (Kidde Nighthawk) had eventually got to the end of its life and we had to throw it out and we had not replaced it. So we looked for a replacement that we could put up easily in a good location.How do you judge a CO detector? I searched online and checked out reviews of those that actually test these things with Carbon Monoxide and found that the First Alert was frequently rated better than the other brands. I wanted one that had both AC power and a battery backup and this one fit the bill.Here's what I like: After opening it up and popping in the included batteries, it was ready to go! The attached plug and cord are designed so that you can install it directly into an outlet or hang it somewhere else and run the cord to the outlet. But since Carbon Monoxide sinks, plugging it in at wall outlet height just makes sense (It can also be rotated 90 degrees in the outlet to make more room). You really don't even need to look at the instruction manual because it is so easy!People make a big deal about the lighting, etc. on the digital display, but here is the thing to know: The displays on these CO detectors generally do not display anything until the level reaches 30 ppm (even the ones with the always-on red digital display). Anything under 30 ppm and it simply says 0. So the only reason you need the display is if the alarm actually goes off. At that point the LCD flashes red and the number is displayed so that you can report it. I also like that this unit will keep the number in memory for 24 hours (after all, who of us will remember the number if the alarm is going off at 2:00 AM and you are calling 911?). The rest of the time, all you have to do is look at it and there is a small green led indicating that things are ok. Peace of mind!
