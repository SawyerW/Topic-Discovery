First off, I really like this camera.  Mainly I wanted to share some helpful tips with others that may be considering this for purchase.1. This is a night vision camera.  If you use this outside in the daylight colors will appear different than they do to the human eye.  This is normal.  (It looks like my trees are Cherry Blossom's in full bloom.  Kind of cool.)2. They hard code an IP address in the camera and expect to see your home network in the 192.168.0.X range.  If it's not, (like mine, it's a 192.168.2.x net) then you may have difficulty getting to the camera from your PC to set it up.  I simply backed up my router configs, changed it to a 192.168.0.x network, reset my PC's networking, and I was able to browse to the camera and set it up to where I wanted it.3.  This is an indoor camera.  If you plan on pointing it out a window it will work pretty good during the day, but after dark the infrared lights will reflect back off the glass and blind the image.  This is normal for this type of camera.  You can still point it out the window, but you'll need to do something like cover the existing LED's on the camera and purchase an "infrared illuminator" (there are several on Amazon) and install it outside the window, covering the area you want to see.4.  I have 64 bit Windows7 and could not get the little CD to work for me, but was able to configure the camera just fine via my web browser after I got through the initial networking stuff mentioned above.On the CON side, I'd have to say that it would have been smarter to simply make the networking DHCP and not have hard coded the IP address.  I'm sure a this has confused folks into thinking that their camera was dead on arrival.  I'd also like to have an easy way to turn the built in infrared LEDs off if I want to use an external source.  That's all the negatives I have though.  Great bang for your buck.
