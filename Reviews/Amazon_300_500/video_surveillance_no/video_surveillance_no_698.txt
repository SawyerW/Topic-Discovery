Thanks to the folks positive comments, after a lot of research, I purchased this system for it's wide angle cameras, reports on night vision quality, and night vision range.  Thanks to David from CO and his tech knowledge and willingness to help troubleshoot, I figured if I got stuck, I had a good resource out here.  At David's advice, I ordered the system and at the same time ordered 100 foot runs which we used.  My electrician put additional motion lights up and mounted two cameras.  The picture quality is very good; I still need to test the night vision recording for quality.  The menu driven setup is fairly intuitive.  We programmed to record on motion during the day, and steady recording after darkness.  We'll install another camera, and figure out how to connect wirelessly once we have the system running the way we want.  Also, we'll add a thumbdrive for more recording time, and see if we can get that working.  I am happy with this choice, after alot of research.  Update: 9 months later.  System works very well.  In fact, I will purchase another system since I am so satisfied with my own.  At my other property, my tenants had a bike stolen, and the 3 fam next door is full of degenerates, so I intend to purchase this system with 8 camera capability. I order with 4 cameras and purchase 4 dome cameras. I'm considering posting 12" bilingual warning signs "24 hour surveillance" since the system does not have an audible alarm to deter theft. One last comment:  People who are giving this system low grades imho are unrealistic or inexperienced. If you have 5K or more to spend, maybe you can do better.  For for 300-500 bucks, this system in unparalleled for it's quality, it's features, it's wide angle cameras, and it's night vision range.
