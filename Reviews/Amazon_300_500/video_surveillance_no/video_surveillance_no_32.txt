I had gotten some Midland LXT110's recently (mainly for airsoft, paintball, fishing, and what not), and these headsets.  I had tried my friends headsets before, and they're good quality, but it hurts my ear after a while, (why I use headsets when I'm fishing (ice fishing mainly), I don't like when other people hear my conversations), I tried these, and oh my god, these are perfect.  The sound quality is amazing, like a perfect diamond, comfortable like a broken-in, leather recliner.  So easy to use (2year old could probably figure it out).  At first when you put it in your ear, it'll feel weird, but it's comfortable after about 10mins (for me) (it's just a tad uncomfortable at first, and you can still hear outta that ear quite easily for it being like an ear plug).  Some people may be wondering why I got these for airsoft as well.  Simply put, I HATE it when my position is given away because someone used the radio, and the wrong time (for me).  With headsets, I can hear my teammates, hear movement around me, and more importantly, hear my enemies radio call end sound.  The weird thing about these in my opinion, is the placement of the PTT button, but I'll get used to it soon enough.  A plus side of these being clear, perfect sound quality (as if the person was right next to you), you sometimes forget that your wearing it, and, sometimes, people don't even realize you've got a headset in use.  The mic is actually so clear, that I put it up to my small boombox, held the PTT button on it, and my friend could hear EVERYTHING on the other headset.Pros:EVERYTHINGCons:Sometimes you forget your wearing it and say something out loud forgetting to push the button (if you don't have the VOX setting available on your radio).5 - 5 stars on this FINE product.  I would be a dick and say to "BUY IT, IT'S AWESOME" and sound like a 5 year old, but what I'll say, is:I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a 2pin Midland radio.
