Short Answer:I purchased one of these to see if I could use it to mount a laser pen in a project box.This turned out to be a very lucky purchase.  Looking at other "360 degree omnidirectional universal mounting brackets", I thought I was going to have to spend a lot of money to mount a few of these lasers.  It turns out, this little $8.00 bracket is precisely what I need.  With a little ingenuity, I imagine it could be used to mount all sorts of project items.  So I ordered more of them to mount the rest of the lasers.Detailed Answer:IncludesRound Base (free standing or wall mountable) - 2 3/8 inch diameter, sturdy metal, magnetic*, 3 screw holes."X-Clip" (easy mounting on drop-ceiling) - About 2 inch span, light-gauge metal, magnetic*.Omnidirectional Head - (screws into either of the two mounts listed above) - pose-able in almost any direction, easy thumb-twist setscrew, solid construction, feels like it could support up to a couple pounds quite easily.1" shaft (inline extension) - very solid, heavy metal, highly magnetic*, screws right in line between head and either base to add length to the mounting aperture2" shaft (inline extension) x 2 - just like the 1" shaft above, comes with two of them*magnetic* - does not have its own magnetic field, but magnets will stick to it quite strongly.Using either rubber bands or electrical tape, I was able to secure the laser pen to the mounting head quite easily, quickly, and solidly.  Using strong magnets, I was able to secure the mount inside the project box without using screws - the magnets I used (neodymium, from inside an old hard drive) were able hold the mount in place, right through the side of the box.  When the project was finished, I secured the mount in place with short machine screws.I can mount a thousand things with this bracket!  Excellent $8 mounting solution for your scientific project.
