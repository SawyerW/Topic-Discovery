This DVR is a good price for an entry level turnkey solution but know what you are getting.Q-See is a decent brand of DVR / Surveillance equipment but this particular machine is the botton of it's line.  My recommendation is to spend a little more at get the next model up (QT5516-1).These are the specs directly from the manufacturer's website.  I can confirm them to be accurate.  Note that the major flaw is in the FPS (Frames per second) vs resolution.  There are two modes (CIF or D1).  You need 30 FPS / Channel to have usable video and you need a minimum resolution of 700 x 480 (with preference to be 1024 x 800).  With this model, you have to choose between the two.  The bad thing is that the live view doesn't represent what is being recorded. With this model, you will most likely be surprised when the occasion arises in which you need to playback a video segment.DESCRIPTION-DVR Model: QT4760-1-Video Compression: Advanced H.264-Max Hard Drive Storage: Supports 1 SATA HDD up to 2 TB (Not Included)-Backup Via: PC, Flash Drive, USB Hard Drive-Power: DC 12V / 3A-CIF Recording Option: Real Time: 480 FPS (30 FPS Per Channel) (On the onset this looks good as 30 FPS/channel is the standard but note that CIF only has the resolution of 352x240 which is small)-CIF Playback Resolution: 352 x 240-D1 Recording Option: 120 FPS (7.5 FPS Per Channel) (The D1 recording/playback is good resolution at 704x480 but frames per second per channel is horrible at only 7.5 FPS/channel)-D1 Playback Resolution: 704 x 480-Recording Mode: Motion Detection, Time Schedule, Alarm Trigger, Manual-Video Inputs/Outputs: 16 BNC Input(s)/1 VGA Output(s)/1 BNC Output/1 HDMI-Audio Inputs/Outputs: 2 RCA Input(s) /2 RCA Output(s)-Network Interface: RJ-45 for Router Connection Enabling Remote Monitoring-Pan/Tilt/Zoom Control:1 RS-485 Connection (PTZ camera not included)-Live Display Resolution: 1024 x 768-Display Modes: Single Camera, Split Screen Multi-Camera, Auto-Sequence-Video Search: Time, Motion Detection, Alarm Trigger, Manual-Computer System Support: Mac OS X 10.7 & 10.8, Windows XP, Vista, 7-Compatible Browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox-Mobile Phone Support: iPhone/iPad, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile-Simultaneous Remote Viewers: Up to 10 Users-Stream: Dual StreamUPDATE - An owner has posted (see review comments) his experience with this DVR which highlights what I did not mention in my review.  Frames Per Second (FPS) is directly influenced by the number of active cameras recording.  In his post, he notes that he gets almost 30 FPS at full D1 with only using 4 cameras.  This is certainly a good point but for anyone looking at this model with hopes to use in excess of 4 cameras, my opinion remains as posted.
