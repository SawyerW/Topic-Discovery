I have had this monitor since August of 2012. It was the same a friend of mine was using and she liked it, so I gave it a try.This has been the first and only baby monitor I have purchased and I really like it. My daughter is on the opposite side of the house so having this has been extremely helpful.I leave It charging during the day so is ready at night. What I like about it is that it turns on when the baby stirs, coughs, etc. Otherwise the screen is turned off. The button on the left, when pressed, gives you a live view of the baby. I love the night time feature in which I can see the baby in BW. What I have used the most is the lullabies. Sometimes my daughter stirs and I turn on the music from the handheld monitor and I can watch her go back to sleep. It can play one song or random which is the one I use. I don't like that the music is a little bit loud in her room, but at least is blocking out any other noises around her preventing her from going to sleep.Sometimes, the monitor goes out of range (don't know why) but it usually fixes itself up. Another small issue I have had is that sometimes the picture is so dark on the handheld monitor that I have had to go in the room and turn off/on the camera for it to reset.Those are the only issues I have had. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.EDITED June 2014- The monitor stopped working all together. I thought it was the battery, so I ordered a new one. It didn't work. I contacted customer service and they didn't offer any assistance because I was out of warranty. They offered me a $5.00 discount on another purchase...So I will be shopping for another camera...from another company.
