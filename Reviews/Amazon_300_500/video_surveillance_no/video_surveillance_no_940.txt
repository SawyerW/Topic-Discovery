First, the good points. The cameras and DVR were easy to install and set up. The eight included cameras allowed us to get excellent coverage of our 2800 square foot sales floor, and the DVR has a versatile set of programming options to customize when and how activity is recorded. If everything worked properly, this would be a good video surveillance option for small businesses.Our unit seemed to work properly out of the box. We were able to monitor and record activity in the store and log in remotely to view the camera feeds. Within three days of initial setup, we began to notice some of the same problems other reviewers have reported. Our unit will only record reliably when in continuous record mode. If the unit is set to record only when motion is detected, it will randomly change to continuous record, back to motion detection ("alarm mode"), and sometimes it won't record at all, even when there is motion. Q-See's tech support admitted there was a firmware problem with motion detection in D1 mode and suggested we record at lower resolution. One of the reasons we selected this product was its ability to record in D1, so this was disappointing, but we set it to CIF resolution as instructed. Unfortunately, this did not correct the problem. Our DVR will only record reliably if it is set to continuously record, which fills the hard drive much more quickly and makes it difficult to review video if an incident records. Motion detection mode simply does not work properly.Q-See's overseas tech support seems eager to help, but they have not been able to correct the problem and have dismissed my suggestion that the unit is defective. The system works, so I'm giving it a second star, but not as advertised in the product description here and on Q-See's website. Overall I regret purchasing this product and do not recommend it.
