I did a lot of research on baby monitors. I ended up choosing this one after reading the reviews. The image and sound are great, I can literally see my baby breathing in the dark thanks to the infrared. We never use the lullaby feature, but sometimes use the intercom feature.I have a couple of problems with this monitor though that should not go unmentioned:For over $200 - you would think they could have made it a Lithium Ion battery - the LAST thing a new parent (or any parent) needs to worry about is a stupid battery with memory. I have used my monitor for less than three months and the battery is pretty much shot. We tried to only plug it in when it was completely empty, and unplug it when it was totally full - but things happen and you need to grab it, or the nanny or a grandparent plugs/unplugs it without understanding they are killing the battery, etc. It used to have a long battery life, but now we are down to a couple of hours, and I see that diminishing further as time goes on. A replacement battery appears to be about $30 online, though I plan to see if I can get one for less.The camera and the way it hangs up - the only option is to have a shelf near the crib, or a nail on the wall above the crib. It would be nice to have had something that could have clamped to a curtain rod or nearby shelf. It is especially a pain if you travel with it and then you are using trash cans and boxes to try and find something to put the camera on near where the baby/child is sleeping.The image on the screen can't rotate - I constantly have to pick up the monitor and turn it on the side. This is not a problem, just annoying.I like the monitor, but I basically feel like you can get an awesome iPod Touch and a wifi camera and do a lot more with the same amount of money, with less hassles about the charger/battery/camera placement, etc. I don't think we would buy this again or recommend it since we are already looking for another monitor that can fill the gaps.
