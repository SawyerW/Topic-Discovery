I currently use a Dlink router and the MyDlinkApp for Android which I love as it allows me to remotely manage my router and reboot it anywhere. This Dlink wireless camera appealed to me because it interfaced through the same android app so I got it.The camera arrived packed well. I took it out of the box and set it up in my foyer focused on my front door, but placed so I could control it and rotate it to see my stairs and other areas. I loved how easy it was too plug in and get online. I also like the audio quality, it is pretty crystal clear and the pan/tilt is silent so you don't hear a loud motor when you rotate the camera.What I didn't like is that the camera has some issues.1. It is blurry, yes I followed the directions in the manual and I was able to get it focus, but it doesn't seem to have an auto focus so if you set it for one view if you pan/tilt the focus isn't locked in. I found for me I had to really not move the camera to get optimal use out of it. Seems silly to not be able to rotate a pan/tilt camera because when I do it goes blurry.2. The auto day/night settings don't seem to work on my camera. It's placed in an area and at night it gets pitch black, the camera doesn't switch from day mode to night mode, likewise in the morning it's pretty bright in the foyer and the camera doesn't switch from night to day mode. I have to manually control this setting.At this time because the focus issue I can't recommend this camera. I also have the Wansview Wireless IP Pan/Tilt/ Night Vision/ Internet Surveillance Camera Built-in Microphone With Phone remote monitoring support and that has all the same features, however it's motor is noisier so you hear it in the audio and it's more of a pain to setup. But it has auto focus, auto day/night works and I haven't had any issues out of that one.
