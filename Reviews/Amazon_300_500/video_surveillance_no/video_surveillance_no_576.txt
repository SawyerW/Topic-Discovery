Overall this was a bargain Wireless IP Webcam. Despite the poor documentation I had no problem setting it up and getting it working with my monitoring software. At longer range (over 40 ft) wireless communication was somewhat lackluster showing a lot of dropped packets and periodically losing the signal altogether. However it could be dramatically improved using a high-gain antenna or wired connection. Other wireless devices at the same range from the router worked without any of these issues.I ended up hard-wiring the camera which made a vast performance improvement. Effective web device interface offering solid pan/tilt control and a reasonable quality picture other than the fact that the grass showed up as purple and my black sweatshirt showed up as various shades of blue regardless of contrast/brightness controls. Night vision worked particularly well and since it switches to monochrome, none of the color balance issues were present.If you don't care about the color issues and just want a simple IP webcam for security purposes this will do the trick for a reasonable price. I wanted to like this camera but it simply does not compare to the quality of my Foscam IP camera which has good colors and is more solidly built but that costs at least 50% more.Bottom line, its not terrible and the price is right so you get what you pay for, maybe not all of these cameras have the same extreme color problems but judging from one reply to my query in the answer section, I know of at least one other user with the same issue. Your experience may differ, unfortunately there is not a replacement option from this supplier, just a return one, I may reorder at a later date if the color issues get resolved but in the meantime it is on its way back for a refund.
