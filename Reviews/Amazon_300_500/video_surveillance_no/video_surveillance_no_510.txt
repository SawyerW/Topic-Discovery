The DVR has a somewhat flimsy case and the power brick cord seems like it isn't fully connected but it is; the connection just doesn't have a solid feel to it. However, it all works.  The other connections: USB, HDMI, ethernet and BNC, are all solid.The instructions are easy to follow. I first set up the DVR, which makes a loud beep when turned on. I used an HDMI connection to an HDTV and the menu was clear and legible. The mouse worked as it should. Initially I tried to connect to the network using a powerline router extender (the kind that you plug into an electrical outlet and it uses signals sent over the house electrical wiring) but the DVR failed to find a signal. I then connected it directly to a router and that worked. The instructions do say to connect it directly as it might not work using an intermediary between the DVR and router. Setup using the onscreen menus was easy.The cameras are sturdy and connect solidly to the DVR and the power brick. Each brick comes with a 4-way power splitter; i.e., you can connect up to 4 cameras to one power brick.  Each camera also comes with a very long cord. I would prefer wireless in order to not have wires running all over the place but for the price of the set, I can't complain.Once connected, the pictures from the cameras were fine. Colors were good and there was also good detail so you can really see what is going on.For my purposes I am not using internet monitoring so I can't comment on that feature of this system. But as far as the picture from the camera and and reception and onscreen display on a television, that all works very well. The main limitation of this system is that the cameras are wired, not wireless, so you are restricted as far as placement.
