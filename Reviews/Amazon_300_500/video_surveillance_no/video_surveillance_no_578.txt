I have other IP Cameras that work much better than this one at comparable price.First, the Good:1. Video quality seems good. That's it.Now, the Bad:1. Network settings are idiotic.  It comes "preset" with static IP 192.168.0.178, DHCP turned off.  So if your home or work network uses anything besides that, you have to first change your entire network, or find another router (or cross-over cable), change your computer IP settings to the 192.168.0.x subnet, then connect to 192.168.0.178 via web or included software to change it to DHCP or set a static IP, then undo everything in reverse order.  Ridiculous.  Other cameras come DHCP enabled, you plug it in, it gets an IP on your subnet, you connect to it, done. This one, fail.2. E-mail alerts don't work. Again, other IP cameras I have send e-mail alerts just fine. This one will not, using the same settings, as well as every other possible setting (TLS, SSL, SMARTTLS), port 465, 587, you name it, I tried it. Nothing.  Noteworthy: all these cameras appear similar in their backend firmware, only the user interface and software varies and this camera lacks there.3. Cannot save PTZ presets.  Really? That's a shame.4. No product support on manufacturer website.  Lists many of their other model numbers, but the NCB541W is nowhere to be found. If you hope to find firmware for it, keep hoping.5. 2 of the 3 of these cameras I got failed to work.  Even after following steps in #1, 2 of the 3 would never respond on the network.  No response to ping, no web response. Just sat there blinking green light. It's possible that these had their network settings changed then were returned by someone, and got reshipped to me, but by this point, I was over it. Returning all 3 and sticking with the EasyN brand that worked much better, has more features, is also on Amazon, and cost the same.
