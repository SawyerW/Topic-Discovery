First of all allow the point that several of the reviews written here on Amazon to applaud the excellent customer service of Foscam are posted by people who have never posted a review before. Take away from that what you will but it makes me wonder how many of these hundreds of reviews are from actual customers.My own experience is that although when the camera functions it is great we do have a return rate so far of @40% (purchased 8 with 3 defective so far) and teetering on returning all of them. We've been testing and installing these over the last 10 days or so and have 4 up and functioning, 3 of them working fine. The problems on the ones we returned were right out of the box and have been various to the infra red feature not working, broken antennae, and pan not working.Now we have the technical/software problem that the cameras will flicker (the picture rapidly changes contrast) resulting in dozens of false motion alert emails sent. I learned through the Internet that one possible solution is to change the resolution settings from 640 to 320 and this seems to work. Unfortunately the cameras revert back to the 640 setting on their own. All attempts to reach Foscam fail. The telephone says "all circuits are busy" whenever I call, the chat offered on their website while it offers help when you submit a request an auto-responder replies "how may I help you?' but no one is there.The cameras are pretty cool and when they work it really solves an issue for us. Unfortunately when quality and service are this bad it can only mean that they are so busy they can't keep up or they don't care as they are going out of business. I don't think any company can survive on this extremely high return rate and lousy service too.
