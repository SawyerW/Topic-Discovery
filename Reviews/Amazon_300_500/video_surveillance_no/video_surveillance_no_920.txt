I noticed dust and other accumulated schmutz in my heating system intake ducts.  I had a duct-cleaning vendor come out to examine my system and make a recommendation as to whether it needed cleaning or not.  After taking a cursory glance, the technician concluded that it needed to be cleaned, despite not even bothering to look at the ducts leading from the unit to the grates.  He spent more time figuring out how the ducts were run through the attic and walls, but only by using a flashlight while standing on a ladder in the attic.Since my system has an electrostatic filter with a traditional filter on the output side, I started to wonder if the dirty ducts were only on the input side.  So, I plunked down less than $20 for this camera.  I took off a vent / grate on the first floor, and the sheet metal duct was clean as a whistle.  I also have flexible ducts, so I figured those must be dirtier, since there is more surface area for dust and dirt to accumulate.  I taped the camera to a fish line and stuck it as far into the duct as I could get it.  I showed everything was clean, with absolutely minimal dust / pollen.  It seems doing regular maintenance on the heating system and cleaning the electrostatic cleaner twice a year really works.Needless to say, I won't be calling any duct-cleaning vendors soon.The camera works great, you can adjust the brightness of the LEDs to avoid glare, and the picture is surprisingly clear.  I had to download the software from the web and install it that way, since my Surface tablet doesn't have a DVD drive.  It took me a little while to find the download, but it is out there.Very happy with this purchase, though I've only used the camera for this particular application.  I can see where it will come in handy for other situations.  One caveat - I have no idea if it is really waterproof or not.
