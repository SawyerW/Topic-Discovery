First I'll start by saying I would give this monitor five stars if it were not for the fact I had not one, but TWO break within 6 months.  The sound just completely went out, and luckily both times it happened during the day so I noticed immediately and did not happen at night.  Amazon was of course great the first time sending a replacement same day but now that this happened again I requested a refund and ordered the Samsung SEW3037 instead.  I think there is a flaw with either a large batch of these or this design in general because there are many other reviews now noting the same issue.  I used it heavily during naps, all night etc but isn't that the point??? Really dissapointed in Motorola bc of this.... I expect a $240 monitor to last at least a year.As for the monitor when it worked-- Great clarity, great range, sound quality is good but did pick up lots of background noise, and one note is the buttons/controls are set up oddly.  The volume you have to toggle to the menu to access which any parent knows at 3am when you dont want to wake your partner up this is annoying..and the Pan/Tilt buttons are on the left side in a row.In case anyone wants a comparison, I just received my new Samsung video monitor the SEW3037 model.  Its great.  Buttons are much better set up and parent friendly...Volume on the side, PT buttons in a circle layout, has a nightlight, and shows the time which is also a nice feature.  The clarity is very good...Same clear color for daytime but the motorola has a slight edge in the nighttime viewing. Still though, its clear enough to see my sons features, lost pacifier etc.  The sound is much better...the motorola picked up my sons white noise machine very loudly, this one does not and I hear him crystal clear.  It also has a VOX option so you can have it idle to a sleep mode when it does not detect a certain level of sound.  As to how long this one will last, I'm hoping much longer than the motorola monitor!
