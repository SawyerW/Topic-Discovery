I bought this system with 4 cameras.  The setup is very easy, you set the date, mount the cameras and the cords you use have both the video and the power attached together.Since my house has a lot of trees (making it hard to get a bird's eye view), I mounted them low, kept the DVR in my basement and ran the cables out of basement windows (easy to run cable in your basement)The video quality is good even at night (when it is black and what); like watching a VHS tape.  But if something major happens to you, you will wish you had HD.  My car was broken into during the day time, I was very happy to have video of what happened, but if I had HD instead of high resolution I would have had a better look at his face and most importantly, I would have gotten his license plate number (this guy drove to our area to walk around and look in car windows)For the money, it is worth it.  These are the negatives:One camera went bad immediately just from me unplugging the DVR itself.  Even though the power is separate, I guess that sent a surge that blew it out.  Q-See sent me a replacement.A 2nd camera went bad 2 months after having it.  I sent it to Q-See and I hope a replacement is coming.  I was able to see when the camera stopped working and nothing happened to cause it.  It went from recording to being a frozen screen to just dying.So will these last long term?  I tend to think they will not and I don't want to be buying replacement cameras periodically.If you video constantly and use the best quality on all cameras (as I do) you only have 6 days worth of history before the old stuff gets written over.  It's easy to write video onto flash drives, but sometimes you realize something happened more than a week before and you are SOL unless you decrease the quality or video less (like set it to record only when it detects motion).
