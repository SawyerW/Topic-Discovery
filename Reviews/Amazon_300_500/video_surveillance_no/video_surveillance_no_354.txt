I initially bought just just one Linksys/Cisco WVC80N WiFi camera to see if it would work for my scenario. During the 3 week evaluation, it worked like a champ, especially with Cam Viewer on the iPad & iPhone. So I bought 3 more for my home and 6 for my business, for a total of 10 WVC80N cameras.That was between June and October 2011. By January 2012, 8 were working properly and 2 would only work if I hard wired them with an Ethernet cable. In other words, the WiFi stopped working. Over the course of the next couple of months, one by one, all but 2 stopped working over wireless.YES - 8 cameras with dead WiFi!!!!!All told, they lasted between 6 months and 9 months before almost all of them failed. DEAD WIFI. Only 2 WVC80N cameras still work like they did when I bought them.And yes, I know how to configure them, yes, I have a technical clue and no, I did not configure either the cameras or my routers incorrectly. I tried static addresses, MAC address filtering, reserved DHCP, WPA2, WPA, WEP, no WiFi security, different routers, different physical locations, ad hoc networks - if there was a test to get these 8 cameras back online wirelessly, I tried it. And this is in 3 completely separate physical locations on 3 completely separate networks that I control.8 of them are dead. Coincidence? I think not.If you run long Ethernet cables to the cameras, they do work... but that is not why I bought them. That is not why you (the reader of this review) are thinking of buying them. I bought WiFi cameras - I received rubbish.Check Google and you will see that this is a widespread global issue that Cisco just ignores.Your mileage may vary. Caveat Emptor!*** Edit : I should add that all of them are running the latest firmware dated 10/30/2009 - version Ver.1.0.01  I updated them as soon as I bought them in 2011.UPDATE: As of December 2012, 18 months after buying the first Cisco-Linksys WVC80N camera, ALL 10 CAMERAS are DEAD. ALL OF THEM. You have been warned.
