I bought this because I have heard there were problems with the Summer brands and being able to see into others signals and with a lot of kids in our neighborhood I didn't want to deal with that so I got this monitor.  It has been great.  It is the perfect BASIC video monitor, and I think people forget that it is a BASIC video monitor. Heck, it's only $99!There are other reviews on here that complain about screen size and when the monitor turns on due noise or lack of motion.  The screen size is fine for what it does.  I don't need some HD top of the line screen.  Just something that I can see if my child is awake on.All I can say is that with as much noise as a baby makes and as much as a baby moves in the middle of the night I would not want it to go on every single time, no one would ever sleep because the monitor would be turning on every 5 minutes!  Now our bed room is close to our child's room so I can hear when he makes small noises and I am fine with it not turning on, but if he crys, coughs, sneezes, it turns on.  But that is good enough for me.The only con would be the beep the monitor makes when you have the sound turned on when it goes into VOX power saving mode.  It is a bit annoying, but at night we sleep with the sound off because like I said we can usually hear everything from his room, and I am such a light sleeper that the light turning on is enough to wake me up.Overall I love our little monitor.  We haven't had any problems with it interfering with our wireless and it works all over our 3600sqft house.  Oh and the camera can be mounted on the wall if need be...I only wish it could zoom in.  Thats it.
