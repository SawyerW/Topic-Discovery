I recently purchased a refurbished unit from Amazon.  While relatively complicated, I was able to get it to work on my home wireless network in a couple hours.  Next I tried to get it to work over the Internet.  It appeared that it had been registered for online use by the previous "owner".  I called Panasonic and they said it would take them TWO to THREE WEEKS to clear the registration.  This was a factory reconditioned device so I'm very frustrated by the delay.  I suspect many refurbished devices have been registered.  The Panasonic representative gave a quick response so it appears to be a common problem.  I tried to get them to exchange it but they said it was good product.  Apparently Panasonic considers a product good even if it will take weeks to get it to work as specified.This a a very complicated product and I would suggest that unless you able or willing to spend time tweaking your router, configuring the camera, and on the phone to Panasonic that you wait until they are more plug and play.  There is a reason Panasonic has knowledgeable tech support - lots of install problems!Addendum: 5/14/09 - Product is finally working and meets my expectations.  I called Panasonic after waiting a week for the camera's previous registration to be cleared (this prevented online use).  The support person indicated that the camera had been cleared and proceeded to help me setup online access.  I'm not sure why I never received an email saying the camera was ready.  I was also told that I was quoted 2-3 weeks because Panasonic Japan (server location) was scheduled for a 1-week shut-down for holiday.  Normally the camera registration can be cleared in 2-3 days.  The original support person should have said that - he  made it sound like 2-3 weeks was standard processing time.I'm very satisfied with the camera but still believe that to configure the camera/router for online access will require panasonic support for most users.
