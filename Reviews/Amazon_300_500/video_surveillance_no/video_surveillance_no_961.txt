My children are too old to use this as a baby monitor, however, it does work very nicely for my wife to keep tabs on my safety while in my workshop.  The 2 way communication is nice because my wife no longer has to send one of our screaming kids out to get me for dinner or if they are in need of my assistance for something.  On the other side, I can ask for assistance if I am doing a big project or am just in need of some company (not usually why I'm in the shop though).The range on this thing seems good.  My workshop is about 50 feet away from the house and I have no problems using it.  Sometimes, for kicks, my 8 year old son will turn on the lullaby which always makes us both laugh.One feature we never thought we would use is the night vision.  I am rarely in the shop after dark and if I am, the lights are on.  However, about a week ago, I noticed some of my things were on the floor when I know they were on the bench.  After watching the night vision, I found that a squirrel decided to setup a home in my shop and would not go in while I was in it.  We saw how it got in and made it so the little thing cant get in it again (at least not that way).  There are plenty of woods for it to set up a home in near my house.Unfortunately, we don't use the other options on it, although, I do like to see the temperature of my shop before I go to it.  It allows me know if I need to turn on the AC or soon, the heat (yuck).Very little setup was required.  It actually worked pretty much right out of the box.  The monitor is rechargeable and holds a charge well, although we mostly keep it in its charging station so it doesn't get lost.
