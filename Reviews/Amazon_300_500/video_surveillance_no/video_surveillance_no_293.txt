If there would be one complaint with the Defender I would say the it's the video quality. The video is comparable to those rather grainy surveillance cameras you may have seen on your hi-def unit at home when they show 7-11 robberies etc. That said, I wasn't really expecting 1080P out of this unit, it is what it is. It lets you see what is going on around the outside of your house. It helps to adjust the settings to high quality but it is still rather poor. The unit is relatively easy to set up which is a major plus as it includes the needed hardware to mount your camera and detailed instructions on setting up your receiver and how to operate the features of both receiver and camera. There is 24/7 lifetime customer support although I haven't had a need to use them yet. I have tried it in two different locations to see the difference and there was a minor difference in the area that received more night time light. It comes with a 2GB SD card so you may want to put a larger one in for convenience,otherwise you can delete as the card holds 340 minutes. If you need additional cameras the Defender allows up to four cameras if you need more areas under the watchful, motion detector eye of the Defender.I am new to having a security system at home, so the hookup for a novice is fine I believe. If you have a business, this may not be the unit for you, as you may want a little more of an elaborate system, although this one works just fine. All in all I think this Defender is the near perfect , slightly grainy electronic eye you may want observing what is happening around your home at night or while you are away. Recommended for those that don't want to break the bank but want to feel secure.
