I purchased the Levana Babyview20 monitor when my toddler got his 'big boy' bed so I could keep an eye on him.  As someone else wrote, the ideas are good in theory, but not in practice.  Interference free means that the monitor automatically changes channels when it detects interference which apparently happened every few seconds in our house. It also has a voice activated feature in which the camera only picks up sound when it reaches a certain preset level.  Once that noise level is reached the sound is great, but when it changes channels (you don't always know it's doing this), it either resets to where it has to be noise activated or the monitor and camera get out of synch.Putting it all together:When it changes channels and switches to voice activated mode, the noise has to be pretty loud in order to activate it (like a loud speaking voice) and there is a slight delay.  I didn't like this because I want to know when he's awake even if he's not crying or being loud. The picture doesn't seem to be affected when this happens.Sometimes when it would switch channels, the camera and monitor would get out of synch in which case you don't get any sound from the monitor (the voice activation does not work) and the picture may be frozen as well.  You have to go into the child's room and push buttons on the camera in order to resynch...I think you can see why this would be a problem, especially as often as it was happening with us.  The customer service rep I talked to said that even a neighbor's wireless connection could cause interference, so even if you don't have any devices that run on the same frequency, this could be a problem.All that said...When the monitor was working well, it was great. The picture quality was good, the sound was good and it was very easy to use. I, however would not recommend it.  I would rather get some interference and know that I can always hear and see my child.
