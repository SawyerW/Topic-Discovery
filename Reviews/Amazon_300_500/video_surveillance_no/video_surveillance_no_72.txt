When I first got this camera for viewing wildlife in my yard. I could not read the card on my computer or camera so would take it to the drugstore photo kiosk to see what images were on there. After 2 weeks, the camera would tell me the SD card was full when it wasn't and would not take or store images. I called the company and they were very polite and sent me a new one (after having to purchase a new SD card in case that was where the error was). They even sent a return postage sticker. It again only worked for about 2 weeks and now even though I reformatted the card and it says there are images on it, NOTHING will read them and I was thinking of buying a game camera viewing device but I now think that the camera is doing something to the cards and it would be a further waste of money. I am very frustrated because I have a security issue that this camera could help with but it is once again worthless.I wish the company would fess up and fix the problem and give us all a refund who have had these issues.Since writing this review, I again called the company and was not treated well, was told it was my error, which it wasn't. Nothing was done to rectify the issue, much less admit defective or underachieving product.  I have since purchased a Tasco and it has so far proved wonderful. I called tech support to ask a question, it was fast and easy information AND the card used in the Tasco, Bushnell product, can be easily read on an iPad using an Apple card reader connector, which I purchased on Amazon. The pictures and range have been excellent with the Tasco...don't waste money and frustration on the Primos.
