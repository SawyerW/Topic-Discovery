Had I done more research, I probably wouldnt have purchased this (more on that later), but it does a good job for what it is.Range: The range is good for our use.  With door closed, and around the walls, we get solid reception.  We live in a prewar building in NYC with very thick walls, and this had fared well.Screen: resolution is acceptable, you'll be able to see just fine as long as its close enough to baby. The zoom function is somewhat useless to me.  I've tried zooming in many times early on to make sure baby was still breathing (paranoid parent!) and it gets so pixelated its hard to make anything out.Nightvision: At night this is actually quite clear and crisp within a reasonable distance, which if used as a baby monitor wont be a problem (i.e. you wont be able to see way down a hall with it, but 10ft is fine).Battery:  its been just over a year, and our battery is showing signs of not holding a charge for too long, and thats with keeping the screen off most of the time and not heavy use.Controls:  pretty intuitive and simple.  The pan and tilt is very responsive and an excellent feature.  The music option is kinda silly and doesnt sound great IMO.  One annoying thing is the volume, in that you cant turn it off.  When we go to sleep, there's a constant humming sound coming from ours like some sort of sleep machine.  It would be great if you could turn off the volume completely, or they upgraded their tech so that it stays off unless there's a reasonable level of sound (i.e. a baby crying).So,  what would I do differently now with some technical proficiency?  There are IP cameras you can buy on Amazon at a fraction of this price, that have much better quality video and night vision, and allow you to view the video from your smartphone, or computer, as well as auto alert you if there's any movement detected.  Clearly the setup requires time, whereas the beauty of this is theres zero work to be done, just plug and view.  Your choice.
