This camera works great! Easy to setup (granted I really really know what I'm doing). Mostly I want this review to help everyone having problems with the e-mail notification and remote veiwing.1) Remote viewing  What you need is really a ROUTER that supports both DDNS (DynDNS) ,Single Port Forwarding, and DHCP reservation. The Linksys E3000 and above does, so that's easy. Use DynDNS.org, not the TZO that comes on the camera. Set the router to DHCP reserve whatever IP you want for the camera(s). Then setup SINGLE port forwarding for whatever unassigned port you want to goto that address (e.g. 47152 --> 192.168.1.3). If you have more than one camera setup more ports to their addresses. Open the DynDNS.org account and choose the hostname option. Follow all the prompts, make your account and put that info in the router. You should get confirmation of success. Then just use a browser and goto [...]# (ex: [...]:47152). You will get the normal web interface for the camera like you were on your home network and typed the IP.  Also a great app for viewing on Android and iOS is IP Cam Viewer. The developer updates regularly and recently added audio support for this camera on Android and iOS.2) E-mail alerts  Goto lavabit.com and setup a basic account (128MB). You won't be keeping anything on this account so you don't need the space. Use their SMTP settings and your new account info and put that into the camera web interface. Direct the e-mail to your real e-mail, and show it from the lavabit.com one you just made. SSL is off by default for lavabit.com, so as long as you don't turn it on, the camera can send from that SMTP server.If anyone wants me to clarify on this review just comment and I'll get an e-mail alert. I'll do my best to answer.
