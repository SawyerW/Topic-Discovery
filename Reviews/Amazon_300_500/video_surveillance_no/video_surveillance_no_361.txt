We recently had a baby, and I bought this camera, two FOSCAMs, and a TRENDNet wireless IP cameras to set up a network and watch over the nanny.  This camera, which I assumed would be the best of the bunch, actually ended up being the worst one.  I've had lots of linksys products in the past, and currently have a linksys router, so I was most confident that this camera would be good.  The first camera, which I bought on Amazon, was unable to connect to my wireless network.  The installation CD was useless, and essentially started returning a bunch of errors.  I tried to set it up manually, since I've become fluent in how these things work thanks to my nanny-cam network, but it just wouldn't find my network.  I finally called tech support for Cisco, and they were great.  They spent two hours trying everything under the sun to get the camera to work, and in the end admitted that it wasn't the settings or the network, that the camera's wireless function was not working.  They sent me an replacement camera, which had the exact same issue.  I spent hours trying to get it to work, and had the exact same problem.  So, fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice...can't get fooled again.Apart from the wireless issue, the camera worked great.  Had a better picture, and better audio, than the FOSCAM or the TRENDNet.  But really, that's like saying that apart from the shooting, how was the play Mrs. Lincoln.  The whole point of these cameras is to be in a wireless network.  I have to say that, in my limited experience, the FOSCAMs were the best of the three kinds of cameras I bought.  As numerous comments note, they are not the easiest to set up.  But they work, they pan, and the picture and sound is adequate.  Not great, but they get the job done.  My made-in-the-USA Linksys camera, not so much.So be forewarned, these cameras apparently sometimes have problems with their wireless connectivity.
