This is an overall great value once you understand a few things.This device is susceptible to RF noise.  Its either gonna work, or you have to much RF noise and it will not work.The camera has a series 2 dip switches which give you which give you 4 frequency ranges to play with.  The base has a tuning knob to fine tune each setting of the dip switch.When you initially plug this thing in IT PROBALY WILL NOT WORK.  Play with the dip switches on the back of the camera in all positions and fine tune on the receiver dip switch each position.My intial setup all I did was plug and hope to play.  It didnt work, and I felt like I belonged in the 1 star camp.  I through it aside and said fegetaboutit...Fast forward a few weeks later I dug it back out noticed the dip switches on the camera and adjusted them. Fine tuned on the receiver side for each position until I found the one that worked best.  BAM, perfect picture!  Added it to my Kguard DVR setup and set to record.Then a week later bad horizontal lines rolling up and down while in live view. AARRGHH, whats going on?  Then I tried to think what changed in the last week with my RF enviornment.  I happened to add and XBOX 360 slim to my entertainment setup.  So I went over to the XBOX, unplugged it and BAM, perfect picture again.  Plugged it in , boom lines are back.So be aware that once you dial it in and you still have scrolling lines, its probaly the RF noise in your home.  Try unplugging items that generate RF noise one at a time (cordless phones, XBOX, wifi routers, microwaves while in use, etc.) to see whats killing your image, Its probaly not the camera.  For me I live with the lines.  They're not that bad.  Plus I love the fact I can add a camera anywhere by simply plugging it in.PS: The lens on the camera can be turned to focus.Pros:CheapVery smallWell builtGreat resolution and color for priceEasy to hideAudioEasily added to a Cheap Chinese CCTV DVR for a low cost additional cameraBattery operatedCons:No IR lightsVery susceptible to RF noise in the 2.4GHZ rangeXBOX 360 Slim interferes
