I have set this trail camera up and used every combination possible. I have captured 3 short videos. 1 video the coyote came in to eat the bait but the infrared glow scared it off. The placement of where he appeared in the in the video it was obvious he had walked into the cameras field of vision about 10 feet before it registered a life form. I have had nights where all the bait has disappeared and I don't have a photo or video to show for it. I have bought a Bone Collector Trail Camera (it's in the mail) on a recommendation of a friend who has had very good results and big differences in test runs with his other cameras on the same tree and covering the exact area. The X-8 did catch a couple of open shots with nothing in them, I am guessing the trees about 35 feet away moved just enough in the wind to trigger the photo. The web belt for attaching the device to a tree has some issues as well, such as it will not tighten very tight to keep camera in place. The only reason I gave it a 2 rating is because I did get those 3 videos over a weeks worth of trial and error. I was wondering if the lack of photo captures are because smaller animals are coming in such as Raccoons or Cats. I will have to test it on my cats someday when I have more time Make sure you set this up very close to home for the learning curve or you will be VERY DISPPOINTED. BTW I did buy the 32 GB Class 10 Mini SanDisk on some recommendations of users posting their reviews about this product, I am not so sure a person has to go to that extreme from what I saw in the Videos. Good Luck
