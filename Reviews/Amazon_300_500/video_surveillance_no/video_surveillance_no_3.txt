Our dog was waiting until no one was looking and sneaking up the stairs to get in the trash cans and urinate.  I got on Amazon to hunt for a solution and found this item.  It was priced low and had enough decent reviews to make it worth a shot.  In fact I bought two with free Amazon Prime shipping.When it arrived, I found some batteries on the shelf and immediately installed them in each unit and set up for the test.  I put the sensor on the landing halfway up the stairs and the receiver in near my wife's computer, where she usually is when  the little stinker creeps up the stairs.  The next day around 11:00 it went off and she bolted up the stairs and caught him red-pawed.  Oh boy, was he surprised and flew down the stairs.  You know, it's amazing, but you really can go down stairs twice as fast with four legs as you can with two!I had an issue where the alarm was not going off yesterday unless I put the receiver six inches away.  I think that has gone away now with new batteries.Because I'm 100% indoors, I'm not having heat problems.  Because the sensor is on the landing, I don't have issues with it going off constantly.  The chime is somewhere between a digital doorbell and a intruder alert -- not completely annoying, but by no means pleasant.This thing even catches my teens going down the stairs after bedtime, even when they try to jump over it!  Yeah, man!These use one frequency, so the sensor and receiver are identical.  One sensor will set off two receivers, which is a good thing if you don't know what room you'll be in and you have a long ranch or 2-story house.  You can switch off the receiver if you don't want the alarm to go off.  The sensor is always on (Passive Infrared).It's small, cheap, made in China and may not last a year, but it was inexpensive and works for my needs.  I give it 4 stars for value (good for the low cost).  If you want long-term quality, look at a different product.
