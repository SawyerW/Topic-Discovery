Like everyone else, I refuse to turn my wifi off, Everything in the house is connected to it.I knew when I bought it that the camera was in the same frequency range, but I saw the tuning knob on the receiver and thought I could dial it in clear on the back of the camera as well..The problem is that their are two switches on the rear that allow for a total of four frequencies. My wifi is set to channel 11 to avoid interference from the neighbors who is on the standard channel 6.I tried all the channels the camera had, and they all seemed to be the same, interference, stuttering, and a maximum of ten(10) feet range. Channel 1 had the broadest fine tuning range of all the channels, but being the perfectionist I am, I still would settle for a little static as long as the image quit jumping.All of a sudden on channel 4 my reception came in nice and clear and moving the camera around had no problems whatsoever even from across the house through 2 walls.Satisfied, I sat down to write a review on the camera, and boom.. no wifi detected. Turn wifi back on and camera went out, but I've found a happy median while sacrificing video quality and range, Camera channel 1, wifi channel 11, fifteen feet away looking out a window onto the porch and driveway.I placed a bit of aluminum foil onto the receiver antenna and laid it down onto the metal casing and got a little better signal.If you are using this camera to record while you are away and not using wifi it is great, but if you are monitoring it from a computer or while sitting around surfing I would suggest you find a camera in the 900Mhz -  5.8Ghz range.
