I've been in network services for 15 years, so I didn't have much trouble getting this camera working.  As others noted, if you haven't had experience in setting up a network device, you need a nerd or this camera isn't for you.The camera is great, and sets up easily if you know how, and looks to have very good quality.The user guide is HORRIBLE and doesn't explain even the most rudimentary features of the software.  Eg.  the device defaults to 60 hz. and if that sounds good to you, don't set up the camera to work in sunlight.  It will be very overexposed and can't be corrected.  The manual doesn't cover this, but there is a "daylight setting" which takes care of the problem.  And, there is no discussion in the manual of how to record the video of where the software puts the recording.  All of this, which should be covered in the manual, is doable.  But, you have to have a good understanding of computers, software, and networking to make this very good camera work. Lots of other features available - I'm dreading trying to make the motion detection work.  The manual doesn't explain any of this, whether the resulting image is a video or still, and what the duration of any recording is.  BAD!!!!Let me say that I got this camera to focus on a bird feeding station, and for that it works OK.  It seems to have a minimal focus of about 20 feet (designed to work as a surveillance camera in parking lots) and it would be nice if they put in an adjustable focus.  My birds are a little out of focus but very identifiable.  I may try putting a supplemental lens on to get the focus down to about 15 feet.Really good hardware, and I was able to get it going "out of the box", so it works.  The price is great for the camera.  But, again, if you don't know IP networking, you'll need a friend.
