Wow, this Defender security system is the best I've ever seen or used, especially at this price. It has every feature I ever wanted and then some. It has long range, night vision, a 2 way intercom, a DVR that records up to 350 minutes of video and audio (love the motion activating feature), a weather resistant camera, and a nice 7'' LCD screen.There has been some weird stuff happening late at night around the outside of the house over the years. Mysterious items being left on the front porch, doorbells being rung with nobody in sight, and worst of all, a few years ago, an older man wandered into the garage late one night, that was accidently left open. I stumbled upon him by chance when I was taking out th trash. I slammed the door leading to the garage and called the police. Even though the police came that night to check everything out (he was long gone), it would have been nice to have recorded evidence that the stranger actually left the area. I didn't sleep too well that night. If I had this setup then, at least I would have known exactly what he looked like and how long he was there.You are not limited to using this for outdoor purposes only. It would work great in an secure work environment, maybe to let employees in at the start of the work day or lunch. Or perhaps just to keep an eye on young children in the house, though you can find less expensive models for that. Seeing stories on TV about home security cameras catching the identities of robbers while people are away on vacation is evidence enough to show just how valuable these things are.The only negative is that you only get one camera (some cheaper sets come with multiple), but you can add up to three additional ones if you have the money.Overall, this is an outstanding product that is well built, easy to use, and might help you sleep a little better at night.
