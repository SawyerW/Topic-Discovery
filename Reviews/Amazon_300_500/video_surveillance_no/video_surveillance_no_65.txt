I decided to retire my Wildgame IR4 cameras after two years of service due to repeated IR-filter failures. I was looking for a reasonably priced camera that would last more than a year with moderate use. After reading the reviews on Amazon.com and chasingame.com I settled on the Primos Truth cam 35.(78.03 at Amazon.com) I ran it all muzzleloader and gun season overlooking my food plot and this camera did not disappoint. The 4 D cell batteries lasted longer than I expected. dozens of pictures each day. The batteries lasted from early November to late December. The temperatures were extremely warm though, rarely getting below freezing all season. The pictures are good enough to determine what deer are patrolling your property but not Hi-resolution enough to pick out detail over more than 40 yards. The Infrared emitters didn't exactly reach out there but on a trail or in the woods made the grade. Don't expect much in a field or a food plot at night though. Trigger times are fast and this camera gets the job done in most situations. No problems with white-out or black-out pics at transition times.The camera did write a corrupt file to an SD card once ruining the pictures but has worked fine since, (this may have been a card fault). I placed it out after deer season and some budget batteries bit the dust after a week. I don't blame the camera though. I was slummin' it that week due to a small paycheck.I will follow up later with a long-term reliability report. Trail cameras offer lots of features at a good price point these days but few hold up.If small is what you are after better look somewhere else. This is a bigger camera. It has a solid mounting strap and seems pretty sturdy. 1 year warranty is pretty typical. I like the temperature, time and moon phase stamps on the images. I will include a couple for your perusal. Right now, I recommend the Primos Truth 35. If it gives me 4 years of reliable service I'll stick with them forever......We shall see.
