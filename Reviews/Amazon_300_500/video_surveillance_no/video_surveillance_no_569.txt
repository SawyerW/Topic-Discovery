We wanted this for a sliding patio door that led to our backyard.  More to keep track of kids, than for a burglar alarm because we also have one of those for the entire house. This has worked perfectly.  Easy to install, simple to operate.  I can hear the alarm in any part of the house, but it doesn't pierce my ears, so maybe it's the setting my husband put it on.(Update: we have it on CHIME mode.  With that mode, it is loud but not piercing.  Also, with the chime mode which is on the right side of the unit, you don't have to set and reset the alarm code.  If you open the door, alarm chime goes off, but then it stops.  It just lets you know when somebody is going through the door.  If you set it on ALARM mode, you will have to set the code and unset it each time if you don't want it going off, so I suggest you use this if you want it as a burlgar alarm and the chime mode if you simply want to know if the door is being opened.  Hope that makes sense)He put the largest part on the slider, the smaller part on the jam.  It doesn't need wiring; that was a PLUS!  Then he set the alarm mode, the code, showed me how to use it and it really is that simple.No, it doesn't keep anybody inside from unlocking the door and going out, but at least I know if somebody is trying to go outside.  It won't keep anybody from breaking in.  They can break the door and come in.  It's an alarm.  It goes off and lets you know the door has been opened.  It isn't loud enough to summon all the neighbors, so if you aren't home, it won't help except maybe a burglar would get scared and run.  If you are home, at least you should hear the noise and know it.To me, that's what it was made for and it has worked perfectly.  Just bought a second one for our garage door into the house.
