I am the ONLY person that posted real pictures.  Be sure to check out my pictures.  I wish someone had done it sooner.July 16, 2013 UPDATE:Swann removed customer images.  To see the images mentioned please use this link.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/A1B9PHF8TA7BSS/ref=cm_aya_bb_listsNOT Sony:I opened up the camera and took a picture of the CCD chip.  I assure you it is not Sony.  In fact, I don't know what it is.  It is not Sony, not Sharp, not Panasonic and not even cheap Korean.  [...]Opt for real Sony CCD.  A real Sony CCD with less TVL will be better than this knock off CCD.No IR Cut Filter:If you don't know what this means take a look at the customer pictures section.  You WANT a camera with IR Cut Filter.Not Pro:This is sold as "Pro System",  well I posted 13 actual images on the product page.  So, judge for yourself.  I spent a week obsessing about CCTV systems and decided on this.  It's going back.The cameras are junk.  600 TVL means nothing.  The images are blurry and the only option to adjust image quality is at the DVR using brightness, contrast, hue, saturation.  There is no adjustment on the camera itself.  480 TVL cameras would be just as good, if not better.This is NOT a full D1 DVR.  It might record adequate D1 video if it had better cameras.  While you can record 8 channels at D1, you can only play back 4 channels at a time.  So, if you are actually scanning for an event you have to scan 4 channels, then scan again on the other 4 channels.Why TruBlue?I thought for sure the system would have blue LED infrared like some of the newer CCTV system.  But it has the red ones.  Why is it called TruBlue?  I guess because of the blue light on the DVR around the control panel that you will never use because it comes with a mouse.  What a joke!!!Noise:Why haven't more people commented on the noise.  It is louder than my 5 year old desktop computer with the fan on 100%.  And the fan is constant.  So, plan on installing this DVR someplace isolated (like a closet). ***  UPDATE ***The day I posted my customer images taken from the system, the manufacturer added more "product pictures" - pushing my customer pictures out of plain sight.  Shady.  For that reason, I've lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1 star.*** UPDATE 2 ***I took a risk and bought some "700 TVL Sony Effio CCD" camera direct from china at a e-bay for $35.  WOW! They are so much better.  I posted pictures comparing them with the Swann in the customer pictures section.  The Swann garbages is getting boxed up tomorrow and shipped back to Amazon.
