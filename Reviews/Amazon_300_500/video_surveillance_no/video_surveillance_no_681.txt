Just received a bunch of these to replace another brand in my home. The actual size of the product is not what's shown on the Amazon description.  The actual size is 5 inches diameter on the dot and the height just about 2 inches.Oddly, the product page has two sets of sizes, and they're both wrong. The "product specification" section says Height:9.06 inches; Length:7.31 inches; Width:7.75 inches (all of these are waaaay off). In the "product description" it says the unit measures 5.7x5.7x2.8 inches.  Closer, but still wrong.Reason why it's a big deal to me... my previous alarms were 5.5 inches wide. When I remove them, the paint which was underneath the old base will be slightly brighter in color than the rest of the ceiling (since it was screwed on there for many years). I was happy to think the advertised larger 5.7 inches of the new alarm would cover this up so no one would see a "ring" of color difference. But now that I see it's really 5 inches wide a ring will be visible.  Amazon, please correct the specs!Aside from the size issue, the units came at a great price. The batteries are inserted through a small compartment door which slides open on the side of the units. It takes a tiny bit of force to pull it open but nothing excessive.  A neat little feature which is not mentioned in the product description is that it comes with little locking pins (if you choose to use them) for the battery compartment door and base mount. These prevent the door and unit from being manually opened/unscrewed without the use of a screwdriver (to depress the pins). For my one family home, I don't need to use these pins.  The instructions say these are meant as a removal deterence if the alarms are used in a public area (or any area where you don't want someone to easily unscrew the unit or swipe the batteries).
