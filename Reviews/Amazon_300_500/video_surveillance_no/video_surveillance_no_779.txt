UPDATE -----4/30/13---I really like this monitor---when it works.  We purchased this because of the ability to remotely operate the camera to see more of our children's room.  This is great for toddler twins on the move.  We are able to see very well with the infrared and daylight.BUT----after four months, our first parent unit stopped working.  I believe it was the sound that stopped working on that one, but am not sure.  Amazon replace it very quickly without hassle.THEN---after three months, the replacement monitor got stuck on SCAN 3, and would not recognize any of the three cameras we have synced to it.  Amazon wanted me to contact Motorola.  I did, and they are sending a second replacement.  But, the warranty is only good for a year from the original date of purchase.  I am not very confident that this parent unit will last for the net few years.I am very disappointed, because I bought this monitor because we had toddler twins and one on the way.  I was hoping it would last until our newborn doesn't need to be monitored at night.  Very expensive for a short duration of use.We had a Summer Infant Slim and Secure with the twins, and it worked very well for two years.  It still works, but the picture is not as good as it first was, and the battery doesn't hold power very long.  At least we are still able to use it while waiting on a replacement.  And we use it when we travel.Original review:  We had a slim and secure camera that worked for a little over two years.  We then got these and really like that they rotate.  It allows us to see the whole room for our two year old twins, who can easily get into trouble!!!!!I also like the microphone, so I can say something to them or play music
