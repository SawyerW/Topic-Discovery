I've had it about a year now.  It has been working outdoors temps from low 20s to 110F.  It has been almost in the open, not under shelter... so it is made well enough.  You simply MUST keep the many wires as dry as possible.  Twice it has gone out due to wires getting wet (I guess) and drying/cleaning the wires fixed it.  Now I have them well sealed and hung properly to keep water from seeping in.I find that logging on to my router is a must with the 8+ network devices I have constantly connected.  I believe I connected to the router directly and copied down the IP address it used.  Then when doing the wireless connection I used that same IP... however I may have been lucky (and I do apologize, I thought I reviewed this a while back and now I've forgotten some details).  I believe the camera might have connected on it's own (a few times) and gotten a new IP from the router just as you'd hope it would.  Power goes out and at some point I know the IP changed, but it still worked.I had the email working but after that last episode with rust forming on the Cat5 connector I didn't bother with it again.... I think it was sending too many email and I could not adjust the sensitivity well enough in a yard with many moving shadows (bushes and trees) to set off the motion detector.  I'm happy with it being in the back yard and the wireless working through brick and up to the 2nd floor through some walls.  Not that the signals necessarily travel that route but I'm saying it is not a clean/straight path from router to camera.Wish I could remember more details but being happy with it says it all for me.  I won't easily give 5 stars on most electronics and this would be 4.5 if I could give it.  The motion detection thing bugs me and the setup can be troublesome for the half star deduction.
