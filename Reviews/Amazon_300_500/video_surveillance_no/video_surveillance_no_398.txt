I purchased this system to keep an eye on my home while at work or vacation. Some planning before it arrived payed off and in  only one day I had 6 cameras up and running. After a couple of calls to Zmodo the system was sending e-mails to my phone and I was viewing my home on the net. Nothing bad to say about the system. It performs well especially for the price. To say the cameras can see 80 ft. in the dark is a bit optimistic and if you wanted to make a blockbuster movie for the big screen this might not be the best choice but If you want to protect your home and have some peace of mind when you are away you can't do much better. The downs are few but include night vision that makes identifying faces difficult and a noisy fan on the dvr. My dvr is located in my bedroom and the noise is a little irritating. I am thinking about using a timer to only operate the system while we are not at home. This is not a big drawback for me because I purchased the system for when I am gone anyway. I suggest ordering an extra 50 ft. cable or two. Four of the eight cables are only 25ft! I managed to use two of them but compromised on camera location. I have added a couple of dome cameras inside and using one of the furnished outdoor cameras in the garage. The domes and the garage are the ones that trigger an e-mail due to leaves, birds, cars, etc. and so far not one false alarm. I am confident my home is protected and that was my goal. Amazon delivered as promised as they always do and i have no regrets about the purchase. I can truly say this is well worth the cost and time.
