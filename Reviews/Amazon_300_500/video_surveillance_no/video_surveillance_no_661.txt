I finally got my IP Camera setup.  Something to note, if you use a range other than 192.168.0.x for your IP address, you will have to change the IP address of your PC to that range before the BSearch_EN.exe or Dev_Find.exe would be able to find your device.  I use 192.168.1.X, so on Windows 7, I had to go to Control Panel; Network and Sharing Center; Click on the network connection you are using (Wireless Network Connection for me); Details will show you the IPv4 address that you are using, click close if you are not in the 192.168.0.x range; click Properties; click Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4; click Properties;***Take note of your setting here, you will have to change your pc back, after you get the device setup***click use the following IP address; for IP address type 192.168.0.20, for subnet mask type 255.255.255.0; Click OK, OK, Close.  You will be in the 192.168.0.x range.  Use the BSearch_EN.exe or Dev_Find.exe to find your camera.  Set the camera to the range you were in before the change.  If your address was 192.168.1.100, then change your camera to 192.168.1.x.  The x must be different than other devices on your network and between 0 and 255.  Once you update the settings on you device, you will lose your connection to it, until you go back and set your setting to the original settings.  After you are back with the original settings, go to an internet browser and type the IP address that you assigned to your device, then a colon, and then the port number you assigned ([....]) if you set the x in the IP to 80 and set your port to 1026.  Hope this helps with setup problems.I got the alarm and e-mail setup and seems to work pretty good.  Picture quality could be better though!
