After reading through Amazon reviews of similar devices, I decided on the TruthCam 35, both because it was nearly the least expensive and because the reviews were better than any of the other similar cameras.  The set up was just as simple as people said it would be.  The instructions are detailed and clear. The only hitch occurred because the red and green "pilot" lights that tell what the camera is doing, are very hard to see.I strapped the camera to a tree where it had a view across my back yard for about 80 feet.  I wanted to see what was stealing suet feeders and wrecking the bird feeder, and I wanted to see what was eating lily flowers before they opened.  I went out the back door (about 15-20 feet from the cam) at midnight to see if I could see the camera work at night.  I saw the "invisible" flash go on and I finally saw the red light.  In the morning I went out the deck door (about 80 feet from the cam in the line of the lens), and I went to the Truth cam and removed the card to see what I had photographed during the night.  The card had about 15 images.  Half were of my leaving via the back door at midnight.  The pictures were clear and I was fully recognizable.  The other half caught me the moment I opened the sliding door on the deck, even though I was 80 feet away.  It continued firing shots until I was face to face with the lens and turned it off.  At 80 feet I was not recognizable. At 60 I was clear and easy to identify.After a night of operating, the LCD indicated that the 4 "D" cells were still 99% full.The only thing at all disappointing in the camera so far is the two indicator lights which are just too dim and recessed to be clearly seen from a distance in daylight.  Otherwise, the prices is right, and the camera worked as indicated.  Excellent!  I only gave it 4 stars because of the pilot lights and because picture quality could be improved, but for this price I'm not complaining.
