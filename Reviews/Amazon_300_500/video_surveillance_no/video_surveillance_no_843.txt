You will not find a better video monitor for $100.  But being $100, it's not a 5 star product.  Take into consideration that this is the only monitor I've owned.  We've used it for 6 months now.Pros:- Price.  Seriously great price- Video.  The quality looks great.  There is definitely better quality out there but you don't need better than this.- Night vision.  I've been really impressed with how well it switches to night vision and how good it looks.- Auto sound.  This thing detects what is background noise so well.  So the general hum of the room doesn't cause the monitor to make sound.  It will hum for about 5 seconds and then silent until a noise is made.  It is so nice to not have that hum always going.- Signal lost sound.  If it loses it's signal, it's a loud beep.  This is nice because you want to be aware and wake up when it happens.  Rarely ever happened to us though.- Design - Easy and intuitive to use.  Stands up nice on a desk or clipped to your shorts.  Camera was easy to mount and position.Good enough:-Sound quality - it's got some static, but no more than I've heard from friends monitors.  And you get used to it pretty quick.  The volume levels are nice.-Camera width - You have to place the camera pretty high up the wall to get a full view of the crib.  I don't know what is normal but it seems like they could make a wider lens.  It works for us though.Cons:-Battery Life is short.  You basically have to always keep it plugged in.  I think we get maybe an hour.  This was annoying at first but we got used to it quick-Video won't turn off.  I think some models allow this but we can't turn the video off.  It would help battery life and keep our room from glowing all night.-Signal lost sometimes.  We have a big house and the signal can get lost from 2nd story corner to 1st story corner, but mostly, it's been pretty impressive distance.
