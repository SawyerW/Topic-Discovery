Pros:- Decent pivoting on camera (very decent range of movement)- sharp picture (though you have to focus manually on the camera)- pretty easy to setup if you are technically inclined- lots of features like motion detection with emailing and ftp, video recording, etc.- Night vision works perfectly; integrated controls for 4 cameras.Cons:- You do need to be technically savvy to set this up. There is very little documentation on how to do this. But it is very obvious how to do it if you are in the field. There is no GUI wizard to help set this up.- No zoom- When camera is using night vision you see a ring of red dots around the lens. So hiding can be a challenge.- No SSL or encryption options. The web controls for this thing runs on HTTP. So capturing packets and seeing your passwords is very easy. So security is kind of an issue.- I'm not sure about any support (Hardware, software, replacements, etc) because I haven't had to use it. But looking at this I have no idea who I would contact.- Firmware updates - There is no option for the camera to go out and discover firmware updates. So you have to search for them your self.- For some reason I needed to factory reset the camera to start using it when I received it. Not too much of a con but it made me think that this was refurbished or something.Honestly, this camera being around $99 and having all the features that it does is pretty awesome. Other cameras with only half of option this has costs about $250-300ish. This camera looks like something that someone created, sold to a bunch of other companies (who just stamp their name on the front), and they are the ones who provide support for it. So you can get updates from them even if you didn't buy the camera from them.For the money it's a great camera. It's not perfect but I'm certainly not going to spend $300 on one like this.
