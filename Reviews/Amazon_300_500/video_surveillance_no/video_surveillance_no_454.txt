I like that this camera set was really easy to setup - just turn on, get electricity running, and you've got a nice system.  However, I have a few gripes.  I think people need to be aware that you need electrical power to this camera, so if you have an older house without electricity outside, you'll need to set something up.  This is noted here on the product page, but I don't think people understand what a pain that can actually be, or how much an electrician will cost if you need to set that up.  So something to keep in mind.Luckily, we had already installed electrical wiring outside when we had a motion-activated security light put up, so installing this WAS relatively easy.  We noticed, though, that the camera kept moving in its positions, and that it had a tendency to fall out of position a lot - kind of like it got "tired," and drooped down at the end of the day.  Not a big deal for us, but if you want precise monitoring of a certain spot, it seems like the brackets/joints of the mount are not made precisely enough for this.That being said, the monitoring capabilities of this thing are really cool, and if you have a dog or a child at home that you'd like to keep an eye on remotely, it's pretty nice.  But I don't see why a web camera system wouldn't be just as easy for a smaller task like that indoors.  If you really want to have monitoring in several outdoor and indoor areas of your house and want an expandable system, I think this is a nice system.  But if you just need indoor monitoring, go for something cheaper, and if you need outdoor precise targeting, go for something more expensive :)
