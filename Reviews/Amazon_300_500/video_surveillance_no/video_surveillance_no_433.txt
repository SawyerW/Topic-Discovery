The web camera works as described. Unfortunately, you must pay an additional fee for a smart phone/iPad app to view it. All of this I knew going in. (FYI the only iPhone/iPad app they provide support for has a frequent pop up asking for donations because they're going under. Glad I spent $10 on an app that is soon going to be obsolete). What I didn't expect was the issues with customer service/technical support.When the camera works, everything is great. I have owned the camera for 3 months and have had to call technical support 3 times. Each time I have had to wait an average of 3 days to have someone help me. What the other reviews don't mention is that there is a limited amount of technical support available. While they are very helpful when they do call, it does take a significant amount of time to get an appointment.I wish I hadn't have ever purchased. I had done extensive research and honestly WiFi baby is comparable to many other wifi baby monitors out there. I am going to have to buy ANOTHER monitor because every month I go 3-4 days without a baby monitor. It defeats the purpose of having a monitor.It seemed worth the extra money (instead of buying foscam) because of the Amazon reviews of great customer service. I then purchased this WiFi monitor over other comparable products because again I thought the customer service would be a valuable asset.Before purchasing keep in mind when reading so many positive Amazon reviews about stellar customer service, that every time WiFi baby helps (even after initial set up) they send you emails requesting you to write positive reviews on Amazon. Even if you didn't purchase on Amazon. WiFi Baby is clearly aware that Amazon requests are fueling their sales. It's unfortunate that they don't provide the customer service/technical support that they tell you to write about.
