I have a 20-month old, 6-month old, 4-year old boxer pup, and only 2 eyes, ears & hands available at one time.  Thankfully, this monitor was SO easy to set up, that I felt like I had another set of eyes and ears to help me out! :-)  I didn't even need my husband to help me set it up, and that is saying ALOT!!!!The large color screen is defintiely my favorite feature... I have seen & used many monitors, and this is by far the clearest!!!  The color is incredible and I can actually see the ENTIRE crib... both of my kids have been belly sleepers since they were 1-month old, and somehow they manage to scoot themselves from one corner of the crib to the clear opposite corner, so it is imperative that I see the entire crib.... this monitor definitely does it!Another favorite thing about this monitor is the sound, and the range!  Most monitors I've tried had SO much static if I moved a certain direction or distance from the base...not this one!  I can turn it up load when I'm busy and need to hear every roll, or I can turn it down really softly to only hear louder squawks and cries.... all totally static-free!  Also, at 200M, I can be outside playing with my older son while the baby is sleeping and I don't have to keep running in to check on him.  This monitor defintiely puts me at ease :-)OH & a funny little tidbit to add...when we first used this monitor, I told my 20-mo old that the friendly alien named "Moto" is watching him and making sure he and his brother stay safe while they're asleep.  Now he gives "Moto" a kiss goodnight before bedtime.  So sweet.Defintiely a great buy!!!  I have lots of friends who are pregnant, and am often asked about products that I couldn't live without.... This is for sure at the top of my list!  Thanks Motorola!
