Pros,Excellent Customer Service/SupportCostworks well without any interferenceclear picture (especially at night compared to our Moto)Decent rangeCons,build qualityMore details,Cost - the main reason we picked this onePicture - We moved from a Motorola Baby monitor which stopped working after 13months to the Infant Optics DXR-5. It defenitely has a better picture quality especially at night compared to our old Moto/unidenInterference - we briefly also used a Uniden which had interference issue causing clicking sounds on & off waking my daughter in her sleepReading reviews and using a few we found out that all Video Monitors have some issue or the other. So we got the infant optics because of the Price and now we would buy another one of their products(if needed) because of their support. Since I know if there are issues they are willing to work with you to fix them. So Overall this is great video monitor for the price since it works well without much interference(except for close range microwave), has good sound & picture(day/night) and most of all the Excellent Customer Support we got.We contacted them because our screen would go off at times and at times we had loss of signal(both issues didnt happen often) and they were happy to replace our 6 month old monitor shipping it right after I sent my tracking info for the old one. They followed up to check if everything was working well with the replacement and answered all our questions.Only drawback I had was the build quality since its all plastic, but for the price I paid I cannot complain especially considering we got a replacement for issues we had. So I would probably buy a product from them just for the support I received ofcourse if the price was right & the item works as good as this. Hope this helps.
