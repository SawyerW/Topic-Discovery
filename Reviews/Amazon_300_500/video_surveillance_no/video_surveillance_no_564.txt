I can get an OK (I would not call it good cause you get a ton of static ticks and fuzz bars) signal with about 10'-15', but this is with no walls in between so short of recording video of something I can currently see with my own eyes this is worthless as a baby monitor.  I have tried several locations, I have shut down my 2.4ghz wireless network and nothing makes an improvement.  I live in rural PA and have no close neighbors with any additional wifi signals or any other 2.4 ghz devices.  At its best it is staticy and annoying, at 25' you can tune in enough to barely make out whats going on and FORGET about audio!  Audio at that distance is horrendous!  This was initally purchased as a nose cam for an RC heli but I figured the signal would be weak so alternately I was going to use it as a baby monitor but it will not be suitable for either of those applications.  I do not feel its a defective unit so I will keep it but I have yet to figure out what to do with it.  Maybe mount it on an RC car and drive in circles in from of the TV and receiver the kids will get a laugh but thats about as far as this will go and I am not holding out much hope for that either since 9v batteries are good $$$$ and this thing eats them in 30-45mins (the batt will last longer but at the cost of quality, and there is not much headroom there).  The tuner is a hassle too I wish it was digital and not analog, calling it 2.4ghz is very misleading as many people relate it to wireless networking which further leads people to think it is a digital signal. 2 star... Even for that price, no sir, I don't like it!
