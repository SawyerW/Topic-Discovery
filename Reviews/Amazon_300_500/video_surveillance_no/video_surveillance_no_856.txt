I never believed in spending a million dollars on a monitor - my first was just audio and a cheap one which worked fine as for me, if the baby can't walk out of bed, video wasn't needed. Then my daughter started walking and in her own toddler bed therefore "mobile". We wanted a middle of the road video monitor in regards to price and this was it for us after reading many reveiws. I have been using it for 2 months now and below are the things that worked and didn't work for us.Pros:-simple and super easy to use-night vision works great WITH nightlight in room (see con list)-great price considering others are well into 200+ and sometimes waaaaay more complicated devices to operate-easy to add extra cameras if needed though we opted out on that as one is enough for usCons:-audio worked for about a month then started to cut in and out... And now does not work at all, you hear it when you first put the monitor on but then it cuts out and doesn't come back.-plastic covering the screen scratches big time and super easy and now we have to really try to see her sometimes at night because the scratches have taken over the entire screen. (And no, we didn't play frisbee with it - it just scratched that easy with us.)-it's very light and has a cheap feel to it, which is fine for me BUT I fear it's going to break most of the time so I'm very gentle with it and though we liked the price, it's still $100, it should be better quality.-battery is crap and seems like it lasts for a couple minutes. (Obviously longer but still, it sucks.) we just keep ours plugged in most of the time.Overall I loved it for the first month and now wish I spent mor e time researching a better one - with no audio we have to use our old audio monitor with this one for video. Basically we wasted our money. :(
