This is the second game camera I've owned and the third I've had occasion to use. My initial impressions of the Primos camera are very good and I am completely satisfied with its performance.As soon as I received the Primos Truth Cam 35, I tested it in an area of relatively high pedestrian traffic (the side yard of my house where people tend to walk their dogs, leave waste and damage the lawn with impunity). I set the unit sensitivity at norm, and for 3 stills with a 10s delay. The field of view was established in an area where vandalism of the lawn was ongoing; this was a particular problem with another model camera that failed to sense a wide and deep enough area. The Truth Cam 35 not only covers the area of interest, but much more often detecting movement on the other side of the street.At least 2 photos of casual passers-by are generated and typically 3 if they linger to trespass by permitting their animal to enter the lawn and relieve itself. The daylight photos are excellent providing time and date stamps (suitable for civil or criminal prosecution) and those taken after dark are also adequate to identify trespassers. The infrared lights are noticeable at night and probably have given pause to the nighttime trespassers as this activity seems to have discontinued altogether.Occasionally, cars speeding by will trigger the device and exit before they can be photographed, and I suspect that birds flying by probably do the same thing; however, this is a minor annoyance that simply generates blank photos of the area.  With a 2G SD card installed, hundreds of high resolution photos can be saved and quiclkly sorted through later.This camera may have been intended for entirely different purposes, but as a means of dissuading inconsiderate jerks who prefer to trespass and let their animals relieve themselves in someone else's lawn rather than their own, it is well worth the price.
