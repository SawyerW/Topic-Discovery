I cut open the connectors for this camera and used it in my 5.8Ghz FPV setup. It works pretty well, with a very nice resolution. At first I didn't know how to wire it but eventually I figured it out, almost at the cost of my 5.8Ghz transmitter. The lens that it comes with is not wide angle at all but it screws in and out so I assume it is replaceable. As for mounting, with the metal bracket it is quite easy. I was able to make a pan tilt mount by mounting a servo in the center mounting hole and then a second one on the screw holding the bracket in. At first I tried to mount this into a plane but it is made of a pretty heavy metal so I was afraid my planes wings would fold in. When I tried to take the metal covering off I found a problem. The lens screws into the metal shell, not anywhere underneath so it is very difficult to mount without the casing. That pretty much ended my FPV flying with this camera, however I also have an RC car which I can mount this to and weight isn't really a problem so I was able to mount it quite easily. Note that driving an RC car low to the ground will significantly reduce the range you can achieve for FPV, at least for my 200mW 5.8Ghz system. Saying that, I was able to still get a few hundred feet of range with upgraded antennas, spironets and a helical. One additional feature of this camera is that it has audio, which may not seem like anything for the plane FPV guys, but for an RC car it makes a world of difference. If anybody needs help setting up a similar FPV system do not hesitate to ask me, I try to check my email often and will respond as soon as I can.Overall this is a very heavy duty camera which can take crashes at about 20Mph and still work effectively, it can detect IR, and does OK with lowlight. Really its a steal for the price!
