This is the first camera system I have purchased and installed for my home.  Everything needed for installation was in the box, and the instructions were easy to follow.  I would recommend planning out where each camera will go and how to run the wires before you begin drilling holes in your house.Installing the 8 cameras took me about 4 hours total.I would also recommend having a dedicated monitor or HD TV connected to the DVR at all times - it makes making some changes much easier.My only minor complaint was with the manual - it really jumps around from one issue to another.  It would be helpful to have a more logical flow to the instructions on setting up the DVR.  I also had to call because I couldn't get the motion detection to record properly - they did answer the phone and the support tech was great.  He explained I needed to set up a schedule for recording (not mentioned in the manual).The Network installation was easy (but this is what I do) so I may be biased.The Adroid APP works great!  It is fun to see what the kids are up to when we are away.  It is also nice to know where our boys are playing outside without worrying.The Night vision is really good for a home system.  We have decent ambient light from street lights and security lights around the house.  However, one camera is in the dark and it still can detect and see someone from 40-50 ft away.  It may not be admissible in court but the video is good enough on that camera in the dark.I would recommend spending the money for the 8 camera system - even if you don't need all 8 installed you will have a spare or two.For some reason the internet based viewer is sort of grainy to view but it is acceptable.Finally, plan ahead, know your local laws on where cameras can be placed, and you should have no issues.
