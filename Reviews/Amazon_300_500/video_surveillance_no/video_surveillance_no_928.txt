I am editing my original review to reflect my opinion after a few weeks of use. The system seems to work as well as I would expect for the price I paid. My original review spoke of the cable length not being 60' as advertised. I installed the forth camera today and took the opportunity to measure the cable before the installation. The cable measured out at 56.5'. While this is short of the advertised 60' it's not that big of a deal. I changed my 4 star rating to 5. I have had some vandalism taking place in the alley behind my business. I placed the cameras in locations to keep an eye on my back door, but high enough to be out of the line of sight. The small camera size makes them very inconspicuous. I used an old computer monitor to help with the setup. After going though the online network setup that Zmodo has on their website, I did have to call Zmodo tech to help me with the final tweaks to be able to monitor the system from my computer and smart phone. I had about a 30 minute wait on hold until the tech answered. He was very helpful and easy to understand, unlike some help lines. I can now view the cameras from any of my computers, and my android phone, either on my business network, home network, or the 4G network.As I expected, the image quality isn't like that of more expensive cameras. I can make out faces pretty well up to about 25 feet daytime, and about 15 feet at night. The night vision is better that thought it would be, and the daytime isn't as good as I had hoped. But since I'm only having trouble at night, it should work out just fine. Fortunately, I haven't had any vandals since the cameras have been in place. I have discovered that my IP address on my wireless router changes sometimes, I have been told that this is because I have a dynamic IP address. You will have to change your remote access IP code on your smart phone and remote computer when this happens. It's kind of a pain, but I can live with it.
