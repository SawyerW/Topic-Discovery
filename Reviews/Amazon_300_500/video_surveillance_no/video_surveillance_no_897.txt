I can't add too much to a lot of good reviews.  I have been using the system for about four months.  I find you get good value for the money on a basic system.  Here are a few problems I have found:1) When first turning on & testing the system I had no video on the VGA monitor and was totally stuck, hidden in the manual I finally found you have to hold a button for three seconds to switch to VGA.2) When setting up accounts for remote viewing you have to have administer privilege.  I cannot set up my kids i-phones or my parents devices to just view as a restricted user.3) Cameras are okay in light, but poor in low light.  Close up, such as inside in the dark you can make out and possibly identify a person.  They are very poor in the dark outside, very snowy and nearly impossible to see anything more than ten feet away.4) The manual was not clear nor helpful at all for more difficult things setting up email and alarm notifications5) Don't try to set it up using the remote PC Swanview app as it has limited functionality, use the mouse & monitor on the DVR itself.  The thing that got me was that I couldn't see which camera was triggering the motion recording as it doesn't show up on Swannview.  Once I looked on the DVR it marked the offending camera with a M (for motion), then I could adjust the sensitivity6) Amazon has removed the free Swannview app for Kindle.  Before I bought this system I checked & it was there, after I bought the system it disappeared and links you to some "IP Cam Viewer" for $3.99.  If you have a Kindle Fire you can go to Google apps and do a round-a-bout install and get the better free Swann app, but if you have a base Kindle you are stuck.Things that I liked:1) Tech support was fast, friendly and very helpful.2) Learning how to set up recording modes was fairly easy3) DNS setup was easy and free through Swann4) I can add better cameras as I can afford them, but for now I have the system up and running.
