So off the bat, I am going to say that this is a good camera, not a great camera, but good... and the remote pan & tilt is great... The picture in color is so-so, and night vision is clear so long as you don't zoom in, which gets pixelated. And be sure to adjust the focus with the bevel on the front of the camera and you will have a good picture... BUT...The set-up is a nightmare. I am usually very good with these things, and it took an hour on the phone with tech support to get it to work, and even then, they stopped trying when they thought it was a router problem. My WPS wasn't connecting, I couldn't get it to communicate even when I chose my network, and on top of it all, I couldn't remember the password to my router.Tech support walked me through forwarding the camera's port (I have done general port-forwarding before, but this was a little trickier since it had to be done through the camera's ip page) and then they wanted to change the settings on my router, but I couldn't remember the password, so they just told me what to do once I got into my router settings. Turns out I reset my router (and set the wireless up with the same name and password so I wouldn't have to reset all my devices) and the camera linked prefectly. Forwarding the camera from .20 to .140 was the key. If I had any advice for people buying this camera, it would be to print the manual out before you try to install... it doesn't come with the camera, but is very helpful.All in all, this camera is a good value and does what it is supposed to, and I think now that I have gotten this one set up, I could add others with ease. Tech Support overall WAS very helpful, and I have to give them a lot of credit for their patience, since they can't see what's going on on your screen! So print the manual out and CALL tech support... don't try to be a hero. They are patient and helpful!
