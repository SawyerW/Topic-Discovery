[update] Feb 2012 - BROKEN. The video monitor charges via a cradle and miniUSB mount, the monitor plugs into the cradle. The female miniUSB connecter broke inside the monitor (detached from the PCB), rendering the device useless. IMHO - an exceptionally poor design, given the physical demands of a baby monitor. Lorex customer support was essentially non-existent given the fact I couldn't reach them live (after many attempts) - I suspect that had I got someone on the phone they'd wouldn't have replaced my unit anyway. I opted to get new monitors in the end (Motorola), which haven't broken, but don't work as well...===[original review] We live in a house that holds 1 toddler and traverses 3 levels (many walls, doors, stairwells, kitchens and bathrooms separate the room we wish to monitor), wireless coverage of any type has been very difficult. We've used a Phillips Adventnet audio monitor for many years, whose wireless coverage and audio reception has been excellent, but it has no video. We've also tried different wi-fi video monitors, all have had failing reception, or simply been awful to use.We found the Lorex via an Amazon Gold Box Deal, all reviews pointed to a video device that would fit our needs - I'm pleased to say that it has. There are many features that we don't use, so I'll focus on the ones that we needed... The color video reception is great, especially considering we operate it at its lowest signal level (1 bar, through many walls and doors);  the camera operation works superbly in the day or night. There's no zoom on the video, and the screen resolution is ok,  but it shows what's needed. The audio quality is ok, nothing compared to the Phillips, but I think we've been spoilt, but considering it's also carrying video we're happy, especially now that we have a visual on our wee one.
