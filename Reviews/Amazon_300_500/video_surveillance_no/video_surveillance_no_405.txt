I was able to setup the camera with a PTEL mobile sim card which should cost me about $5/ month which was nice.  I am able to arm and disarm and take pictures via SMS.However, there are some inaccuracies here.They claim a "Blackout invisible IR flash" but there are visible red lights from the IR LED diodes when the flash goes off, so it is not "blackout invisible".Also, they claim "* Very low power consumptionWith <0.25mA (<6mAh/Day) standby current, build-in Li-ion battery will take and send hundreds of images. You also can use the external power source."HOWEVER, with a battery that is 1200mAh you would expect the device to last for a LONG time at less than 6mAh/day as they claimed.However, I charged it fully overnight then this morning I turned it on and armed it at 8:46am and it sent me a message at at 4:13pm that "I will run out of power soon. I can't send MMS/Email, please change battery"This was with NO activation of the motion sensor as i faced it towards a wall and No sending of texts or SMS inbetween turning it on and it running low on battery.So in real world situations I would expect you to get 7-9hrs of use from one charge.The 'standby' mode that they claim takes <0.25mA must be when it is not armed, and what use is that for a motion detector?  The power drain on 'armed mode must be closer to 150mAh.The motion detector works much better indoors and at night than it does in the day.  In the day outside I walked about 10ft in front of it and it did not detect me until less than 5 feet, but at night it got me from 10-15 feet away.It has survived a few nights of rain outside without any damage so far.If this really had what it claimed as far as invisible flash and good battery life then it would be 4-5 stars, but at 8 hours of battery life it is hardly usable
