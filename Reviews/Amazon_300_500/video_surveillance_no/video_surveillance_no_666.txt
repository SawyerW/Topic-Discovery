I purchased this camera for a specific reason: I hated when I would just crawl into bed and gotten comfortable under the covers and my wife would say "Did you remember to shut the garage door?". Never being entirely certain, I'd always get up, find my robe, head downstairs and check the garage door only to find that I had indeed remembered to shut it...However, this camera has been waay too much fun to leave stuck in the garage all day. We've thoroughly enjoyed using the TinyCam app for our android phones to monitor our pets while we're out at work all day, and even found out that our dog makes a regular habit of sleeping on our living room couch at night.I'm in the IT industry, and I've been able to configure this camera to do some pretty cool stuff using the unintuitive, poorly translated instructions and interfaces that you'll see described in other reviews. However, there was lots of documentation and help on setting up similar cameras elsewhere online, and I was able to get this camera up and running on wifi in less than a half hour. Now that I've continue to play with it, I've scheduled the motion control alarms to send me email alerts whenever it detects motion while we're gone (which also includes 6 still-shots of whatever motion it captured). I also have it upload stillshots to an FTP server.All in all, this has been money extremely well spent. My previously skeptical wife has even voiced interest now in purchasing several more so we can monitor more of the house while away.PROS:1. Neat features built in (email alerts, ftp uploads, remote controllability with web interface or mobile app)2. Price3. Wifi range. So far, I've yet to find a spot in my house where this doesn't pick up a signal.CONS:1. Poor translations in interface and instructions2. Not designed for tech novices. You'll definitely want to phone a friend if you're not comfortable with basic networking and router configuration.3. Lack of remote control zoom. There is auto-focus, but no zoom.
