I purchased this on a recommendation and it's one I wish I wouldn't have listened to.  The product is cheap quality and whoever designed it didn't think about it's practical purpose.  The camera end has a very blunt tip on it with little or no control over the end of the scope such as wire placed 3 ft in length on the head end to bend it in a certain direction.  Unless your using this on straight pipe with clear line of sight it's worthless.  You'll spend hours just trying to get around a corner never mind a joint in the pipe.  The blunt tip catches everything along.  Since you have no control over the head and it's weighted like it is, the head will lean into the side of the pipe causing the blunt head to take an angled landing.Now I know what your thinking....just keep ramming it till it breaks free.  I thought the same thing and tried that.  Because of the aforementioned blunt weighted head it just keep landing on the joint at an angle because you can't steer it into the center of the pipe as you could if there was a wire in the casing to bend it opposite of the direction your pipes lean going down.  I tried to add an external wire and it really wasn't much help since it was just another thing to catch on things.Overall, worthless product.  More of a play toy then anything.  Now it does work good to see if you dropped some thing down the drain without having to pull the P trap but you won't need a 10M on for that.  Honestly don't waste your money and time with this product.  Even the head was designed to big for older homes plumbing and the angles you can get in pipes when dealing with that.  Giant waste of money for anything more then a play toy.
