I installed and started using this system since 3 days ago. It exceeded my expectations. It does everything as advertised. Just plug the camera and the monitor to 110v and paired automatically in just a couple of seconds. No bad surprises or any issue. I installed the camera to watch my home's main entrance and placed the monitor (display) in the secong floor of my house about 60 feet away from the camera, the reception is clear and strong. Please notice that display is black and white (no color image). If for any reason you turn off or unplug the camera and/or the display, it will immediately re-start with issue when you turn it on. You can set a continuous view or can be set to show image on the display only when the camera's motion sensor detects any activity (the sensitivity of the motion sensor is great), also, recording to the included SD card can be set to record continuously or only when the motion sensor detects activity, and can be set to record 5, 10 or 15 seconds everytime the motion sensor detects activity. You can also set to overwrite once the SD card is full, or can be set to stop recording when it gets full. Playing what is recorded in the SD card memory is done just by few clicks to a button. Actually, all the possible settings to the system are easily done with one or few clicks to buttons. The system is great, I fully recommend it. The intercom function works excellent. The video and voice is fully wireless between the camera and the display, and works great. Note that you will need a regular 110 volts connection where you will place the camera and the display.  The unique CONS that I perceive in this system is that btoh camera and display do NOT have the option to run based on batteries (preferably rechargeable batteries), this would be great specially to be able to move the display around different rooms in your house.  But, the system performas great as advertised, and it is a great system,  I fully recommend it!.
