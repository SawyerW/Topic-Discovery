well, first off. this IS NOT compatable with ANY other I.P. camera system except KaiCong cameras{MEANING you CAN'T add this to an existing Foscam,loftek,coolcam,wanscam,..or any other of the 17 different ip camera brands i tried this model with. {p.s. I Own and Run the Swan Technologies Corp. U.s.}  also it IS NOT compatable with Blue Iris AT ALL! or any other NVR software,except the one that comes with it on cd.it Does funtion on its own and with other KaiCong I.P. cameras of this model, tho.  The "plastic shell" that houses this camera is an exact molding of a Foscam 18w series, but inside, it is a generic knockoff of a Foscam O8w.  What makes this camera BAD isnt the build quality {cheap plastic,but lines are straight and looks solid},its the AWFULL FIRMWARE installed in the camera itself!  WORST FIRMWARE OF ANY CAMERA IN THE PAST 10 YEARS!(it looks like a 4year old wrote it}now,if you are going to build an entire system using nothing but this model camera, it would be fine. the IPCmonitor NVR software that comes with it is very good actually, but only works with KaiCong cameras.The wireless range on this model is "hit n miss" ,i first tested it with a Bountiful WiFi BWRG1000 {most powerful router you can buy without a FCC license}and the camera had a wifi range of 38feet line of site{no obstructions}.  i then tested it with a Linksys WRT54GL {running DDWRT firmware/ the second most powerfull router you can buy},and the camera had a range of 36feet line of site{no obstructions}.  the highest frame rate you will get on wifi with this model is 10.3 fps {thats it}. on Lan cable ,you will get 15-17 fps in VGA mode {640x480}. [side note- the wifi was always unstable-dropping connection every 10-15min.] was quite stable when on a Lan Line tho. the Night Vision and Low Light view is VERY GOOD ACTUALLY! =) NICE Bright Images in a NO LIGHT room.in a lit room however..the video quality is dreadful =( even adjusting the brightness controls,it looks like a really bad webcam extreamly pixelated and over sharpened.  but hey...for $36.99 what do you expect. its worth the price,but not much more tho.if you want an i.p. cam to try out and learn from,get one of these. but for any real surveilance system, stay away from this one.  p.s.  its is pretty easy to set up, and to configure for remote view buy the way.
