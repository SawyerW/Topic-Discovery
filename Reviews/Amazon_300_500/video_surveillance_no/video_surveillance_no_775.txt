I wanted to love this monitor. We have two boys (ages 2 and 3 months) and I wanted a monitor that a) had a good battery life, b) had a large screen, c) I could take outside, d) had great sound quality. This monitor has a wonderful camera and allows us to see everything. I love that it automatically toggles back and forth between the boy's rooms, and allows me to pan the room (in case Elmo falls out of the bed and I need to safely return him before my 2 year old wakes up). It also tells us the temperature of each room, so we know if it's just too warm in there and need to turn on a fan. When it works, this monitor is great, however there are a few cons that will force me to return it. First and foremost, the sound drops for no apparent reason. When this happens, you have to go into the kid's room, turn the mounted camera off and turn it back on. There is no warning and sometimes we don't even know when it happens until we look at the monitor in the middle of the night and and see the sound bars light up. Second, the battery life is terrible. We don't keep the monitor on the charger until we go to bed, and it still only holds a charge for 2 hours before we need to plug it back in. Third, we cannot take this monitor past the backyard or into our garage. We live on a small plot of land in a fairly compact house. For those that live in a larger house, I can't image this even working from one side of your home to the other. I really wanted to love this monitor, but for the safety concerns that go along with dropped sound, I will have to return it.
