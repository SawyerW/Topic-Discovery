I bought the master system and installed the external camera about 20' above my driveway.  Installation was incredibly easy, and the camera worked well right away.  It was simple for me to drill a hole through the house at an inconspicuous location and run the flat ethernet cable to the camera, so I didn't need to mount the power supply outdoors.  Since it seemed to work well, I added an indoor camera in another area of the house, and it has also worked flawlessly.The motion detection works well, and I'm receiving email alerts with snapshots when deliveries are made or whenever there's some activity on the driveway.  I live in a rural area so I'm looking forward to catching some pictures of the animals that roam over our lot.Since our internet ISP forces a double-NAT situation, we are unable to set up an externally-accessible web server at our house, so the technique Logitech uses here of pushing updates to their server (when motion is detected) is great for us.  The $79 yearly fee doesn't seem excessive considering that you don't have to constantly have a server running at your house as other systems require.I had some initial trouble with the iPhone app being unable to download recorded clips, but it seems to have "fixed itself" (maybe a problem on the server has been addressed?) and now works every time.  An iPad app would be great, I hope Logitech is working on that...in the mean time you can run the iPhone app on the iPad in "2x" mode.The Logitech forum for this product is useful and seems to be monitored by Logitech personnel.  I get the impression that they're actively developing the software and that updates are frequent, which is a good sign.All in all I'm very happy with the system and plan on getting more cameras.  My only gripe is the lack of a Mac application, hence 4 starts instead of 5.
