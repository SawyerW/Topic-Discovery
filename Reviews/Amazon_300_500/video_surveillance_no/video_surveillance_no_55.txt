I purchased the Primos Truth Cam 35 on 9-11-2010. It was simple to setup.  I placed it in the field on 09-26-10, and set it to take 3 photos every minute.  I retrieved the camera from the field on 10-03-10.  It took 6,542 photos (day and night) of deer, ferrel hogs, squirrels, and racoons on an 8GB SD card, with 70% battery life remaining.  Of these photos very very few were of small game. There were hardly any blank photos, if any.  The night time IR photos were clear, except some blur did occur on some of the photos, if the game was moving during the shot. The wildlife did not seem to mind the night IR LED's.  I did not notice where it ever startled them, though sometmes they would look directly at the red LED's. A few photos were a little dark during the transition time between dark and light in the morning and between light and dark in the evening, but this was minimal, maybe 2-3 minutes worth. Overall the picture quality was very good, however the daytime pictures were all mono-chrome (not in color).  I emailed Primos with a sample photo and they told me the camera was faulty and that it needed to be replaced.  The Amazon transaction was seemless and smooth.  Amazon sent me another Truth Cam 35 even before they received my return.  I tested out the replacement just to be sure that it worked correctly before I place it in the field.  It worked great and the outside daytime pictures were in color like they should be.  The daytime colors seem really good. I'm looking forward to getting the camera back into the field this weekend, so I can get some really great color photos of the wildlife. I would recommend the Truth Cam 35 and I would buy it again.
