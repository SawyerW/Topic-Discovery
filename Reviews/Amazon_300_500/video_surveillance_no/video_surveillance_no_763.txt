This monitor does it all!Excellent purchase!The 3.5" screen is great, the auto color for daytime and black/white for night-time is brilliant.We have no trouble seeing our favorite baby sleep soundly while we go about the house.The monitor is portable, has a great signal, (even without the antennae up).YOU CAN CONTROL THE CAMERA LENS FORM THE MONITOR!! UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT-ZOOM!! (Waaay cool!)Has a great range of motion.(New users tip - Put a nail in the wall about 5-6 feet up from floor on the side of the crib/bed, hang camera on wall and you can really get great view of the entire room, Make sure power cable is hung away from crib or baby will yank it, use a 2nd nail to route cable over a few feet if needed)The sound is crisp and clear, and loud.The picture is very nice, and very clear.There is no jitter or screen lag.The temperature is accurate.The battery lasts for hours (about 4-5 per charge - or use in connected to the charger)...and it hooks up to your TV! If you have PIP you can geek out and hook it up to watch baby while you veg. (need a USB to RCA Cable to hook to TV)Possibly the best feature is the intercom function - You can talk to your baby, or to whoever is in the room, and they can talk back - great if you need to ask someone to bring you something, or to help calm baby until your arrive.You can play 5 built in melodies for the baby to listen too (though I think they all kinda sound the same, but still a great distraction for some babies I imagine)You can expand this to have more wireless monitors and scan between all of them.The ~$200 price tag is higher than others, but I can see this monitor working for a few years of baby's life! Set up for crib now, and maybe useful for watching baby playing outside later, and even a front door/driveway camera later on(when placed in front of a window - not outside)...totally worth the investment!
