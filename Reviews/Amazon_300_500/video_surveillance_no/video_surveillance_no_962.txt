After 2 days of using this unit, I'm returning it.  I had been using a Samsung unit for 18 months, and decided it was time to upgrade. This system was a total disappointment.1. The battery of the monitor didn't fully charged, therefore, when unplugged from the power supply, I couldn't get more than 60 minutes (even by using the ZZ mode) before the low-battery signal started to go off.  This happens for both daytime and nighttime usage.2. The big screen doesn't ensure any better resolution.  Instead, it's stretching a normal screen to this huge screen, burn more battery and not giving me a better view.  The pixels are huge!  I wouldn't say it's bad, but unlike other reviewers stated, it's not that awesome.3. I tried to use the split screen... it gave me automatically 4 screens even though I don't have 4 camera. And even then, the resolution didn't get any better, still the huge pixels in 1/4 screen.4. When using in ZZ mode (sleep mode), it was totally quiet, unlike the Motorola unit that switches to sound monitor.  I personally feel safer when constantly hearing my baby's room rather than waiting for the noise sensitivity to wake up the system.  Talking about that, the motion sensitivity, when set to high, gave out a startle chirp when motion was detected... scared me both time it went off, so I had to switch the sensitivity to medium.5. Viewing angle is very small.  I placed the camera across the room (maybe 11ft wide room) and all I could see was the crib.  I was hoping to see maybe half of the room at least.Ok, what I like about this unit: when it's on, I can hear clearly any noise from the baby's room without the A/C sound.  My previous Samsung unit had good sound, but the Motorola sound was like coming through a plastic tube plus all the background noise.Hmm, maybe I should have given it 1 star?
