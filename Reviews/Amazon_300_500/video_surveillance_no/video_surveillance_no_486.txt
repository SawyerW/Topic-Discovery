I can't vouch for the longevity of this product, but after having it for a few days, I am impressed with its performance.  It has been responsive every time I've tried to connect to it away from home.Pro- feed quality is impressive - even at night- the viewing angle is wide enough to capture an entire room if you set it in the corner- motion detection works well- good value (unfortunately HD cams are still pricey)- easy setup- a number of configuration options for different levels of tech saavy- simple and functional iOS appCon- switching to night mode triggers a motion detection event - even in auto mode- no documentation on what the light statuses mean.  the power LED started blinking green the other day - one forum said that this means the camera is in live view mode (uh oh?).  another said this means that the camera is (re)connecting to wifi.  definitely would be nice to make sure that someone isn't viewing me somehow...  anyone know a way to verify that?- i use mac address filtering on my router, and with that enabled, i was unable to get the repeater to work.  i have to admit that this issue may just be specific to my setup- motion detection setting has to be the same time frame for every day that it is enabled - no different schedule for weekends- motion detection cannot be enabled outside of the schedule if daily schedule is setWish List- offer push notifications to iOS for motion events- offer a shutdown or a privacy mode button- provide a second motion detection toggle on config/iOS app that allows you to override the current schedule.  this way if you need detection on outside the set schedule, you don't have to manually change it for that case- offer a way to disable motion detection when you are at home (more difficult problem!)- offer a method to force video capture(please correct me if I've made any mistakes on my cons/wish lists)Overall, I would recommend this camera for entry level surveillance.  Enjoy!
