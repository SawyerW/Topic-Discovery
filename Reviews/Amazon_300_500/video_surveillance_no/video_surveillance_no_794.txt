We first got the Sony 900MHz monitor with receivers.  They were really great; we put the monitor in his room and one receiver on each floor. The range was really so-so since it loses signal if the baby is sleeping on the second floor and I'm in the basement doing laundry.  We had a few scares with the baby (once with a shortness of breathe and another time where we found him sleep with his blanket covering his face) so I decided to get a video monitor instead (my husband wasn't so convinced and thought I was being paranoid).  I got the Motorola monitor from Buy Buy Baby with the 20% off coupon which includes an extra monitor.  It definitely gave me a peace of mind.  I put the monitor on the nightstand next to me when I sleep and whenever I hear a noise, I just look at the monitor to make sure he's ok and if I needed to get up to fix his blanket or to comfort him.  We keep one camera in the nursery and one in his play area, and it easily lets us switch between the two cameras.  It has a speaker so if I need to talk thru the monitor, I can.  Even though our baby to understand my commands like "Don't eat that!", I can use it to watch and tell my husband "Don't give him that!". The music feature was a bit too loud for my baby.  I tried turning it on once and ended up keeping him wide awake instead of putting him to sleep.  However I get full signal in the basement wit this.  My mom takes care of my baby while we're at work and she uses the Sony monitor.  She ended up having to walk up and down the stairs to check up on him once in a while.  So the difference between the Sony monitor and the Motorola one, besides having a peace of mind and video vs sound, is that it is 1 Sony monitor (mic) with 2 receivers  vs.  2 Motorola cameras with 1 monitor plus better signal strength.
