After the numerous positive reviews on both ... and various camera sites, I went ahead and picked up a S200. I've managed to get some good pictures with it, but it definitely is not a good camera for someone looking for a "point and shoot" device. Careful composing of each shot is required, as is tinkering with the various settings and modes. For example, on my first outing, I took it to a large aquarium in Chattanooga. When I returned, I realized that only 1 out of the 16 shots I took was excellent; 2 other ones were pretty decent, and the rest were garbage. Not great for a supposedly "point and shoot" camera. On my second trip, I spent about an hour with the manual, learning the intricacies of auto focus lock, flash lock, various metering modes, and other features. If I spent a minute or so on each shot, carefully determining the best mode for the situation, my results were much better - 6 out of 8 shots were excellent. If you want a camera for a vacation where you want to snap something neat that you see as you pass by; say, out of a gondola, while on a train, etc - I'd say forget about the powershot s200. If you are looking for a camera to produce excellent "set-up" shots, this may be the one you're looking for. Pros:- Great picture quality and color - if you're willing to  compose the shot extensively.- Rugged, fine-looking stainless steel- comes with a li-ion battery pack & charger - good battery life- menus are easy to navigate throughCons:- photos that are "point and shoot" are likely to come out blurry or improperly exposed, to the point of unusability.- Camera does not take Compact Flash Type II cards - only Type I- No uncompressed file mode - if you do any cropping / editing on your picture, expect it to get worse each time you resave it.- Focusing is very picky in low-light situations- Price is pretty high for a 2 megapixel camera- lower resolution modes are practically useless; only the "best" resolution setting gives quality pictures.
