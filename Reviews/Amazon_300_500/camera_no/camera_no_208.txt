This camera was a gift to my 7 year old son. I realy like the form factor it was well sized for small hands. The loop and clip are great for a child to clip onto belt loops and a wrist band that comes with camera. Very smart since you want to stay away from things that go around the neck. Has a small LCD to frame the shot. It doesn't go into feature over kill and just the right amount of features. It even has a flash. You provide the SD card and a 1 or 2 gig card is quite ample. The software is for the PC but my son's computer is a G5 iMac. We just use iPhoto and that works fine.The down side is the image quality. Having a lot of pixes is not as important as image quality. Basicly it is at the level of a camera found it a cell phone. In fact my iPhone produces better images. But satisfactory images can be had you need to learn  the limitations. The camera is quite unforgiving about shake even with flash. This may be a good thing as it will teach them to hold the camera still. But if this is never going to happen with you child the images will be dispointing. Low light is another weakness. It does have a flash but it is over powering in the more common distance one would shoot the camera 4-5ft. The image has little image latitude and exposure needs to be on or the image will not work very well.Basicly I have gotten better images out of an 10 year old olympus 1.3 mega pixel camera then this camera. This is why I am being more critical about this camera. I think if they did 2 mega pixels and did it well would be more valuble then 5 as it is done in this camera.Other then that I think it is a good first time camera for a kid.
