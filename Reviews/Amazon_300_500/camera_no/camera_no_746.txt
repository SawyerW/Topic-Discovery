My first camera a Samsung Digimax A402 had failed me so after some quick research I settled upon this camera. The A402 only had digital zoom. If you are not familiar with the differences between optical and digital zoom I can sum it up for you... optical zoom is what you want, digital is really a non-functional catch phrase and basically means, no useable zoom. I take lots of outdoor shots and lots of distance shots where I knew a 10x zoom would be most attractive. This camera works great. There is no image stabilization so I recommend using a tripod anytime you expect to use over 5x zoom. There are lots of settings on this camera and to be quite honest I am still learning the optimum settings for various environments. Shots in the dark require, at least in my experience, the reviewing of a few of the settings to see which works best. Camera is a bit finicky in the dark so be prepared to work through the learning of the settings.I love this camera and I am thoroughly impressed with the images I am capturing.You will want to buy a few things to accompany this camera... a carrying case, a 1GB memory card (about 500+ images at max. res., a good set of rechargeable batteries and charger). The camera does come with a lens adapter which also, in my case, serves as a bit of protection for the lens. I have no additional lenses or filters at this time.So I have no problem recommending this camera. The price is excellent for what you get and it is a nice piece of equipment. You can just do point and shoot if that is where you are at or you have plenty of flexibility in settings options if that is your thing.
