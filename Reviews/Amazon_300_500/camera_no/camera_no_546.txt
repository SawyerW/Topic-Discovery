Pros:Excellent value. Intuitive user interface. Laden with useful features without becoming confusing. Relatively light and compact. Decent image quality. Respectable battery life. Good display. Quick response time. Durable. No time limit for movie shots. Low noise for low light situations. Fixed lens has a slightly wider angle than most zoom lenses. Overall quality is excellent.Cons:Lens distortions makes portraits its weakness. The lens is on the soft side. Lack of zoom may be trouble for some, then there are those who can appreciate a fixed wide angle. Low light focusing can be a tad slow or inaccurate even with the focus assist light. No extra long shutters (only up to 2"). For those who care, no sound with movie clips. Conslusion:This is a great snapshot camera. The simplicity and speed of its interface makes it a joy to use. Useful features at the touch of a button that both novice and advanced photographers will appreciate. Respectable battery life reduces the inhibition to joyfully snapping away, and the quality of its images did not disappoint. The robust body is durable and allows its use in less friendly conditions. I have used quite a few digital cameras from Nikon, Minolta, Sony, Canon and Olympus, yet none feels as "willing" as this camera to shoot pictures. The speed, quality, battery longevity, simplicity and durability of the camera allowed me personally to concentrate more on the photographs than on the gewgaws, delays or battery exhaustion. I have indeed shot an incredible amount of pictures with this camera, more than with all the other much more expensive cameras. The P31 is build for quick snapshots, with features that inspires creativity, and at a price that I can only love. A wonderfully balanced combination, if you can only overlook the lack of zoom.Recommended:128mb Memory Stick, Extra NiMH batteries. A quick charger.
