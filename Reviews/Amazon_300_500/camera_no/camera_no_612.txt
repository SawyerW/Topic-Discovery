First off, I'd like to say that I've had this little camera for three years now. I'm now doing the research to buy a new one with higher MP, but this one is still going strong.If you're the type of person who just wants a point-and-shoot digital camera, this one will be pretty good for you. It only has 2 megapixels, but the extra features are pretty handy. You have Black & White mode, Sepia mode, Negative mode, and Solarize mode. It takes little mpeg movies (without sound) and you CAN zoom in and out while recording video- I've heard of cameras where you can't do that. It takes pretty good pictures with good battery life (I love the fact that it came with rechargeable batteries AND you can use AA's) and I've loved using this camera.Now onto the cons. If you use AA batteries, it will eat them up. Your best bet is to use the rechargeables. If you use the digital zoom, the pictures become more blurred, but that happens on all digicams. It takes a while to start-up, but the thing that bugged me most was the time it took to turn the flash on. If you're low on battery life and you press the flash button, prepare to wait a little while. It also takes a while to take a picture if you use the flash as well. The flash function on this camera is poor.I didn't have any problems with this until the past few months, but what did I expect? It's lasted three years already! I began to experience the "black screen" problem and just recently, it began flickering as well. But what do I do when that happens? I take out the batteries and put them back in again, but if that doesn't work, I just drop it on a (carpeted) floor and voila! The impact seems to make it work again.Again, you get what you pay for, plus a little more. If you're going to buy a digital camera and have the money to burn, I would suggest investing in a newer model. But if not, you have yourself a fine little camera right here.
