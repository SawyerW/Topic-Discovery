Let me start off by saying that I do not consider myself a photographer.  I primarily needed a camera to take pictures of the guitars I make and the cars I work on.  That being said, an SLR is a little overkill for what I am using this camera for.Pros - The image stabilizer makes it easy to use zoom and get a decent photo without using a tripod.  I've been able to get some very nice looking pictures both from all sorts of ranges.  I love the macro setting because I can really show off some of the fine details of my cars/guitars.  The LCD screen is also very nice and the zoom works great.Cons - I hate that you have to raise the flash manually.  I'm sure I will get used to it over time but my Fujifilm S1800 had a nifty little button that would pop the flash up by itself.  The biggest disappointment for me is that there's no view finder.  I found it easier to hold the camera steady if you can rest it against your face.  The S1800 also had a view finder.As you can see, I used to own a Fujifilm S1800 and you may think I liked it better than the L110.  Well, let's just say that the cons of the L110 are the only pros of the S1800.  I was not satisfied with the quality of pictures I was getting with the S1800 and then discovered that a close friend also owned an L110.  After giving the Nikon a try, I immediately sent my S1800 back and bought a Nikon.Overall - I'm very happy with my purchase.  I've been able to get some great shots of my cars as well as my guitars.  The quality isn't as clear as an SLR but what do you expect?  The camera is easy to use and has a ton of cool settings/features.  If you're looking to dabble into photography or just want a nice point and shoot, you won't be disappointed with the Nikon L110.
