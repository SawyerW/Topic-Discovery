this camera is perfect for people who are starting off their digital camera career.  it will work as a point and shoot but this is a camera you can hone your creativity on.  when you're ready to experiment, the A70 provides a high degree of manual control for a camera at this price point.pros:- very nice resolution- 3x optical zoom lens- amazing manual control for the price: manual focus, selectable ISO sensitivity, and exposure (aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual)- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours- AF assist lamp helps auto-focus for low light situations- nice layout of controls and easy to understand- very nice build quality - feels more expensive than what its price would suggest- bright, detailed LCD monitor- good shot-to-shot times, quick start-up time too- movie clip mode up to 3 minutes- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)- impressive battery life plus it uses non-proprietary AAs (but i'd recommend buying rechargeables)- excellent value - no one else offers this feature set at this price levelcons:- slight chromatic aberrations visible- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom- moderately underexposed flash shots- RAW format not supported- no histogram available - useful to see if photos have correct exposure- distracting mirror finish frame surrounds the LCD monitor- competition is lighter and smaller, but also does not give the same amount of manual control- the supplied 16MB CF card is not adequate - be ready to shell out more $$ for more memoryi was surprised by this camera.  at its price point, it has the most features among cameras available today.  this camera will work well with beginners (but who'll want to spread their "creative" wings later) but will not disappoint more advanced photographers on a budget.  definitely a camera to add to your short list.
