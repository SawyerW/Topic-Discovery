I purchased this camera as an all-around point-and-shoot for my family's use, and plan to return it and pick another - probably a Canon SD850 or similar.First, the good.  Photos are very good overall, with the exceptions noted below, and much better than my previous camera, a Nikon 4300.  The camera is small, nice looking, and has a huge LCD.  I also appreciated the integrated (and internal) lens cover and non-protruding optical zoom.  The image stabilization was another selling point for me.Then I got the camera home...  The slick look is slick (as in slippery) to hold, too.  The tiny buttons are not well differentiated, and like other reviewers I found myself accidentally hitting the power switch frequently.  The big LCD always looks grainy, making me think my photos weren't very good until I viewed them on my PC monitor.  I also found the interface confusing (and I'm no electronics newbie).But the real killer is the camera's speed.  Although it snaps open and lights up extremely quickly, it refuses to take a photo for about two seconds.  Press the shutter button again, and you're waiting 1 or 2 more seconds while it focuses and processes - by then the kids have turned away and are on to something else.  In short, it's just unbearably slow in everyday use.Back in the box, then.UPDATE: I returned this camera and purchased a Canon SD850 IS as a replacement.  I am much happier - the Canon is SUPER quick so I no longer get photos of the backs of the kids heads, their ears and hair, or the background when I was setting up the shot...  Other quirks with the Nikon that I noticed in a week of use: The battery/card door is VERY hard to open and feels flimsy; the charger requires a big bulky power cord; the slim design fit very nicely in a pocket.
