See updated comment below.For the money you can't beat this little camera...for the folks who are complaining about blurry photos, this isn't a $1,000 DSLR...there is some shutter lag, as with all inexpensive digital cameras; take that into account and you'll be fine:  so far I haven't had any difficulties capturing crisply and clearly the smoke rising from my BBQ grill (it helps if you use the right shooting mode for the right shot, too; for that I used the sports/action mode).  The micro mode is great!  Another thing that helps prevent blurry photos is to use a tripod!  Especially if you're shooting important landscapes or portraits.  (Helpful hint:  when using a tripd you may want to turn image stabilization off...try a shot both ways and see which you prefer.)  As for battery usage...most cameras eat batteries if you're shooting a lot, which is why every photography book/course/instructor/owner's manual tells you:  carry extra batteries!  Now let's talk video...I am so delighted with the great videos this little camera makes!  I had a small digital camera which I paid half again as much for, and my Nikon takes better videos.  Again, folks, this isn't a $1,000 DSLR; don't expect it to be, and you won't be disappointed.  I highly, highly recommend this camera!  It goes with me everywhere I go, and it has not disappointed me yet as I put it through its paces.UPDATE:  10-17-2010:  I took this little camera to Biketoberfest, and in the sports/action mode using a panning technique I got crystal clear photos of the bikes as they went by me.  I shot several movies and the sound was awesome, and the movies are sharp as a tack!  The batteries, which I have had in the camera since I bought it, lasted all day and were still going strong.  The micro mode is very impressive...you can get as close as 2" to your subject.  The more I use this camera, the more I'm impressed with it and happy I bought it!!
