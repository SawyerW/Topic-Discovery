I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago for a trip to Vegas.  I also have a Canon S30 that I feel is just too much of a brick to carry, plus the capture lag is very frustrating.  I looked at most of the sub compact models on the market and was really impressed with the features and more importantly the size of the Casio EX-S600 that a friend of mine has (I wanted something I could put in my pocket and not know it's there).  I liked the similar size of some of the Sony models, but wanted an SD card camera (not a Sony proprietary model).  I was ready to buy the S600 but was then tipped off to the new release of the 770.By no means am I a digital photography aficionado so I cannot talk about the manual adjust capabilities of the 770.  But I can tell the difference between a good picture and a bad picture and I have to say the picture quality in Best Shot mode is great.  There's little thought involved - just point and shoot and the shot is nearly instantaneous (the lag was a concern of mine).  Colors are crisp and flash lighting is good.  The large wide screen on the back is great (way better than any of the other sub compacts I considered).  The battery life is also very impressive.Pros:-ultra small and light form factor-super quick startup-practically no lag on shot taking-awesome large widescreen LCD-fast 3x optical zoom (plus 7MP means digital zooming is finally really practical)-great battery life-SD card storage-great widescreen MPEG4 video w/ dedicated buttonCons:-almost too small to handle (I recommend egrips or equivalent grip tape for handling)-zoom buttons could be easier to navigate-screen susceptible to scratching (I recommend a screen protector)-picture is a bit grainy in really low light-sound recording just OK-wrist tether that comes with unit too shortOverall I highly recommend this camera.
