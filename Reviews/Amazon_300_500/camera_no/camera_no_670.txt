Although this camera is considered an entry level DSLR camera, it has a lot of features found on more advanced cameras. Pentax does not seem to have the name recognition of a couple of the other big camera makers, but I have found this camera to be an excellent value for the price. We like this camera because your can take very good photos with the automatic setting or you can use the easy to understand menu functions to suit the situation in which you are shooting pictures. The features that were most important to us were the anti-shake control and the auto focus. Both of these are excellent on this camera. I don't use the live view to preview pictures very often, but it is nice to have this function available. The kids in motion and the continuous shooting modes have worked very well for me. Another selling point for me was that this camera uses regular lithium AAA batteries. You can always have spares without having to remember to keep a battery pack charged. I haven't yet taken any low light pictures with this camera yet so I can not comment on that aspect of its performance. I mainly use it to take pictures of my children and grandchildren. I have used this camera to freeze a baseball in flight and to capture the expressions of a 1 year old. We have also taken some very nice landscape shots form our favorite hiking trails. I have taken a video clip just because you can, but I will not rely on this camera for videos. This camera seems very intuitive to learn to use and I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a DSLR camera. Pentax also has a website which seems to have good customer support and forums where you can get any questions answered and get tips to learn to use you  camera better.
