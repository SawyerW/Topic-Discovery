I really wanted to love this camera, but after 3 weeks struggle, decided to return it and go back to my old Canon.Pros:1.Beautiful LCD: the picture on the LCD look way better than anything else I'd owned2.Natural light+flash mode: two different pictures in one shot, my favorite feature, but then I realize the +flash is always nicer, so probably not that useful.3. Crisp imagesCons:1. Odd placement of flash: the flash is placed on the right hand side of the camera, right next to the shutter. extremely difficult to operate with single hand. always accidentally block the flash.2. Weak flash: Maybe it's normal for this type of compact PnS, but my dad's Sony HX1 has way more powerful flash. This Fuji ended up useless most of the time during our trip to Hawaii, where strong flash was needed in a lot of shots to counter the super bright background.3. Slow processing: Takes long to process the picture between shots4. Bad battery life: I got 3 backup batteries for this little camera, each backup performs similar to the one came with the camera, but equally bad. I did need all 4 batteries to last a 6 hour day trip. Also slow flash charging.5. Poor charger quality: charger died after few charges. End up not being able to use the camera for half of my trip6. Only 3 continuous shots: unlike what was stated in the user's manual, this camera only allows 3 continuous shots. Even worse, after each continuous series, it'll take about 30 sec before you can use the camera to do anything. Very annoying feature, though not as annoying as Sony HX1, which takes even longer to recover. For this, Canon is the nicest: 0.8fps until card full, super useful for taking random shots. I think this and the charger issue are the two deal breakers for me.
