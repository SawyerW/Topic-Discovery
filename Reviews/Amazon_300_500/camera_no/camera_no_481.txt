After about six months and four thousand pictures: This camera is really good.Cons:Battery - 4/10 - does not last as long as it should, I would definitely prefer using rechargeable AA/R6.Software - 1/10 - worstest, horriblest, slowestest, stupidestest software that would be perfect for the mid 1980s.  Do not waste time installing the garbage that they offer - pictures on the SD card can be accessed  directly (they are organised in subfolders containing 1000 images).  For editing or minor corrections I use PhotoScape; panoramas can be made, with some effort, using Hugin.Pros:Picture quality - 9/10 - produces sharp images with very good colour retention.Autofocus - 7/10 - generally very good, but missing is a real spot focusing like in high-end cameras. Sometimes has problems with finding obvious focal point.Zoom and macro - 8/10 - close-ups come really nice, but watch out for the flash (I recommend taking macro pictures with and without flash).  Zoom is quick (after a brief delay) and quite sufficient.Flash - 9/10 - for this type of camera it is outstanding.Workmanship - 9/10 - some parts, particularly battery release, look like a cheap plastic.  However, I accidentally fell on the camera while taking a picture, on concrete surface and everything works despite a dent in the case!Low light focusing and pictures - 9/10 - I would not expect such quality from a small point-and-shoot.Viewfinder screen - 9/10 - works in any light, brightness can be adjusted.Automatic modes - 8/10 - way too many choices, with some of them unclear.  I am most frequently using self-portrait and starry night (long exposure).Intelligent auto - 8/10 - works excellent, but at times has mind of its own during searches for the focal point.Movie modes - 8/10 - high definition films are good quality, sound is decent.  Missing is ability to change focus during filming.Delayed shutter release - 8/10 - magnificent feature, but 10 seconds may be too little.  Missing a counter on the viewfinder screen and/or indicator at the camera's front.Image stabilisation - 8/10 - much better than I would expect from this type of camera.
