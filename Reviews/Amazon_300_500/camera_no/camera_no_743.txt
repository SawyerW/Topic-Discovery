Just got the camera. I used to own Canon S70, which is better in everything besides the zoom. Unfortunately, my old canon was stolen, so I had to look for a temporary replacement, until I can afford a nicer one. Well, my search stopped at this Kodak. I got it for $200 only, which is great.Everything works great so far. I cannot comment on the life of batteries, but I bought 4 recharchable ones and a recharger, so I doubt I would ever run out of power. I also got a 512M card, as the medium picture size is around 2-2.5M each.Zoom works fine. I would say it's great for such camera. Of course you cannot zoom fully and expect that leaves on a tree would be in perfect focus, but it takes great pics in full zoom, so if you question that capability, disregard all negative feedback on this issue.It takes pics in nice color. I would say 'full' color. Blue is blue and green is green. I've heard that Kodaks were good in this, so i can only confirm that rumor now.As for the rest of functions, I have not had enough time yet to experiment with everything, as the school has already started for me, so I only have so much each day to devote to my new toy.I hope I'll have time in a week or so to post more comments on other features, but to all who are considering this camera, I would say this:it's not too small, but fits in one hand nicely,it's 6M pixel, so takes nice resolution pics, which are below 3M eachit has nice zoomit takes nice colorSo, for this camera with its price, I gave it 5 stars. If you are looking for superior performance or quality, look at cameras that start at $700 or $800 - you would not find anything in this price range that would satisfy your need. (I am looking into buying a $800 camera myself, so I've done a lot of research trying to get a nicer bargain with a cheaper camera and found out that there is too much of a gap between any 'cheap' camera and what I really want).Hope I could be helpful
