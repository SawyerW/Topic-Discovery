After using the FujiFilm F200EXR for over a month I was a bit envious of the video and all of the automatic features on the ZS3. I loved the shots the F200EXR took in Dynamic Range mode. They are probably the best for any point and shoot, however I simply found the F200EXR to be "dumb" in automatic mode. I was always having to adjust the ISO manually because it took the approach the everything was moving in lower light situations. If you are willing to use manual settings all the time, which gets old for me, the F200EXR will take some of the best photos of any point and shoot, if of course you can get the settings changed before the shot is gone.The ZS3 is much different. It is smart. It can detect if the subject and/or the camera is moving and will increase the ISO only as needed. I've taken shots indoors and out and it does pretty well at choosing the right settings. It even chose night scenery mode automatically one night when I set the camera on a table and used the timer. It detected that both it and subject were not moving and used a slow shutter speed. Who needs manual settings with a camera this smart. I was afraid I might miss them, but not yet.I also enjoyed the burst function this weekend watching BMX stunt riders at an outdoor Fair. I just couldn't time it right to capture them in the air and I turned on full resolution burst mode and got some incredible 10MP shots of stunts in the air.It also works well with my Panasonic Blu-Ray player since I can put the card directly into the player to view video or images on my LCD TV.The video is not bad either. I'm thinking about getting a Elgato H.264HD dongle for my Mac to deal with the AVCHD feature. You won't regret buying this camera.
