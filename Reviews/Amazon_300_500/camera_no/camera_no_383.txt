I regret selling my canon g10 since I bought a nikon DSLR, now I just realized that I need a small camera for small occasions, So I did some researched reviews, I did looked and bought some canon, fuji, sony and nikon, first I thought the s3000 and s4000 would be awesome but no same as sony cybershots, I bought and returned some of them till I saw this s6000 from 2 stores for sale and before I bought it, I did check every reviews from different stores, online and local and it has the best reviews among those I bought first, so I gambled again to try this one and boom! no regrets! I love the picture quality, easy to use, and video capture w/ 720p HD. This camera can go a long way, great for beginners and awesome for travel use. Some people complaints how plastic it is or how light it is but this plastic made can do better than most of those metal made i just returned for refunds and replacements. I think it's just about how we take care of our camera and knows how to use it well. I suggest to read the manual book before using it so you won't be making reviews like this camera doesn't do anything etc etc. in fact this is the best budget under $200 point & shoot so far for me. I had couple olympus stylus and those I just bought and returned but all their quality doesn't have match for this nikon s6000.For memory cards, I'd recommend Sandisk Ultra, Or Lexar Platinum II Which I've been using for my DSLR and Just bought another one for my new CoolPix!P.S Before buying a camera and you're in a budget, Try to do research first, read reviews, and comments to see which camera is best for you. Don't ever buy a camera if you don't know anything about it. especially when you're looking for a great quality pictures.
