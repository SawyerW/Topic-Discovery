The GoodThe Fuji F200 is a very good point and shoot. The camera has a nice big screen and helpful features such as red eye reduction, cropping and resizing. The camera takes excellent sharp pictures and it is relatively compact. It is a simple point and shoot and it does have a very sharp portrait mode.The BadAlthough compact, the camera is a bit heavy. The screen smudges way too much, whereas my previous Olympus or Cannon did not. The pictures are a bit grainy and yellowish indoors and in low light. Sometimes, the camera takes a great indoors picture and sometimes it does not. No matter that I am in the same position and pointing at the same object within 5 second intervals. Basically, the auto mode is hit or miss. The EXR mode is noisy (literally) and this becomes annoying pretty quickly.The UglyThe camera does not run on regular batteries. Instead, it comes with a battery pack and a charger. I find this very annoying because if you ever run of battery life, you cannot just replace the batteries with good regular batteries unless you had a spare battery pack (that's about $30-40).Adding to the annoyance, Fuji has combined the USB cable with the AV cable. The result is a bulky and annoying cable.And as a last straw, you are unable to zoom in and out while in movie mode. You are stuck with the zooming level you selected at the beginning of the movie.ConclusionI would get another camera. A Canon PowerShot is better than this.UPDATE 9/17/2009 The battery, fully charged, lasts only 2 days of medium to heavy use (no videos recorded, just pictures). So, if you go on a trip, like I did, be sure to bring the charger. I had to charge the battery every other day. Sometimes, if would not be last the full second day.
