I spent more time and energy to find a digital camera than my apartment, firing my neurons away on such a life-altering event of purchasing a pocket camera. Being a middle class ladder climber, it was like taking a test with multiple choice questions. I compared prices as well.  In short, I chose canon s200 for the simplest, clean design, and the hardest-looking, metal exterior.  Whoever designed this camera, I can get along with.  I chose Amazon.com instead of buy.com for the uncomplicated return policy.The price is high for a 2MP camera, but I didn't want to spend $500 dollars for a 4MP camera. I rationalized by saying to myself if I don't buy another camera later, spending extra 50 to 100 dollars more is worth it.  2MP will serve my purpose as I am not going to print out posters from this camera. Besides, I don't have too much wall space to hang them. It is a size of a cigarette box, but as heavy as a unopened Budweiser can.  It would be nice if the camera came with a longer loop string to put around my neck rather than the small wrist loop. Don't drop it; don't lose it.  125 MP CF card should be big enough for anyone who behaves normally and takes a non-psychiatric number of pictures during a typical vacation trip.  This camera is for someone with a sense of moderation. If you supersize your Big Mac meal, don't buy this one.  This is for those who would rather take a picture of their children who will stand still and look up for 2 seconds if you are lucky.  No time to waste, just point and shoot.  If they want to try, let them; you can always erase it. Those who doesn't want to buy another digital camera shoud consider this one. I am not buying another one until I drop or lose this one.
