First, I have to say I'm an amateur photographer, so I was in the fence when the moment of buying an dslr came, I did a lot of research to finally decide and give this camera a chance. I investigated canons and nikons, but finally I came to the conclussion that this is the BEST camera in this price range for the features it has.I love taking pictures with the pentax kx, they come out very polished and with a great quality. Auto function es very good, although I never use that feature, because if you want EXCELENT photographs, you have to learn to use it in manual, if that is not the case and you want to take pictures on the go, it will be best buying a more portable camera like a sony cybershot or canon powershot.My friends and I have made very good (not perfect) short films with my camera, I record all my guitar videos with the pentax kx and they all are very nice with a great quality in high definition. One thing I noticed firt in this type of cameras is that they usually just take pictures (in this price range). But the PENTAX KX doesnt just record video, but it can record video in intervals of 25 min each, where more advance cameras like canon rebel t3i can only record for 12 consecutive minutes (according to the information provided from a friend who has one of those).One of these days I noticed a dead pixel on the screen of my camera :(...BUT dont worry! this camera has a function that is called pixel mapping and repairs dead pixels; also, it has sensor cleaning and dust removal.The lenses that come with the camera are very useful, except for the telephoto lens(50 -200mm) in the case you want to take pictures of nature in a too professional way, but it is great for portrait pictures. If that is not the case, you better buy a telephoto lens like the sigma 70-300 mm.This camera is great for long exposure photographs like photos of the night sky and HDR photography. Also, I recommend buying filters, mostly the polarizer because is a great addition to the repertory of an amateur photographer.I hope this little review help you in entering the world of professional photography like I did.  Best regards!!!
