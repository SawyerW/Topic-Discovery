I'm not a professional photographer, but as far as amateur point and click family photography goes, I've owned several digital cameras and have shot many family photos in all sorts of conditions and would also consider myself pretty tech savy. Of all the cameras I've ever used, the Nikon L110 is the most dissapointing. When I took the camera outside and shot still photos of birds and flowers, they came out beautifully. However, when trying to shoot pictures of my one year old in my house, images were consistenly coming out blurry and nothing I did fully remedied the problem. Some of the people who have given this camera positive reviews have suggested that perhaps those getting blurry images did not have it in auto mode, were not adjusting the white balance, etc. All I can say is that I tried all those things and more, went through the manual and read about all the features but could not find any setting that completely remedied the problem.The bottom line is when your toddler is doing something cute, you do not have time to scroll through menus adjusting various functions. To me, auto mode suggests that the camera automatically finds the best setting and takes the picture. The worst part is that, there is another setting called "easy auto" that is supposed to do just that, but when I tried it the results were even worse. Sitting five feet away from my son in his high chair eating peas, with all the lights on, and the images were so blurry as to be unusable.A few other features were also annoying enough to mention: the lens cap is a seperate piece that you have to manually place on the lens rather than it automatically being covered when you turn the camera off. Ditto with the flash, you have to manually pop it out for flash pictures. And although some people might prefer this, I think its worth mentioning that it takes AA batteries rather than having a rechargeable unit (which is what I prefer- saves money and rechargeables have a longer life).
