I purchased this camera about a year ago, and I love it!  It's easy to use, has intuitive controls and takes great photos!  When combined with a larger memory card (I put a 256 MB in mine), it will take more photos than you can dream of!PROS:  Movie Mode With Sound - Many cameras have a movie mode, but no sound...What's the point?  2 MP - Great for starters.  Effects - Shots such as Black and White, Sepia, and built in Sharpening mode make use better than just normal photos.  Easy Use - Wheel selector on back of camera is GREAT!  Makes use a lot better than cameras where you have to select through a menu every time you turn it on.CONS:  2 MP is good for photos of just tooling around.  4 MP may be better if you want to print out digital photos (Cannon i950 photo printer is GREAT for that!!!)  Movie Mode - Takes movies which are between 12 and 24 seconds (depends on temperature, I think).  Great for taking small movies IF the events you want to film are on cue when you press the button (Real life, I have found, is not!)  If you are more into longer films, then the PowerShot S45 may be better.  I really like Point & Click photography.  Digital cameras require a bit of focusing time, which can result in a 2 or so second delay.Overall, it's a great camera.  I am upgrading to the PowerShot S45 because of the longer movie mode and the 4 MP.  2MP is fine for home, but I use it at work also, and find myself needing more detail.This camera is great for the price.  If you are a beginner and don't want to blow a lot of cash, I recommend this camera.  Once you figure out for yourself what you like and don't like, you can buy a new one to your likings, and give this one to the kids/family/whoever.Misses the 5th Star because the movie mode is too short, and the delay in taking the photos.  Otherwise, GREAT!
