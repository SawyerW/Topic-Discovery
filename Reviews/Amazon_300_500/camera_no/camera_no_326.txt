Anytime I shop for an electronic, I do a lot of research. Digital camera's are just one of those things that if you don't read reviews and compare, you may end up with something... crappy. Well I ended up buying this lil guy and I adore it!There are plenty of picture modes, and you really should go through them. I recently used the party mode for Halloween in a very dark room, and the pictures are clear and bright! You also have to learn what each mode is capable of in order to get the picture to be crisp and clear. Without the right mode you do end up with a blurry photo.The Macro is magnificent but make sure the object is really tiny since this baby can take really good shots of tiny details without it. The autofocus is very helpful too, but don't let go of that button until it's stopped focusing!You can't be mad at the rechargeable battery. It's another big reason why I chose this one. Most camera's with disposable batteries just don't have a long life. This rechargeable battery can laaaast. I can't really say how long, but I will say that after a night of shooting pics, I didn't have to recharge until the 3rd time I used it...I only have two complaints. The first is the actual buttons. They are really soft, and even though I haven't had any problems yet, I'm a bit scared that I won't be able to push them in the future. Think remote control buttons... The second is the on/off which is just a sliding door. It's not so bad, but if you slide it into your pocket the wrong way it does turn on. Atleast it does have an automatic shut off feature if you haven't pressed any buttons...All in all, I do like this camera. I'm glad I picked it. and it's bluuuue!
