It's outdated & unavailable new but I still think the Canon A-series line is the best balance of features, ease of use, & price.My A20 is still going strong after 2 years and 3000+ photos. It has been thousands of miles by automobile & aircraft and still takes excellent shots.There's 3 cons that keep these from being the perfect camera:1. Finger-press to shutter time is just no good for those truly candid shots. It's hard to catch people in natural states while you wait for the camera to autofocus, fire off some anti-red-eye bursts, then finally snap the scene you just missed... You become well-trained to almost prophectic-like preparedness for moments like candle-blowing or most any kid action. Adults are far more camera-aware anyway, so an SLR is still the best way to go for any action requiring fast reaction times.2. Weight. It's a mixed blessing since it comes mostly from the 4 AA batteries (ONLY USE RECHARGABLE, PEOPLE!) that allow you to go long between changes.3. Size. It's barely pocketable in loose pants. And then it pulls your pants down. You won't be hiking or even just walking around much without a good belt (or suspenders). So be prepared to carry it by hand (good for quick snapshots) and/or stowing it in a camera bag/pouch.I use a LowePro D-Res 25 AW bag which is bigger than absolutely necessary, but has MORE than enough space for a backup set of batteries & memory card, the A/V cable (in a perfect interior slot), shoulder strap, velcro belt strap, and an attached (but hidden) rain cover. Plus it's very well padded. It could fit the data cable too, but I don't carry that myself. Overall it's more of a (travelling) storage than everyday portage pouch.I guess that's a bonus review of the pouch.
