I tried to set the release mode following this book. I started at the beginning of the book and then chased the instructions from chapter to chapter and page to page having to look up where the different buttons are on the camera. You only get a little snippet of the instructions in each area of the book. I never found out how to perform this after looking for at least 15 minutes. Instead of having it all in one location with easy to read instructions. I then challenged my wife to try and figure it out using the book. She is still trying to follow this with no results. If this is this guys idea of easy instructions for a beginner then don't bother with any of his other books either. I also purchased the Field Guide and  tried using the pictures in it to help.  I also tried the instructions in the Field Guide and they were also not complete. Following this book I could not get most of his instructions to work at all. If I could return this book I would but now I am stuck with both of them. I was hoping for a book that is easy to read and has all the instruction for a function in one location, with maybe a picture of where the button are you need to use for that particular function. This book is only good for a person that knows all the terms and is very familiar with this camera. My wife is still trying and she finally gave up on the book and is just poking around and having much better luck. So far the things that do work are nothing like the book says. If you do  figure out how to use a function I suggest you write it down because it will take you another hour to figure it out again. I think this camera is pretty confusing to start with and having some one that is a camera nut can not write instructions that are easy to read.Save your money and look some where else for help.
