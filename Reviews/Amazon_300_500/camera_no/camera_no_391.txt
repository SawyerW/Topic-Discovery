After a few days' research and testing between Canon S90 and Canon SX210 at 2 shops, I decided to get a Canon S90 for its better image quality.But when I went to a third shop, aiming to get Canon S90, I was shown on the computer screen the 2 photos (jpeg) taken at the same place (indoor) a few seconds ago, one by S90 and one by Nikon S8000. The photo taken by S8000 rendered the true colors, just as what I saw under the lighting, and the image did not have jagged edges as in Canon S80 when magnified at the computer. Then a couple of shots confirmed that the noise control between the two were not as I expected. At least under ISO 400, Nikon S8000 photos did not provide more noise than Canon S90. Actually, at ISO 125, I did observe that Nikon's resolution was better. And the LCD screen resolution of Nikon was also higher than Canon S90. True, Canon S80 allowed one to take RAW images and manual control, but I wanted a travel zoom camera and would not like to work with RAW images or excess processing of the images(otherwise I would take my DSLR.) And Nikon 30mm-300mm provides a much more flexible zoom than Canon's 28mm-105mm.Having Nikon DSLRs myself, I had the impression that DCs were not Nikon's strong areas. But the test shots gave me enough confidence to get a Nikon S8000 back home and gave it a try. Under sunlight, the photos were so pleasing and much better than I have expected from a DC. The image sizes can be either at 4:3 or 16:9. At 300mm, the image is still very acceptable and at 30mm, I detect very little distortion. I mainly shot photos using the AUTO mode but the MACRO and FOOD modes are extremely useful. The FOOD scene, allowing me to change the color tones of the photo, gives such delightful photos of the dishes! To summarise, Nikon S8000 is a very pleasant surprise for me. To top it all, I got a grey Nikon umbrella (which could be used as a reflector) and Coolpix camera bag for free at a local Asia dealer.For the limitations, Nikon's menu seemed to be a bit less user-friendly than the old Panasonic DC I owned. I also hope there will be more reviews comparing S8000 and other cameras, especially at high ISOs.
