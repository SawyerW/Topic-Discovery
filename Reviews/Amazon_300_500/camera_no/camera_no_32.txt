I've had my Casio Exilim EXZ55 for a year now and I'm quite happy with it.  It's small and very sleek looking.  I can take it anywhere and everywhere, and not have to worry about it taking too much space in my purse or pocket.  The pictures come out great, I love the huge LCD screen, and I've had no problems with the camera whatsoever.  It is very user friendly and it makes for a GREAT first camera for those who aren't camera/gadget savvy.  Even for someone like me who loves to take pictures and have used many cameras in the past, I am still very impressed with it!  I've used the Olympus and Minolta cameras in the past and have been happy with those, however for a small and easy to use, easy to carry around, this camera is really something!  It does the job of all the other cameras and takes less space to carry around.The only thing that's a bit inconvenient is the cradle you have to put it into when charging the battery or when downloading pictures...however, it's a minor detail and it's really not that big of a deal.  Speaking of battery, you only have to charge it fully once (I normally do it overnight) and the battery will last you a VERY VERY long time...I can keep it in my purse for 1-2 months taking pictures left and right before it runs out of battery (approx. 600+ pictures).  If I'm taking a lot of pictures every day, such as on a vacation, it will last me 3-4 days of taking pictures constantly, before the battery life will go low.  It's amazing how much battery life it has!I highly recommend this camera and for the great price, it's quite a deal!  You won't be disappointed.PS - I normally keep the camera in a camera case when it's in my purse so it doesn't get all scratched up since I carry it EVERYWHERE.
