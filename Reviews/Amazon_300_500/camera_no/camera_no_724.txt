We have a 4.5 month old and a 3 year old. Our 3 year old has a neuro genetic condition called Angelman Syndrome, and we really needed a system that could keep an eye on both of our children. We had a Summer monitor, which worked for a while. But when we moved to a larger home, the range was awful, and after a while the volume on one of the monitor units started to short out, and by the end, we either had no volume or it was all the way up.The Lorex has been great so far! I have been very impressed with the quality of the product. It was easy to set up and easy to use. I only have a few complants, if you could even call them that. The pan and tilt camera doesn't have mounting hardware or holes. We ended up mounting the camera to her bed using extra strength velcro. Also, the camera cords are not very long, and we had to use an extension cord for one of them. The other issue that I have is that the monitor itself really needs to come with two cords. Ideally, we would keep a cord in the kitchen and the docking station in our bedroom, so we only had to move the monitor at morning and night. Or a second monitor option would be awesome, too!All in all, this is a great system and we have been very pleased with it during the short time we have had it! My kids love that we can talk to them in their rooms (although our 3 year old was freaked out a bit by this at first!). And I really like that we can record what is happening in their rooms with an SD card. Our special needs child has sleep issues, and it is nice to be able to record her at night in an effort to track her sleep patterns without having to be awake or set up another video system somehow.As far as the selective mute funtion and the alarm funtion- people have complained that these don't work well or are too loud...but you need to know that both of these functions are OPTIONS! They can be turned off if you don't like them!
