I thought I was buying this camera for the 12MP, Nikon quality and excellent zoom, but I was disappointed.All the pictures are blurry if shot at 12MP, so I had to switch the settings to 8MP to get a good shot.  Waste of money.Easy Auto has never produced a good picture for me.  The shutter is always too slow and the light horrible.  The only time you can consistently get a good picture out of this camera is in natural light, which is nothing special for any camera.You cannot adjust the shutter speed, and the shutter is always too slow.  The closest you can get to adjusting the shutter speed is by adjusting the ISO, which still doesn't make much of a difference.It takes minutes of adjusting settings, white balance, light settings, ISO settings before the camera is even close to the right condition for shooting.Time between shots is really slow until you turn on the sports continuous mode.The flash is also a pain.  Just flipping it up will not turn it on.  You have to go into two menus and put it into flash setting besides flipping the flash up manually.The LCD screen is difficult to see in the sunlight, and of course, there is no view-finder.The zoom is really touchy.  You can never zoom just a little because of the huge range.The only thing I've liked about this camera is the battery life.  I have taken over 300 photos, left my camera on forever and taken videos too, but the batteries are still not even half-drained.Overall, I think this camera is meant to be an easy point-and-shoot with ridiculous amounts of zoom and no manual controls.  But it can't even perform as a no-frills camera.  I thought I was getting a good deal on this camera, but it ended up being a huge waste of money.I would never suggest this camera to anyone.
