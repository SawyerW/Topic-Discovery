On paper the EXZ55 looks great. But once I got it there were a few things i did not like. I had this camera for a couple of weeks and returned it. I'm going to try the canon sd300.I liked- great battery life- big screen- solid construction- movie recording with sound and audio playback is great- very compact with a lot of featuresI returned it because- It's a two-handed camera. You have to hold it with your left and operate with your right. I want a cam that can be held and operated with one hand. My old cam ( a canon s100 from way back in 2000) could be held in the right hand while operating the zoom and clicking the pic with the right index finger. But with the Z55's button placement, I was sure that sooner or later I would drop it if I tried use it with one hand.- Movie / Picture mode can only be selected by menu. Multiple clicks and navigation are required to switch between the two, so you might miss a shot, or you might forget to switch and start recording in the wrong mode. I'd rather have a switch on the outside so I can quickly toggle movie / picture.- Not the best photos. I had some great shots and some weak ones. I think it's a focus problem rather than a lens or CCD problem. Sometimes the cam figured out what to focus on, giving great pictures. Other times things looked fuzzy and grainy. There was a lot of variability in sequential shots of the same scene and lighting, so I don't think it was user error.Other things I didnt like that I could have lived with:- I didn't like the cradle (althought I've read that some people do). I prefer the chargers where you take the battery out.- Casio makes two cases that supposedly are tailored for the Z55. But I found that one was way too big, and one was too small. Actually my old Canon S100 leather case fit pretty well.- The LCD is not recessed, so I expect the screen surface will get scratched up unless you're very careful.
