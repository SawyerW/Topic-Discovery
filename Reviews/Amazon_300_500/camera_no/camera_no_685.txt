I have been using this camera for the past 2 years now and it has never failed to deliver - whether I am shooting landscapes, portraits or just plain walk-around shots.Just a few of the things I like most:- Value for money - no other camera provides the combination of features, quality and price that the K-x does. At a sub-$700 price you get two extremely good kit lenses (the 55-300 especially is a real gem), class leading low-light capability, in camera HDR, IR remote compatibility (you can easily get a $5 generic IR remote and it will work - has for me), high customizability, etc. etc.- Low-light capability - over 60% of my shots are indoors or in low-light, and the ability to go up to ISO6400 and get extremely usable shots is a boon (add noise reduction and you literally cant tell pics have been taken at those high ISO's, what little noise it introduces is that easily manageable). And combine it with a fast lens and you are clicking away while others are fumbling with their flash, tripod and missing shots.- In-body stabilization - this alone is a big reason I took to Pentax. As you build up your lens kit, you don't need to shell out big bucks for every lens as the in body stabilization means the lens just has to put good glass and the rest is taken care of by the camera. I have been able to take completely shake free shots at 1/5s.- Backward compatibility - the k-mount can take quality lenses from over the last 2-3 decades that Pentax has been making stellar glass. I have the Pentax-M 50mm f1.4 and it is a beauty. And given the in-body stabilization, all the glass is now available with full shake reduction. Try this with any other brand.I can keep going, but from personal experience, just the above should comfortably take you from beginner to enthusiast and beyond while keeping enough greenbacks in your pocket to add more lenses!Good luck!
