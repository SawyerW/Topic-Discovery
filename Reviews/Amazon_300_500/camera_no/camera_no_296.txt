I started out with a Nikon Coolpix 950 5 years ago, and we still have it! Last year I received the Nikon Coolpix 3100, and still own it as well (great little camera). I wanted something that had more capabilities, as I am becoming very involved in photography again. I did a lot of research between the 8800 and the Nikon D-70 SLR. In the end, I opted for the 8800, and thus far am very pleased with it.This camera is NOT for novice Digital Camera users. There are so many buttons, options, and gadgets that a novice would be very confused, even though it comes out of the box ready for just basic point-and-shoot photgraphy. However, this camera would be a high expense for someone who does not intend to use all it's bells and whistles. If you want a point-and-shoot only camera, without much to-do, go with the younger Nikon versions, such as the simple 3100 or a 5000 series. If you are looking for a more professional picture taking camera, and want to be able to add lenses, filters, hoods and flashes, then it's a sure bet. SHUTTER LAG TIME is very minimal here. It's still a tad slower than the D-70, but pretty fast for a digi camera. I have't had it long enough to know how it will hold up over the years, but thus far I'm very pleased with it. DOWNSIDE; requires those Lithium-Ion rechargable batteries that are pretty costly; you're supposed to take the battery out even when camera is "off", as it still draws a minute ammt. of battery power. Much heavier and bulky than a compact point and shoot (but a very different camera, also)A NOTE ON THE LEATHER CASE... this is a good choice for traveling, such as vacation and such. However, if you are a "true" photographer, you will need a large aluminum case to store all the lenses and accessories, plus the camera, in. The leather case barely holds the camera and a few major necessities, but does not really have room to carry the battery charger along, so you will need to purchase 1-2 spare batteries for a vacation trip.
