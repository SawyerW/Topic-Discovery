I have the camera for a few weeks now. So far my impression of the camera is very positive. In the sub-compact catagory, the S330 probably have the best image quality (in my opinion). There are some issues under low light conditions. I think you should take this into consideration if you are looking at this camera.1. For example, the auto-focus have a hard time locking under low light conditions. The picture is actually in focus, but the indictator says otherwise. As long as you hold the camera still for long shutter speeds the camera should take a well focused picture under low light conditions. The focus assist light is not that great either, but most other models in this catagory don't even have this feature.2. Not a good camera to take distant objects at night. The flash is too small and weak, but that is a trade off for having a small camera.3. The biggest issue with this camera is probably the auto white balance. If you use the auto mode under artificial light, the AWB feature doesn't work well at all!!! But this can be corrected under manual mode. I hope Canon will have a firmware fix for this.Overall, it's hard for you to go wrong buying this little camera. The image quality is above average. Its size and construction is top of the class. My only real big complain is the camera is too pricy for 2MP. Oh... In addition, 50 bucks for another battery is not that cheap either (you should get one for long trips). 8MB compact flash card is so somewhat useless (only 10-32 max shots depending on the quality). So you probably to have spend another 150 dollars to make the camera "complete".If you haven't looked at other subcompacts, I recommend Nikon Coolpix 2500 and Minolta DiMage X. Those are great cameras too, but S330 filled my needs betters than those two. Cannon S30 and S40 are great, too (suffer the same low light problems <- from what I heard).
