This camera is great for someone who wants to start taking pictures, but doesn't want to spend a lot of money on it. Perfect for a young teen as a gift.Its 5.0 Megapixels make the pictures it takes look remarkably good, and the option to turn flash on, off, and red-eye remove, is a help in whatever enviornment the picture is being taken.One great thing about the camera is the sheer ease of use it offers. There are only 3 modes, camera, video, and favoriting. On camera, it's simply point-and-shoot and take some pictures. There are a few modes it offers to enhance the visuals of the picture, and similar options that are fun to play around with. Video offers the chance to take a video, but unfortunately does not record sound. Favoriting gives the opportunity to look through all the pictures you have taken and mark which ones are the best. This makes it easier to import the pictures to a computer later.The only fault I find with this camera is the use of AA batteries. I would much rather prefer a rechargable battery, as it uses a wire instead of having to carry around many loose AA batteries. Also, the LCD screen is pretty small, but that doesn't really take away from anything, it's just a heads up.Finally, the share program. This is an EasyShare camera afterall. When you get the camera, it should come with a CD. This CD makes importing your pictures all the easier, and lets you preview them in a super-easy to use setting. In the program you can make your own albums or folders of pictures, and save them whereever you want on your computer. Simply click on a picture you want, and it's in.Overall, this camera is fun, easy to use, and cheap for a starter camera. Hope you have fun with it!
