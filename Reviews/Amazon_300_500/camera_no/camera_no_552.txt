This camera has so many great features and is very easy to use. Here are my best features on why I bought over other Canon camera or Fujis (My experience: NIKON COOLPIX is best for camera buffs, but this one beats all for everyday shooting, travel shooting, family photos, and professinal looking shots within budget - (...)(...)1. Largest resolution and largest size gives best 4x6 and 5x7 prints. I take all my photos on the CompactFlash card to Wolf Camera and they print them on their big machine. go professional for $.50 a photo - worth it everytime2. Can take one pix in color, the next in B&W;3. Can use manual mode for faster shutter speed and/or aperature setting. Or can use AUTO like I do everytime4. Flash red-eye works most of the time, but I do correct 2 out of 5 red-eyes b4 I take my pix to Wolf Camera with Adobe5. Software for PC and cable lets you attach cable to camera and turn it on with automatic download to your PC of new pictures. You can also go in and download older ones saved on the media card (CompactFlash)6. I like taking 5-7 pictures for one BEST shot. I then go through and delete the ones that did not come out well and print the one that did!7. Video capture is about 15 seconds with high resolution and plays well on the PC. Each file can be joined with Microsft Movie Player (XP) to create one long movie (AVI file) nd burned to a CD. You can view the movie on the camera too.8. Good depth of field. Not a wide angle, but some elements are achieved9. Viewing screen on the back is very good and wide10. Upgrade to a 64 MB or 128 MB card - the 8 MB included card is not enough for big photos11.  Zoom is excellent. On highest zoon, you can't be too close or too dark. The focus will not work evertime, but taking a step back works.12. Flash can be turned off for any shot13. you can review the pictures on the camera one by one or by a small grid (I think like 9 pictures). You can even zoom in on the pix you took on the camera and move it around.
