I've used this camera over the past several years and I remain a true believer of both it, and its updated 5MP version, which I also own.  The expanse of capabilities and options with the camera allows for taking excellent pictures under nearly any conditions.  The manual as well as the shutter and aperature priority imaging modes allow you complete control over the imaging process.  I've taken pictures of everything including northern lights at 2 a.m., my cats in near complete darkness, portrait shots of subjects in dark rooms standing in front of bright windows, and they've all turned out wonderfully.  For printing, I've used both my home printer, and a professional photo store, and prints up to 11x14 have turned out perfectly with no degredation at all.Several recommendations if you buy this camera.  Don't waste your money on Sony's cd-r disks.  I've used verbatim, memorex and k-hypermedia cd-r with no problem.  They're certainly much cheaper, and they all hold 185 MB while the Sony's only hold 156 MB.  I would also suggest that you buy the Sony external flash for the camera.  While the hot shoe will accept other brands of flash, I've been very impressed with the improvements to my pictures since buying the sony flash.  I would also recommend buying a small (3-6") expandable tripod that will fit in any case.  This allows you to set up longer exposure shots for dark environments, as well as for using the timer function on less than ideal surfaces.If you're looking for huge storage (and archive) capabilities, excellent images, and complete control over your picture taking (minues the zoom limitations), then this is certainly the camera for you.  Everyday I think it is worth the price I've paid, and with a new baby in the house when first purchased, being able to take several hundred pictures in the first few days and email the "best-of" off to the grandparents is certainly a plus.
