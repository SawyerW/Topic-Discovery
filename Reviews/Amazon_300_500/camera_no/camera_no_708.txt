The Defender GK300- 7M2 Hands Free 2- wire color video intercom system is a relatively inexpensive intercom system designed to provide peace of mind with minimum hassle. This device is simple enough to install and is instantly ready to use with the flick of a switch.Besides the simple setup, this monitor has some other interesting features that make it useful. I really like the night vision option because it makes visible what would otherwise be difficult to make out. I like the sound- it is easy to tell exactly what is being said- and I like the loud, easily noticeable chime when someone rings the doorbell. The fifty- foot cable is also nice because it is long enough that I was able to place the viewing monitor in my bedroom with no problem.As for the cons, I can find a few. The video quality isn't the greatest- it is a little fuzzy, even though I can still tell who is on the screen. Then, there is the duration of the video- it displays for only about thirty to thirty- five seconds. After that, the screen goes blank and you have to keep pressing the video button to get it back. This latter feature is one I wish was different. Often, you will want to watch and listen to the person at the door, but because you have to remember to keep pressing the video button, you could easily miss something important.This is a basic intercom unit, hence the average quality overall. I know there are more sophisticated products on the market, but they all cost several times more than this, the Defender GK300- 7M2 intercom. I suppose for the price, it is an acceptable option but don't buy this expecting a fancy, high tech intercom unit. All you get with this are the basics, making it good enough for only for those with minimal security needs.
