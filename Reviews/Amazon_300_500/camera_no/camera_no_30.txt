Strengths: Excellent pictures with outside lightingWeaknesses: Red Eye reduction doesn't seem to work at all. Night photos of fireworks didn't work well even when using that setting. Any pics you take inside with low lighting are very grainy. Nice size camera for a woman~~too small for a mans hands.Summary: I've had the camera for 8 months now and was very satisfied with any of the outside pictures or pictures that had a great deal of lighting around to compensate for the basic lack of a flash ~ the flash doesn't really help unless you are on top of the subject. Inside pics in dimly lit areas are very very grainy and I have tried every setting to improve them with absolutely no luck. The camera comes with different settings, but even when I put the camera on the firework setting all of the fireworks came out blurry. The size of the camera is great for a woman with small hands but is awkward for a mans larger hands. The casing is very flimsy and was dented when accidently dropped about 4 ft from the ground (height you would hold a camera at while taking a pic) while my husband was taking a pic of my daughter. The lens which protrudes while taking a pic would also no longer retract into the camera with this very small accident. BEWARE ~~ if you drop the camera plan on buying a new one. Casio charged me a FLAT FEE of $200 plus other small fees. Total charge to repair camera $220.43. I requested that the camera be sent back without repairs so they couldn't reuse my perfectly good lens or reuse the battery or any other good parts and there is a shipping fee to return the camera. By the way, a new camera from many dealers on-line costs somewhere between $229 and $259.As stated earlier the camera works very well in good lighting situations ~~ poorly in dimly lit situations. The only reason that I would not consider purchasing this camera again is due to the unfortunate way that Casio sticks you with a super high repair bill.
