I just want to affirm that the ex-z700 takes great photos at iso 50-200. after that it is a bit noisy. but any 3rd party photoshop plug-in noise canceling will fix this. There is one major short-coming to this camera. (if you are new casio cameras..this may steer you away. Older casio models eg: qv-r* series had the ability to shoot in apature or shutter priority. This one doesn't give you these options.  Only way to get around this is to use the "Best Shot" mode and find a template that will more or less fit what you are trying to do. Owning many casios in the past I had never used the "best shot" mode till now. It does the job but it sorta takes the fun out of playing around with different settings and comparing the results. But what you loose in flexibility you sure make up for with convenience. You can carry this little bugger anywhere and with 7 mpxl image you dont have to have a 8x zoom. you can crop and get very good quality 8x10 photos. that required a 5 mpxl camera to have a 8x zoom to get the same reults. the lens wide open is like a 35mm.. i prefer a 28 or even better a 22 but almost all the compacts are in the 28-35mm range. speed is about 2.8. (still not fast but in line with most other compacts) this is a great camera...want one better..olympus camedia c-7070 (twice the price)Oh i also want to mention that this does not have a optical viewer. (lcd only) another shortcoming but it does have a focus assist lamp. great for low light situations. If you want to buy a very good digital camera on a budget.. orjust like to have a camera around all the time..just in case. you really cant go wrong here. just remember its a point and shoot not a prosumer camera.
