Well, thought it was time for me to get with the times so I finally got myself a digital camera.  I've always wanted one, but just really never had the money for one.  I was able to get my hands on the Sony MVC-FD100 Digital Camera a couple of weeks ago, and I can say that I am very pleased with it.You don't have to be a computer wiz to know how to operate it, which is one of the best qualities.  It is VERY easy to use and I seriously think that anyone can learn to use it in a matter of minutes.  It's a little bigger than most cameras, but this is because it allows you to save pictures to a floppy disk (which means that you really never have to hook up the camera to your PC to view or share your pictures).  You can also use memory sticks as well (they're expensive, but can hold lots of memory and is more convenient than switching floppies non-stop).There's a lot of neat things you can do with the camera.  You can zoom in and out with ease, change the effects to make your pictures look different, and you can make short MPEG videos (with no audio).  All of these features are very easy to use and are easy to learn.A main drawback to this digital camera is the price.  It is rather costly, but I think it's worth it.  If this seems to be out of your price range then you should look at some others.  There are plenty of others that are less expensive.All in all, I am very pleased with the Sony MVC-FD100 Digital Camera.  It's easy to use and is very convenient.  If you're looking for a high quality digital camera that can be operated by just about anyone, then I highly recommend that you check this one out.
