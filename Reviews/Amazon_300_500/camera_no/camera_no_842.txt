I brought the DMC-ZS3 based on the rave reviews that I read on Amazon and other sites.  Well I was very disappointed. The colors were artificial, washed out, and positively ghastly and the video was fuzzy. The sound on the video was tinny, muffled, and quiet. As for indoor shots with the flash, they were very poor. I used auto mode and program mode and tried every setting, but nothing really made much difference. The camera was totally unacceptable.I should point out that pictures and videos looked and sounded great on the LCD screen, no problem there, but not when downloaded to my PC.There is nothing wrong with my PC. I used QuickTime and Windows Media Player (with the right CODEC installed) to view the videos. I also tried them on my wife's PC. The videos looked better on Windows Media Player, but not good enough.Incidentally, I loved the 12x zoom and the great menus. But that doesn't make up for the lousy images, video and sound.In comparison, my old Canon SD1100 colors and resolution were excellent. The Canon video was great, even though it is not HD, and the sound was excellent. The Canon was superior in every respect, except for the ability to zoom while shooting a video. But who cares about the 12x optical zoom if the results are awful?So I returned the DMC-ZS3 and I'm glad to be rid of it.Then I bought a new Canon SD970 with HD video and wow what a difference! I took pictures and videos of the same scenes for comparison purposes. The new Canon DESTROYS the DSC-ZS3. I asked my wife and kids to compare the pictures and they agreed. The Canon pictures and videos are gorgeous. And the Canon's sound is lovely. (But I wish I could optical zoom while shooting video.)So I am truly baffled by the rave reviews of the Panasonic. I don't think that my Panasonic was a lemon, but I suppose it's possible. But then why would so many aspects of the camera be so poor? I didn't compare it with another DMC-ZS3.Buyer beware.
