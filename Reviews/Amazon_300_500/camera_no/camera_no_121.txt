This camera replaced a Panasonic Lumix ($600) that failed due to design defect which Panasonic blamed me for, so I was skeptical about buying another expensive camera.  This has been a gem.  Now, I have three Nikon lenses and two remote flashes.  This camera "grew" with me.  I mostly relied on the auto functions at first but then bought a few books (Scott Kelby) that made all the difference and enabled me to experiment without being completely in the dark. While just about any point and shoot, today, has many of the functions necessary to take great photos (shutter settings, aperture settings, ISO settings, flash adjustment, exposure control, etc...), THIS camera has them at your fingertips so you dont have to wade through menus --something that makes all those features useless in some cameras.  Switching lenses is easy and undaunting.  Best of all, I can take this camera anywhere and not worry that it is too fragile.  It did take a big bump in my last move, and the lens on the camera might have been damaged if not for the lens hood, which did not fare as well but saved the body.  I have purchased a D3100 for my son recently so we can share some books and equipment, and he loves his Nikon as much as I love mine.  The years and dollars I wasted on buying "wannabee cameras" are regrettable.  This camera will be a wonderful backup camera ten years from now -- and my lenses will all still be just as useful on a new Nikon as they are on this one.  I especially have loved the ability of the D80 to act in Commander mode to operate remote flashes.  I am still learning to use the features of this camera, but it is not because they are hard to get at...  Canon certainly makes a wonderful camera too, but I will probably never know because I am now a loyal Nikon customer.
