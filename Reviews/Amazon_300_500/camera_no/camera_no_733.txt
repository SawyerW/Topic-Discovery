This is my first review of anything, but I'm quite frustrated and had to write it since I just tried to take some pictures with it.  I've had the camera for a year and half.First off the positives.  The wide angle capability is very nice.  Taking group shots close up is amazing.  The video mode is pretty nice also.  Being able to zoom while taping is very nice.Now the negatives.  For some reason, when you don't take a picture in wide angle, the camera has a tough time focusing if there is not a lot of light.  The pictures come out crap if you don't have good lighting, and the flash doesn't do much to help.  It's hard to take good pictures with this camera if you aren't in wide angle.  Note, I do have the digital zoom off.  For some reason, when in wide angle even with low light, the camera is not bad taking pictures.  I've taken some amazing video with this, but when playing back on the computer, you cannot fast forward or skip certain sections, the software will make you start all over from the start.  The EasyShare software is very sluggish when you load up and also downloading lots of pictures and especially video.  Sometimes you think it locks up, but it just takes a long time if you have more than a few pictures. I have used it on two pretty decent computers, so pretty sure it's not on my end.I love the wide angle abilities, but this camera and software is just not good.  There are more wide angle pocket sized cameras available now.  Just for reference, I have the original Canon Elph SD100 and a Sony DSC-H1.  I'm moving on from this camera.  I'm a little surprised how well this camera has been rated so far.  I know most people aren't shopping for this camera since this one's a little older now.
