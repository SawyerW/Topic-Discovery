I received this camera as a birthday gift and I am far from impressed. I only got a new camera b/c my other had broke so I was desperate. My parents picked it out and usually do a good job with electronics however I think my father was sucked in by the cool color. That is the only good thing about this camera.It takes forever to focus and take a picture. It is somewhat confusing to use. The full user manual is a DISC for a computer. What if you wanted to look something up but didn't have a computer nearby? COME ON! And the quick start guide looks like it'd have a lot in it, but it's too busy covering 3 languages in addition to English. Pictures taken in dim lighting that would benefit from flash, apparently don't trigger the flash. About half of pictures come out dim, yellow, grainy, out of focus or a mix of all four. I've taken to using the camera on the portrait setting just so that the flash will come on.I wanted a camera with regular batteries b/c I like to carry extra on me and I don't like dealing with a charger.  This camera also eats batteries like crazy. I can't take over 100 picts and review them without having to find new batteries. My last camera, a Cannon something or other that was like 5 years old hardly needed batteries.LASTLY, my biggest complaint about this camera is the battery door. If you touch bottom every so slightly the door will pop open throwing the batteries all over. Idk how many batteries are lost underneath stuff at my house b/c of this. Sometimes it even throws open with so much force that the memory card gets loose. So don't even bother trying to take this to the bar. With the batteries not staying in, potentially losing your memory card, and the amount of time it takes to get a picture, it's not worth the stress. I would tape the battery door closed but since the camera goes through batteries so fast it's just not worth it.Save yourself the sanity. There are plenty of other cameras out there with a comparable price.
