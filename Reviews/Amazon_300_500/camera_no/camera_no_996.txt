I have now bought THREE of these cameras since December 2009.  I bought a black one and a pink one for my wife and daughter for Christmas.  The black one died in the early Spring.  Fortunately I had purchased a Square Trade Warranty to cover the first death in the family and Square Trade sent me a check for a replacement in just a few days.  I then replaced the black one with an orange one, which has already proven to be a mistake.  Last week, just when we needed the cameras for homecoming pictures, both the pink one and the orange one died.  These two cameras were still under factory warranty, so I had to pack them up and mail them to the Fujifilm repair center in Edison, NJ.  Turnaround time is estimated at a few weeks and the customer service woman at Fuji was gruff and nasty on the phone.  Even worse, after they're repaired I don't expect these cameras to last long after they are returned to us.  Luckily, I got a Canon SD1200IS for Christmas and it has worked flawlessly, so homecoming was not a total loss.When our Z30s have died, they've died suddenly and completely...no power, no nothing.  To make things even worse it has happened with absolutely no warning.  One minute they're working fine, the next you've got nothing more than a $100 paperweight.  Think about how happy you'd be if this happened to you in the middle of a vacation in a remote location (like a national park) where you couldn't readily find a replacement.  Just throw some gingko biloba in your camera bag so you can at least remember what you saw.Consumers reading this review are, of course, welcome to buy whatever camera they want.  Having learned my lesson I'll never buy a Fuji product again.  Don't say you weren't warned.
