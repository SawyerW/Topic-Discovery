I purchased this camera based on reviews I have read here and the [...] comparison "Compact Camera Group Test Group 6: 'Compact superzoom' cameras". I've had this for about two weeks now. Other cameras I own are Casio Exilim EX-S10, Canon Powershot A1000IS and Sony Cybershot DSC-T77.Other cameras I considered were the Canon SX200 IS and Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H20. I'll skip the good features as most of the reviews here have pointed those out. Here is a list of what I don't like about this camera:Perspective Distortion - I don't recall seeing this in any of the reviews but this is a very obvious flaw of this camera. I have a 6 month old baby and I take her pictures everyday and as often as I can, mostly indoors (at home). At 1x zoom setting, this is very evident. The wide angle lens causes this effect, with the portrait image warped.Low Light Portrait - As I have mentioned, I use this camera mostly indoors and using the AI feature, most pictures show dark exposure. Skin tone is also darkened. I have a Sony SR-11 HD video cam and it takes better pictures at low light conditions.Battery Life - I was only able to take 200 pictures after recharging the new battery overnight.Proprietary Battery - I tried searching for an OEM backup battery but can't find anywhere online that says the battery worked. All battery reviews I have seen say they don't work with this camera, even OEM ones.Dial for Setting - The settings' dial on the camera doesn't firmly stay in place and often gets dislodged, which causes an error message. This is easily remedied but it is annoying because the slightest bump on the dial will cause this.I wouldn't recommend this camera if you will be using it mostly for portrait pictures. If you are looking for a camera that will be used mostly for zoom photography with HD capability, then this will work.
