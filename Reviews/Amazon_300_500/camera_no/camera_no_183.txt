I bought this to goof off with and also as a potential baby monitor.Right now it is set up as surveillance for the front of my house and does an okay job looking out the window and detecting motion. I use it with a Synology DS210j and Surveillance Station and get emails with motion and also can get texts. It is set up to record these events and I can log in and watch them or archive.VIDEO: I played around with the settings and found that outdoor mode works nicely in most light situations. Maybe when it is pointed inside I will change that to 60Hz.FREEZE UP: I had the same problem some others have had with it locking up after about 10 days. I had been getting emails notifying me of motion detected (through the Synology) and they just stopped. I gave it a power cycle and it was back in business but this could be an issue if you can't power cycle over your network and have this thing at a vacation home or somewhere remote.AUDIO: I could hear through it but could not figure out how to talk back out of it. Maybe I need a remote speaker or something but I thought that two-way was standard. I might just be doing it wrong but don't care about this feature very much.I think for the price, despite a few negatives listed below, it is a good value and a nice entry-intermediate level IP camera.Pros:Easy set up. 20 mins from out of box to setup complete.Works with Synology NASMotion detection has 2 zones and can be calibratedCan be redirected remotelyComes with mounting bracket for wall/ceilingCons:Can't figure out how to shut off LED lights at night. I have outdoor lighting that is sufficient and the LEDs just get in the way.Is there an on/off switch that can be triggered remotely? I didn't see an option for that or for schedulingPicture quality is a little iffy for 2011...no 720p? Come on man.
