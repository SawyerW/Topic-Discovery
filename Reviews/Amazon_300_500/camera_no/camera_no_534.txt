After three years of wanting and drooling, I finally bought a digital camera.  Now of course, I had my doubts and worries, so I held my breath with each click I made which led me to purchase the Olympus Camedia D-380.  My fears subsided when I began to test the features of this camera when I received it the next day.  This is a great beginner's camera.  At the highest resolution (1600x1208), you can take 5 photos.  At the lowest resolution (640x480), you can take up to 47 photos, although it's not the best quality.  By default, the setting is at 1600x1200, which allows for 16 photos.  I use 1024x768 which gives me 29 photos.  Keep in mind that these number of photos are on an 8MB memory card.  A higher card will produce more clicks for your buck.  For the most part, I didn't need the instruction booklet to guide me through the steps.  I find it simple to operate, and mainly used the booklet to understand what the icons represented.  There was very little which I couldn't figure out where I used the booklet to understand.  This camera is simple to operate.  This is my first camera of any kind, and I found it worth my money.  The first thing I noticed was how light this camera was.  It felt like a toy, but it's functions proved otherwise.  The four AA batteries will add some weight to the camera, but not by much.  After every photo, the image will freeze for less than a second in the LCD screen.  You can view your photos through the thumbnails offered, and delete those which you don't want, saving space and meory for those good photos. The Olympus Camedia D-380 can also record mini movies (without sound of course).  The more difficult aspect I found was the application which comes with this Camera, but the problems where easily worked through.  Over all, I found this camera to meet my needs.  I'd recommend it to anyone first starting out.
