I bought this item after reading the reviews,  expecting some limitations since multiple reviewers pointed out that one couldn't get the full functionality of this device without running Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out the following:  For one thing,  you can configure the camera entirely from Mac OS X / Safari.  Second thing,  once the latest version of the firmware is installed (I am currently running with 1.1.0 build 77),  one can control the camera entirely from Safari (it no longer requires Windows Internet Explorer specific ActiveX,  I mean,  it still works with ActiveX,  but it supports multiple profiles that work without -- and I have the full functionalities,  including sound,  camera control,  preset configurations,  on my Mac running Mac OS X and Safari).  Oh,  and contrary to what was mentioned by another reviewer,  the camera works fine with Apple routers (I am using a TimeCapsule,  and the camera works fine with WPA2 as supported by this router).  I also bought the eyeCam iPhone app (mentioned by another reviewer)  which works perfectly with this camera.One thing that I have learned by talking with Trendnet tech support (who are very responsive by the way),  is that after having upgraded the firmware,  one must i) reset the camera and ii) reconfigure it,  otherwise you'll encounter some glitches.The one thing that would make this camera better would be https support...  but they seem to be actively improving the firmware,  so who knows.I put only one star for the documentation,  because it is rather basic (works fine for a simple setup,  and is mostly a walk through the setup web based utility), and it didn't mention anything about Mac OS X support (which is odd...);  that said,  their customer support seems to be top notch,  so I wouldn't hold that against them.Oh,  one last thing:  multiple vendors on Amazon offer the same item,  with different prices,  so it pays to look around what is available on Amazon before placing your order.
