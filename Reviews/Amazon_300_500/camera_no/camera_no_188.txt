I bought this WebCAM as a way of keeping an eye on my dog.  My dog is Bloodhound and everything that you've probably heard about their sensitive noses is completely true and worse!  Her nose gets into everything so I needed a way 'catching her in the act' so that I could correct the behavior.The WebCAM is quite small and the web based configuration is simple.  However, if you're not a computer guru who knows all of the ins and outs to setting up your DSL router and webCAM, good luck.  I consider myself very tech savvy and I struggled with getting the router and camera to work together for quite some time.  Forget about the instructions that come with the camera, they are almost worthless.Here's a tip that I found on a third party web site almost as an afterthought.  If you want to use the "Speaker Out" feature, you have to supply the speaker!  Nowhere does TrendNet give you this little gem of information, or at least nowhere that I could find it.The camera "looks up" much further than it "looks down."  So if you mount the camera high, (I mounted mine near the ceiling) you may need to mount it with a little down angle so that you can increase the field of view below the camera.  I mounted mine so that it looks straight down giving me the widest field of view possible.  Note that if you do this, the image will "rotate" as you pan the camera from side to side.The wireless works very well, again using the web based setup is a snap to setting up the wireless.  It has a lot of different security features that works with a wide range of Access Points.The zoom is a joke.  It's nothing more than like zooming in on a photo using your favorite picture viewer / editor.  Worthless in my opinion.All in all, I like the camera a lot for what I'm using it for, essentially a security camera.  I'm considering purchasing a second one for my downstairs.
