All the advertising talks are trueI am one of the oldest users of digital cameras. The advent of 800 thousand pixels (not 8MP!) digital camera was a great milestone in my digital camera life. I'm always totally enchanted by the ever-growing intelligent features of newly announced digital cameras so far. My most favorite digital camera was NIKON Coolpix 5000 which was an 8 megapixel machine with superb image quality.However, the limitations by its compactness are as follows: - Long startup time (many lost shots) - Frequent off the marks shots - Frequent battery changes required  (3 changes per half a day) - Night shots unsatisfactory - Many, many blurred imagesLast year, magnificent advertising talks of EOS 20D attracted my attention: - A top shutter speed of 1/8,000 seconds - 5 fps performance for up to 23 consecutive frames - Long battery life (700-1000 shots per one charge)My EOS 20D completely shattered my strong belief that digital cameras were not suitable for long range shots. To my great surprise, the shots taken by the EOS 20D proved otherwise! This is the moment I really felt the happiness of having purchased the EOS 20D.The EOS 20D features high-resolution of 8.2MP which is the only unsatisfactory point in the long range viewpoint because the race for high-resolution continues on and on. More amazing fact is that it can record 4-5MB data in JPEG and nearly 9MB data in RAW mode in 5 fps performance!It is possible to take 400-500 shots in one charge even if you check every shot on the rear display. You will be marveled at the battery life continuing for 100-200 shots after the warning of insufficient charge indicated. It is very convenient.I'm enjoying EF-S17-85mm f4-5.6 IS USM lens which is admirably free of blurred images by its stabilizer feature. It is worth buying for all dim environments holding off the use of flashes.
