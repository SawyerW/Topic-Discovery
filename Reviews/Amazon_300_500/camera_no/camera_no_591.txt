I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point. Well wait no more! This Camera is just plain FUN. I have had it for 5 months and barely a day has gone by that I haven't used it. It really changes the way you approach photography since you can edit on the fly, the instant feedback helps you shoot till you get it right! Trial and error - the best way. Tip - after shooting an image hold the shutter button down and the image will show in the LCD screenIt's very well suited to people with a medium level of computer skills (perfect for Mac users) The photo stitch feature is awesome letting you seamlessly join panoramic pics together with supplied software.I recommend the following accessories:1. Extra compact flash card, as large as you can afford, I got the Viking 128 MB2. Extra battery, although the supplied pack is pretty good once it runs out you need a back up. (Get the elph Kit which includes a nice case and a really cool strap for not much more than a single battery)3. If you plan on using the camera with more than one computer (like home and office) get an extra USB connector so you don't have to bring it with you every time.4. Compact flash reader - I got one of these thanks to other reviewers although I don't use it much. You can upload 50 hi-res pictures in a few minutes with the supplied "image browser" software. It is a good battery saver but with a spare it doesn't matter anyway. I'm still waiting for the perfect printer, everythhing is SO big and UGLY! but I guess if I wait long enough...........
