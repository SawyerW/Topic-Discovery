I wish that Fuji 72 EXR could have posted two basic settings - one for indoor pictures at home and one for outdoor for photographs as I am a novice (non-expert).  The indoor pictures seem to be on the yellow side and I have to manually fix all my pictures.I can't figure out if I can change the white balance or not under automatic settings.I think this camera has fantastic potential if you're a photographer.Terrific optimal zoom for a pocket sized cameraDecent videos, even though it's not a HD Video cameraFuji software cannot work with Vista 64 bit at this timeSo, why the 4 stars.  At a camera store, I physically compared the indoor photos at an automatic setting to all the cameras with high optimal zoom (I wanted at least 7x Optimal Zoom); The Fuji F72 EXR had the sharpest photos with the best colors compared to high optimal zoom cameras from Nikon, Sony, Canon, Olympus, etc. However, I was unable to compare the Panasonic ZS3 which was at Costco (Costco cannot provide batteries to test the camera).I also like being able to choose the Vivid color setting which really makes the outdoor colors brighten up incredibly.Great outdoor pictures on EXR setting in the Dynamic range.Please feel free to make some camera setting suggestions to me.  I would LOVE any basic recommendations so that I can just point and shoot automatic pictures indoors (under normal fluorescent lights) and outdoors with sharp detail.Addendum:  I am no longer confused.  I am very disappointed because the Panasonic ZS3 (which I checked out using my friend's ZS3) is WAAY better in both outdoor light and indoor light on Automatic than the Fuji 72EXR.  Now, I have to see if the store is willing to accept my return with a 15% restocking fee.  I picked...poorly.
