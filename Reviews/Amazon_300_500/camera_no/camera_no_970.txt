I was looking for a little camera for those times when I didn't want to carry my Nikon SLR.  I was with a friend who was taking photos in a dark restaurant of her daughter's birthday party and the photos looked fantastic.  I asked what camera she was using and it was the Coolpix S630.  I believe the camera is discontinued now, but I found it on Amazon at one of their sellers and I have been very happy with it.  What I don't like about most of the newer model point and shoots is there are TOO many features -- confusing, and not necessary.  All I'm looking for is a camera that takes good pictures.  I've tried others and liked them, but then when I see the quality of the photos I am disappointed.  The Nikon S630 takes great photos without any fussing.  Not sure why, but Nikon cameras really capture color well and the S630 is no exception -- the photos I've taken with this camera are beautiful, sharp, and easy to get.  While the camera gives you plenty of "scene" options, including fireworks and sunset, the normal mode is great at automatically choosing what settings to use for the scene.  All the buttons to change scenes or settings (if you feel the need) are right there on the back panel -- no searching around for them.  Very user friendly!  Another plus is the rechargeable (charger is included) Lithium Ion battery that comes with the camera.  These batteries last so much longer than AA batteries!  Though the "movie" option is not something I use very often, I tried it and it does a good job.  Adjusts for different lighting well, and picks up sound very well.  I will be surprised if you don't love the Nikon Coolpix S630 and the photos you can take with it.
