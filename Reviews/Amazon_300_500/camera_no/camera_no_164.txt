At first glance, wanted to give this a 5 star rating, but there's some sorely lacking features.  Is it a working camera?  Yes, it does it's job decently, but it could of been so much more.  With this hefty price tag, it should of been so much more.#1 - At log in, it's not password encrypted.  So anyone can stumble to your computer, click on it and they would discover the camera which would ruin the purpose of Hidden camera.#2 - No alarm clock - at $250, I would think they can afford to put an alarm function.  It would make the clock a lot more real, hard to imagine a digital clock this big, this heavy, yet no alarm?#3 - The extra Platinum service - This is the real sucker here.  Functions that should have been included - pan, focus, password entry, it's there, but you have to pay more for it, as if $250 for a camera isn't enough.#4 - Must plug into wall - It's a wireless camera, but it must be plugged into the wall, making it no longer wireless.#5 - Vista users - don't bother.  It does not work out of the box, I couldn't figure it out.  Fortunately I have several computers at home, hooked it up to XP, setup is a breeze.#6 - Logitech sticker at the bottom of the camera - hard to remove.  Anyone with any knowledge of the brand Logitech would immediately sense something wrong here, when did Logitech start making cheapy clocks with no alarm?Would I recommend this camera?  Yes, only because there isn't anything else on the market to the general public.  If you have XP, setup is a breeze, pic. quality is decent, the hidden camera is well made, no matter how you look at it, it's a clock, though sorely lacking the alarm feature.  If they added those features mentioned, even at $300 it would be worth it, but without it, it just feels like an incomplete product.
