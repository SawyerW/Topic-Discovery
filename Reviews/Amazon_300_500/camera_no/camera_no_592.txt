It's amazing what you can fit in such a small package. You can read the features, I won't waste time there, but what I can say is that this is the best digital camera in its class, hands down. I have tried Olympus, Fuji, Sony, etc. etc., but nothing comes close to this camera. What mainly surprised me was the sturdiness and durability of the body, buttons, and display. The camera just feels great in your hands, not cheap and plastic.Image quality is excellent in most conditions, and very good in the dark, in my experience. This is even on the lowest quality mode. If you're having trouble getting good pictures in the dark, use the flash -- that's why it's there! Don't expect the camera to magically take an amazing picture without light. The flash, by the way, is excellent -- it fills well and is plenty bright. I take most of my pictures at 1024x768, but the 1600x1200 mode is still excellent. I've seen cameras that take grainy pictures in the highest resolutions, but not this one. Great quality all around. Printed pictures also look excellent in 1600x1200 at 4x6 and even 8x10, if you don't mind a slight loss of resolution. If you need to make prints at 8x10, and still want all the greatness of this camera, get the new 3.2 Megapixel Canon Digital Elph S-230. It is a bit more expensive, but you get what you pay for -- an extra megapixel of resolution.One other great feature worth mentioning is the Canon Image stitching software to put together 360 degree or multiple-shot panoramas. It works great. I have some great panoramas from everywhere from the tops of mountains to Memorial Stadium during Big Game. And did I mention how small this camera is? Pocket sized. Literally. No comparison.
