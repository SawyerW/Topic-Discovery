I purchased my Rebel T3 about a month ago and am in love with this camera.  It is my first dSLR and I have a lot to learn as a newbie.  I've identified a wonderful photography forum at Ugly Hedgehog.com and enjoy seeing photos and reading how photographers caught their shots.  Many links are provided to hundreds of websites for further information.  This has been fun but overwhelming in trying to learn the ins and outs of dSLR and specifically my T3, just because of the massive amount of information that is available and so much of it that is not applicable to my T3.  However, what I gained most was one user stating that "anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to get David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography".  My search led me to Amazon and after reading the first chapter free, I was hooked.  I purchased the Kindle version so I have it to take with me as needed.  It is easy to read and the picture quality is good, even though it is in black and white only.  Having it on my computer Kindle library is like getting 2 books for the price of one.  The large computer colored screen view with fantastic quality pictures is a real plus.  As to the quality of the information the author provides, I find it exceptionally easy to understand.  He really does make me feel like he is sitting down with me and showing me how to use my new camera and all of its features.  I just made my purchase today and am so pleased with it.  This is one book that I know I will read cover to cover and will have as a much used reference book in the future.  I agree... anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to have this book.
