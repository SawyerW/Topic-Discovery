Honestly, I now firmly believe that reviews on sites are often "seeded" with positives from companies.My wife and I purchased this camera for her mother, and we are greatly disappointed.  The photos it takes are, to be honest, not up to snuff.  This camera actually takes worse photos than most 2 megapixel and 3 megapixel cameras that were out 4 years ago.  Give no thought to the fact that it's a 7 megapixel camera.  It just means you get 7 megapixels of a poor photo.  Maybe it's the lens, but in all honesty, my wife's new Samsung Cell Phone takes photos as well as this disappointment does.We purchased this Nikon because my wife has had good experiences with her Nikon Coolpix 5900.  That camera is a few years old, and was three times the price, but we feel we got "taken" by trusting the Nikon name on this.I will say that it does take decent close-up shots.  Anything in the mid-range, however, is generally blurry or out of focus 50% of the time.  Honestly, to look at the photos, we can't figure out what the camera was trying to focus on, either.  Nothing at a medium range looks good.  Long-distance shots are quite ho-hum.The PC mode is, strangely, somewhat useful.  Anything in between that and the highest 7 megapixel mode should be avoided.  We feel we need to take photos on the highest setting at all times in order to get a photo that is at least acceptable.In all honesty, you should avoid this camera.  I know it's cheap, but for the price, there has got to be something better.  There's no point in a camera being "easy to use" if it takes awful photos.I have no hatred of Nikon.  We will never again, however, purchase a cheaper camera from them.
