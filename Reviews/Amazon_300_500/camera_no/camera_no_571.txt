I normally shoot with an Olympus 3040 digital which has all the bells and whistles that allow 35 mm style photos. But I have missed numerous potentially great photos because I didn't have this somewhat larger camera with me. I wanted the Elph for about a year, but didn't get it due to short battery life and the 2-megapixel limit. The S330 uses the NB-1LH lithium ion battery (which can be used on older models too. After reading the reviews of the new S-330, I bought the camera. I haven't taken many pictures in the few days I've had the camera, but took some outside and a couple indoors. I printed out a 5X7 outdoor shot and was very impressed. The quality of the photo was every bit as good as with my 3-megapixel. Now I have a camera in my pocket ready for those formerly missed shots and I can count on great pictures to at least 5X7's... I also bought the Viking 128MB card, an extra NB-1LH Battery and the PSC-300 Soft Case. I would do it the same way again and maybe get the AC adapter for time hooked to the computer or for learning the camera better. The case is good but has a pocket that accommodates the charger and battery, so it is a little large for a jean's pocket. The ZoomBrowser software that comes with the camera is much better than I had for file storage and printing layouts. File naming, moving and printlayout are easy. I still use Photoshop Elements for my image editing and haven't tried the image editor that came with the S-330. A camera is a bit like a life jacket: it doesn't do you any good if you don't have it on you. If you want a camera that you will have with you, you will like this camera.
