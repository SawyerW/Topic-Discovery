This is a good beginner camera.  I would put it in a class with the old Kodak Instamatic film camera - more than a toy but certainly not professional.Pros:  The camera is small enough to slip in a coat pocket, easy to use, takes decent to good pictures.Cons:  Batteries - Yes, it eats through batteries fast (and by this I mean the batteries must be replaced somewhere between 12-24 pictures depending on whether flash is used).  I did notice, however, that when the camera no longer likes the batteries, it doesn't mean they are truly dead.  So don't just throw them out - try them in a flashlight first.  In fact, if you let the camera rest awhile (off for a few hours or overnight) you may find that the battery indicator now seems ok.Dark Pictures - indoor pictures do tend to look dark, even with flash, but you can fix that with the brightness/contrast edit in the software that comes with the camera.  The downer is that you can't just print them as is right away without fixing the picture first.Picture Delay - There is a delay between when you push the button to take the picture and when it actually snaps the picture.  So, what this means is that you think you've snapped the shot but then you move the camera and find out that the real time it takes the picture is not when you press the button but a few seconds afterward. The result is blurred pictures, pictures of the floor or your feet or something else you didn't really want.  So, you have to be very careful when taking a picture and hold the camera very steady in position a little while after pushing the button to make sure that you get the picture.  Overall:  I don't regret buying this camera.  It is useful and handy since it's small.  But I wish I would have purchased something a little better.
