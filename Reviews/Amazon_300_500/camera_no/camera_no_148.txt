First of all, I am an amateur photographer. I do, however, have years of experience shooting 35mm SLR photographs. My favorite camera, which I still own was my old reliable Nikon FE.  I have recently made the change to digital photography. Having loved my old FE and having confidence in Nikon, I bought a Nikon D80. Up to now, I haven't really gotten into the meat of the camera, so to speak. I've mainly been playing with shooting photos from the full green auto mode, while I read up on the many other features of the camera. I am extremely disappointed in the flash photos using the full auto mode and onboard flash.  They are all underexposed and very dark.  I sent an email to Nikon's technical support, along with some photo samples. The technician agreed that the photos were underexposed. However, he told me that he felt the camera was working properly. Remember now, these were fully auto mode photos. There was no operator error, since I had left all settings up to the camera (auto exposure, auto focus, auto ISO, auto aperture setting, auto shutter speed, and auto white balance). I find it disappointing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $1200 or so for a Nikon DSLR, and, in order to get  properly exposed photographs, if you're wanting to just point and shoot, you have to shoot in another mode such as Program mode and adjust the exposure, or, brighten up your auto mode photos with photo editing software after you've uploaded them to your computer. There are a lot of good things about this camera, but, since this a $1200 Nikon camera, I'd expect it to not only take a decent auto mode flash photograph, but that any auto mode flash photo taken by this camera would be outstanding.
