I'll compare ZS3 with TZ5 in this review if you want full review about ZS3 read other reviews, I wanted to buy new camera and TZ5 was already available for 210$ and ZS3 sold out and costs 399$, since ZS3 is an upgraded TZ5 from last year i was thinking if its worth the wait and the extra 200$~ to get the ZS3 (Been trying to get it for weeks but couldn't find it anywhere)Anyway here we goZS3 got everything that TZ5 have with extra stuff which is* ZS3 is slimmer/smaller/lighter and the battery is a little bit better* ZS3 got brighter screen (Good when you shoot during sunlight)* ZS3 record HD 1280X720p in AVCHD high quality 17mpbs format* Better placed microphone,in the TZ5 your hands end up on the microphone* ZS3 record in High Quality Stereo,TZ5 record in low quality mono sound* better cleaner picture and less noise thanks to the newer Sensor/tech* ZS3 got Extra 2x Zoom and better 25mm wide angle instead of 28mm* New Auto mode is so smart even the inexperienced gets good pictures* Faster and stronger auto focus with face Recognition and Face Detection* Dedicated recording button for videos (Take videos during photo mode)* 10MP without any quality loss thanks to the newer sensor* HDMI Output that can be used for both videos and picturesIn the other hand ZS3 VS ZS1 (ZS1 is cheaper by 100-150$ right now)* ZS1 lacks the HDMI output that can be found in the ZS3* ZS1 Can not record in HD at all and AVCHD format not available* ZS1 record in low quality mono sound* ZS1 got no dedicated button for fast access to video recording* ZS1 LCD is smaller (2.7 vs ZS3 3.0) and less resolution* ZS1 got 1/2.5 CCD vs 1/2.33 CCD on the ZS3 (ZS3 a little better)* ZS1 Image stabilization is not great during video capture unlike ZS3* ZS1 Does not have the wind noise reduction option unlike the ZS3So after my research i decided that i want the ZS3 and it was worth it because i care a lot about high quality HD videos with High quality Stereo sound so it was no brainier to me specially the fact its smaller even when they added more zoom and extra wide angle lens with more MP and less noiseI hope this was helpful
