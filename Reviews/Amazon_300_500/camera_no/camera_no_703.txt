I purchased the Pentax K-7 body last year to use with my existing Pentax compatible lenses (a Tamron 70-300 and a Pentax 18-55), and it has been a great camera.  Lots of positives: The weather resistant body is rugged and feels solid in your hands, and is noticeably more compact than other digital SLRs.  Despite the smaller size (which comes in handy when traveling or hiking), the whole camera feels much more substantial than the Nikon and Canon models in the same price range that I test drove.  Good low-light sensitivity and shake reduction work together with great auto white balance to let me capture great interior shots with ambient light (or sometimes a flash with a diffuser bounced off the ceiling if it's really dark).  Controls are laid out well and are intuitive to use, and it's a piece of cake to adjust f stop, exposure times and compensation settings while you're shooting.  Daylight shooting is a breeze.  Autofocus motor in the body and shake reduction built in to the body mean that lenses are cheaper.  Having HD video capability at the ready has been awesome while traveling. Quite often I take it with just the 18-55 mm zoom lens, and leave all my other gear in the camera bag at home.Negatives:  Autofocus sometimes searches for a moment in very low light, but does usually find focus after a second or two.  The frame rate in burst mode shooting is decent, but not super fast.  Pentax cameras and lenses are not as common as the Canon & Nikon, but with the body and two decent zooms, and possibly a hot shoe flash, you'd be all set.  If you need to shoot at really high frame rates, capture 1000's of images per day, or need super high performance lenses and other gear, this may not be the camera for you.  However, it's an overall great pick for an advanced amateur.
