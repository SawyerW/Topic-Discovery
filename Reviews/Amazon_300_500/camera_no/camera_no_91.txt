I had not planned on upgrading to the D80 from my D70, but around Christmas, a local camera store had a 20% coupon for nearly anything in the store, including the D80. So, my plans changed. I have been a Nikon shooter for a number of years, and my most recent 35mm SLR is a Nikon N80. So, the D70 had a very familiar look and feel to it, and I found the transition from film to digital was pretty comfortable. I researched the D70 for months before buying it and had extremely high expectations for the camera, all of which were exceeded. The D80 retains all the great features of the D70 with improved imaging, new features, and an excellent system of buttons, dials, and menus.I have really enjoyed shooting with the D80 and find I use a number of different approaches depending on my shooting subject. Aperture preferred, shutter preferred, program, etc. All have their merits. I think that DSLRs today are fantastic, and all the good brands have great offerings. So we can hardly go wrong any more. Since I had the experience with Nikons and some good lenses, I decided to stick with Nikon and have been most pleased. Nikon's approach is to focus on image quality, no pun intended. There is less emphasis with bells and whistles, compared with some other brands. The competition among the big DSLR manufacturers is fantastic for us digital shooters.This is a great camera, but I think that Nikon should provide Capture NX, its imaging software developed by Nik and Nikon, should not be an add-on at additional expense. Other manufacturers provide that imaging software for free, and I wish there were an ultrasonic dust remover, but this camera is a pleasure to use. Hope this helps you make a decision.
