This is a very good camera to bring along regardless of whether you have a DSLR or not.  For people who generally shoot using a more powerful DSLR, this camera will give the shooter the luxury of having a point and shoot camera as well as a manual/semi-manual camera in one very small package.With 12.1 megapixel, the images are highly detailed and the prints are good enough to have on the walls.  I like taking pictures wherever I go, but I'm not always able to carry my DSLR around. With this camera, I no longer have to choose between hauling a heavy DSLR or miss the opportunity of capturing something interesting.On the automatic side, the facial recognition and anitshake features are must haves when you only have seconds to take those pictures.  The high ISO numbers allows proper exposures in many low light as well as high shutter speed conditions.  On the manual side, the customizable "function" button lets me decide the kinds of setting I want at my finger tip under different situations.  For example,  I could put the ISO setting there so that I can change the ISO from picture to picture, or I could set the function button to call up the white balance setting when I'm trying to meet a ever-changing condition, i.e. from sunlight to shady skies.  The flexibility of this camera makes experimenting part of the fun as well.Some say this type of cameras are not serious, however, I think this camera is actually fun and yet serious enough to let photographers who enjoy taking pictures no matter what the situations and conditions are a good backup.  After all, it is the finding of interesting images and the creativity of picture composition that we enjoy and not necessarily the joy of just owning more expensive equipments.I'll take my DSLR AND this Coolpix !!!!
