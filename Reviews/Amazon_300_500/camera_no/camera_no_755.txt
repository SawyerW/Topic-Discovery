[[Updated: 10/17/2011After having used the camera for several years, it has since been replaced by Foscam FI8918W whichis far better in value and features. Everything below is still true, but there are better options outthere unless this camera is found for VERY cheap.]]I purchased this camera after having owned the TV-IP110W (an excellent camera for the price, also reviewed by me elsewhere.) I went into it expecting it to be a pan/tilt version of the same unit. I discovered after the fact, which I would have learned had I read other reviews before buying it, that despite having a higher model number, it is actually an older camera with older technology. I learned this by calling tech support to determine why the picture on this one looked like I was viewing it through a sandstorm while my TV-IP110W was clear in 1/2 the light. Sooo... on to the summary:Pros:* Easy to setup and install. No issues getting it setup.* Reliable. Some people have reported having to reboot it every few weeks, but I really have only had it crash once in over a year. Maybe I'm just lucky.* Easy to use interface, though not mobile friendly (See below.)Cons:* As mentioned, quality is fairly poor, even for a camera of this price range. Picture is usable with daylight streaming in from a glass slider on one side of the room and bay window on the other side AND numerous overhead bulbs, but I wouldn't say much more than usable. The TV-IP110W is much clearer with 1 small window and a single low powered CF bulb.* A little sluggish on the movement, but not bad* Interface is not very mobile friendly, but there are work-arounds available if you are html-handy and ambitious.See: [...]  for a detail of the protocol used to control the interface via standard put/get commands. Not as clean as the ActiveX control, but it works.Overall, its a decent camera that gets the job done, but don't expect to be overwhelmed.
