I bought this camera as a replacement for another Lumix point and shoot I had for the past 5-6 years.  I've always liked the build quality and great pics that the Lumix family of cameras provide.  What sold me were all the stellar reviews on Amazon, the Leica lens, and the rock bottom pricing ($139 a few weeks ago).The camera feels light in your hand- almost too light.  Not sure if the body is made of metal or plastic, but it's small enough to pocket if you had to.  I'd prefer to place it in a belt looped case for added protection.  It might be a tiny bit longer and wider than a standard deck of playing cards.  What warrants the 5 star rating from me?  What should always matter the most with cameras - picture quality.  I made a few basic settings once I got the camera in the mail - highest picture quality, vivid color setting, anti-shake setting 'on'.  I popped in the battery after it was fully charged (about 90 minutes), and a new 8gb class 10 SDHC card.After heading to the wilderness of the backyard, I snapped all the familiar images I always seem to shoot when testing out a new camera.  Flowers, textures, any stray bugs or birds that might be out.  I always take a few shots in the shade, the direct sunlight, macro, as well as zoomed shots.  The Lumix FH25 delivered in spades.  Shots were HUGE on my monitor - I was very pleased with the sharpness, contrast, and color saturation in all of the test shots.  Detail on some of the flower shots were amazing - gentle textures on the structures within the flower were razor sharp.  Focusing is fast, so I doubt you'd ever have to blame the FH25 for a missed shot.I've only just started to explore all the various shooting modes- just sticking to the basic shooting mode or the Ai mode for now.  If you're looking for a quality camera with a lens everyone knows as one of the very best, search no more.  The Lumix FH25k delivers.  I'm very pleased with my purchase, and look forward to years of shooting with my trusty new camera.
