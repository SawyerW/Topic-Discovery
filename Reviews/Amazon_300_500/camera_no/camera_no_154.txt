Okay, so I don't normally do this, but I felt obligated for this product.I am a student taking Spanish classes for a month-long course in Puerto Rico right now.  Earlier last week, I dropped my camera in the water....que triste!!  So, I did some online browsing, and found this camera used for only $29.  The way I saw it was that that is the equivalent of three disposables, and I can put the photos online, so I gave it a shot.The camera arrived in about 4 days....literally a week before it was supposed to!  I was estatic to see it, especially because those 4 days overlapped with Memorial Day Weekend.The camera came with a case, batteries, and cords.  The batteries are just normal AAs, so I will probably use the rechargable ones I have when these die out.  The camera takes standard SD memory cards, so I actually can use one I had for my previous camera.  It has an internal memory as well, though, so if something happens with your card you have time to get to the store.  This is a great feature that a lot of cameras don't have now.The camera pretty durable.  It's surface is more of a matted black, not shiny, so it won't scratch as easily.  Its a standard size camera-a little thicker than some of the more basic ones, but still thinner than my previous one.  It will easily fit any camera case.  The viewing screen is more than suitable.  It is 10 megapixels, so images are very focused.  I have taken both indoor and outdoor photos without a problemThe only complaints I have thus far are that it takes a little while to turn on (you have to hold the power button for a bit) and it's kinda noisy (the buttons make noise).  But I really don't consider either of these to be an issue.  It's features are straight forward to use.I honestly can't believe I got this for thirty bucks....I will post if I have any problems in the future, but as my title says, "Woderful so far!"
