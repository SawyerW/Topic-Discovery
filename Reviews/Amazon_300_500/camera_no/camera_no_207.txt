I've been using this for months now and finally got "permission" to sell it. I'll be switching brands to another DSLR; Canon and Nikon are the preeminent brands for DSLR and I wanted to save a few bucks. I guess this time that didn't work.This is my first DSLR. I've had other digi cams, all point and click but wanted better quality images.When this thing focuses the pics are nice, especially outside. The built in flash indoors is ok, too. It takes pictures quickly as well.The biggest problem with this camera is that its auto focus is a total catastrophe. The reason I've waited months for this review is to ensure I had checked into all possible solutions. I've looked online, I've read the manual, I even spent a couple hundred bucks on a nice flash for it. Tried all the various focus approaches, one dot, three dots, manual + auto, etc. Looked into lighting, etc. I didn't rip it out of the box, fail in its use and post online immediately in frustration. Nonetheless, the auto focus on this often just does not work and is during these times of not working worse than a 10 year old Fuji digital camera I got a long time ago.The problem, and you'll note a few others have found the issue, is that it will seek focus poorly. Often it will seek endlessly when in continuous mode, going back and forth over a clean focus but not taking the pic, and even though the lighting is not bad it just cannot for the life of itself focus properly and take the pic. And other times when in single focus mode it has at times actually gone past a clean focus point into the most blurry possible focus and then it took the picture.I'm sure some would read this review and tell me I only deserve to be using $60 point and clicks and maybe that's the case. Or maybe the lens was damaged from the get go (I believe I'm past warranty, so I must have had this since Xmas 2009). Or maybe I have less tolerance for poor behavior. Whatever the case, I'm done with it.
