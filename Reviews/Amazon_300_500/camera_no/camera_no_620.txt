I love photography - being outdoors, working with the camera, and the finished photos.  I used to take so many pictures! I carried my huge full-featured 35mm camera everywhere, and usually got pretty good results.  Then I went to school and got my own job and had to start PAYING for my own film and developing.  I quickly slowed my picture taking to a trickle.I got this camera in February, and I have taken over 1000 pictures since then.  I have all of the control I had in my 35mm camera, and more, so I do not feel constrained.  Imagine being able to choose between 5 different speeds of film, eight different types of color saturation, plus black and white, and changing film between every shot!  Pushing a button enlarges the center of the frame to check your focus, and pushing another button while in manual focus mode has the camera auto-focus once - which is perfect when I want to use the auto-focus feature but do not want to miss a shot because it is re-focusing.  I tend to get more good pictures now because I can immediately view my shots and tell if I've got something wrong.  Also, this camera feels well-balanced and all the controls are easy to reach.It has a tripod socket, but no cable release.  There is a 2 second and 10 second timer.  As with all digital cameras, there is a small delay between pushing the shutter button and taking the picture, but its pretty quick on this camera.  You will get used to the timing with practice.For the serious photo buff, I suggest two full sets of recharable batteries (NiMH) and the highest-capacity high-speed memory cards you can afford.  You then have free film for life!It didn't fit in my purse - so I bought a bigger purse.
