I love the camera because the functions are so easy to use. It is not at all complicated and has lots of different options. I try to take pictures on horseback, and can easily work with the camera while moving. On auto most of the shots were REALLY nice... beautiful shots, I have some that look professional. A few of the shots under auto were fuzzy... you have to be patient and wait a little for the camera to figure out what it needs to focus on under this option. I imagine that the camera was adjusting since I was moving when I took the shot. If you need to take a quick shot of something fast, use normal view or if you want to chose a specific photo option, your target for the photo might move by the time you flip through a couple screens to chose face, animal, candle light, etc as the specific type of photo you want. This is true of most cameras though... and like I said, it is easy to find what you need. I tried video and shots of a deer under regular and night.. with my porch light on it. I could see the deer but the camera couldn't even when I messed with different options. Some pictures under certain options showed the deer some... but not that well at all, I was disappointed with this. The camera has been durable for the month I have had it so far, and the software was easy to use as well.  As far as amazon goes, they sent me an e-mail to pick up the camera at the post office as it needed to be signed for... but it showed up the next day via mail and was left in my mail box. Just a heads up... could have been the post office or amazon that got that one messed up. In case it happened to rain and your mail box is outside like mine, be careful to get the camera when amazon says it is coming.
