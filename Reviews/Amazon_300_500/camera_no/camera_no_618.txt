Honestly the best Kodak camera I've ever used was an OLD 1mp from around 2000. A friend picked up this Kodak for $10 at a local Goodwill store just to tinker with. As a photography hobbyist they figured for $10 if it's TERRIBLE we can just toss it in the trash. Keep in mind they purchased this camera from the Goodwill store in the summer of 2007. With that being said, I just dug it out (surprised I still had it) to take some close-ups of my main camera which I just broke. I found some old pictures I'd taken with it which I will be uploading onto Amazon to share with others. I've tinkered with around a hundred digital cameras over the past 10 years from SLR's to camera phones and prefer to stick with point-and-shoot's. Here's some pros & cons with this one:Pros:LCD Screen is present (not big, not super small but usable) & has viewfinder in case LCD breaksMemory: internal & SD slotBatteries: 2 AA's which are readily available (I've found the Energizer e2's to be the longest lasting disposables)Sturdy large-ish design, easy to hang ontoMacro surprisingly decentCons:Eats batteries like there's no tomorrowSD card goes in seemingly backwards vs. most camerasSlow boot-up and camera shutter speedMenu can be a pain in the rear to navigate, camera doesn't remember any settings when turned off & back onMacro doesn't focus too well within 6" from subjectI honestly wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone unless they wanted a really cheap knock-around camera to keep in the car or something like that. Mine was stored for a year and now has about 10+ dead pixels in the photos it takes. For what it is and being a 2mp old-as-dirt model I think I'll still keep it around just in case I need it.
