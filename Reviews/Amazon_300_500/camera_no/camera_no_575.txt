I am an old-school, amateur (hobby / relaxation now)  photographer (Canon F1, Mamiya 645, and a 4x5 View camera) 35mm to  large format.  I did not have the funds to get an interchangeble lense digital.I had taken a few photographs with friends Minolta, Kodak, HP, and Nikon digitals.  The S330 is definitely above them. I would have given the S330 a blazing 5.0, but would actually rate it a 4.5 do to size of my hands vs. the size of the camera and the LCD size( glad I wear reading glasses) and the spot effect of the flash from a distance.I shot a 12 exposure role of Kodak Gold Ultra ISO 400, after metering off of a gray card and keeping that exposure setting and compared to the same photos with the S330.  The S330(on auto) was a little underexposed in the shadows, but not enough to not compensate with a competent graphics program.  Landscape photographs out the van window at 60 miles an hour were good. There was some blur, but if you lead the shot as you would in shooting skeet, it was acceptable.  Color was acceptable in all cases(not like the overt blue when shooting ektachrome.When I ordered my camera, I also ordered a 32 meg and 256 meg CF card ( Simple Tech cards and Flash Link CF card reader ).  I strongly suggest the average user to order a supplemental 32 or 64 meg CF card when they order this or any other digital camera.  I just ordered a spare battery and will order the car battery charger and AC Adapter kit in September.  The low battery feature should give an obnoxious warning, but it does not.I have had no problems with the software that was included with the S330 of the CF Card Reader (running windows 2000).  Strongly recommend this digital camera, as I have been well pleased. Point of note: READ YOUR MANUAL.
