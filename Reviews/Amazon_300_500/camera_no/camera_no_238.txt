This is my first digital camera.  I am going out of the country to visit family next month, and I plan on taking a lot of pictures, but I didn't want to lug around boxes and boxes of film (I need to save all the suitcase space for clothes and whatnot).  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money on the camera, just in case I lose it, as I often tend to lose things.  For the price, I am so far very pleased.  Not to mention I got the money towards a memory card, so I was able to get 64 MB card for just a few dollars.Even though this is the first I have purchased, I am semi-familiar with digital cameras from high school and college courses and friends, so I somewhat knew what I was doing, but I think that this camera would be easy for even the least knowledgeable person.  I opened up the package, put the batteries in, and started taking pictures.  I have yet to look at the instruction manual! The one thing that I was a little disappointed about was the battery usage, but I'll get over it.  I plan on buying the lithium batts.  I had the camera on for about an hour and already the batts were on their last leg.  But in their defense, I had the live feed on, and was trying it out on my TV, computer, etc.  I'm sure that it'll be just fine when I just have it on to take the pictures.I was also surprised about the quality of the pictures.  I have emailed some to my family, and they're excellent!  Plus, the software that was included is easy to use and install.  All in all, this is probably the smartest investment I have made in a while!!I will say that the shutter has to be held down for a second in order to take the picture, which is okay, but I have an 8 month old and it's impossible to get him to be still that long! And also, the buttons are a little punchy.  Sometimes just pressing them once clicks them twice or you have to click them twice just to work, but all in all, it's a solid camera, especially for the casual picture taker.
