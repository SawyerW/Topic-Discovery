Great little camera!  After months of research and deciding on buying a Canon S300, I was pleased to discover that they had released an updated model, the S330.  Its resolution is 0.1 megapixle lower than the S300, but it includes many refined features.I've used the camera for a little over a week now and have taken nearly 500 pictures and am still on my second battery charge (about 2/3 of the pictures I've taken have been with the LCD off).  The included 8 MB compact flash card limits the number of hi-res, hi-quality pics you can take, but you can buy a 128 MB card for a little over 50 bucks (I recommend one from SimpleTech) and be able to hold from 128 to over 1000 pictures, depending on resolution & quality.The camera has lots of options and is especially versatile in its "manual" mode where you have a little more control than you do in the full auto mode.  It gives you freedom to lock the AE, focus and other settings, as well as apply special effects/enhancements.  I leave the camera in manual mode most of the time, since it retains its point-and-shoot simplicity; that way there's one less step to take (turning the selector dial) when I want to change how the camera's taking pictures.It also has a video mode and photostitch mode.  In the photostitch mode the camera helps you line up multiple shots so you can merge them into a single panoramic shot using software on your PC (included).If you're considering this camera but fear it may be too small to easily hold, don't worry.  I have larger than average hands and have no problems at all with manipulating the buttons and taking pictures (although, as with all things, it takes some practice).Enough rambling, the bottom line is....This is definitely the BEST 2 MP, 3 x zoom, compact digital camera available at this time.
