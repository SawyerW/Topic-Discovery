The IDEA of the Ethernet over power line is great, but in execution it just did not work for me at all. I thought since these were on sale from being discontinued I'd give it a try but was sorely disappointed with how it functions. I continually lost connection or never could establish a connection in the first place. I have a very new house, less than 5 years old, so all the wiring is in great shape. Even on the same segment I couldn't maintain a reliable connection. With 15+ years of working in the IT industry I have a fair bit of confidence in what I was doing.The camera itself is quite decent for what it does. The focusing is easy to get to and the lens direction being controlled via a small ball on the back of the camera is a brilliant little idea I think. The ability to hang it looking out a window or into a room via the attached suction cup is also a nice touch and I'm disheartened that no one else has a design similar to this.The software that logitech bundles is ok at best. The idea that I "HAVE" to use their servers to retrieve any usable images or video is ridiculous. The option to run a tiny web server from a machine in my home is very simple to do and the option should at least have been included. I personally am using Blue Iris software for my video recording and this camera, when it would connect, worked very well in that.Logitech does have an upgraded version of this camera but I've not used it yet. I may within the year and will post an updated review for it when/if I do.I had hoped that the camera would work with POE (power over ethernet) but sadly it does not. Again, the upgraded version is supposed to from what I've read elsewhere. I just wish the add-on cameras weren't so bloody expensive. If they were 80-100 I'd gladly snap one up but not for their currently 150+ price tag.If you are looking for a camera system I would stay away from this one unless you just want something to play around with and have some cash to throw away.
