My first DSLR.  Have had Film SLR in the past and loved the creativity that can be accomplished with a manual camera. Hated the hassle and price of having film developed. Went to point and shoot digital and lost interest in photography. I picked up a friend's Canon DSLR and was instantly hooked again.Chose the Pentax because I have some old manual K mount lenses left from my film SLR. In retrospect after using the auto focus lens that comes on the K-x I will proebley very rarely if ever use my old K mount lenses.So the number one reason I chose the K-x was a poor choice on my part. But this is an awesome camera Here are what I like.1. Hand Shake compensation is built into the camera not the lens making lenses less expensive and it works extremely well.2. This is the most compact DSLR I have held. It fits my 8 year old daughter's hands and also fits my somewhat large 45 year old man hands at the same time.3. Simplicity of use. In auto mode my wife and daughter take excellent photos. (Think outstanding point and shoot.)4. Complexity all functions can be manipulated to give you full control of your photos. (Think Film SLR loaded with ISO 100 - 3200 film at the same time and full manual control of shutter speed, F-stop, Focus and any other thing you can think of.)5. Price this is a great first DSLR and possibly the only one you will ever need. It's not a pro DSLR but some times it thinks it is.6. 4.7 Fps this means your child is playing a sport as the ball comes toward him/her you push the button the camera will take 4.7 pictures every second for about 4 seconds depending on the speed of the SD card. I had an old SD card lying around I got about 5 pictures and it would slow down. I put new class 10 SD card in and it doesn't slow down for about 30 pictures.
