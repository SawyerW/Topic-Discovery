I wanted a camera with more zoom than our Canon SD (I also use 2 DSLRs and film cameras). I picked this cam because I didn't need HD movies(ala Sony) or HDR(Fuji EXR200). Shirt-pocket-fit, quality images, 10:1 zoom, macro, reliabilty and ease of use were my criteria and this camera fit them all. This is my 3rd Fuji point-and-shoot and the first two lasted a several years each, going through much abuse, travel and being handed down to other family members.  Picture quality is very good, I use mostly the Program Mode, occasionaly changing "film Simulation" or the ISO range.  I like a camera where I can control the exposure and focus point and with this camera I almost always can.  The only thing missing is manual focus. I've taken about 750 pics with this cam in the month I've had it and highly recommend it for quality, versatility and ease of use in a pocket camera.ONE YEAR LATER:  Well, i finally broke this thing-too much hay, dust and drops.  but i'll still give it 5 stars. i got 6000 shots out of it+Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCDmovies.  it is NOT a set-and-forget point and shoot but after a few weeks i found it easy to switch in and out of exr, change iso's, turn the macro or flash on or off or even switch to manual without missing a shot. i was especially impressed with the quality of macro shots, less impressive at full zoom. i used this camera primarily in program at fixed iso 100, occ. in exr for the HR or HD. in auto400 images start to look processed but are still suitable for web albums.  in my opinion NO digital except DSLR is suitable for prints over 5X7in.THREE YEARS LATER: I replaced this camera with a Finepix F80EXR, basically the same features but 12MP instead of 10MP. It's at 16,000 pics, plus videos. It's starting to show wear and occasional glitches but still reliable enough to be my carry-it-everywhere camera.
