I got this thing on special at $... That came with a 32m flash card free on promotion.When I finally received this baby, I just could not put it down. I played with it until I could not find anything to photograph.It's fairly easy to figure on the buttons as well, without having to read the manual. I started taking picture and transfering them to my notebook before I even read the manual.The manual is very nice written, precise and written in an easy to understand language. Once I read the manual, which took less than an our, I was using my Coolpix 2000 like I have owned it for a year.This scene modes make it easy to take quality pictures under any type lighting. With the right sceme mode, I have yet to take a picture that's too bright or too dark.The red eye reduction works pretty well too. I turned off all the lights at my place and took pics of my girfriend in the dark. The results were good. I noticed though that from the side it does not work too lekker. Anyway, it's red eye redution not elimination.I did not use the software that came with the camera. I think it's not necessary if you're using Windows XP. It's just another package that fills up much needed drive and memory space.The LCD display is very clear, even under bright light. The screen updates very quickly as well, so you can move the screen around a lot and still not have to wait while it catches up.For an amateur, this camera is an excellent buy. It pretty much does everything for you and still takes excellent quality pics. I was not too impressed with the sticker that Nikon has put on the front of the camera and I could do without th noise from the zoom lens.
