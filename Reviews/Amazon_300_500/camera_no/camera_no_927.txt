I ended up returning the Casio EX-H10 (a great camera but not great HD video) after seeing the examples of this camera's HD video on YouTube.  I spent a lot of time comparing and testing this camera alongside the Casio.VIDEO:Great HD Video quality with a good modern codec (AVCHD), but I would have preferred the more-accessible H.264 codec (i can open AVCHD files with Windows 7's Media Player, but they don't scale to the right size?  VLC manages to play them only part of the time).  There are good examples of the movie quality on YouTube, although the videos I shot fell just a tad short of what I expected being a tad grainy and dark.  Very nice that the camera can zoom while shooting video - the sound just barely gets picked up in the recording.  Stereo audio is also a great feature, as well as the mini-HDMI port.PICTURES:The pictures are grainier than the Casio H10 I was also testing and the camera doesn't handle low-light as well, but they come out extremely sharp and really capture the details (I can shoot my bookshelf from across the room and read most of the titles on the photo).  The 12x zoom is amazing for the compact size.BATTERY LIFE:This camera's battery life is one of its greater shortcomings.  The camera I tested along with this one, the Casio EX-H10, gets 1000 shots/charge and this Panasonic only gets 300 or so.OTHER:It's a minor thing but I am glad this camera is flat on the bottom so you can take stable non-flash shots off a table without a tripod.  I also wish there were more manual controls but most people won't miss that.  The interface is pretty good but could be more descriptive, and I'm not a huge fan of the mode-dial at the top.  I wish this camera used mini-usb instead of a proprietary jack.
