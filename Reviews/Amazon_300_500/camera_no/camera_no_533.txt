Just got this camera on May 31, 2002, there were not many reviews so I vowed I would respond when I had made a quick review of the product. Here goes:Camara came with the non-lithum batteries, but I have used the ones in the box now off and on for two days. It was very intimidating with all the multiple books included, but mostly that's because they duplicate each book for each language.  It took me about an hour to feel comfortable shooting the camera, but I took several pictures in the first 10 min.  Camera feels solid, light and comfortable.  The LCD menu is intimidating and I think I will still have to do more research, but it looks promising for advance features. The panarama works with the card that comes with it, so use it for just those shots, cause it won't work on any other smart media cards like the free one that was given with the promotion. I went out and took two dozen pictures of my chickens on the free media card and never got to the end.The quality of the pictures are excellent, especially for web design or email.  Printing I haven't done on the good quality paper but appears that it could successfully accomplish that also.Overall I found the auto light and point and shoot ability with this camera great...even went outside at dusk and took great shots.  The software is fair, but I fell back on JASC Paint Shop. The connection was exactly like connecting an external USB external hard drive and works the same so you can drag and drop things to whatever location you prefer.If I come across any downs for this camera I will write an additional review.  But my conclusion is...  This is a great camera for my needs and most needs and is awfully fun to work.  Excellent for the price...and if it last for a good long while I will be tickled to death.
