I passed up the Canon Powershot SX200IS because it didn't have optical zoom when taking videos.  The ZS3 had everything I was looking for--sharp pictures, long zoom, great video with optical zooming and stereo sound, small size, wide angle, etc., except the picture quality is not so good.  I tried out this camera at my grand niece's birthday party and everyone came out pale-looking especially when I used the flash.  I tried out all the settings and compared the images side by side with the images I took with my old Canon SD800IS, and the Canon beat out the Panasonic except for the sharpness--the Panasonic do take sharp pictures. However the colors on the Canon came out more vibrant than on the Panasonic, which came out dull and washed out.  Sure the Panasonic takes sharp pictures and nice HD videos with stereo sound, but overall the still images to me are not good.  Also, the camera is too fragile to carry around without a case, I was always afraid of scratching the LCD or dropping it because of its smooth body.After two weeks of use, I returned the Panasonic to Amazon.  This is the third Panasonic camera that I had bought and returned because of poor image quality.  The first and second were the FX07 and FX50 two years ago, I see Panasonic's image quality has not improved much.  I guess I'll stick with Canon and wait until they come out with a new model that has everything that I'm looking for.
