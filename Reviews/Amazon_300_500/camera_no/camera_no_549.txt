like anything, its got its drawbacks.this is my first digital camera and i just LOVE it.  the picture quality is great!  what attracted me to the this particular model were the following:  the sony brand/reputation, the design (it's small, compact, and lightweight), the 3.2 MP, and the rechargeable batteries.  the batteries were definitely a priority for me.  also, i wasn't looking for a high-end model, just a digital camera for my own personal use.  i've read that this model is great for 4X6 and 5X7 pictures--  anything larger than that size and you'll see a deterioration in picture quality.  i researched and shopped around for about a month and a half before making this purchase... and i really think that this digital camera gives me everything that i want at a decent price.  now for the cons:  i was a little disappointed that the included battery charger took THIRTEEN hours to charge 2 batteries!  that's wayyy too long for anyone's liking.  also, the included memory stick is kind of flimsy.  right away, i knew that i would need to purchase another memory stick with a higher capacity as well as a case (i mean, you just spent a few hundred dollars, so you'll need to protect/preserve your investment).  i decided to buy the accessory kit acc-csnq (which comes with a case, two extra batteries, and a "super quick charger" which would take one hour to charge as opposed to the ridiculous 13 hours).  again, i was disappointed that the kit cost [so much], but i felt that i couldn't do much since that price didn't drop despite waiting another month before making this purchase.  seriously, this "kit" is just another way for sony to make more money.  overall, a GREAT digital camera, but with the much needed accessories, expect to slap on .. additional [money] to the bottom line price.  enjoy! :)
