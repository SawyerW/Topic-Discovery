I was looking for a good digital camera at a reasonable price.  The D-520 definitely fits the bill.  I wanted to make sure the camera I bought had enough features to keep me happy, but wasn't so complicated that my wife wouldn't use it.  This camera seems to fit the bill.  She can power it up and shoot away without worrying about changing any settings.  I like the 3X optical zoom, it gives you lots of options for framing a shot as you take it without losing resolution like you would cropping the picture later in your computer.  All of the pictures I have taken so far look great.The only down side to this camera keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the Camedia Master software that comes with it.  It doesn't allow you to do much but download pictures off the camera and put them in albums.  My biggest beef is that it appears that you can't change where the software stores it albums.  You can upgrade to the "pro" version of the software, which adds some nice features like being able to rename groups of pictures to one name root with a numbered extension ...Thankfully, the ability to drag and drop the pictures from the camera (it shows up as a removable drive on your PC) offsets this drawback.I would highly recommend this camera.  As with all digital cameras, you should invest in some good nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries and a good charger.  You may want to carry some spare charged batteries as well.  I also recommend getting more smart media cards as the included card is only 16 MB.  Some people recommend 128 MB, but since I don't like putting all my eggs in one basket (what if that card gets damaged or lost?) I recommend getting two 64 MB cards.  The price difference isn't that much, and you have a backup card in case on gets damaged.
