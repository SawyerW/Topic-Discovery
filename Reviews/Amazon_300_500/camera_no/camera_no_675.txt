I love this camera, I still use it, it's fun easy to use, fast, in expensive, BUT...There's that word again,Pentax makes some awesome gear.  Period.  There is no disputing that.  The problems are more around the ease of getting what you want.  If you want lenses or a flash, they simply don't have the selection of Canikon or the distribution channels.  If you are just getting this one camera and don't want to get into photography and you are only going to use the kit lenses then you can not beat this system.  even if you are going to use some of their awesome glass with the understanding that your pool will be limited then this is still great gear.  If you like to buy new toys and want to really get into photography then this should be a standard disclaimer, buy the cheapest canon or nikon that is new on the market set aside the money you saved by not blowing your budget.  Use it for a month then go down to ritz and try to figure out what gizmo will help you with the shots you've been having trouble with(faster lens, a flash, fast telephoto, these may not make sense now, but after you've played with the camera and talked to some other shooters or read a couple magazines and reviews it'll be clear what you need for your style of photography.).  With the weaker supply chain you really can't try stuff out as easily.Like I said the camera is great, but the availability and selection for lenses and gear just isn't up to snuff if you are taking up a new hobby.  That said I will use this camera for some time to come.  I was able to use a shade 13 welding plate to photograph the Venus transit earlier this year.
