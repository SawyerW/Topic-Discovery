Let me start off by saying that my last camera was a 3.5 MP and it was good for what I used it for but I let it bounce off the floor one to many times and it has died. That is when I started to look around for other easy to use good quality cameras. I looked at a lot of my friends cameras and started to read all the reviews.One of my friends had the Nikon L20 and he loved it. I tried it out too and loved it but I then found out that the L22 was replacing the L20. I asked around and found a friend that had the Nikon L22 and he let me use it for a weekend. What a very nice camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and then some. All the pictures and videos looked awesome to me and I did not have one problem with it at all. All the pics were sharp and focused. What more could you want? East to get batteries! Yup this camera uses AA batteries and I had a boat load of them. Everything in my house seems to use AA batteries so a long time ago I switched everything in my house to rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They last forever in this camera. Say if you were at a wedding or something and your batteries run out. Just go to your local corner store and get a few easy to find AA batteries or just bring a few extra from home. Life is easy for me. I hate the proprietary batteries that come with most cameras. The other good thing about this camera is it uses standard SD and SDHC memory cards. I got a 8GB SDHC card for $19.00 bucks. It gave me something like 2,200 available pics to take at 12MP. Needless to say I purchased this camera in sliver from Amazon.com and I take it everywhere with me. Remember it is a $100.00 dollar camera and not a $500.00 dollar camera. It doesn't have all the high end features like touch screen but it has everything I want and it takes really nice pics. I don't think you'll go wrong with the Nikon L22. Get it. Trust me :-)
