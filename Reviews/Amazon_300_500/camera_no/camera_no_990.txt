I've had this camera for about six months now.  I must confess it did take me a little time to understand the EXR modes but once I did I got some good shots.  And it took me some time to realize that the soft images I was getting was not due to an inferior lens, but the camera's preference for slow shutter speeds and small apertures.  When I used a tripod I got some really crisp images, but lugging around a tripod kind of defeats the benefits of using a compact camera.Anyway, I've got a little more than a thousand shots on it and it developed a hardware problem about two weeks ago.  When I turned it on the lens travelled all the way to it's maximum length and an error message appeared saying "focus error".  The lens would not retract when powered down.  All you could hear was a buzzing sound afterwards when either turning on or off.  I let it sit for a few hours and tried again, and it began working for no reason.  It functioned normally for about a week and then the same problem happened again.  This time it took almost two days of sitting on the shelf before it began working.  Same symptoms.The camera has never been dropped or abused. Or gotten wet.  I cannot trust it anymore and will not buy another one.  Time to buy a real camera, I'm afraid.Overall, I did benefit from the camera because it forced me to think about the choices it offers in exposure modes.  It makes you feel like an integral part of the picture taking process, and your decisions will make or break the results.  It is not, in my opinion, a good camera for those who seek an idiot-proof camera but will help you become a better photographer if you are willing to make the effort.
