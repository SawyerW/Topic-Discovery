Bottom line:  Fuji has come up with what I'd say is probably the best low light point and shoot camera on the market at the moment.Low light photography has, until very recently, been a real challenge for camera manufacturers.  Nikon's pro level SLR cameras (the D300, D700 and D3) revolutionized low-light digital photography for those willing to shell out a few grand (or more) for the privilege.  I shoot with a D300 and I'm still amazed at how well it makes use of the available light.Point and shoots cameras, while increasing the number of megapixels, have fallen short on low light performance.  You're left with either unviewable noisy images or forced to use an onboard flash with a very limited range.  Even the much loved Panasonic LX-3 suffers spotty low light performance.Fuji's new camera does not best my Nikon (it really shouldn't considering it's a fifth of the price) but it certainly does better in low light situations than I've seen a camera in this class do.When conditions are right images are balanced with very little noise.  Pushing the envelope too far, unfortunately, results in images that suffer a bit from the camera's oversampling.  They're not as bad as other cameras might be in similar situations, but they aren't something you'll want to have printed either.  In other words, a dark ballroom won't work, but indoor rooms with some ambient light will do pretty well.I do suggest playing with the manual settings extensively.  There are a bunch of menus to go through to get it perfect but the results are far better than the camera's own automation.  It's also a great way for beginners to learn more about exposure!My only disappointment is the very limited movie mode.  If you're looking for a camera that does great stills and HD video, look elsewhere.  Video is limited to SD 640x480 and is length limited.  Video is such an afterthought on this camera that Fuji even left it out of the marketing materials.
