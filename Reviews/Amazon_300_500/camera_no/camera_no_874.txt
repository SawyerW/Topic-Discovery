Updated on January 23, 2010: Returned it because AVCHD-Lite is too painful to work with. We (I and my daughter) tried all the solutions listed on websites including HandBrake and talked to Apple geeks in the store, and tooled around till it was not worth our time. I was finding that the captured video was starting to get locked inside Panasonic PhotoFunStudio even on my Vista laptop. It never made it to iMovie on our Mac. As the box says, it is iPhoto compatible, and just barely.original review:I have owned this camera for a few weeks and have many positive and negative aspects of it to share with others considering this.Pros- 12x optical zoom on video and stills makes for a lot of sins, easily a steal at this price and form factor- The image stabilization is good- It is an excellent combination of features for the price if you can live with/get around the cons below- HD video (even if it is "Lite") and HDMI connection to TV are good thingsCons- slightly dim (easily fixed through light fill in photo editing software) indoor pictures- AVCHD "LITE" confuses software on PC and Mac alike. On the PC using the FunStudio, I had to instruct it to play video at normal speed before the choppy (2 fps) playback went away using one of the preferences menus in th software. On the Macbook Pro my daughter has tried both iMovie and Handbrake. iMovie import played the video too fast and she is still trying to figure out how to use Handbrake to get around this. Any help much appreciated!- So to get around it we have switched the camera to record in the format its manual suggests as the PC-friendly one" Motion JPEG. The cards fill up too quickly and the videos (even short ones) take too long to acquire and then the .MOV files end up in the photo folder rather than the video folder. FunStudio will not even play back the video on the PC without first installing Quicktime!
