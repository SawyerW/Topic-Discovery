I was shocked when I started taking pictures because they were so clear and true to color.I'm pretty familiar with point and shoots as I've had several Canon's and while they did a good job of taking clear pictures, I think the Panisonic come out crystal clear, with more realistic color than the Canon's.I just returned a Canon T1i to Costco for a refund because while it took great picures, I didn't want to lug it around with me on my touring bike or fly to Portland to take pictures of my new grandson.  So far, I've only shot about 100 pictures and a short movie.  I just love my results and I'm pretty picky.  No they were not all perfect but it was not the camera's fault...I hate reading instruction manuals so it was learn as you go.I will ad a few on the picture site within. One in particular is a morning sunrise of orange clouds outside my window, looking through the shutters...absolutely stunning color.The only slight complaint I have is the location of the picture taking button itself, I think it should be on the end where the zoom is but it's not a big deal.I love all the different settings especially night scenes and snow settings.  Snow has always been difficult for me with DSLR's and while I have not shot anything in snow yet, I'm expecting geat results.In many ways it is not fair to compare this to a DSLR especially one of Canon's fame and it's a good product and I would recommend any Canon product but I just love this camera and can not find any faults with it or the movies which by the way are as good as if not better than the ones on my Canon discussed above.If you're looking for a great small point and shoot with a 3" screen this is the only way to go with a Lecia Lens.
