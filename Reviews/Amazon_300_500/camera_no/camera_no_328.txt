I did a lot of research on the type of camera I wanted to upgrade to, and everytime I looked online and read reviews I kept comming back to this camera. I finally talked my husband into buying it for christmas for me. To my surprise it is eveything I hoped and more. The auto feature and the exr feature is very easy to use. the auto mode even gives you the option on choosing your ISO if you want. to use this camera though I think you have to do some research on how to use ISO, Shutter speed and apeture modes. But that is what makes the camera kinda of a hybrid. It is really a in between camera (between a reg point and shoot and a DSLR). The pictures are soo much better than my five year old point and shoot kodak camera. The camera is light, the body is big but not as big as the canon rebel. The flash is ok, but I guess that's why it comes with a hot shoot too. The battery seems to last a very long time, days. I havn't tried video yet, but that wasn't the main purpose for me buying the camera. The camera comes with a small manual but to really learn all the functions of each mode you have to down load the cd it comes with and read the full manual. overall I think this camera is a great camera for me. I wanted a point and shoot because I'm a beginner camera user but I also wanted to play with features that a DSLR had, in hopes that one day I may get a DSLR. I would recomend it if you are interested in going beyond a point and shoot camera but are not yet willing to commit to a spending big bucks for a DSLR.
