I saw this camera at CES a few years ago when I was shopping around for a higher resolution pocket camera. (My previous cameras Fuji 2600z 2.1mpxl & Fuji E900 9.0mpxl).It makes the perfect camera for everyday use in a compact size with simple easy to use functions. The screen is large enough my parents can actually use it without squinting. Though they do fumble a big because it is tiny to hold. But because it only has 1 large shiny button up top, even your drunken friends can take quality pictures.This little digcam is quick loading enough for my camera to take pictures that no one thought you would be able to capture(papparatzi-style). I've taken over 76k shots and haven't had any problems with it. Takes great shots in daylight or nighttime w/flash.The best part about this camera is that a normal person probably won't even need another battery. If you do it will only cost $10-20. If you shop around a 2mb SD cards are $10/ea. On a 2mb card you can take ~594 photos.The Good: quick to turn on & take pictures, excellent night/club people shots, super-bright large screen, long battery life, awesome video + sound, easy to use functions, can take pictures less than 2seconds in between(w/flash), edit any part of the video while on the camera, quick loading/saving data, view pictures by date, adorable body color.The Bad: some of the settings are reset when you turn off the camera, has trouble capturing focused shots of racecars in action, indoor shots w/out flash witll produce a super grainy pics, macro focus starts around 4-5"+, no viewfinder. Keep the image stabilization on or you are going to be in for some trouble.Easy to Use, simple & that takes nice shots... at the right price. The next step up would be a Canon(which produces more balanced skin colors).I have no regrets about this purchase whatsoever as a cute little daily use camera!
