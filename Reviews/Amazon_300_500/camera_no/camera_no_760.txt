I am not a pro photographer, but I do enjoy taking pictures and video every chance I can get.  I had an Olympus 3x 3mp digital camera that I had been using for a number of years with no complaints except the zoom power.  I always wished I had more.  I had also been using a JVC camcorder for a number of years with no complaints also, but definately wanted to upgrade to a digital camcorder.  I had been checking on digital camcorders for the last year and couldn't quite decide on any one particular brand, I kept seeing pro's and con's for every camera.  So when I came across this Kodak Z812IS, it seemed it had everything I had been wishing for, in one unit and at an exceptional price.  I checked it out alot and really couldn't find any con's against it so I got it.  WOW, it takes amazing pictures, of course, but my biggest surprise was the video capability.  I bought an 8g memory card, so I would have plenty of room for both video and pictures.  And it definately has a lot of space for both!  The first thing I noticed about the video, is the stability.  The gel suspended chip technology gives an absolutely exceptional video.  It looks as though I am video recording on a tri-pod.  Amazing, is the best word I can to describe this camera.  All the features it comes with and the advanced technology, you cannot find a better deal for this price range.  When you purchase this camera, I recommend at least a 4g or 8g memory card, so you can use the video to the full extent.  I also bought the rechargeable batteries and charger.  My pictures are sharp, my video is clear and stable with good sound, the software it comes with is easy to use with Windows XP (I don't know about VISTA).  I highly recommend this camera, in fact I have three other family members who now want one too.
