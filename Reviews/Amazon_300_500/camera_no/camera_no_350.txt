I own a Sony Cybershot 7.5 mp that I bought in 2007. The Sony CS is a great digital camera. It was over $200 dollars at the time and I still use it today. I purchased the Nikon Coolpix L22 digital camera as a gift for my Mother after she asked me to have several ziploc bags full of old camera film developed. I am mostly happy with the Nikon. The camera is user friendly and the zoom options are easy to use. The Nikon L22 takes 2 AA batteries instead of using a battery pack. Which I think is better for beginner camera users. The pictures are of good quality but still lacking a certain crispness that you would expect from a "12.0 mp camera. My Sony SC ($200+) is only a 7.5 mp and the pictures look better than the Nikon.  The easiest way to shoot pics is to use the easy-auto setting. The digital flash can get annoying as it seems to need a good 10-15 seconds to "recharge". This can get really old when you are trying to capture say; a sunset or someone opening a gift. What I'm saying is: When timing counts; it sucks to have to wait. Now, the video. The video is terrible. I don't know what Nikon did to mess up the video so bad but it isn't pretty. The options for video output are limited. Standard tv 640 and 320. The color of the video is severely altered and blues will come out green. It also tends to look majorly "overlighted".Imagine you were filming on a stage under stage lights. Bright stage lights. Yeah, bad. So, for the price (around $70). I can't complain too much. If you are switching from an old camera to digital cameras then this would be a good first buy. If not, then get something of higher quality.I would suggest the Sony Cybershot. (Surprise, surprise)I guess I had already been spoiled by a greatly superior camera but hey: "What do you expect for $70"?Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W180 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3x SteadyShot Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Silver)
