but the performance is below par. Firstly, this camera has many great features (manual control of apeture, shutter speed, exposure compensation, flash brightness, and much more). It's fairly simple to learn how to manually change these features to fit the situation you're photographing. The camera design and on screen menus are user friendly, and the camera has a very solid feel to it (probably can take abuse well). Unfortunately, over the 3 days and 200 pictures that I had this camera, I don't think I had a single picture that I was impressed with. Most all of them were fuzzy, some of them blurry, or the white balance was incorrect, some of the pictures even had noise in them...and I tried almost every type of lighting condition possible, with tweaking every feature the camera had every time. I believe the problem lies with the autofocus. It's slow, irritably slow...and this camera has trouble focusing on many types of objects (dark, shiny, brightly lit). Should I have to use the auto focus lock every time? I don't think so. In auto mode, I get the same result in picture quality, even though the camera is supposed to set everything on its own. Also in auto mode, the flash is way to bright (thermo-nuclear bright), but can be toned down in manual mode. Finally, the LCD view-finder is noticeably laggy, or jumpy...which would be a problem when trying to snap a fast moving object, where you would have to snap the picture slightly before it was in the center of the view-finder to compensate. Now I've read great user reviews about this camera (which is why I bought it in the first place), but I honestly can't say anything near what anybody else has said. Traded in for a Fuji Finepix 3800 (close equivalent) and have had no problems so far at all (look for review soon). Well hope this helps anyone considering this camera!
