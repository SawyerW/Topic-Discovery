For the vast majority of the snap-shooting public, this tiny gem is probably the only camera that crowd will ever need.  I see people on once-in-a-lifetime vacations using those throw-away cameras to capture life-long memories on 4X6 prints. If only they had this camera and a decent sized memory card, they and their memories would be much better served. I have made 5X7 prints from mine and they are excellent. The 4X6 prints look like they could have been shot with a Nikon or Leica. In fact, I do magazine photography with my 35mm cameras but recently shot a MOMA gallery opening with the Elph (only camera I had with me). The shots we so good, they went into a national magazine. The 2X zoom, while adequate for parties and such, isn't wide enough in tight spaces. (Most people who want the 3X zoom Elph crave reach on the telephoto end - I crave my coverage on the wide end!) The software and cables included to download from the Elph are adequate but if you buy a USB card reader, you can do your image transfers without tying up the camera. The size is perfect so you can take it anywhere and the battery life is surprisingly good. I did get a spare battery but have not needed it. I also bought a 128Mb compact flash card so I can shoot at max resolution and not have to worry about running out of "film." If you don't have a Digital Camera yet, get this one and you'll be hooked. - Here is a July 2003 update: Canon has improved this model with a 3 megapixel and 4 megapixel model. I tested the 4 MP version side by side with my 2 MP and could not see a quality difference in a 4X6 print. Thought you should all know!Go check out the Canon G5 - better in every way and the prices are dropping! A real bargin.
