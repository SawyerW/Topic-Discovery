Before digital cameras I used to carry a Olympus XA with me almost everywhere.  When at work I carried it in my briefcase, when going out with friends it fit in my pocket, when backpacking or cycling it is as small as a pack of cigarettes with its detachable flash removed.  I took it everywhere for years.  I wanted something similar in a digital camera: small, rugged, and takes good pictures.Enter the Canon Digital Elph S200.  While small it is heavy for its size giving the impression of quality and durability.  I still have a lot of 35mm gear but face it; most of the time you are shooting snapshots that won't be enlarged above 4x6".  2 Megapixel looks just dandy on 4x6" prints even if you end up cropping.  When I'm shooting something I plan on blowing up I'll use my 35mm or even medium format gear; the rest of the time I use my little Canon.  I purchased a 128MB CF card which holds enough shots for entire vacations.The one drawback to this camera is the time it takes to autofocus a shot.  There are times when I'm trying to snap a picture when the camera "thinks" for as much as 10 seconds before firing.  You can minimize this by pre-focusing the camera before taking the shot but this is not a good camers to try to grab a quick shot.A month after I got my Elph S200 the Elph S230 came out.  The S230 also has a 2x optical zoom but 3.2MP resolution.  The S230 is also about $100 more expensive and an inch or so bigger.  This would be a camera to consider if you want a little more resolution for larger prints and don't mind it being a tad bigger.Except for the slow autofocus speed I'm thrilled with the Canon S200.
