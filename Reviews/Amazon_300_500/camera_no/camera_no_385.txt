I love the speed of picture taking with this camera and so far I've gotten no blurs, no dark pictures, and the color is great with the automatic setting.  There are a lot of options that you can set manually and setting them can be tedious and take awhile, but so far the color options (black & white, sepia, standard color, vivid color) and the setting options (I use the close-up macro and ISO the most but there are lots - beach scenes, fireworks, etc.) have been great once I get them set.I started with a really nice Sony compact camera but when I pressed the button it took two full seconds for the picture to take - way too long with moving children.  I have a nice Sony DSLR with better response time and my intention with a compact camera was something that takes quick, clear pix and fits in my purse so I always have it.  This Nikon responds as soon as I press the shutter button - probably less than a quarter second response time.I learned the hard way though - if you edit a photo on the camera and it says "please wait while camera finishes recording" DO NOT remove the battery to turn it off no matter how long it freezes up!  It was my first day with the camera and I did not know what it was doing, and it froze for so long that perhaps I had no choice, AND there were other pictures on the SD card I had used in a digital frame so perhaps that was my error.  I had to open the camera and pull out the battery to turn it off, and it corrupted every photo on the card, including the new ones I had just taken.  A quick reformat of the card (in the camera) and it is now working fine.
