I have had the Lumix DMC-ZS3 only a few days- hardly enough to qualify as an expert user yet-but I would like to mention my first impressions and comment on a few negatives that I read elsewhere during my research. The Leica wide angle/telephoto Zoom lens is a miracle of engineering. The 12X telephoto is impressive in so small a package, but even more useful for me is the 25mm (equivalent) wide angle. It is able to focus quickly and quietly from a few inches to infinity. Using the wide angle setting and aiming it lengthwise from the end of a 30x15 ft room it shows both long walls from about 12 ft in front of the camera. No more missing Uncle Henry and Aunt Edna at opposite edges of those big group pictures! In that same room with no ambient light the flash filled the room from front to 28 feet back with exceptionally bright and even illumination. So much for the weak flash complaint- this little camera provides the best flash depth and uniformity I have ever seen. I haven't had enough time to judge battery capacity, but in my few days of informal testing the battery seems to hold up well. I will carry the little charger on trips until I get a sense of how many photos the battery will provide between charges. I concur with the other user comments about high build quality and ease of use as a point and shoot camera for the non tech users. On the IA (intelligent automation) setting together with the good image stabilization it is very hard to get a bad picture. Oh yes- The mode selection dial is nicely detented to stay where you set it- but I guess it could be inadvertently switched by careless handling. With it's big bright screen, multi mode selections for the more technically minded, and even HD video capability it's hard to think of what could be improved. Overall- I find it to be an outstanding camera with no noticeable flaws. I am very glad I chose it for my wife to easily pick up and use and for me to share.
