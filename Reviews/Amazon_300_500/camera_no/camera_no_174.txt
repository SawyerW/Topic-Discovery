I think my title says it all.  Here is a good basic INDOOR security camera.  It's not an outdoor camera (there is a outdoor camera available, but this is not the one), and it comes with the monitor and software.  It's wireless, so that you do not have to run wires through  the house, however you cannot plug it into an extension or surge protector.It does take time to setup.  Put aside a good hour if not longer unless you are well aware of computers and setting up this type of camera.  IMHO with anything new, I set aside a good hour to do a setup as things almost always do not go according to plan, then I try to rush and do more wrong and things go from bad to worse. So set aside time.There are some subscriptions you have to pay extra for if you wish.  It'll all work without it (like recording and looking back), but again you do not have to.  Personally I think a year should be included in the initial setup.Some ideas for this system could be a baby monitor or indoor security system to keep it focused on a room.Also, it does not have night or low light vision.  But again they do sell cameras here at amazon to go with the system.When setting it up, you'll want to do a manual check for new versions and upgrade as especially when you're upgrading you want to have the most recent version.  And in the future, manual checks for upgrades tend to work better than auto.  But again, set aside time.Now keep in mind the camera itself is basic.  It's not high quality to give details.  You can purchase high quality cameras, but they cost money.  Do a search for security cameras and see the prices.  For all you get here, this is well worth it.  Even with the extras you may wish to pay for, it's not a bad deal.
