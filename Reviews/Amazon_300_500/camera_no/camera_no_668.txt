I have owned a Pentax K100D for over three years and acquired several additional lenses.  Building on my earlier investments was important to me.  While I have not really explored all the new features of my K-x, these are my initial reactions.The Kx is marginally smaller.One of the features that I liked in the K100D, a separate settings display panel has been removed.  It did not take long to get use to activating a settings display on the viewing display panel.  My only concern is the additional drain this may create on the batteries.The battery utilization seems improved.  I transferred two sets of my rechargeable  AA batteries to the K-x and I seem to be getting more pictures on each charge than I had been with the K100D.Since I shoot all my pictures in the RAW format; I was worried about the storage demands imposed by the 12 megapixel images of the K-x compared the 6 megapixel images of the K100D.  It has turned out that there is much more variation in the size of the Pentax RAW formatted images on the K-x.  As a result the RAW files created by the K-x up to this point range between 12 and 19 megabytes.  The average is about 15 megabytes.  With the K100D most images were very close to 10 megabytes in size.  If this holds up I'm getting images that have twice the resolution with only a 50% increase in file size.I was also pleasantly surprised that the programs that I use to process my digital image (Bibble 5 and Paint Shop Pro X2) did not bog down when handling the larger files.  If there is any slow down in processing time associated with the larger images, it has seemed negligible so far.I've had no problem in using my third party lenses with the new camera.After only a couple hundred images on the K-x, I am satisfied that I has met all the expectations that I had when I purchased it.
