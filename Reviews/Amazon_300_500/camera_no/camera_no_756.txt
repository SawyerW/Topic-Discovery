I have been using a digital SLR Minolta for two years and I have not used one of these point and shoot digital cameras so please read my review based on these. Maybe some or all of these features are already in other point and shoot cameras.To sum it up, I think this is a very good value for all the features you get.Features I like:-I like several pre-programmed best shot features. It has best shot modes such as high sensitivity, business cards, night portrait, old pics. Amazing.-The video quality is so so but for a camera like this I think it is good. After all it is a digital camera not a video camera. I am happy with it. It has features like short video that captures 4 secs before and 4 secs after you click the shutter. I have not tried it yet but I think it uses a buffer memory to do this. Amazing. You do not worry about clicking the shutter too late.-It has auto frame function. It follows the focused person if (s)he moves. I have not used the face recognition feature yet.-It is very intuitive and easy to use. Options are easy to access.-If you buy it online the price is very good for a camera like this-It is small, easy to carry.The things to watch out:-I think the hand strap is weak and looks cheap-It looks like (I am not sure) this is thicker than other Exilims. It still is a small camera.-Most of the information is on the CD provided. Paperback Manual provided gives only basic info to operate.-It seems like there is a slight lag after you click on shutter and while it is writing on the memory. I am used to my digital SLR I guess.Overall I am very happy with it. I'd recommend it.
