I make jewelry and needed a camera that could take crisp, true-color, very close-up pictures of the tiny details AND be affordable and easy to use. This meets all my expectations and more. I originally bought another camera that was around the same price and had good reviews because it had 12x optical zoom. Luckily, the salesman showed me this camera and the difference in close-up shots of the same thing - the logo on his shirt, actually. I couldn't believe how much better this tiny little camera was when it came to capturing the details and colors of every stitch compared to this other camera with supposedly more zoom power. He said it was because this is the new generation -- tiny with a better lens and processor. I returned the first one and happily played with my new camera, easily taking shots in all light conditions, action shots of the kids, black & white or sepia, movies without sound, etc. I even took a picture of my son in his daycare class through the thick glass window with diamond-shaped metal wire inside it (it's on an army post, so, of course, security glass is everywhere) and instead of focusing on the wire inside the glass like every camera I've ever had before would have done, this took a clear picture of the room. He was the only person in the shot and I was able to zoom in digitally later on with the "crop" option and get a clear picture of how excited and cute he looks when he first sees Daddy coming to pick him up at the end of the day. Priceless! This will also help me sell my jewelry since now I live so far from my friends and family who want to buy it, but would like to browse through and find exactly what they want before sending me some money based on a blurry picture and my description. I also found that it's so small and the battery lasts so long (it was like 2 weeks before I had to recharge it), I just carry it in my purse so I never miss a picture-worthy moment anymore. I just can't rave about it enough!
