If you are looking for a versatile, relatively inexpensive 3 megapixel digital camera, the Olympus Camedia D-550 is a very nice selection.  It takes good pictures, the Camedia software has greatly improved over earlier versions, and transferring pictures is especially easy using Windows XP (Home version).  One of the neat things about the camera is the ability to let you choose what equivalent film speed you want to use.  The "faster" the film (i.e., the higher the ASA number), the less light you need, but the grainier the picture.  I took a few pictures at dusk in the San Diego harbor using an equivalent ASA of 400 and got some terrifically colorful, but grainy shots.That said, there are some aspects of this camera that are annoying.  Nothing that cannot be dealt with, but it's still annoying that you have to deal with them.First, the flash pops up EVERY time you open the camera lens.  I don't know why this is so annoying, but it is.Second, the camera defaults to a HQ (high quality) resolution that is not the best resolution.  You have to change that manually.  The problem is, every time you shut off the camera, it resets to the default setting again.Third, the default setting on digital zoom is off.  Again, you can change it manually, but guess what?  Every time you turn off the camera, it goes back to the default on the digital zoom as well.Fourth, the instruction booklet is skimpy on information.  If you like playing with this toys, this may not be a bad thing; but it would be nice to have more information on how to use all of the features.In summary, this is not always a user friendly camera, but if you overlook those flaws (which just require you to keep on your toes), this is a very good camera.
