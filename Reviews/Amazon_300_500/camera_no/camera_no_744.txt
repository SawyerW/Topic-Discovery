When you're looking at a camera, you rarely read much detail about the software.  The manufacturers only focus on the camera details.  While this a great camera, the software and limitations of the proprietary Easy Share program make uploading your pictures a terrible experience.  If you are happy with the Easy Share software, this camera will work fine for you.  However, if you are like me and prefer to use advanced photo editing programs, you will despise this camera.  Yes, it comes with a USB connection.  But Kodak has limited you so that ONLY the Easy Share software recognizes the camera to transfer pictures.  You cannot access the camera or pictures through My Computer, Windows Explorer, or any other photo software.  You MUST use the Easy Share program to transfer pictures, and then they go into Kodak "albums" in the software.  I did not believe this could possibly be true with a USB connection, but after spending 20 minutes on the phone with Kodak support, I was assured it was designed this way.  The camera will not be recognized by Windows XP or anything other than the Kodak Easy Share software.  Besides this being annoying, it is problematic if your software crashes and you have no other means to get your photos off your camera.It is cumbersome to continually switch the photo destination to this or that folder if you choose to organize them differently.  Kodak always wants to create a new folder within a folder.  It's truly awful.  The software also does not display the photo name, size, date taken, etc.  You can resize only by printed size (4x6, etc) as opposed to pixels.  For many users the software will be fine, but if you are accustomed to advanced photo editing, organizing, and so on, you will be severely limited.I am debating between returning my camera because of the software issues, or buying an SD card reader to read my pictures independent of Kodak's software.
