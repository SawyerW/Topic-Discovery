I purchased this camera through Amazon and was thrilled to get such prompt delivery on this beautiful little red digital camera.  I had ordered the camera thinking it would be simple to operate and would take better pictures than my previous digital camera.  Although the zoom was stronger and more megapixels, taking pictures from a distance is still very disappointing.  When trying to enlarge the pictures to print, they become fuzzy and a waste to process.On Veterans Day, I had taken quite a number of parade pictures and proceeded to download to my computer.  I had some older pictures on the memory card which had already been successfully downloaded to my computer. I was able to view all the new pictures I had taken on the camera, but when I plugged in the USB cable, no pictures would download except for the older pictures, about 15, which were still on the camera.  I called technical support about the issue, and he told me to take the memory card to a local store to process.  I did this, but the pictures were no longer on the memory card as the rep assured me they would be.  Somehow, the camera must have deleted all the important pictures I had taken.  This was very distressing to lose all my pictures.Also, the battery cover is extremely difficult to close.  What I had hoped for in a simple to use camera is a total disappointment with this Nikon. Included with the camera was a minimal instruction manual. A more complete instruction manual was in the form of an instruction CD that could be downloaded to the computer for reference.  This is totally unacceptable.  I questioned the tech support about this and he said it is part of the going green initiative not to send a printed version.This camera is a total puzzle to me as I have never had a digital camera that deleted pictures without my intentionally deleting them.  I am very distressed with this beautiful little camera, and hope that Amazon will allow a return on it.
