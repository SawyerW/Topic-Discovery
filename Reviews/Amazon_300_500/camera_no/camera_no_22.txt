I've owned this camera since it first came out.  I used the 20D for sports photography for the local paper as well as for pleasure/artistic photography.Let's start off with the strengths.  The camera is built like a tank.  Not a cheap plastic job.  Some people complain that the battery door is a little feeble but I've never had a problem with it in 8 years.The controls are well laid out.  It's very easy to change the ISO and to shoot aperture or shutter speed priority.  The menu system is easy to use and has all the controls a semi professional could use.Image quality is very good.  Good in low light, with usable shots up to 1600 ISO and perhaps 3200 ISO if you're pushing it.  The pop up flash works well as a fill flash.  The quality of the image is very dependent on the quality of the lens.  I've used some sharp prime lenses with great results, good results with better than average zooms.  Battery life is excellent.If I had only a few minor nitpicks I would say that the camera is heavy.  Very heavy to haul around all day on your neck.  Buy a good quality strap.  Lately I've been using a 40mm Canon pancake lens to keep the weight down with very good results.  Also, the 20D takes a CF card.  These days, most people would prefer SDHC card usage.If you can pick this camera up in the used market (cams in excellent shape go for $200-$300), then I would say your getting a great deal.  Don't get too worried about the fact it doesn't have 18 megapixels...the images stand up well to any other camera.  The better the glass, the better result.  Buy this camera body, then get some great glass.  If you can't afford Canon "L" glass, some cheaper and very usable alternatives are the Sigma 17-70, Canon 70-200 F/4 and the Canon 40mm pancake lens.This is a true serious amateur or semi-pro camera.  If you're a "pro" your probably looking at a full frame camera anyways, however this would work well as a great backup cam.
