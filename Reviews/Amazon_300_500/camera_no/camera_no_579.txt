A lot of fun playing around with the 330; I really like being able to connect it to my TV during a party and showing a slide show. Sounds can be associated with taking a picture or turning on the camera; you can download your own sound files. I shopped around a lot and all the camera's have some problem. The battery time is about 3/4 to 1 1/2 hours depending on using the LCD and the low battery warning is very short; the zoom is average for a 3X and the view hole is not overly accurate; also the macro feature is about average. But I could find more problems with the other cameras I tested. Overall, my family loves the camera and we use it a lot. Especially nice are the Sepia, Black/White, photo stitching, the LCD is about the best I've seen even looks good in bright and low light, memo feature is cool, the colors are very accurate and the pictures look great, it feels like a real camera not some piece of plastic. And best of all it fits in purse or bigger pants pocket.8/5 I've played with the camera for about 2 months now; in 1028x768 mode with super fine quality I can get 270 pictures on a 128meg card (49.00 Viking Card); I had Wal-Mart print 4x6 and 5x7s and they are perfect; they look better than my 35MM.I'm very impressed with the manual adjustments you can make; from the 50-400ISO to the lighting.  I took a hike in the Adrondack mountains and was able to adjust the lighting to take pictures in the forest.  The movie mode is very good but you can't rotate movies and the 320x200 is so so when displaying on a 35" TV.  One problem, downloading to my PC is extremely fast, about 150 pictures in 2 minutes but sending pictures back to the camera is painful at 10-20 seconds per picture, ouch; also you can not send AVIs back to the camera.Still a great camera.
