This camera is wonderful.  It's small, it operates smoothly, and the quality is spectacular.  Our previous camera was a Panasonic 6MP that my wife and I loved.  I purchased this for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it.  She was always partial to the Panasonic, (even when I sat on it and broke it at the park, she told me she didn't want a "newer, better model", she liked it so much, so we purchased an identical one).She liked this one from the words "Merry Christmas".  I didn't realize it was the same camera I had suggested that my mother-in-law buy (which she did, and loves it).Things I love about the camera:1) It is well balanced. -The megapixels, size, screen size, and ease of use make it a perfect point and shoot camera.  If you don't need a powerful zoom, then this is a great choice.2) The Image Stabilization makes for excellent pictures, clear and crisp.  (Sometimes that was not the case with the Panasonic, images tended to blur with slight movement)3) Taking a close-up is just as clear and crisp as regular photo. - I cook a lot, and I'm working on a cookbook with pictures.  Taking pictures of food is easy and wonderfully clear and crisp with this camera.  My previous camera took shot after shot, even on it's "closeup" mode.4) Quick startup. - Getting the perfect picture of our 2 or 6 year old can be all about timing.  You turn it on, in a matter of seconds, this thing is ready to go.5) Lighting is not a problem. - Light or dark, this camera performs.  The flash is not apparent on most pictures, and you get a nice and resolute photo with every snap.  The auto-focus feature is outstanding.I have not loaded the camera software as other users have, but I use a free Shutterfly software, and although it's either all or none, I just set it up and go do something else until all the pictures are loaded...after that, uploading to shutterfly and editing my pictures is a piece of cake.I love this camera!
