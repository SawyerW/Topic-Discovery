This is my first purchase of a digital camera although I have used both a SmartMedia and floppy disk-type digital camera. I was looking for a digital camera that was around $200 and I came up with this. I started at a great website that has reviews of most digital and non-digital cameras on the market. You can access them at [...] Choose a camera from the drop-down menu. They show you photographs of the camera you review from all angles (top, bottom, side, front and back) and they give you sample photos taken from that camera. They also have great reviews. I picked this camera over the Kodak and Fuji 1400 because of the features along with price. You either get 640 (Normal) or 1280 (Fine) resolution. You also get an easy-to-use timer. You also get a USB connector which is key when using this type of camera. You don't want a serial connector unless you want to sit at the computer for an hour while the photos download. The only problem I found with this camera (and knew this when I bought it because of the reviews I read) is the LCD screen. You really can't use it to take the photos because everything appears dark even in the lighter setting and the pictures have minimal quality on the playback feature. But, the rest of the camera makes up for the cheesy LCD panel. I used the viewfinder to take pictures and that worked fine. You can view the finished picture good enough on the screen to see if you want the picture or not. And, the quality of the photos is wonderful. It is worth the price. They also give you a hardcopy manual to use when figuring how to use the camera. The menus are a little confusing for a newbie but if you read the manual you can figure it out. And, to save money at Amazon.com go to Flamingoworld ([...]) and look for current coupons. I saved $50 on this camera with a coupon. Enjoy!
