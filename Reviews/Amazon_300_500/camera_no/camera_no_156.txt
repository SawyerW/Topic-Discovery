Still produces good to great images 7 years after introduction! Has some problems, like the mode dial that switches modes too easily in your pocket, has a 12mp mode that isn't really 12mp, and a 6mp mode that's a bit over-sharpened and overly compressed BUT nevertheless produces nice crisp, generally well-exposed images right out of the box. Doesn't over-expose as much as the F20 or F30 in my experience either. The 12mp Fine mode also produces an alternative to the more compressed and slightly over-sharpened 6mp mode but is a little noisier and softer. That can be corrected by downsizing the 12mp images to 6mp. Images are fairly noise-free for a compact camera, and even the ISO 800 setting, though not up to the quality of the F10 or F30, is pretty good, although only 3mp.This is all being picky as the 6mp images directly out of the camera are nicely "punchy", sharp, and have great colors, but in some situations having the 12mp Fine mode (or possibly the RAW mode, I have yet to try it) makes for better post-processing possibilities. There are some other minor oversights that the E900 corrected, like a live histogram and blinking highlights in playback mode that are lacking in the E550, but this camera is also faster in most respects than the E900 and is less expensive on the used market. Another accessory that I haven't tried yet is a lens converter; you can still get wide angle and tele add-on lenses for the E550 and the E510 on Amazon and eBay, and that may be true for the E900 model as well. Has all the manual modes you may want (wish it had a Custom setting mode too though!), shoots at over 3fps in burst mode, has manual focus if you need it (that could be easier to use though), and a flash you DON'T have to keep turning OFF, because it's a pop-up. All in all, still an exceptionally good value even after 7 years!
