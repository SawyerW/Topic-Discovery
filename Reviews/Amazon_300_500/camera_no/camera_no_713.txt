We just received received this monitor today. We bought it to replace our Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7" LCD Screen and 1.8" Handheld Unit. We have had the Summer Infant for about 3 years now. The main screen started going out so we decided to try something new. The thing we loved about the Summer Infant was the fact it came with 2 monitors (not cameras but the screen to watch the camera). This is important to us because we have the large one in our master bedroom and use the smaller one for babysitters (who stay the night when we are at work). When we get home from work we like to be able to still have the monitor in our room so we can check on our little guy. No other monitors seem to have this so we had to figure something else out. What lead us to this was the ability to view the cameras from Skype. Sounded like a great idea but here is the problem. The monitor must stay hooked to the computer in order to view it remotely. In my opinion it kind of defeats the purpose on why we purchased it. Set up is pretty straight forward pairing the cameras to the monitor and I love the ability to pan and rotate the camera. We also purchased an additional camera that we put in our upstairs loft. The quality of the picture seems to be good and the interference is much better than the Summer Infant was. Not sure if we are going to be able to keep this one because of the remote viewing issue. For anyone that this isn't important to you should love this monitor and I would recommend it. I will update the review as we live with it over time and hopefully I can figure out a way around the Skype issue.
