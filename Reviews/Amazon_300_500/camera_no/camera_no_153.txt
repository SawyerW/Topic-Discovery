We have had this camera now for about a month and we have been very impressed with it. It takes wonderful photos indoors or out and is for the most part point and click. It also has a very large LCD screen so it's easy to line up your shot - this makes up for the lack of a viewfinder on this model. This camera also does short videos (length depending memory available) as well as timer settings and a 3 shot sequence which are all easy to access while in photo mode.We use it to take family photos at events and just around the house and usually get great photos - when we don't it's usually because we hesitated when pushing the button or shook the camera a little. Otherwise the photos are clear and of great quality.There are some negatives, but they are to be expected from a 10 Mega pixel camera. For one, the battery life is a bit short, but a set of rechargeable batteries takes care of that - I recommend NiMh over NiCad.I was also concerned about being able to see the LCD screen in bright sunlight, and although it is not 100% clear at that time, it is still usable in my experience. The camera also has a battery saving feature that dims or turns off the LCD after a period of no activity, but keeps the camera ready to take a picture.The most important thing for me was that the camera had a memory card slot, and this one has an SD card slot inside the battery compartment. I currently have a 1Gb card in the slot and even at the highest settings, I can store 169 images on a single card.I would have to say that despite the low price, this is NOT a low price camera. I am very satisfied with it, and although you can not change out the lenses which I would like, it's far less expensive then a 10Mp SLR camera with excellent photo quality.
