The ZS3 gives you a lot for under $250. I was waiting to buy the new 12MP 2010 Panasonic ZS7 or the highly anticipated 10MP 2010 Sony HX5V but I just couldn't pass up a bargain. I almost went with the new Sony HX5V but the sample images on the web show the image quality to be noticeably lacking in detail compared to the ZS3. At full 100% view, the ZS3 retains detail and clarity that the new Sony just can't compete with (under lower ISO settings). I'm not waiting for the ZS7 because the sample images out there show that the extra 2MP degrades the image quality on such a small sensor, and it's gonna be $350 and up when it comes out. The ZS3's image quality is very comparable to the venerable Canon S90, you'd have to look hard to see that the S90 retains just slightly more detail.There are some slight issues which prevent me from giving it a higher score. The flash is rather weak indoors, below average. I find it has difficulty focusing in low light and has even more trouble focusing in macro mode. Some people complain about the lack of manual controls. You do get to set the ISO in certain modes but there is no way to control the shutter speed or aperture. This is no big deal as 95% of users don't understand those features. This is a really a true P&S; camera, buy something on the higher end if you want those controls or get a DSLR.I've been playing around the AVCHD video and while it's impressive for a compact camera it is definitely not a HD camcorder replacement. The CCD sensor shows streaks of vertical light in bright areas. It's useable in certain situations where you don't want to carry a camcorder. I find that the best way to deal with AVCHD is to use the free program txMuxer to combine your clips. Once it's combined into one large MTS file, you can use the free Handbrake to encode it into a high quality MP4 file that can be played on virtually any media player.
