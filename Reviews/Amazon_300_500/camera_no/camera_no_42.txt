This camera is a fast little camera with lots of nice features. It is a battery-hog however, so be sure to buy an extra battery or two for it. It takes around 2 hours to charge the lithium-ion battery pack to full capacity.The camera takes sharp pictures, but has a small amount of vigneting and slight barrel distortion at all focal lengths. These irregularities will not be noticed in most instances however. The onlt times they really become noticeable is when shooting bright plain subject like a light-colored wall or the sky, where the vignetting is seen, or when shooting architecture where the barrel distortion can be seen by a discerning eye.The contrast-based auto-focus is quick and precise in bright light, but tends to stumble and hunt in low light or low contrast situations.On the up-side, the camera offers true-colors and accurate white balance. The ability to put the camera in complete manual exposure mode is big plus for those who want to break-away from the novice auto-program scene modes. This little camera also offers a manual focus option, but with no real distance scale to go by, it is very limited for practical uses.The size of the camera is small and will fit in most any shirt-pocket without a problem. Easy to stow away and a great alternative to luggging a heavy and bulky SLR around when doing so would be inconvenient.The optical viewfinder is very small and dim, with no information displayed except for the focusing-brackets. The LCD screen makes up for it though, with a bright, sharp, easy to read display.The menu system is fairly simple and easy to navigate, making it a snap to change settings quickly. The advanced manual covers all the settings and how to change them, but is only on a disc in adobe .pdf format. A paper manual would have been much more convenient.Compared to the few other 7MP p&s; cameras available, the Olympus Camedia C-7000z is a feature-packed little camera for a decent price.
