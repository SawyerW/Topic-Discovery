Let me get one thing out of the way: the camera is great. It was priced very reasonably and is still what I consider to be best-in-class for inexpensive digital cameras.Here's why it was priced so reasonably:Shipping from the original order was slow but not terrible - we ordered three things from three different US-based Amazon merchants and this was the last to arrive by two full business days, taking 7 business days. The camera looked unused BUT it was clearly an open box item, and it was advertised as new. The charger included with the camera didn't fit the battery (and the battery fit the camera, so the charger was obviously wrong) so I contacted the seller (Tek Depot) for a replacement charger. They apologized and said they would be shipping a new charger. At this point they were still on track for a 4/5 star review at worst. I understand things can sometimes be confused at the point of shipping. However, a full 8 days later we had not received any charger or any notification of shipping (or delay), so I contacted them again and asked when it would be delivered. They replied that they had JUST ordered it, that it would be coming directly from the manufacturer, and they would be contacting me again when they had a tracking number for me. Eight days to process a replacement charger seems ridiculous to me. So we waited. And waited. Two more days later, I still had no tracking number and no communication, so again I contacted them and asked for my tracking number. Their reply was that it had been shipped USPS and therefore would have no tracking number. Regular mail after almost three weeks of having an inoperable camera? Inexcusable. We finally received the replacement charger - and it's a knockoff from China. (It works, but it isn't what they said they were having shipped.) We will never again purchase from Tek Depot, and the only reason this product receives TWO stars is that the camera is indeed superb.
