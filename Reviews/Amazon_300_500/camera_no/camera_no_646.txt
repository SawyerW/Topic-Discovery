I got mine from bestbuy for about 300 bucks and I'm really satisfied with it, 2 megapixels are just enough to make a good quality photo without having to buy an aditional hard drive for all them pictures (if this is your first digicam trust me you gonna make hundrets of them). Its easy to use point and shoot camera but it still has quite few features and settings that will make that special shot just perfect. Its small metal body fits to any pocket so you can take it with you anywere. A biger memory stick is a must, trust me it will fill up fast.Not to long ago I also purchased an LCM-PX carying case which is also great, it's small, fits the cmera perfectly, you can ware it on your belt like a beeper or a celphone and when the oportunity comes you'll never miss that great shot. I cary mine every where I go, not only when I go on a trip.The two things that made me buy this purticular camera are: #1 it's made by SONY, In my life I owned many electronic gadgets and sory to say most of them had some kind of a defect or broke down after a regular use, not so with SONY products, I had them for longes time and they take on any kind of abuse I throw at them. #2 for a tiny camera like this SONY packs it with all kinds of features other cameras don't have like Super HAD CCD (an image sensor that makes a 2 megapixel camera seem more like a 4), or a AF Iluminator (helps out focusing in less them perfect liting conditions), and ofcours SONY has the best movie mode out there. So stop thinking about it and just get it, for your self or as a gift to others (trust me they won't be disapointed)
