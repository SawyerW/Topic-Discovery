This camera has met my expectations in so many ways.  I should note I never really wanted to start looking for a new camera when I started looking for this one, but a camping trip (where I actually stored my camera in the tent!) sent my Canon to its grave.  This was the second digital camera I'd lost to outdoor exposure.  No more.  I'm now a loyal Olympus fan.Thus far, my Olympus has been through the rain and cloud forests of Costa Rica, through several feet of freshly falling snow in Romania, and on many a camping trip and trail.  And I'm just as happy with it as day one.The images are crip and clear, it fits perfectly in my jean pockets, and I like the fact that the lens withdraws within the camera to avoid scratches.  Battery life has been outstanding.  It seems to be such an issue with so many electronic devices, but I've found that I can take hundreds of pictures with my 810 without a hitch.  Now that I think about it, on my recent trip to Romania, I was snapping away with the camera without an electric converter or spare battery and never ran out of batteries over my 11 days.At first I was a little disappointed that I couldn't find a weatherproof camera with a viewfinder, but I've become very used to the LCD digital display as of late, and it hasn't proven a problem.If there is one thing that I would like to change about this camera, it's the curved edges.  Sure, they look good.  But say you want to take vertically-oriented image in the middle of the night?  You can't set the camera on a level surface with the curves edges on the sides (and you can't hold it in your hands, or the image will blur due to the long exposure), though you can shoot horizontally.  I guess I could get a tripod, but this is a point-and-shoot camera...And if the worst I can do is to complain about a camera's ability to shoot a particular orientation in the middle of the night...not bad, right?
