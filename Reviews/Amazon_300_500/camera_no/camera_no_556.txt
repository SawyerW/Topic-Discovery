After carefully reading through literally hundreds of reviews on the 2 megapixel digital cameras with optical zoom out there at this time, and a visit to two stores to play with them in person, I decided on the Canon Powershot A40. This is why: the camera body is sturdy and it is easy to hold and shoot. It looks like a normal camera so fits in most point-and-shoot camera bags. The camera is also small enough to fit in the pocket of most cargo pants. It has many accessories available and has upgradable lenses. The camera is somewhat intuitive to use once you know what the symbols for the buttons indicate- all of them are multifunctional. The only downsides are that the knob is a little less than ergonomic and the manual is horribly organized. The camera itself is fantastic overall. It does eat batteries quickly when connected to the computer for downloading, but on the road it is very conservative (I reccommend buying the ac adapter for downloading unless you have an unlimited supply of batteries). The optical zoom flows smoothly into the digital. The software is very easy to use and you will definitely find it useful. It also comes with a lite version of Adobe- which is a great piece of software to have on it's own.What about the pictures? The pictures are fantastic! The shots are much more akin to a manual 35 mm camera than a point-and-shoot. The colors are very vivid. You'd never be able to take shots like this with a regular camera. It can take a picture in a darkened room and make it as clear as if the lights were on. All together this is a great camera and I'm glad I bought it! I highly reccommend you consider it too!(Aside, Amazon.com has better prices than ALL the retail stores, it's trustworthy and just as good as most internet stores/auctions so I suggest you buy it here.)
