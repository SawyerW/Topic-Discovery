The only thing which could make me happier would be having a 500mm telephoto lenses for my nature/birding photography!I was waiting for Pentax to start producing digital-SLRs to compete with Nikon and Canon. Main reason: to be able to use the k-mount lenses in which I'd invested since the 1980s. Even my manual telephoto lens fits and functions with the *ist DS. I'm quite pleased with the shorter zoom lens which came with the *ist DS deal i found via Amazon.com.Inspiring, creative, and good digital photography starts with the quality of your camera. It's not so much whether you get one with 6.1 or 8 or 10 or 36 Megapixels (which dictates how humungous you want to go with prints.) I think a camera's quality depends upon the lenses.And don't underestimate the quality of your software -- your "darkroom" -- for improving, fixing, and playing with your photo images. NOTE WELL: The Pentax editing software -- at least, the version which came with my camera seven months ago -- is very disappointing. You'll probably want to find an alternative or two. If you use the Apple Mac version 10.xx operating system, the included iPhoto software offers helpful, basic edit tools (and the capacity to assist in sorting, cataloging, and making slideshows for viewing. For Apple and Windows, etc. there's the workhorse of the creative photography world (film and digital) -- Adobe's Photoshop (available as a standalone or within the multi-software Creative Suite that you can set up to be able to shot Camera Raw.) For a lighter version, try Adobe Photo Elements.Pentax digital SLRs seem to hold their own with Nikons and Canons -- and usually for better prices. Go for it before you cheat yourself of any more lost months of enjoyable productivity. (Don't forget: When we're behind the camera, the irony is that we can miss the experience of the moment while trying to capture a memory.)
