Text says IA does NOT function in movie mode.If you scroll up it says that IA DOES function in movie mode. Someone didn't proof read for content.Don't believe everything you read.FWIW...the camera still shows hand shakes in movie mode despite the software.It is NOT a steady cam.You have to use panasonic batteries ONLY, and of course panasonic makes them expensive.If you want to use ac adapter they charge you big bucks for the cableswhich are NOT included.Watch out for vertical lines when shooting video in sunlight. Even the owners manual cautions this behavior.If you want to watch your stills/videos direct from camera to HDTV you must buy panasonic HDMI cableswhich cost $$$ and are of course NOT included.When using zoom in movie mode you WILL hear the whirring gear noise. Get used to it.Digital zoom at HIGHEST magnification will get really close up but the images will be blurry so what's the point.LCD monitor display can be difficult to see in bright sunlight despite adjustments.Now that all that's out of the way, it is still a good camera that delivers excellent qualityphotos and videos with minimal manual adjustment. Flash could be better but I can live with it.I'm a scuba diver and use it for underwater documentation and by the way I had to go the EBAY Japan to get an underwater housing. Almost impossible to get any in USA without big bucks.All in all I actually LIKE the camera and would probably buy another if my original was damaged beyond repair.I just don't like panasonic's built in SCREW, misrepresentation of features, and blatant methods to extract more money from the customer. SHAME on Panasonic.I've lost all respect for you. Despite all of this rant, it REALLY is an excellent point and shoot tool, with nice features.Just thought I'd add my $.02 cents worth so the potential buyer knows what you're getting into.If you're willing to put up with all of the above you'll enjoy it.
