I go through cameras like hogs go through mud. Not because I drop them in the mud, but because I like to buy a lot of technology. This little guy has stuck with me and here's why:- I tried the G9 first. I always noticed the extra girth when trying to discreetly carry it in my jeans pocket. The p5100, even with a soft case, can be forgotten about while I'm carrying it in said pocket.- Have you seen the images that can be made when using the wide angle and sb400 bounce flash? HOLY **** I'm no pro, but the results are creative and dramatic, to a much higher degree than any other P&S; I've ever had. Without the attachments, the pictures are still just as good as any other P&S; I've ever tried as well, and I used to even have the "legendary" Fuji F30. Even if the latter has better dim light results, the former makes up for it hundreds of times over with the bounce flash option.- I won't beat the horse with the "performance issues." I'll just say I don't notice them, even though I originally owned the G9 for a month. That said, when I had both cameras at the same time, the interface of the G9 was a lot more user-friendly and "snappy."- I took hundreds of pictures with both of them in the same conditions with various camera options. Subjectively, the ones taken by the p5100 consistently looked better and more alive than the G9 (without attachments). However, I could get much better "quasi-bokeh" with the G9, esp with the lens zoomed in and macro mode on.- Finally, p5100 + attachments = much better pictures than G9 alone, and in that configuration it weighs about the same as the G9 without attachments.- Result? FIVE STARS. Not because it's going to be as good as my friend's 40D, but when considering PRICE SIZE and RESULTS, it is.
