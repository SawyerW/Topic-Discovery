I've had a Kodak 6490DX camera for a couple of years now and love it. My only complaint is the blurriness from no image stabilization. It takes excellent pictures. Well, when the Z812IS came out and I started reading the reviews, I couldn't imagine a camera better than the one I already had. My husband bought me the Z812IS for Christmas this year and let me tell you, it blew me away. It is amazing! You can zoom at full distance, it looks blurry on the screen, but when you take the picture, IT'S NOT BLURRY at all! The colors are wonderful (Thanks Kodak!) and bright, rich colors. The pictures are so very clear and sharp. I also love the additional features of this camera. You can crop right on the camera as well as "enhance" or "fix" the picture right on the camera. I've already sold three other people on this camera also. And two of them own recent models of Kodaks. The other one owns a much higher priced different brand camera that she doesn't like. (Paid over $500 for it.) She wants this one also. I know I haven't gotten into the technical aspects of it but everything you read about it is true. It's just honestly a GREAT camera and to me, worth way more than the sale price was. Kodak did a really good job with this one!My only complaint? You have to buy the rechargeable battery and charger for it but it's worth it if you search a get a good deal on them too. It'd eat up the disposable batteries really fast. Kodak really needs to reconsider including this. Other than that though, I have NO cons of owning this camera only many, many pros! Buy one. It'll be one of the best investments you'll ever make. If you don't throw it around (and buy the padded case to carry it in) it'll last for years! :)
