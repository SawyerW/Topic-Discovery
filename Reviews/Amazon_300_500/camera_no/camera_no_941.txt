I bought this camera to take on a trip to India and Africa.  My old Canon sureshot was great, but I wanted a larger zoom and a smaller size. After much research, I opted for this one over a similar canon SX200is. I got the camera (shipped) for under $250, and I'm still amazed at what it can do, at how well it does everything, and that it does it all in such a small package. Being new with the camera, I mainly used the intelligent auto function, and it worked very well, allowing me to take clear shots at full zoom without a tripod (all from a safari jeep).  I also shot some short HD films, which were pretty jittery (because of me, the jeep, and the amount of zoom) but amazingly sharp with passable sound. Keep in mind that your ability to take a fluid video will depend on the speed of your camera card (I used budget cards claiming class 8 and 10, and had good results overall, but there where a few pauses here and there probably due to write speed). While not the smallest camera you can get, I kept this camera in a shirt pocket often, which is amazing considering that it has a lens set up that goes from 28-300ish mm. Also, now that I'm not in Africa, I'm so glad it has the wide angle lens, which is what most of us need most often. It does eat batteries when under heavy use (but not so much when used sporadically) so I carefully researched and bought two extra after-market batteries for under $20 each (be careful to read reviews to see if you are getting the right battery) and both worked fine. I ended up using only two batteries per day on safari, but it was nice to know the third was there given the gravity of the trip. Oddly, the price of this camera has gone up and I think it is being replaced by a 12 megapixel model.  I bet that camera is also great for the money...
