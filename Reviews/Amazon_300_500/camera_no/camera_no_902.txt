Here is my background:  I have owned over 20 point and shoot cameras and now shoot with Nikon DSLRs D300 and D40 and I also owned Canon 40D.I also owned Fuji F10 and F30 and S6000fd so I know that you are thinking between this and Fuji F70/F72 and maybe also Casio H10 which is an interesting model.  Here is my review:I owned TZ3 and TZ5 before and ZS3 is better.  The quality of my concert photos and videos I've been getting with ZS3 is better.  Here is why ZS3 is great:1)  for all intents and purposes you can place it in iA mode and it will give you a proper shot 99 out of 100 times.  Don't need to fiddle with anything.  Also useful when you give your camera to strangers to take your photo.  They won't screw it up for the most part2) ability to take concert videos and photographs.  As TZ5 before it, ZS3 allows you to preset minimum shutter speed down to 1/250 in the normal camera mode.  This is the most important feature you need because it acts as a pseudo-shutter priority.  At 1/60 to 1/125 you will freeze people's movement on stage.  And this camera is easy to sneak in to concerts because it is small.3) AVC HD light 720p is the most advanced video format currently available for p&s; cameras.  It is amazing.  the video quality is out of this world.  You need to see it to believe it.  And AVC HD Light videos can be natively burned to any regular dvd and then played by any blu-ray player.  In fact, PS3 plays them natively off the card reader plugged into USB slot.  Because Sony supports AVC HD Light format.  ANd Blueray format does as wellWhat is not so great?The battery life is worse than on TZ5 which is a disappointment.  The battery is smaller because they made the camera smaller.  Unfortunately while I was getting 400+ photos at a concert routinely with TZ5 (no flash)  ZS3 batter is at least 1/3 worse.  I've heard that Fuji F70 battery is even worse.  So I took off one star for poor battery performance.  After Fuji F10 and F30 with its 600 shots per charge, this is not acceptable in my book.  However, I feel currently this is the best point-and-shoot camera in its class.
