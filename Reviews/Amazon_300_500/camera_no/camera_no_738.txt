I bought this camera to replace a Canon SD400 that was no longer working. I spent about a week shooting everything, from my one year old son to panoramics in the country. Unlike most digital cameras I have used, this one produced uniformly noisy pictures, even outdoors in bright light. Low-light shooting was just plain awful, but I thought perhaps it was the standard settings I was using. I turned off digital zoom and then did a series of test shots. They all came out noisy. I am not sure if the other reviewers are used to having noisy results, but I am not. The panoramic feature is actually pretty limited in that you can only do 3 images stitched together, and if you don't get it right, the resulting image will be wrong. The way it does this is after you take the first picture, it puts a sliver of that image on the LCD screen and then you have to line that up with the element in the shot. It's a little tricky, but after a lot of trial and error, I got it. The problem is that the wide-angle lens distorts all of the images and the wide-angle panoramics take on a fake, fish-eye quality. I returned this camera and got the new Canon SD700, which is a far superior camera. The Canon implementation of panormic is far superior in that you can stitch together as many images as you like and instead of a sliver, it shows you a third of the original imge for you to line up, which is much easier. In addition, since the stitching is done with software (the camera comes with its own panoramic, but I prefer to use Photoshop's stitching for best results) you can do full 360 degree panoramics, which are very impressive when printed. This isn't the worst camera I've used, but it doesn't take very good pictures, which is really the only thing to judge a camera on, I think.
