Although I did not buy this camera from Amazon (found it cheaper elsewhere and paid for that in customer service) I felt compelled to write a review here since it will likely get the most exposure at this website.I have had this camera for 2 weeks now and I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I bought it originally for two features -- the 5MP resolution and the size of the item itself.  The pictures are great and look like they would easily lend themselves to enlargement without a loss in clarity.  The camera easily stows away in the pocket of your pants and it's like it is not even there.PROS - small size/portability; 5MP resolution with the ability to set resolution at 5, 4.28, 3, 1.875, 1.2, and 0.5 MP; movie mode which records movies as long as you have memory; voice recording as long as you have memory; picture/voice mode allows you to place a 30 second voice caption onto your pictures; ability to manually set f-stop, shutter speed, focus, whitebalance, electron volts; can zoom and crop images right on the camera; up and ready to take a picture in <2 seconds, 3x optical zoom, controls very intuitive, 2 inch LCD screen large and clearCONS - images grainy in low light (what camera isn't?), SD card slightly difficult to remove from camera, voice recorder doesn't record clearly when input is very loud, 4x digital zoom does not keep image clarity very wellEXTRA SPECIAL PRO - battery life (I have taken over 200 pictures with flash on 70, two video clips of 1 and 5 minutes, and a voice clip of 10 minutes and the battery indicator hasn't budged off full)I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a high resolution point and shoot portable digital camera.  It's a winner.
