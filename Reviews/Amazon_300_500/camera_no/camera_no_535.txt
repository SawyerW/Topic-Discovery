I just got my camera today and immediately went to work trying to figure out how to operate it. All you have to do is study the quick sheet that comes with the camera and you know most all you need to know about how to operate the D-380.You will see the 2.5 on up to the 4 MP camera her but you don't need that. If all you are going to do is take some pics and download them to your computer, the D-380, or any other 2.0MP camera will fit the bill. With the 8 meg card included with the camera, I can take 30 photos that look really good. This is by far not the highest resolution the camera offers, but nor is it the lowest. I found this setting to be optimal. Think about it: Why would you want to take a picture that is bigger than your monitor screen?The black and white setting is great also. There is nothing like a good black and white picture.For the money, this is a great deal considering you also get a 32 meg memory card to boot.The only thing that i have found that i do not like is the USB port on the camera. The company changed the size of the port so you will have to use THEIR cable. The model before this one could use a regular USB cable. This is the one thing that will probably make me sell this camera and search for another one. I have five computers and I am not going to continually unplug the USB cable and haul it around my house to the other computers. I give this camera a solid 10. I give the people at Olympus a big fat zero for being so greedy as to change the USB cable port so that buyers would have to use THEIR cable.
