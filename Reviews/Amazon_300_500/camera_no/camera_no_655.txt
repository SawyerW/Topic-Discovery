This is only a preview and I will post a revised review in a few days.This is my first SLR camera so I have no frame of referrence other than my visits to camera shops to try a few out.  I was torn between the Canon T1I and the PENTAX K-X.  I took a look at the T1I and felt it was a bit on the cheap side. It was also a bit more expensive with less features and lens are very expensive.  Also I think the 1080P at 20 frames is a gimmick as is the whole HD video feature in SLR camera's.I have only had the Pentax K-X camera for 24 hours but cant get over the build quality.  It takes fantastic pictures and has more options and tweaks than you could ever want.  Its very easy to use right out of the box even for my wife, yet if you want to tweak your photos and get into it everything SLR offers, the options are there and then some.A few comments about the fact the camera does not come with rechargeable batteries and battery life in general: As for Battery life, I am using the supplied Lithium AA's I have used the camera for several hours, taking video and a couple hundred pictures, the battery is still showing as full!  As for no included rechargeables, this to me is a non issue.  1.  You can keep a spare set of batteries either alkaline or Lithium or even rechargeable which is what I plan to do.  I think this offers a ton of flexiblity and ensures you will never run out of juice!Also, the camera I purchased was a kit with both the 18-55mm and also 50-200mm lenses.  these lenses are great build and have excellent image results.Again, this is only a preview but what I have seen so far I am so glad I went with the Pentax over the Canon T1I!  More to come soon.
