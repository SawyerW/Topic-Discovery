We purchased this camera 2 years ago on Amazon.  It produced wonderful pictures during that time.  This camera was treated well and kept in a case when not in use.  It was not taken to the beach where it would get sand in it or used in an abusive manner.  We used it mostly indoors for family photos.About 3 weeks ago we started having problems.  When the camera was turned on the lens would extend and retract several times and then finally close.  A warning was displayed stating "System error (zoom)." At first we thought it was the battery and replaced it.  The same thing happened.  Thus we called Panasonic and found out to have the camera repaired it would cost $180 through a company in Texas (no one answers the phone).  This is approximately half the cost of a new camera of the same model.Another family member, who purchased one around the same time, also started having problems with their Lumix DMC-ZS3.  First when previewing taken pictures, the lens would not retract and close but stayed open.  Additionally, when taking a picture, the lens covering would not completely open and had to be manually moved so as not to create a shadow on the picture.  As above, the cost for repair was $180.Looking online, it appears that these issues are not isolated and have frustrated many.  Paying $400 for this camera to have it basically become inoperable 2 years later is unacceptable.In contrast, we have two Canon point and shoots that we have used over the last 5 years with no problems at all.I have voiced my disappointment in an email to Panasonic.  Not sure it will do any good.We post these comments so that others may be warned.We will not be purchasing another Panasonic product after this unfortunate experience.
