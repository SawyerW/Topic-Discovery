I recently bought this camera used, for about 1/3 of the price mentioned above. I have been very pleased with this camera body, the lens if a different story.If you are switching from a rebel series body and want to switch to the xxd line, without having to spend the $1500 needed for the newest xxd, then this is a great place to start. I really didn't want the video capabilities of the newer bodies.This body is easy to use if you have ever used a Canon film camera, which is the background I have, then you will have no problem switching to this camera. Most functions can be found where you would expect them, you can set the camera to use the half push on the shutter, or the back focus button. Handy if you are shooting subjects where you can freeze the focus, and you just want to meter the light.If you want a camera for low light, or as it is also called high iso, buy a newer model. The high iso performance of this camera is very noisy and requires a lot of post.The lens:The lens I am less satisfied with.  I find it has problems focusing, especially in low light. When I take it of AF these issues are gone, but the you have to deal with the focus ring.  With this lens it is way on the front of the lens, there is about 4mm of plastic.  I am a tall guy with big hands, and find myself grabbing the wrong part of the lens to focus often.  This is an a minor setback, especially when you get sharper pictures using MF.I am currently looking into which lenses to buy, I will retire the kit lens after I buy different lenses.  I don't even want to sell it because of the issues mentioned above. I will just hang on with it and give it to my daughter when she gets her DSLR body.References: For more information on me find me by searching Berry van der Linden for my flickr search for madberry
