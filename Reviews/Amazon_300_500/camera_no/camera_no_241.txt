This is my first digital camera but I had the chance to compare this against other cams owned by friends & family. I've been using it for a little more than a month now, here are my "results" ;)Positive notes go to...Picture quality:Great. Details are crisp & colors are natural.Ok pictures are a little overexposed when the flash goes on in a mildly lit environment, but I had this problem with my old-fashioned "analog" camera as well and advanced photographers can use the exposure settings to minimize this.Features:Great. This camera has every feature I need. It has a wide variety of settings & option, you can record "animations" (no sound), etc... In addition the user interface is clear & user-friendly.Design:Looks ok, handles great. A little bulky but not oversized.Negative aspects...Battery:Battery life is low. This is the main drawback: as you can't switch the TFT view off (no optical viewfinder), batteries die rather quickly. They don't last more than 1-2 days under moderate use. Maybe using rechargeable lithium batteries might help, but I haven't tried it yet. So if you use this while traveling, be sure to bring in 2 sets of 4 rechargeable batteries with you. You'll probably have to change batteries every day. Because of this, you'll have to carry spare batteries everywhere you go... Grrrr...Software included:Nikon's software was really lame. My brother's Sony has much better software. I uninstalled everything and now I'm only using XP's built in features.Overall...This is a great camera if you don't mind the battery life that might fall a little short. But my brother's Sony doesn't last much longer either. This is maybe a common problem among all digital cameras. But it's worse here because you don't have the alternative to use an optical viewfinder...Still if you don't want to spend much and if excellent quality pictures are more important than long battery life, give it a try!
