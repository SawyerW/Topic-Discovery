I bought the D-520Z as my third digital camera. I have many years of photography experience, and have owned more than two dozen 35mm film cameras.This is a great camera for the person who is somewhat fussy, but still wants an easy-to-use optical zoom platform. For the benefit of people who don't read instructions, one may view a just-snapped picture by pressing the display button twice or (better yet) setting the camera up to display the picture for about 2 seconds after snapping it. Also, all settings can be memorized so the camera is ready to go as soon as you fire it up. For instance, I use fill flash on nearly every outdoor shot that involves people, and I have a preference for spot-metering. Both of these items are selectable and memorizable.Although the flash recycle time is a little slow, I consider it a very fair trade-off for being able to use AA batteries and only two of them at that.  Performance with NiMH batteries is outstanding; on a recent vacation I took over 100 pictures, most with flash, with extensive use of the LCD, and never changed batteries.Low-light performance is acceptable to me, and I take a lot of pics indoors.The camera is quite compact (fits easily in a shirt pocket with room to spare), and most important, the body is relatively thin.  Before you buy ANY camera, consider whether you really want to lug that clunky (and expensive) digital camera around for the sake of a possible tiny increase in picture quality.The true measure of any camera is picture quality, and I find this one to be very good.  I'm finicky, and I'm pleased.This camera is not as sexy-looking as some of the competition (read ELPF), but the price is right and I feel beginners and amateurs will be able to take a very high percentage of good pics with this one. Highly recommended...hats off to Olympus.
