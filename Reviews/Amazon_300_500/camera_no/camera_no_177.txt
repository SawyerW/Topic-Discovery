Overall a decent camera at a great price point. There are some minor glitches but none of those are deal breakers for me.Pros- Feature packed (Pan/Tilt, 2 way audio, night vision, wireless with WPA2 support, stream to IE/Firefox/3G phone, recording to NAS, just to name a few)- For $[...] including shipping, it's definitely the best bang for the buck at this point- Easy to install- Everything works for the most part once it's set upCons- Build quality: The first one I got from Amazon has very loud grinding noise when it starts up. The second one came without any problem though.- Stability: Whenever you restart or power down the camera, there is a possibility that you won't be able to connect to it after it comes back. I have seen the same problem on both cameras (with the latest firmware build 71). Usually the problem goes away after a few reboots, but it's quite annoying.- Constant background noise: This is a confirmed issue caused by an over-sensitive microphone. Apparently Trendnet is working on a fix for this.- Even though the camera has a built-in microphone, you can only capture video (not audio) when you try to schedule any recording to a network storage device.- Lousy tech support. They are not responsive, don't not know much about the product beyond the superficial stuff, and sometimes have difficulty to understand what I am trying to say (and vice versa)Other things I wish it has:- Support https so it's more secure when streaming over the Internet- Support authentication over RTSP. At this point, anyone with a 3G phone and the right URL can view your camera if you enable RTSP (Yikes!)- A privacy button to temporally disable the camera, or some scheduling capability to turn on/off the camera- Multiple profiles for motion detect so you can monitor different parts of the room depending on the time of the day- More intuitive event configuration
