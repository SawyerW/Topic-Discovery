There are three sets that are nearly identical, and differ only in the type of camera: this one (hidden camera), the outdoor starter kit, and the indoor starter kid.  for more comprehensive reviews, look at those other kits as well.As for my opinion, this set does what it says it does in a pretty seamless fashion: you install the software, plug the camera into the wall, plug a USB adapter into the wall and your computer, make some minor configuration changes and you are all set.  I have no doubt we could have gotten a better system cheaper but not one as seamlessly integrated.We looked at many different systems and bought this one instead because:- most spy cams broadcast for TV...you then need a TV/VCR to record, or a separately purchased adapter to make it work with your computer, and we weren't technically confident enough to want to buy different pieces and figure out how to get them working together- some spy cams are self-recording (they contain memory internally) but these tend to be pricey AND they limit how much you can record; they will fill up if you don't clear them out regularly, and for our purposes that wasn't practical- most "wireless" spy cams work on a WiFi wireless network, which is great if you have one, but we wanted this for use in a place we didn't have wifi; this one works by transmitting over your home or office electrical system.- the cost of the system includes a website you can set up to view your camera remotely (although if you have a firewall you'll only be able to watch 3 minute pieces; if the system can connect directly, which might require configuring your router which some people will find daunting, you can watch constantly).So, that said, here are some cons:- only works on PCs, not macs- 95% of the configuration is a piece of cake, but some aspects are confusing, like how to schedule alerts, and setting up for emailing alerts- the program has many features that are in the program but you can't click on them -- they are there as advertisements for a "platinum" version of the software that costs $80 a year.  It's annoying to have a screen full of buttons you aren't able to click, and to have advertising be such a prevalent portion of the interface- this one is kind of petty, but it would be nice of the clock that hides the camera had an alarm, since we had to remove a "real" clock in place of this one- the camera is fine for security, but the image is kind of strange - it appears to be infrared?  Which means the colors are bizarre.  Reds turn yellow, greens and blues turn white.  Which is probably fine for security purposes, but don't be expecting to get a high quality video out of it
