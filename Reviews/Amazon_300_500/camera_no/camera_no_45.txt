This is my third digital camera I have owned, and my first Olympus digital camera.  To start off with the pros, the camera looks really slick, especially when you get it in a color other than silver.  The camera is small and lightweight and carrys with it plenty of functions for those that aren't very photography-inclined.  The photos that this camera takes are superb for being its size and the battery life is excellent.  With a 512mb xD picture card I can take 523 pictures on High-Quality (2nd from best setting) and 180 on Super-High-Quality (the best setting).  I don't see much of a difference between the HQ and SHQ as I am not a photo-junkie, so taking 523 pictures on HQ is plenty enough for me.The only problems I have with the camera, however, is that you cannot charge the battery inside the camera, and every time you take the battery out to charge it (or swap it with another) the settings clear and you have to set the camera back up and set the date all over again.  One would at least think that a digital camera nowadays would have battery-backup on the memory.  Guess not.  Also, the camera does not come with very much storage.  Although most cameras do not either, most others come with 32mb, while the Sylus Verve comes with only 16mb, so if you're getting one of these cameras, be sure to purchase another xD picture card.All in all, however, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons with this little camera.  The camera is perfect for those of us who are not totally obsessed with digital photography.  If, however, you are really into digital photography and want a camera, might I suggest looking elsewhere.  But if you're looking for your first digital camera, or just something to replace your old one, and you only want it for family vacations and whatnot, then this camera is good for you.  Just be sure to pick up another xD card!
