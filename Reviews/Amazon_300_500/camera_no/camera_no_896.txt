I waited everyday until it's release, then purchased as soon as it became available.  I believe it sold out in about a day and I am so very happy I purchased this camera.  I really love the Nikon D90, but for the active person/everyday camera, this camera is the one to get.  When I go backpacking, go to work, wherever, I take this camera with me everyday.  If I want the shot of all shots, I will use a SLR.  But most often, I want to take home some pretty photos and memories.I am not going to write a technical review here, because they are everywhere on the web.  The purpose of this review is to inform people who may be considering to purchase this camera is that they will not regret the purchase.I was tired of my other point and shoot camera as the 5x zoom was inadequate for any close up (Casio Exilim 7.1MP).  It is a nice slim pocket camera, but the photo quality was satisfactory at best. This panasonic camera has the best selection of variability for a point and shoot camera as far as wide:zoom ratio with optical lenses, and good MP.  This 10 MP takes more clear/pristine photos than my girlfriends 12MP camera.  She loves my camera and would like one for herself.  I find the auto selection plenty adequate.  So look, if you want a camera that can produce excellent photo quality for clarity and color and you just want to have fun and not overthink every shot, this is your camera.  If you want a camera with the manual controls and have the ability to control every aspect of your photo, go with a DSLR.Of course it is ridiculous I would compare the two.  What I am saying, is if you want great photos without having to go to the expense of a Nikon DSLR, you want ease, functionality, and practicality, this is a great choice and one I researched for many months before it's anticipated release.
