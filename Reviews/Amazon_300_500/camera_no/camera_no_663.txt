The Pentax K-x was my first SLR, and I got it after a lot of research in which emphasis was on compactness, image quality and features/ease of use, and a huge plus for the K-x was that it accepts standard AA batteries.The K-x did not disappoint in all categories, and if anything proved to meet or exceed my expectations especially in low light shooting with extended exposures. The difference in photo quality was phenomenal as compared to other point and shoot and prosumer (pro-conusmer) digital cameras of which I have owned about a half dozen through the past decade (from Sony and Canon).Shortfalls:1- The autofocus seemed to have trouble focusing when a light source is facing the camera, even at an angle, switching to manual seemed to solve the problem, but one should have quick reflexes to adjust the focus manually if shooting conditions change.2- After a few days shooting with my  Pentax K-x I noticed a spot in some pictures which appears whenever the background is blue, in some shots it becomes more evident than others which gave me the impression that the camera's software is trying to overcome a dust particle of sorts somewhere in the Camera optics. I checked the lens and the mirror, everything seemed to be spotless clean, and I have been shooting with extreme caution, so I concluded that the problem must be with some dust particle on the sensor and accordingly I sent it back and ordered another one. Once I received my second camera I took a shot of the sky mid-day immediately after taking it out of the box and assembling the lens, and to my surprise there was still a spot of a different shape not too far away from the previous camera! I returned it and I'm convinced that this is still a great camera, but it seems that stores are shipping returned merchandize or for some reason the quality control people at Pentax don't seem to bother taking pictures of the basic sensor colors (blue, green and red) to insure the quality of their product.
