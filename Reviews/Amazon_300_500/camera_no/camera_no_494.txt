The Amazon price is $60 cheaper than places like Staples, and I think it's reasonable for what you're getting.It's probably the easiest digital camera I've ever used.  The interface is simple and straight forward, and it gives you descriptions of each function along the way.  Focus is excellent and fast compared to my old camera, as well as the zoom feature which is pretty powerful for such a small camera.  Picture quality is decent and images almost always come out sharp.  Taking pics in extremely low light conditions may require an adjustment or two since they sometimes look grainy.My only real complaint is video mode.  24 frames per second in HD mode is pretty low compared to the cheap Flip HD 60 frames per second.  I recorded part of a TV program on my plasma as well as video game clips and it had a flicker in HD mode, whereas in SD mode with 30 frames per second it looked perfect. I'm not sure why they couldn't have made HD mode at least 30 fps.  Also, as others mentioned, you can't zoom in or out while shooting video.  If you're looking for this feature with higher frames per second, look into one of the higher end Canon point and shoot models.  They're a little more expensive, but I sort of wish I spent the extra money for these features alone.  It still won't replace a good camcorder, but it's nice to have an efficient all in one device.This camera also doesn't include video editing software like Flip cameras where you can shorten or splice clips.  It says Super LoiLoScope is on the CD, but it's only a link to purchase the software for 70 bucks!  I found it bizarre and ridiculous to feature the software's name on the CD if it's only a link to download and pay for it.Bottom line, if you only have a $150 budget or less to spend on a camera and need something simple and effective, this is a good buy.  If video is going to be a priority, save up a little more and get a Canon.
