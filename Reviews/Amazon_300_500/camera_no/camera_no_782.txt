This camera is the PERFECT camera for those of us who want the following: 1 a small camera easily carried in a laptop bag 2> want manual controls as well as automatic 3> utilizes excellent (and affordable) Nikon addon lens and external flashes 4> Of course takes great pictures and as a kicker has the BEST macro mode of ANY "point and shoot- even has anti pin cushion and barrel distortion mode for PERFECT close in pictures (Like ebay pics)I am not a novice but not a professional and was looking for a small camera that gave me manual controls. And not only is this camera small but it LOOKS like a camera should (maybe not important to you) but this feels absolutely PERFECT in the hand and I have heard from many pros that the camera that is used is the one that feels the best when taking pictures and this one is perfect.The P5100 is always compared with the Canon G9 and the G9 DOES take marginally better pictures but the P5100 is A> $100-150 less, B> much smaller and lighter (important to me) and C: has a 30 fps movie mode- the G9 is only 15 fps. Again that is important to me. And to me the pictures it takes are fantastic.And for those who say this camera cant take good shots of moving objects I am not sure what they are referring to. Just yesterday we were drivng back from Houston and took pictures of car and truck wheels at 80 mph next to us and the camera froze the wheels perfect every time in both manual and sport modes.  Maybe it is the version 1.1 firmware that the units ship with now. Also I set the camera to 8 mpixel and I experience only a slight shot to shot lag like 1 second no big deal to me at all.I took the advice of another reviewer and bought the wide angle lens (very squat and fits the camera perfectly without sticking out too much. and the hot shoe flash- just takes great shots every time of everything.I Love Canon cameras and have bought many SD700, 850 and own a S3 (great camera) but the P5100 is the one I carry with me and gives me, as a mid ranged experienced user, the ability to shoot almost as a good as a pro, at a fraction of the price and a fraction of the weight and bulk.Yes having a RAW mode would be better and maybe a 5-7x zoom would be nicer ( a reason to upgrade to the 5200?). Anyway as you can tell I recommend Nikon P5100 highly.
