The truth is this camera is unfit for the purpose intended. To begin with , while the built-in screen freezes the picture at the time of taking it, the actual picture is recorded approx. 1 second later. No problem when you work in a studio with models, for sport or any animated subject it leaves composition to chance. Highly annoying.Next, the camera controls are maximum user-unfriendly. After 3 months of operation, I was unable to figure out how to adjust exposure (or at least turn auto-exposure off). For example, when you use the camera for document scanning (for example to speed up document conversion into digital files) with lots of white paper and 20% text, it adjusts the image too dark. While the usual text scanner software (I use Caere), works with it notwithstanding, the image shows a medium to dark brown background. That is the case even when you set it on manual.This does not happen in normal operation, though: in fact, color, exposure (even under difficult lighting conditions) and resolution is excellent in real life situations; they are nearly perfect. If the image would be recorded at the time the button is pushed the camera would be ok.Next, the camera does not have a remote control. While for regular photography it may seem unimportant, in a repro-stand, or for that matter in studio photography, a remote would come in handy.Finally, the mechanical design is Mickey Mouse. After inserting approx. 5 times over three months the 1394 cable into the camera-based connector, the connector disappeared somewhere inside the camera and can no longer be found, a gaping hole is there instead. I did not even use one of the heavily shielded 1394 cables. When it was working before the connector disappeared, though, the camera provided excellent moving picture results for Internet (cable) communications.It is a pitty that an excellent concept was executed so poorly.
