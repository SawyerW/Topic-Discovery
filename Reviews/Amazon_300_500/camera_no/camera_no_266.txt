WARNING!  CANON CUSTOMER SERVICE STINKS!  Our experience indicates that if you buy a Canon, you should be prepared to pay for the camera a second time in repairs.  This is regardless of extended warrantees.  BEWARE!This is the second Canon Powershot camera we have owned.  We have had problems with both and in both cases Canon has refused to repair the camera without paying a very high flat fee.  The first time the problem occurred after the warrantee period, so we paid it - about $150.  Supposedly the camera was then covered for a 3 month further period.  Within one month the camera completely failed to work again.  We called Canon service long distance from China, where we had taken the camera, but they refused to repair it saying that the warrantee was not in effect because the problem was a different one than the one they had previously repaired.  We swore we would never buy another Canon.  But, STUPID US!, we read reviews that said Canon was best in our desired type and price range, so we purchased a Canon A70.  It is still within the first year warrantee period, but now again Canon refuses to fix it unless we pay the flat fee - this time $100 plus shipping and handling!  They say that the reason is that the camera was dropped.  We know that there is a small dent on the side of the camera, but we do not want or need that fixed.  The problem is that the camera does not take pictures, its obvious and essential function.  This problem developed months after the small dent in the corner of the camera.  We have tried calls and so far Canon has refused to fix the camera.  WE WARN YOU NOT TO BUY CANON!  DO NOT BE AS STUPID AS WE HAVE BEEN!
