I bought my S200 at the beginning of June and I LOVE it.  The main reason that I bought it was that it was very compact, and I wanted a camera that I could take in my pocket, because I hate carrying around bulky items.  In the month and a half that I have had it, I only had to charge the battery TWICE after the first charge.  Although it is said to take four hours to charge, I found two hours usually does the trick.  Yes, you can downplay it because it only has 2 mega-pixels, but I bought this camera so I could take pictures when I needed.  As an average person, I don't need a four mega-pixels camera for vacation snapshots.  Still, I think the quality for 2 mega-pixels is awesome.  At the largest resolution and smallest compression, I think the picture quality is as good as the higher mega-pixels cameras.  The zoom isn't the greatest, but my digital zoom shots turn out crystal clear.  Canon is a brand that I could trust, and it is high quality.  But what I love is the size.  Lengthwise it is the same size as a credit card.  At only 6 ounces, it feels like very like when I carry it in my pocket.  The LCD screen is bright, and the playback mode is very simple.  I only have a few critisisms which are: 1) The movie mode only lets me take shots for a few seconds, and I don't know why. 2) The 8mb card is nothing!  Buy a 128mb card, because it will store a lot of pictures.  All and all, this camera is a great buy for anyone.  If you are looking for a quality camera that is simple to use and easy to handle, buy the S200!
