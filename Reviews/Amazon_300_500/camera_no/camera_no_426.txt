I bought this camera 3 years ago and have used it since. It is marketed as a higher end point and shoot, but I think it is more than that. Well worth the money if you don't want to take on a DSLR yet. I sent it in for a tune-up due to power issues about 6mos ago and it works as good as when I first got it. Great service all around. This camera still has a lot of life in it even after 10,000 or more pictures taken. I took this camera with me on many travels, the zoom is AWESOME, captures details you don't notice in real life like faraway signs. It does make pictures "soft" looking but that is normal for Nikon. Not great in low light, gets pretty noisy. The grip is nice, I don't think your fingers get in the way of the flash so I don't know why people say this is a problem, it hasn't been for me. This is a great camera for macro, you can get up to 1" away and still focus. Build is great quality, not cheapy plastic but metal and a rubbery grip. Works and looks great after multiple drops (oops). Menu is easy and intuitive, no more than 1 level deep. This is part of the experience which some manufacturers overlook but Nikon did well here. Comes with great panorama software too that is really fun to experiment with.Basically it's a darn good camera for the price, I'd give 4 1/2 stars if I could; solid build; versatile from zoom to macro; takes nice video, etc. but minus half a star for poor flash-off low light performance, vignetting.If you're a beginner-almost-intermediate camera user like me this may as well be a DSLR minus the bulk. Highly recommend.
