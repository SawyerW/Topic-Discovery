This is my first digital camera, and I must say I am very impressed. After just returning from a weeks vacation, it performed without a hitch. The compact size, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and metal housing make for a very portable unit. I usually just slipped it in my pocket, leaving the battery charger and cables behind. I upgraded to a 256 flashcard, which is highly recommended. We took over 200 pics and 2 videos with sound and there was room to spare on the card. A nice feature is the cable that plugs into any video jack on a tv set. I was able to play back a slide show each night of the pics we took that day without use of a computer. After returning from vacation, it was a snap to burn the pics to CD-r and send them off to friends, or just e-mail them. I found the camera easy to use, but you would be foolish not to completely read the manual. I found that fine tuning the settings made for better quality pics. And the resolution of the pics is very very good; they display beautifully on a computer monitor. The video mode with audio is also nice, however picture quality does suffer. I never had any battery problems, I simply recharged the battery each night. Considering a spare is about 50 bucks, you should buy the camera first, then decide if you really need a spare. My wife is a camera buff, and she also has nothing but high marks for this fine product. With the computer software, battery charger, battery, USB download cable, TV cable, and 8mb video card all included, the only additions you really need are a small case (to hold everything) and a larger video card.
