This camera is truly amazing!  I'd been using it for weeks, taking hundreds of amazing quality images before I even knew it had so many advanced features.  That's one of the things that makes this camera so great...  It's so easy to use out of the box.  The advanced features never get in your way like they do with other cameras.  When you want them, however, they are really very cool.My favorite feature I've found so far is the low-light outdoor portrait.  My friends and I took a trip to DC a couple years ago, and took some pictures in front of different attractions at twighlight with a film-based camera. When we got them developed, all you could see was us... there wasn't enough light for the camera to caputre the background.  With the Sony, however, that's a thing of the past!  Simply put the camera on a solid object or tripod, and turn on low-light portrait mode (very easy to do).  The flash on the camera goes off twice really fast,and then continues capturing in low light mode.  What it  does is uses the first flash to find what is close enough to get with the flash, the second flash captures that image, and then the lens stays open for up to two seconds longer capturing the low light background!  The pictures taken in this mode at twighlight look amazing!  Everything is nice and sharp... beautiful.Another great feature is the ability to use the camera's zoom controls to zoom in on pictures you've already taken when viewing them on the LCD.  Reviewing your pictures is great, but it's hard to tell if someone has their eyes closed in a shot, etc. when you're viewing on a 2" screen.  Well, with this camera, you can zoom right into their face to see.  Very useful!This doesn't even begin to describe what this camera can do...  excellent quality, perfect color - truly the best digital camera I've ever owned.
