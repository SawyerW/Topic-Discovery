First off I am a big fan of Nikon. I own three Nikon DSLR's and really like them all.As of a few months ago I owned one Nikon L3 point and shoot camera and one Canon A720 IS P&S; camera. The Canon seemed to be much better and I had a little cash to spare so I bought the newer version of each, a Nikon L22 and a Canon A1100 IS. For what I want, the Canon is much better.The Nikon isn't a bad camera, but it isn't what I want in a camera. There are not enough manual controls. You can see from a picture of the camera that it does not have the big button function selector on top. You are a slave to the Nikon menu's and they don't have nearly the number of choices that I want. There is no Program shooting mode, just Auto. Therefore it will not allow me to choose the ISO setting, which is improtant to me. Like most P&S; cameras it does not have a viewfinder so you are left to hold the camera out one or two feet away from you to shoot the picture. I want a viewfinder to look through so that my head helps hold the camera steady, which is VERY improtant in taking a picture with any kind of camera. Some, but not all, of the Canon P&S; cameras do have a viewfinder.If you can get past the limitations of auto selected ISO settings and can hold the camera steady, there is no problem with picture quality. My guess is that a lot of people who don't know as much as I do about digital cameras would love the simplicity of the L22, and the L22 is 40-50 bucks cheaper than most Canon P&S; cameras so it just depends on what you want in a camera.
