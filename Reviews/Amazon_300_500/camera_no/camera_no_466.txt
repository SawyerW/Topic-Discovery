I purchased this camera for a backpacking trip in New Mexico. I got two weeks before I left which left very little to really learn how to use. It is fairly intuititive for simple picture. However it has quite a few options that I am still learning how to use. I was very happy with the pictures that I took with it. I have been a serious photographer in the past but have drifted away over the years. So, I am a fussy photographer and not easy to please. This camera did a good job for me.I was concerned about the on/off switch at first but it was a non issue.I was happy with the lens range (28mm to moderate zoom.) I was amazed with the macro feature. Easy to use and high quality. I took several photos of butterfly that landed on my arm.having never used that option.I did not see much difference with the different auto photo options except for the high dynamic option. It seemed to make a difference in some situations.I was very disappointed with the battery life. I was only able to get approximately 60% of the expected life. I believe that this was because I reviewed and deleted photos regularly. BEWARE, you are burning battery life every time you play with the photos. The battery strength display is deceptive. The battery did not last long once it quit showing full strength. Panasonic needs to sell their batteries for a reasonable price. This is the biggest weakness of the Panasonic SystemI still have not figured out how to take pictures of fire works. the camera system is not "friendly" for those situations.I did purchase the recommended class 6 memory card.Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6EBottom line:  Good camera, easy to use with options that should satisfy serious photographers. Get an extra battery for long trips when you can not recharge. .Panasonic DMC-FH25A 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Blue)
