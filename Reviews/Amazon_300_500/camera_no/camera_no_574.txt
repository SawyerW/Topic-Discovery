I did about three months of research before I settled on this camera. Photography is a hobby of mine, so I had been eyeing digital cameras for awhile. The MAJOR contributing factor that got this camera in my pocket was just that. It fits easlily into most pockets. I personally carry my camera around in my front jeans pocket. Family vacations, hockey games, just out around town. If you dont have your camera with you, you are not going to get the shot.My other camera, a 35mm Canon, is not what I would consider a large camera, but I would tire of dragging it around in the Smokey Mtns with the strap either around my neck or around my waist. I would have to leave it on the platform at amuesment parks. But, with my Digital Elph, I just slip it in my pocket and off I go! The controls are easy, the pictures are great, and the construction is wonderful. The case is metal, so it feels to me as if it could take quite a beating.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone from just getting into photography to a serious hobbiest.  I do think that for anything over hobbiest you should go with a bigger, more professional series with more MegaPixels. 2 is good, itll get you an wonderfully clear 8x10, But for any needs over that, youll need a bigger camera.Overall, this is an awesome camera, with great style, contruction, and performance. And like I said, if you dont have your camera with you, you wont get that picture.Oh, and I seriously recommend purchasing at least a 128 MB memory card, and an extra battery. The 8MB card that is included gets you about 20 shots, while the 128 gets around 100 (depending on the settings). Also, while I have never ran my battery out, even after a full days worth of use, you cant just pop into any gas station to grab some full batteries. Other than those two items, you should be ready to rock right out of the box.
