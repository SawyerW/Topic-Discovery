I own three 8 mp digicams--the Nikon 8800, the Minolta A2, and the Olympus 8080.  My Minolta sees use mainly in sports situations where its manual lens and fast focus are great assets, and I'm less concerned about sharpness.  The 8080, in good light, takes the sharpest and cleanest pictures.  The 8800, however, is the camera I carry with me most days, because of its versatility and the great images it is capable of producing.  For me, the 8800's greatest two "flaws" are slow speed and high noise in dim light.  It is relatively slow to focus, especially at long zoom lengths, if you do not pre-focus.  It is slow to record, especially if you shoot a series of images.  Noise becomes clearly present in low light images shot at ISO 200, and the noise at ISO 400 is, to me, intolerable.  Noise can be discernable at ISO 100 if the light isn't good.  The lens is slow at long zoom.  In good conditions, however, the 8800 takes beautiful pictures that can be blown up to 8-1/2 X 11 and larger with breathtaking detail.  I've been amazed at the clarity of pictures the camera will produce at maximum zoom.  In more challenging light situations, the camera generally does at least as well as the other digicams I've used.  Colors are usually accurate and vibrant, and the 8800 can capture up to five images in a quick series.  If I don't know what I will be shooting and want to cover a lot of possibilities, the 8800 is my carry choice.  It's compact and durable.  It offers huge zoom length, great resolution, and good macro capability.  It's easy to use, once you get familiar with it.  It's image stabilization works, allowing for many great shots without a tripod.  From the four months that I've used my 8800, there are dozens of shots that I've magnified to huge size on my laptop and just had to say, "Wow, that's a great camera!"  In the right conditions, this camera can really deliver.
