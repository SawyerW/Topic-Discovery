I bought a 4MP Coolpix a few years ago and I really loved it. The pictures were great, it was easy to use, and it was small enough that I carried it in my purse all the time. But after my grandson was born this summer, I realized that with 4MP I couldn't take pictures of him and crop them very much without losing quality. I stumbled onto the 8MP version at Sam's Club, but went online for a better deal, which I got through Amazon.The camera is similar to my old one, but enough different that I'm having to learn how to operate it. The pictures are fabulous. Nikon uses a glass lens which is wonderful. The viewing screen on the back is larger than the old one making it easier to review shots. The thing I was hesitant about was that my old one used a special rechargeable battery. I did not want a camera that used AA batteries because I know those use a lot of them. But Nikon recommends the Energizer Lithium and claims you can get 1,000 pictures on a set of those as opposed to 440 shots with regular AA batteries and 520 with rechargeables.I had read about the delay between pictures. The old camera didn't do that. When I take a picture, an hour glass pops up and I have to wait to take the next shot, so this camera would not be good for rapid fire. The exception is outdoor pictures. I went to NYC to be in Times Square for New Year's Eve and I got some fabulous pictures with the new camera. During the day, on the outdoor setting, there was no delay. I'm very pleased with it but understand that I really need to take an afternoon, sit down with the book, and learn how it works.
