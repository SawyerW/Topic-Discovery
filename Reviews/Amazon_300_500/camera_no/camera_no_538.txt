The Olympus D-380 is a very reliable if you want to snap a picture of the family. I have been using this camera for about two years and it has just been awesome, even though it lacks a few things, which I will get into in just a bit. I mainly photograph dirtbikers, BMX, and race trucks. This little camera does the trick in capturing fast moving objects. Also, it does very well with not getting messed up with all the dirt and dust in the air when photographing motorsports - I have never had a problem with this at all. It has very decent resolution as well, but definitely not enough if you're past the novice stage of photography. I am very pleased with this camera considering it is an older model, but there were a few downsides to this camera which has caused me to seek a newer model. The most annoying problem that I have every time that I use this camera is that the battery compartment on the bottom of the camera is one of those sliding latches. It always slides out, causing all four batteries to spill onto the floor. So you have to be really careful when taking pictures to stay away from the battery compartment. Also, the batteries don't last very long, especially if you use the LCD and review your pictures often. A brand new set of batteries lasted me about an hour to maybe an hour and a half or so, with the camera on the whole time, snapping about 70 - 100 pictures. Another issue is when zooming in, the quality of the picture becomes very degraded - spotty and blurry. And sometimes the flash is too strong when indoors, it makes for too much contrast and loss of color in pictures. And when using no flash or the night time flash, it comes out too dark or sometimes blurry - if your hand shakes or moves. So, this is why I say that this camera is awesome if you just take general pictures but not if you are pursuing high quality shots.
