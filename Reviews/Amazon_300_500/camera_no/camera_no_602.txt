This camera is very small and very durable. Due to its metal frame, it's slightly on the heavy side for its size.It's the type of camera you can take with you just about anywhere. It's perfect for taking to partys and other events as it can take a real beating without getting hurt.2MP is good enough for most occations, and you can make very high quality prints in the sizes you're used to for your APS and 35mm cameras.The AF Assist lamp is a definite advantage, as it allows you to take pictures in relatively low light, usually indoors. It sometimes happens that it can't lock focus, but the camera will still take a picture after a short pause, and usually with a good result at that. This feature is far from perfect, but it definitely gives you an edge over cameras that lack this small, but very important feature.The battery capacity is not that great. With the LCD screen on, you can perhaps get somewhere between 50-120 pictures taken, all depending on how much you're "idling" in between. An extra battery is a must here. I shoot most of my pictures with the LCD screen off, and on that setting, the camera will still show you the resulting picture in the LCD screen for either 2 or 10 seconds (user selectable), so it's not really a problem. With the LCD screen off, you probably about double the amount of pictures you can take, possibly more, before you have to change the battery.On maximum quality settings, your pictures will usually consume between 700kb and 1.1MB of space on your memory card. I've found that most pictures end up being about 1MB.I've had this camera for a year now, and so far I've had no problems at all. This has so far been a very reliable camera. I've also bought a car charger, and two additional batteries for it.I would recommend buying at least one additional battery (I have a total of 3 myself), as they wear out reasonably quick, and they can not be charged internally in the camera - you have to take them out and put them in a charger.
