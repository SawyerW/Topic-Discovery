I have taken about 500 pictures so far in the last couple of months with the A70, my first digital camera.  My review is strictly my opinion on using the A70, since I have never used any other brand, so I don't know if other may behave similarly or not.First the good things: The A70 produces excellent color images, both on the monitor/tv or printed. It uses the least expensive memory card - compact flash.  It uses the least expensive AA size batteries. (I bought 8 rechargeable ones, still very inexpensive compared to those batteries used in some very small tiny digital camera).  Direct hookup to tv for viewing without the need of a dock.Now the negatives:  It bothers me very much that what you see in the viewfinder is not what you get.  The little 1.5 inch screen seems to show what you will really get, but not the viewfinder.  Under bright sunlight, the little screen is totally useless, you cannot see a thing.  And since using the viewfinder does not correctly show you what you'll get, it's very frustrating to have to guess.  Also because of the little screen becomes totally useless under bright sunlight, it is extremely hard to make any setting changes since settings are only displayed on the little screen, not through the viewfinder.  For example, if you need to change from flash-on to flash-off under bright sunlight, good luck.  The second annoying thing is the zoom control.  It is almost impossible to zoom precisely.  You'll go too far one way and when you zoom back, you'll go too far the other way.  No precision control on the zooming mechanism.  It is fine with casual snapshot type of pictures, but not when you want a little bit of artistic creation.  Third annoying thing is the delay reaction on the shutter, which I have read on other brands also, so it is not a unique A70 issue, but that does not make it not annoying.  Among the three, the third is the least annoying.
