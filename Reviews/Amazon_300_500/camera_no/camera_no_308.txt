I've had this camera for a bit over a month now and have been using it here and there but it wasn't until today 9/21/2009 that I really had some fun.  We went to Roger Williams Park Zoo in Rhode Island and this was the perfect camera for the day.  It fit in my pocket, was easy to use and changing the settings with one finger was fantastic.  The colors are great and I used a few different settings with the same subjects to see what the difference was and to be honest I couldn't find a whole lot of difference.The one thing that I liked the best was the stabilizer.  My hands always shake a bit and so usually taking pics really stinks as they are blurry or worse but this baby did great.  I felt like a kid in a candy shop running around taking pics of different things and having them come out great.  If you would like to see the photos I took at the zoo today here is the link: [...](you can find some images from the zoo in the customer images right under the photo of the camera).  I have not touched up any of them so you see them as they were taken.I wanted to write this review earlier but thought I would wait until I had some photos I could share with you.  I think this is one of the better ways in which to help judge a product that you can't hold in your hand yourself.  As we all know online info isn't always helpful and they say the Proof Is In The Picture.  I hope you enjoy the photos as much as I enjoyed the zoo and they help you in choosing a delightful product I don't think you could go wrong with.
