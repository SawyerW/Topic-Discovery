I have been long awaiting my first Digital Camera purchase.  I have been putting it off for well over a year now because I just could not find a camera that I fell in love with.  That was until I saw the Canon A70 one day at work.  I started playing around with it and immediately liked it.  As I worked more I played around with it more, and before I knew it I had decided which camera I would purchase when eventually purchased a camera.  The first thing you will notice about the A70 is how comfortable the camera feels while holding it.  The camera is extremely easy to turn on, and selecting one of the 12 different shooting modes is perfectly placed for your thumb.  The zoom is more than enough for me at 3.2 digital and 3X optical.  Taking/viewing pictures is as easy as any other camera I have ever seen, and the battery life is what is excpected from 4 alkaline AAs(I havent used Rechargable batteries yet).  There is no lens cover to worry about because there is a shutter that comes over the lens when you turn the power off.  The software that come with the camera is above expectations so far, but I have not used it incredibly extensively yet.  The Canon A70 does have a movie mode, and it works fine for short clips.  I also have the Canon ZR45 so I do not use the movie mode on the A70 that much.  Everything you need to get started come with the camera, including a strap and a 16mb Campactflash memory card.  Another nice thing about the camera is that it takes the CF card.  They are by far the easiest to find and cost far less than a number of other memory cards.  The Canon A70 is a great buy for the money at an MSRP of $$$$$.  I would definitely recomend the A70 to newcomers of the Digital Camera world and even to people looking to upgrade from their current camera.  The A70 is a SOLID 5 star camera.
