It took me about a month choosing a camera. My last camera was small and slim, but it took really bad quality pictures with lots of noises - I hated it. HATED IT... and it broke too. with no apparent reason.So i was looking for a camera with better quality, and i didn't mind if it was a little costly or bulky. I wanted a good camera. I was actually looking for high-end cameras, actually debating over two of them, saving up money. Then i found this one.OMG this camera seemed so good. it can zoom like crazy and takes super quality pictures, videos are awesome (zoom-able too), and not as big or expensive as a high-end camera. I read almost all the reviews out there on this camera - in two languages that i know :)And this camera is GOOD. It met my expectations and did everything that all the reviews promised, it's just awesome. I love my camera.All my aunts love my camera, and one of them actually bought the same one after me, and today i just ordered another one for my mom - she wanted one too.Some pros and cons:-pros: takes really good pictures, image stabilization actually works unlike many other cameras, wide angle, great video with zoom, 12x(or more) zooming depending on the picture size, long battery life, you can delete multiple pics at a same time, etc.-cons: cannot make panorama pics directly in the camera (comes with a program in a CD in the box so you can make one in the computer; never tried), zooming knob seems little loose (not to worry too much), and it's NOT A SLIM & SKINNY camera.If you're looking for a case for this camera, here's one that I recommend:Built E-SSC-MDT Soft-Shell Camera Case (Micro Dot)I'm using this and it fits perfect.I bought this camera when it was $300 and I don't regret :)I'm not a pro photographer or anything, I'm just a student who likes to take pictures a lot but can't afford DSLR cameras, and if you have any questions about this camera please feel free to comment on this review.
