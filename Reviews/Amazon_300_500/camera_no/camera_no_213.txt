I was feeling like road kill on the information highway and completly lost in the woods when it came to digital photography,but then I came across this little gem.I am not an avid photographer and didn't really need a digital camera,but I thought I might try out this inexpensive little bugger for the kicks.WOW!!! It is easy with a capital E.This little camera takes wonderful pictures in just about any lighting,with NO FLASH.If you have suffered the hell of red eye,you will love this little camera,no red eye,ever again!And it also handles video conferencing,and can make 10 second silent video clips to send in your e-mails to whomever.It also includes a self timer so that you can take pictures of yourself,or get into the pictures with others.Another little wonder of this camera is the "burst"feature.With this feature,the camera takes a burst of 5 pictures in 1 second!!Great for fast action sequences.I had a little problem with downloading the software,but a toll free call to Kodak and I was up and running in 10 minutes or less.I sent pictures to my friends in thier e-mail and they all told me that the quality of the pictures were fabulous!!I don't know how well the pictures would look if printed out,but for e-mail,web pages,and just general fun without paying a small fortune,the Kodak EZ 200 just cannot be beat for the money.If you are just starting to think about buying a digital camera, try this little baby before you buy an expensive model and see if it doesn't fit all your digital camera needs.It's no bigger then a mans billfold,and only about an inch thick.It has a little wrist srtap so that you can carry it anywhere and it weighs almost nothing.I slip it into my coat pocket and whip it out whenever I see something I want a picture of.It runs on 4 AAA batteries.I have only had this camera for 48 hours and I can't imagine being without it,it is wonderful!!
