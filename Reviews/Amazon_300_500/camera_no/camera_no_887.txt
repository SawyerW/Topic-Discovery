I am making some simple mistake - please help!  I have a MAC G5/OS 10.5.8/2 GB dram running Preview 4.2 (all software up to date).  Previously I had a 2 MP Fuji 2650 and its jpegs looked fine with this setup.  Now with the ZS3 the 10 MP photos looked muddy and ill-focused, 5 MP and 3 MP of the same subject look much better.  I think it must be some issue with how the Preview program is set to display the photos.  When I change the jpegs to actual size, and zoom subjects in the 10 MP shot to the same size as the 5&3 MP shots they look almost identical (so I think the camera is focusing correctly) - but when I simply double-click on the jpegs the 10 MP shots look awful.  Is this because the 10 MP shots are downsampled more?  How can I get all the jpegs to render well?  Am I supposed to use some Preference setting like "respect image and screen DPI for scale"?  Could this be a setup issue (haven't read the manual much)?  Could this be because I haven't imported into iPhoto with which I am not that familiar?As for the ZS3 the dedicated movie button is awesome, the zoom is quite nice to have but uses so much juice that the battery shuts down pronto!  I actually find the wideangle annoying, have to read to see if I can defeat that default state.  Haven't tried to view the AVCHD lite video yet, sounds like getting it to work will be a lot of work.  I really like the package as seemingly the best you can get and still carry in your pocket but man the battery issues are a serious problem if you zoom much; not to mention the price and availability problems of the OEM battery and the 1.2 software shutdown of non-OEM batteries that sell for much less!
