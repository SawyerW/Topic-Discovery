I was in the market for the P5000 and found it was not available so I acquired the P5100 instead. What a fantastic camera! I recently also purchased a Pentax K10d (and it's a great camera but a bit too heavy to carry around on this old neck for any length of time) but this is the camera I use most and I carry it with me everywhere. The program modes are terrific and combined with the SB400 Speedlight this little jewel is just about impossible to beat. The price is great and the camera itself is very high quality construction. The all magnesium body feels great in your hands and the controls are all very handy and easily operated, even in very low lighting conditions. One added plus is the camera will allow you to record audio captions for each picture or you can also record audio alone.  The video capture works very well and it's quite handy if you don't happen to have a video camera with you at the time and still want to be able to provide that little 'extra'.  One very cool feature is the Panoramic Mode, which provides a 'ghost' image on 1/3 of the LCD screen that allows you to consistently match up with the previous image and makes it very easy to take images that stitch together flawlessly.  Nikon really did a great job with this camera!  Get one and you will absolutely be pleased with it. Don't forget to get the Nikon carrying case as well, which makes it very convenient to carry.  Of course the previously owned Coolpix lenses and other accessories work with the P5100 as you would expect them to, flawlessly. This camera comes to as near to perfection as you'll find in a reasonably priced point and shoot.
