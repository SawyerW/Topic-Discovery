I decided to purchase this particular monitor for three reasons:1.  We own a Lorex and thought this would be the latest and greatest model2.  We have two kids and needed two cameras3.  We wanted a two-way intercomI was terribly disappointed and returned the camera after one night.  Here are the cons:1.  Cameras don't have mounts - the previous model's cameras had mounts that allowed them to easily attach to a nail on the wall.  These cameras don't have them.  In addition, these cameras are difficult to adjust to the correct angles to view the children.  You have to place them a certain amount of feet away and above the child's bed.  The previous cameras were able to be adjusted to almost any angle.  We couldn't just swap out the old cameras for these new ones.2.  Monitor stand was poorly designed - the monitor fits loosely on the stand.  It was knocked off very easily by children playing.3.  Weak two-way intercom - I was speaking directly into the mic, and my daughter (who was crying) couldn't hear me.  I had to speak so loudly to talk over her, that she could hear me from the other room.  The previous model's intercom was much louder, and I had to speak softly so she wouldn't get startled by my voice.Here are the pros:1.  Bigger, brighter, color monitor - the monitor is big and wide and easy to navigate.2.  Pan/tilt camera - one of the cameras is able to rotate side-to-side and up-and-down.  This allowed me to see my child when she jumped out of bed, but its scope was very limited.3.  Additional features - allows you to view via Skype and record video & audio, but I never used these features.We ended up getting the Motorola (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VL2VRY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) with an extra camera and are so much happier.  It's well worth the additional $40 or so.
