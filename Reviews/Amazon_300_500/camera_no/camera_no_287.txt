No kidding, I'm almost a raw amateur.  I put down photography 20 years ago and finally decided to buy another camera - I knew it'd be digital, hardly anyone talks about film these days - so I started looking around the very day the D70 came out.  Knew nothing about it, only that I couldn't find one at five different stores I stopped at in the Boston area.  One look at the specs and the price, though, and I knew a fixed lense digicam was a serious waste of money for a compromise.Bought the camera with the 18-70mm lense as well as a 70-300mm zoom I needed for flexibility.  Looked at the manual.  White balance?  What's that?Took the camera out to a nearby lake.  What pictures!  Razor sharp.  First vari-setting I tried I could see the needles in the tops of evergreens fifty feet away on the LCD screen.  Bright display, fast starting, good viewfinder.  Been learning its foibles ever since.Comments:  In bright sunlight there's a necessity to back off the ISO, white balance or exposure; but on the other end of the scale, I've taken images at 8:30 p.m., no flash, and liked the mood the camera captured.Yes, incredibly flexible.  I like to shoot close-ups of swamp plants 20 feet away.  The 18-70mm seems to shoot a sharper picture, and the zoom leaves blur around the edges when I push its limits, but I'm really pleased with how handy this camera is, quick, adaptable, easy to use, high visibility.Problems:  No handgrip available, I have to make one.  Also (maybe it's my big hands) the on-camera adjustment for shutter and aperture, done while focusing through the lense, seem a little difficult to adjust to.  No biggies, considering everything else.Seriously, I'm still marveling at my good luck!  What a piece of technology!
