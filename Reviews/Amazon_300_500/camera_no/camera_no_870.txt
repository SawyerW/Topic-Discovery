When I first got this camera, I was not very happy with the IA setup.  My daughter's school was putting on a play and I could not get a good picture at all using the automatic settings.  I did however get some great video with the AVCHD lite.  It works very well even in a low-light environment and the ability to zoom in and out while recording is excellent.  This camera completely replaces our Sony video camera which seldomly got used due to its size and inconvenience.  After the dismal pictures of this play, I was ready to return the camera and try again.  But, I decided to give it another chance (and also play around with selecting the right scene modes manually).We took it on a trip to Disney and with the 12x zoom were able to capture some of the shows/parades as though we were on the front row.  The camera's auto-focus tracking was excellent and the pictures are very crisp, clear and colorful.  I was most impressed on the safari ride in Animal Kingdom where I as able to capture the animals very close-up all while riding in a vehicle bumping along the path - I was never able to do that with my Sony PS200 (which I had always been very happy with).The LCD is crystal clear and very large which is great for seeing what you're getting.  It is a little difficult to see in the bright sun, but that must just go with the territory.The one downside is that the battery life does not seem to be nearly as long as with my old Sony (it could go for days on a charge).  After a good day of use, this camera definitely required charging.  I'm sure the large, bright LCD and the autofocus do require a lot of power.All-in-all I've been very happy with my purchase.  Hard to believe all the technology and quality you can get for $250.
