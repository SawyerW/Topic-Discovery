I'm a huge Nikon fan. Having grown up in the world of SLRs and then Digital SLRs. I'm also a huge Apple fan and have been using the iPhone for most of my "point and click" photo needs. The iPhone however does not have an optical zoom and has relatively low picture resolution. Its digital zoom is very good, but can't make up for the quality of a good optical zoom.I was hoping to achieve Nikon "professional quality" output with a camera small enough to carry in my pocket.  Its size is fine. the zoom is fine and it works great for what it is. But after weeks of using it, I've yet to get a single photo which is far and away better than what I've been able to get out of the iPhone. The iPhone is faster to shoot, easier to use, faster to zoom, has much better image firmware (as in the way it sees colors is better), has much better exposer controls - you simple touch the screen on the area you want to "expose to". The Nikon is really " you take what it tells you to take" no - manual speed or exposure controls to speak of.This Nikon has a low light compensation feature which does in fact let you take pictures in low light - I found that its interpretation of colors at low light was a bit of guessing game - you never knew what it was going to come up with. ( greens look brown, etc)My pleasant surprise on this camera was the video, which I didn't buy it for but find myself using more than ever expected - not being an video expert, I'm impressed with the quality. I'll keep the camera mostly for this reason.In short if you want reliable "good" photos, every time,  this is a great camera - but not particularly any better than an iPhone. If you want exceptional photos and want to be surprised by how beautiful the photos are - stay with a full sized  SLR for now. I love my Nikon D70 and if it weren't for the size it would be my standard for years to come.
