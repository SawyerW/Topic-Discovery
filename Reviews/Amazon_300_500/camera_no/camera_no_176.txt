This system sounded like the easiest to use (for non-Geeks). I watched the video, 1-2-3 steps and you're done, at least, that is how it should work but this is how it goes. (1) Ordered the Master System (MS), 1 camera (cam#1)+ power supply, disk & a power supply for your computer/laptop, which by the way, must be running 24/7 for this system to work. I suggest using an older (unused) model since most of us update our computer/laptop & usually end up with a spare.(2) While I was waiting for my MS to arrive, I found an add-on camera (cam#2) at a good price so I ordered it. Both the MS & cam#2 arrived the same day. I noticed the power supply for cam#2 was different than what came with the MS cam#1, newer maybe? I hooked everything up according to the disk (which is easy) but cam#1  came on-line for 5 minutes and shut off, although cam#2 worked fine!(3) I sent cam#1 back and the dealer sent me a replacement, now cam#3. I followed the same troubleshooting recommended by Logitech but to no avail.(4) I held onto cam#3 and the dealer sent another replacement cam#4. With all 3 cameras hooked up I once again sent the software to recognize them. It came back with cam#1 (old faithful) and now cam#3! BUT, like cam#1, cam#3 came to life for only 3 minutes and bailed. I reset the cameras (except cam#1), cam#3 is dead but finally cam#4 comes alive!(5) Over the weekend I made sure the MS maintained contact with cam#1 & cam#4 and it has.(6) Now the only drawback is the MS will go offline every other day so you must reboot the MS if you want to view your security cameras over the internet. This babysitting is not the 1-2-3 then leave it alone system I was hoping for.SOOO, I ordered the HooToo Wifi IP Wireless Pan/Tilt camera so I don't have to run another laptop and I don't have to reboot daily. Now this is the security system/camera I wanted & picture is CLEAR!  Logitech could NOT cut it, not recommended if you want to leave home and expect your system to monitor & cameras need ALOT more work.
