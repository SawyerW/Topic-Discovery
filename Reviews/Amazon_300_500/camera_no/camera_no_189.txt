Goals:1) So my family can see the baby sleep or play.2) Watch my nanny with the baby through my phone during the work day.3) 2 way audio to explain what I'd like to see done with nanny.4) pan/tilt anywhere in the room.Pros:1) After returning the initial camera b/c it was defective, the 2nd one works great!2) If at all possible, ORDER IT DIRECTLY FROM TRENDNET OVER AMAZON! It's cheaper then most companies selling the same item and you'll have the newer version with the updated software. This was a major reason why the other camera didn't work.3) The ability to view anywhere. On my computer and phone.4) The best app I found was 9.99. It's called "IP Cam View." You can zoom,listen,etc. Works great for this type of camera.5) The 800 number!!! This is the best by far. Several companies don't even offer 24/7 service. These guys are good. A little tough to speak english but you can understand perfectly. DON'T HOOK UP ANYTHING WITHOUT CALLING THEM. CALL THEM FIRST AND HAVE THEM WALK YOU THROUGH IT. saves a big headache later.Cons:1) I'm having a problem saying this is a con but I have too. Hooking up any wireless web cam is not easy. Even with the 800 number helping me, it still took a couple hours.2) Remember you still have to contact your router company to get a few things so it works wirelessly unless you already know the ins and outs of your router.3) There should be a trendnet app for viewing. Instead I have to use a 3rd party to view. But that's ok.4) it promotes 2way audio. This is true but you have to attach a mic to both ends if you want this to work. You can listen but can't speak unless you do that.Bottom Line:Don't buy this camera from anyone other then Trendnet. They'll have all the updates on there cameras that other companies can't supply. Works as promised and you'll be happy with it.
