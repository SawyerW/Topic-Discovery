I bought this model camera a few years ago, and have just bought another.  I'm not an IT person, but with the help of the Users Guide, and a very helpful tech support person, it's working well.  The camera comes with a Quick Start Guide, but there is additional documentation available from the Trendnet web site - the Users Guide, FAQs and one on remote web access, all as pdf docs.  It's worth taking the time to read everything and understand the steps to get it working.  Even if you don't understand the ins and outs of network configuration, you can get it going by just carefully following their instructions.  The difficult part is making the camera visible via the Internet, because there is a lot of variability in how each local network connects to the Internet.With the older camera, I could view the video with Safari, but could not control pan and tilt.  Worked OK using ActiveX with IE (running in XP as a virtual machine on my Mac).  But the preset position settings did not work at all.  That's when I emailed Trendnet tech support, who recommended a firmware upgrade (to version 3.36).  That process was trickier than the original setup, but I got it done.  The user interface looks quite different from the older version (version 3.17).  But the really good news is that I can now control the camera from both Windows IE and Mac's Safari, including configuring and using preset positions.I can't view the video on my iphone, as it requires java.  However, I did find an app called Cam Viewer that works.  I don't see video in real time, but as a series of still images with a user-settable refresh rate.  Good enough to accomplish what I wanted.I was impressed with the Trendnet tech support - I got a prompt response to my email, the person was knowledgeable, and stuck with me through several questions until I got it all working.
