This Camera is so cool! I can't go into great detail with this review since im not too camera-geek-savvy so to speak but I can let you know what I have learned. I purchased the silver, just love the color, I also did not want to have to worry about paint chipping off or getting scrapped and finding another color underneath.I've had this for a few months now and like I said I am not to savvy but I have learned a few tricks and I am still learning as I go. The camera is small enough and is not really heavy or bulky in the right case. I did also get a screen protector for it.What I have learned- You can use this as a video camera too. I like how I can choose to zoom in really close or zoom out all at different stages. Also I have kids who refuse to stay still long enough to get a actual pic taken so this has setting for that- how cool right?The differences for indoor/outdoor use or lighting uses. This has all of that covered and does not take a whole lot of effort to figure that out. I still am struggling to get it to do some of the other neat things like switching from one thing to the next. I blame this on my lack of experience and NOT reading the manual.Charging- It has one of those flip plug chargers where the plugs that go into the outlet snap in when not in use and out when you need to plug it in. This is a bonus because the prongs will not get bent up when you storage it.The battery- Takes a few hours like most rechargeable things to take charge. I get a good few uses and a couple of hours each time. I have only had to charge it 2 times since I purchased it, but I do not sit there and spend all day taking photos either so I can't really give a specific time frame.This is definitely a very cool little camera for anyone who wants one that can do a little bit of everything for not a big price.
