I was traveling in Europe and in a moment of madness set my camera down and did not keep an eye on it. For some reason in ran away (along with my rain jacket).In some ways it was liberating traveling without a camera. While everyone else was trying to take a picture of Rembrandt's Night Watch, I could actually study the painting without distraction (other than all the other folks who were trying to take a photo without flash). Moreover, I did not want to spend time trying to find a camera store. In addition, I did not want to end up with a camera with a rechargeable battery that used a European or British end plug.Fortunately, when I was in York, UK, I walked by a large electronic store in the old town. I asked if they had a camera that takes AA batteries, and behold they produced a Nikon Coolpix L22. The price was about US $100.I found the camera easy to fit in my pocket to keep it safe. The Nikon system has a number of point and shoot modes. It is very basic and would not suit a serious photographer. I also have a Pentax Digital SLR, which is a lot to carry if all you want are some basic photos of your trip. I have only viewed the photos on my computer and most look sharp. I tried a lot of the various shooting modes, resulting in some poorly exposed photos if I used an improper mode.All in all I am pleased. It is a better camera (more megapixels) than the one that was stolen. I would have paid more for a camera with more user controls for exposure, so long as it used AA batteries. Unfortunately very few AA battery cameras are being sold anymore.
