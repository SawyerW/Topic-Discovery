I purchased the system just over the one year warranty.  Total investment with this system - 1,500.00 approx. (not including hiring an electrician to put outside outlets on my home to house the outside cameras).  When the system works it is wonderful, very impressed with the system. The problem was that for that one year of service, the system decided it was not going to work properly.First one camera could not be read.  Then the next day, four cameras could not be read.  After trouble shooting for three days, I discovered it was not the cameras, but possibly the CRM-100.Having to deal with the WILIFE SUPPORT was frustrating. The techs were pleasant enough, but getting the problem resolved seems to be an impossible task.My third call to Wilife, I spoke to the first tech I had on my first call and after telling him everything that I had done with trouble shooting, he concurred it had to be the CRM-100 (The part that plugs into the wall, and then into the USB on the computer). The tech set up a RMA number to get a replacement part at no charge. He told me that that part there were some problems with them.I got off the phone,happy that the three-day problem was resolved, went to fill out the info to send to the company to get the replacement part, and the online form wouldn't work.So, I called Wilife Support AGAIN to have them help me get the form sent in so I could get the replacement part.This last call to WILIFE SUPPORT was one of the biggest nightmare phone calls I have ever had with any support call I have done with any kind of electronic gear.  Turns out I was not getting any replacement part that the tech told me before on the previous phone call. I would have to pay $160 for a CRM-100 because my CRM-100 was a later model ---and that was probably why the online form did not work to get my replacement part.I would have to write a short book on this last phone call and will spare you with what had happened.
