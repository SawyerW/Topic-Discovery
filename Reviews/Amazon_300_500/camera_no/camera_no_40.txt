I took this on a 2 week trip to Italy.....I took 1158 pic's  and several movies, I was NOT disappointed in any way...the movie feature worked well, the avi's had a very good picture with no scramble pixilation issues, sound was very good as well... for it's size, a great feature..the pics are fantastic, I took several sepia and black and white shots as well.......My friend had a Casio 5.0 mega and the differences, once we had several photos delivered from Kodak were basically, so difficult to see that I am glad I paid less and bought this one...he was disappointed he didn't get better quality for HIS money...why pay way more for what amounts to almost unseen incremental advantage?On another note, I use photoshop extensively and cropped and zoomed many shots, unles you are trying to zoom into something very far away, you will still have a great shot, I took many architecural shots around Monuments in Rome and zoomed many of them, from 100 feet or so you are fine with this camera...you can still pull the details that interest you...The one draw back mentioned by others, which is a draw back for all LCD view cameras is; in bright light it may difficult to see through the viewer, but it takes almost direct light coming from behind to create this hazard, but as I said they all suffer that shortcoming.Other blurbs...its very small but easily manipulated..it fit into a zippered shirt pocket and its almost like you're not carrying a thing....the menu is intuitive....the battery re-charges within and hour......you can bring the cradle which comes with the camera, (which is compact as well)  buy a $10.00 voltage converter and recharge in countries with different voltage outlets...I had zero issues with it...great camera especially for this price....I won't have to upgrade for quite a while....  :-)
