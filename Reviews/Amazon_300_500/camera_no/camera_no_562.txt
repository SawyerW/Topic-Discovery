This camera is great!...Everything about is great. There are a ton of features like movie, red eye reduction and direct to television. (About the television, you won't get as high a quality as you would on the computer. You can turn off the LCD and use the viewfinder. Also 3 optical zoom may seem small, but it is really good. You don't need to get a Sony Mavica 10 Optical if you are going to use it to take pictures of you kids doing sports unless you are on the other side of the football field or in an ice rink. The camera is very self-explanatory except for the rapid-fire mode, but the manual will tell you how to use it. (I have hardly have had to use it.) Make sure if you use Windows to set your settings for you desktop to make the icons smaller. Also if you are planning to get a Canon Direct printer, forget it unless you plan to frame most of your pictures. One more thing, the Compact Flash cards and batteries. The Compact flash cards are very nice, you don't need a 128 card unless your going away for like 2 weeks, a 64 meg one will still give you hundreds of pictures and they are a lot cheaper. Also the batteries, they run really long, even the non-rechargeable, you still want to get the rechargeable though. I suggest that you get a rapid charger and 8 batteries at Radio Shack.This is a wonderful camera. I'd definitely buy this over a Sony Cybershot or an Olympus D-520. Both of those don't have sound on the movie and it may seem like you don't care now, but it does matter. Also the Olympus D-520 looks like the flash will break of and the Smart Media cards are as thin as 3 sheets as paper and look like they will snap in half.
