After using Fujifilm S8100fd for over a year, and finding what I can't do with a point-and-shoot camera, I decided, its time to get a DSLR. One of my friends passed on a news that there was a huge discount on some DSLR called Pentax K20D. That's how I came to be know about Pentax. When I researched about that camera, I thought I may have to go for K-7 instead of K20D. After losing 800EUR on ebay in purchasing a new K-7, I took some time to re-evaluate if I really need to spend some more money on the camera. After 3 months I found it's very difficult without a DSLR. Ok, then which one?I went to a camera shop and hand held some of the DSLRs from Canon and Nikon. All are wonderful cameras but they are bigger for my small hands. Then I found this little camera, which also uses 4xAA batteries as my Fuji. I found the features and the reviews about this little beast very interesting. No second thought, I bought it, this time from PhotoPlanet in Stuttgart. My first expedition was to Wilhelma in Stuttgart. I was impressed at my own skill and the camera capabilities. The color rendering is excellent and the handling is very very easy. The cross processing mode is very interesting. We don't know what we are going to get until we get it.I am not a person who wants to take photos in low light. But in some occasions this camera proved to be my asset.Cons-----1. The auto focus in live view is slow and I feel its of no real use in many scenarios2. The video can be far more better with manual control of aperture and shutter speed rather than tricking the camera to use some preset values in another shooting mode. You know this???3. Looks like a plastic box until you handle it. But far far better than the real plastics from SonyPros??? Everything else.See some photos I uploaded...
