I researched the compact digital camera options for some time. I had always used Canon cameras and was happy with them, but I thought I'd try a Nikon because of its strong reputation. I was intrigued at the possibility of shooting HD videos of the kids when I don't have a video camera handy. I got the camera with a leather case in the "kit" package. I put the camera in its case and went to a big box store to get the appropriate SDHC card for the camera. When I got home and went to get the camera out, the back of the camera just above the screen was cracked! I was livid! I am not a person who throws brand new electronics around and I couldn't believe how UN-durable this camera was proving to be. (My Canon A610 has served me well with many bumps and falls in 5 years and it's still working beautifully - but is bigger and heavier to carry around - thus its replacement.) I brought the camera back to the store where I bought it and the clerks told me they couldn't return it because of impact damage. I told them the camera had been in my purse to the store and back. That's it. They said maybe the camera was jostled or perhaps my cell phone bumped the camera. I didn't realize a camera couldn't tolerate a "jostle." They told me to put some electrical tape over the cracked case and move on.I thought I was buying a high-quality camera at $200. At least for that price I wanted it to last more than a few days without significant damage. If you get this camera, do yourself a favor and get a rigid camera case for it - unless you want it easily damaged. If you have a few extra bucks to get yourself a camera with a metal case rather than plastic, opt for the Nikon S8000. Or perhaps an impact-resistant camera. I wish I knew this before buying. I just thought they would naturally be metal or metal underneath with a plastic overlay. Not the case.
