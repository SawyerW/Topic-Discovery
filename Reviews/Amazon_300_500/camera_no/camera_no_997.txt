This is a review for those on the fence about this product. As of now, it's on sale at Amazon for a really good price. There isn't another like this camera that has as much quality for it's price. The camera is very sturdy, simple to use, and effective. The look on this camera is simply gorgeous. I bought the white swirl version of the Z30, and it really does look nice (and not feminine as I thought it might). Though there isn't a lens window and only an LCD screen, it's not much a of a drawback for me - though i can understand if others would want this feature. The LCD screen itself is conveniently large, and at the refresh rate that the camera gives, it's simply stunning to see in motion. Because the refresh rate is very high, it also produces top notch images. However I do need to mention that this camera is NOT powered on AA batteries but on Lithium batteries, which may bother some. However Fujifilm supplies this camera with 1 Lithium battery and 1 charger with the camera itself, so it really is not an issue for me. Also while viewing the pictures it moves unexpectedly slowly while browsing at full screen, so one might have to view all pictures as an album to effectively skim through the photos already taken. Again, not much of a deal breaker.This camera also was much much smaller than my previous one (Canon powershot a460) and much more efficient. If you are unsure about this product, and willing to pay the amount amazon offers, I suggest you buy it. The sale on amazon will not last (as there are only 9 and counting on sale), and there really isn't a better deal out there.Pros:10.1 megapixel camera produces high refresh rate and great imagessmall but yet sturdyVery appealing to just...stare atPackaged with lithium battery and chargersimple to use, yet with a lot of options for those wanting moreCons:uses Lithium instead of AAslow browsing speed of photos takenonly LCD viewing screen, no traditional camera viewer
