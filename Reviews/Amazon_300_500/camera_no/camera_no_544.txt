I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the Sony CD400,  CD300, as well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in  Peru. Last year we used 2 of the Sony floppy disk/memory stik cameras.  This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high  resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially  most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine. Here's what I found:  The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we  all thought it did the best job.  Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with  most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.  Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's  highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference,  plus it's not as heavy or bulky.  Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more  lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res  images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't  believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.  The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual  control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with  add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for  flash, etc., etc.   Finally! There is a great digital camera, it's just not this one.....check out the CD 300 series....about the same money but I think you will be a lot happier.
