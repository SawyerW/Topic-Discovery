This is the perfect camera for anyone who is just getting started in Digital Photography. It has two megapixels, which is plenty for me. Feel free to get more, but I have taken so many beautiful pictures with this camera when not even using Fine picture quality. The video mode is great. It is what really attracted me to this camera. It has audio and as much video can be taken as the memory card can hold, about 5 minutes on high quality, 20 minutes on medium, and 90 minutes on poor with my 128mb memory card. I suggest that you use medium quality so that you can still get fairly good videos, but conserve memory card space. You just have to remember that it is still a picture camera and not a video camera, so it will not be great quailty video. Now for the complaints. My first is that I can't figure out how to make auto flash come on when I start the camera. For some reason it always goes to no flash, so you have to remember to turn the flash on. The only other complaint is that the 16mb card is practically useless, so I went ahead and bought a 128mb card when I bought the camera. Depending on the different quality settings it can hold as many as 1700 pictures (640 x 480, standard quality) or as little as 120 pictures (1600 x 1200, fine quality). Generally speaking, I keep it on 1280 x 960 standard quality and I can get around 400 pictures. Finally, the USB connection is great. You just hook the camera up to the computer, install the drivers if you have an older version of Windows than XP (I didn't have to install any divers on my computer with XP), and turn on the camera. The computer detects it as an extra drive, just like a ZIP drive. In conclusion: for such a great camera at such an amazing price, what are you waiting for???
