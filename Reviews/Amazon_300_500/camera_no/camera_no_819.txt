This was my second Samsung Digimax camera.  After about four years and thousands of photos, my first Samsung (the very same product as this), had served its purpose well. The settings were still functioning, but at a slower rate and it became increasingly unreliable of "getting that shot". I was excited to find the exact camera on Amazon for $107 (w/shipping). The seller wrote in the description that the camera was new, and the only reason it was listed as "like new" was because there was a tear on the box.  Had I been smart, and being somewhat familiar with retail, I should have realized that the tear in the box was probably an indication that the item was a previous return because it was defective.  Regrettably, I did not test the camera when I received it in early February.  It was only when I was getting ready to use it for a party that I realized the camera was defective.  None of the settings worked.  Quite simply, the camera is worthless.  I contacted the seller after the alloted 30-day return, and as was his right, he refused (quite succinctly, btw) to accept it for an exchange or refund.  My biggest problem with this seller, and quite frankly my only problem with this seller, is that I am nearly certain this product was not tested before it was listed.  If it was, the seller has little to no knowledge of cameras -- even basic ones.  This camera is very user-friendly, provided it works.  All one needed to do was take a few test shots to find out that the camera was defective.  So, I'm going to share 50% of the blame with this seller -- I should have checked it immediately -- the seller probably would have honored the 30-day return policy.  That being said, it should have never been listed...and somebody should have known better.
