Had it for a couple of days and have it all set up, here are my obsevations:1. Pretty Easy to get going out of the box. Had it streaming video off the wired connection within 10 minutes. Wireless went pretty well, too. (using Windows Vista 64-bit)2. Picture quality is surveillance-cam quality, not web-cam quality, as might be expected. Wish it were better, but it will do.3. I figured out how to get it to stream over the internet with a little searching. Here is the short version of what you need: A) a router set up with a Dynamic DNS service (free ones are available) B) Forward the (static) local IP address of your camera through your router as another port. Now you can connect to it over the Internet at no cost.4. The Chrome web browser does not let me move the camera, or zoom in, or access somne other features.  MS Internet Explorer shows all of the features.Overall, I'm very satisified w/the camera. The only thing that costs it a star is the picture quality. I was hoping for better.UPDATE: The camera has locked up and failed completely. As of 2 weeks ago, the camera would not boot itself up when powered up. I cannot connect to the camera over my local network at all. Looks like a dead unit. I've contacted TRENDnet customer support and I'm in the process of sending it back to be replaced. On some other review websites, it seems others have had some problems with the machine dying on them (looks like high infant mortality rate). When it's working, it's pretty cool, but we'll see how the reliability is with this next one. Downgraded to 2 stars for now.UPDATE 2: Replacement camera has been working mighty fine. Customer support wasn't too painful, took about 4-6 weeks to get a replacement direct from TRENDnet. Upgraded back to 3 stars since the second one is working well.
