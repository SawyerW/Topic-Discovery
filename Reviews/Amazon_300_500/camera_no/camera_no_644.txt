When I first started shopping around for a digital camera I wasn't really sure what was important to me.  Finally I figured out that what I really wanted was:1)not to replace my normal camera so 2Mpixels would do just fine2)minimum 3x optical zoom (didn't care about digital)3)something small4)under $4005)movie mode with soundNow that I have the Sony P2 here are my likes and dislikes:Likes -1)it is one of the smaller cameras out there - great for travel2)I love the movie mode, which is only limited by the size of your memory stick3)I like the fact that you can turn off the digital zoom so that you don't accidentally use it4)The menu system is intuitive and easy to use5)The battery is much smaller than I expected - the camera is not heavy at all (yet still has a solid feel)6)You can plug the camera right into your TV to view the photos and movies7)You can easily change between NTSC and PAL video formats which will be great when I go back home to the UK for a visit8)Has automatic scene lighting for when you are in a dark place - works really well9)Rechargable battery holds quite a good life - easily enough for a full day's outingDislikes -1)You have to wait much longer between shots than with a conventional point and click camera (2-3sec maybe)2)I knew the 16Mb Memory Stick wasn't going to be nearly enough so I just ordered a 128Mb one with the camera (more money)3)I like having a rechargable battery, but the down side is if it runs out you've had it unless you carry a spare (which are small and light, but again - more money to spend)Bottom Line -I personally would buy this camera again.  It ended up being a little more than I really wanted to spend, once I added on extra memory and spare battery, but I haven't regretted it.  I am also contemplating getting a case for it to protect the viewing screen, but I don't think this is a requirement as long as you are careful.I didn't give this 5 stars because of the shot delay and the fact the you really need to buy extra memory.
