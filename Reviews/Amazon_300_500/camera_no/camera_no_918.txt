I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect camera -- one that takes great pictures & video, has a nice long zoom, is easy to use and portable.  I had 2 digital cameras already, one being a Kodak 643 (reliable, but just okay) and the other a Nikon Coolpix S550 that was a big disappointment. Both cameras take pretty lousy pictures and video in low light, as does my Canon camcorder.  This time I read lots and lots of reviews.  I read reviews on camera websites, and I read consumer reviews on Amazon and other websites.  The Panasonic Lumix ZS3 was, hands down, the winner for the type of camera I was searching for.  I went to camera stores, too, and was told by one salesman at a major electronics store that, although his store didn't sell this particular camera, it was much better than the Canon that they did sell.  He then reached into his pocket and produced his own camera...a ZS3!  That was the deciding factor for me, so I watched the prices on Amazon and ordered my new camera in February when the price fell to $229.  I certainly have not regretted my purchase.  This camera is wonderful.  The pictures are stunning, it works well in the automatic mode, and the HD videos are great, too.  We have played videos on our 46" hi-def Sony TV, and they are gorgeous.  My camcorder only gets used now on rare occasions when I need someone to take video at the same time I am taking pictures. Despite the fact that it has a 12x zoom, the camera is small enough to pop into my purse, or even in a jacket or pants pocket. The wide angle lens is great for group or outdoor shots.  I would recommend buying at least one extra battery, as the supplied battery doesn't last terribly long.  If you are looking for a camera that is easy to use and takes amazing photos and video, buy the ZS3.  I can't wait to photograph fireworks on the 4th of July!
