The DEFENDER GK300-7M2 HANDS FREE 2-WIRE COLOR VIDEO INTERCOM SYSTEM is awesome.  Seriously awesome.  Not a real techie person, I was worried about the installation and whether or not I would be able to set this up without any help.  Reading the directions, etc. took me a few minutes but it was relatively easy. The hardest part was actually trying to secure it to my front porch.  Because of the bricks, I decided I could better use the DEFENDER VIDEO INTERCOM system out by my pool; especially when my children are swimming.  Hands free, I was able to keep track of everything going on in the range of the video camera -- I envision using this during the summer to keep track of what my children are doing in the back yard, especially the pool.  It is the perfect "eye" for me to use when I have to run into the house to do something quickly.The camera's clarity and the audo alert are what makes the DEFENDER GK300-7M2 the perfect monitoring system.  I was alerted when testing this out -- my husband being the person walking up to the camera.  I was able to see him without straining or searching through a haze to figure out who it was -- even at night because the DEFENDER has night vision.  Night vision is the greatest I would think especially if you live alone.  I was able to see my test subject get out of his vehicle (we tested the DEFENDER in the back yard around the pool as well as at the front door), walk across the yard as well as come into the camera's view from the side.  Clear picture, audio monitoring.  It was so much fun to play with!I would recommend the DEFENDER to anyone wanting to feel safe in their home.  I would also think using this in maybe a baby's room would be a pretty cool thing to do as well.  That way, you could hear the baby cry and even watch the baby sleep!Natalie S. for Amazon Vine
