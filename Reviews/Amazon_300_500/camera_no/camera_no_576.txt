picture quality is awesome as everyone has mentioned. unlike some people pointed out that flash is somewhat weak, it takes awesome photos in complete dark. good: movie mode is just perfect for creating 30 second 320 x 240 clips ready to upload on the internet. unlike camcorder, you don't have to go through the hassle of capturing and convert to internet friendly file. software comes with the camera transfers everything in CF card to harddisk automatically and you could upload files straight to geocities for your friends to view them across the country.(BTW: 3.5MB file per every 30 second clips it creates. it's 30 seconds at max PER SHOOTING regardless of CF size. you can have many 30 seconds clips stored in your card but you can't shoot 40 seconds straight because after every 30 seconds, there is 3 second delay while writing information to CF card. don't get confused you could start up a internet broadcast with this camera like 30 minute show.) Manual option is really fun to work with and it creates professional looking photos. (take a picture in really dark room, perhaps with single candle light, set long shutter at 15 seconds exposure. you will get amazing soft looking photo). bad: in movie mode, light exposure is fixed to the point when it starts capturing. in other word, if the light condition changes darker or brighter in the middle of shooting, you will only be left with audio and white or black screen. (it does not adapt to new surrounding while shooting) ugly:what am I suppose to do with 8MB flash card now?!?!?! psc-300 bag is perfect fit for this camera. I really had heck of time getting hold of it. I finally order it from gateway accessories online after driving around all over the town. It really should've come with the camera in sake of protecting LCD.don't forget to get an extra battery. have fun.
