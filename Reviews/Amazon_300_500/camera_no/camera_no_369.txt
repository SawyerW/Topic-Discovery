Hugely disappointing camera. Mediocre flash photo results, purple fringes, severe noise in low light, and intermittent issues. Positives are good video results, bright LCD screen, and good-enough results in bright light. The battery compartment latch is useless, and has to be held together with a rubberband.This is my first Nikon camera. The combination of the price and the fact that it is a Nikon led me to purchase this camera. I have been using Canon cameras for 15+ years, and was very eager to try this barebones point-and-shoot Nikon. Needless to say, it has been a huge disappointment. Maybe I got a lemon, or maybe at the price this is the best I should expect to get.The positives:- Cute size.- Attractive red color.- LCD screen is bright.- Video results are good.- No settings to tinker around with, so a good option for someone looking for a simple camera.Negatives- The latch that holds the AA batteries in the hold is flimsy. The grip that holds the latch shut is so thin that the latch pops open at the slightest touch. You need to use a rubberband to hold the latch in place.- Photo results are very mediocre. In bright light the results are ok, but you can see a purple tinge at the edges. In low light the results are very grainy. The graininess is the result of the camera automatically choosing a high ISO rating.- In low light the flash does not do a good job of adequate lighting.- The photos look to be very much on the soft side. It's either that or they look out of focus.- Sometimes the camera just does not shoot. You have to switch off and switch on the camera back to take a photo.Nonetheless, for those looking for a basic digital P&S; I would not recommend this camera to anyone.
