I have owned a Panasonic camera since 2004 and loved the quality of pics and the ease of use. I have gifted one to my sister also. I had to retire my first panasonic after 6 years of use because while taking it out of the bag, I accidentally banged it on the wall lightly but the lens got stuck so I decided to buy a new camera because cameras nowadays are lighter and smaller even with the super zoom and my old panasonic has 12x zoom and was a bit big. After doing a lot of research on other brands, I knew I would end up buying lumix since I had tried nikon,olympus,fujifilm and a canon in the same price range and none had compared to the lumix. I am a loyal fan of panasonic and all the positive reviews and my own trials of different cameras led me to buy this camera. I got it on one day sale last month that amazon was having this camera for $99 the next day it went back to $130 even though it was still on sale original price being $179. I love everything abt this camera. Only thing that I don't like with this camera is that when the flash is not on indoors some pix are blurry. So I hope they improve that, I took a lot of pix with this camera when we went to Disney world and some shows in DW didn't allow use of flash so those pix ended up blurry but most place you can use your flash indoors and nighttime so it's not a major problem. Daytime pix are awesome and crisp and I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for cheap and best and a super zoom camera. Delivery was so quick, amazon said it'll take 5-7 days and it arrived within 3 days of ordering so that was awesome too! Very pleased with Amazon and the camera!
