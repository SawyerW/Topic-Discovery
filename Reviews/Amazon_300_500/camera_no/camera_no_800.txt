I was looking for the best 2 AA powered *pocket* camera - Something fairly thin without the handhold bulge of the Nikon p50 or the Canon A570. Price was not that important, but it seems that no one makes a really high end 2 AA powered camera. All of these are pretty cheap (under $150). I already have a Canon S5IS (uses 4 AAs) and did not want a new battery type for my small camera (Sanyo Eneloops work great BTW). I bought the L15 after looking for months.Good: Uses 2 AAs, thin enough, some nice picture modes (like best shot), image stabilization, pretty good image quality (but I am not a pro).Not so good (or at least strange):Autofocus struggles at times, and not always when light is low. I'm not sure why.Flash recycle is slow and entire camera locks during flash cycling - but this is so for all 2xAA powered cameras so I can't fault NIkon for this. It would be nice if someone solved this however.Plastic case (but it *is* only $130)Not necessarily bad, but could be better:Menus are not complex (that's good) but extra button pushes are required that should not be needed. On Canons, pressing the shutter immediately kicks out of any menu and shoots. Nikon requires you to get out of the menu first.Changing a setting like flash, requires you to go to the selection and then hit ENTER. The ENTER is an extra unneeded button push.The flash always seems to do the red eye "double flash" no matter what the setting.Wider angle (like 28mm) wide setting would be nice.Summary: This is a pretty good camera but with compromises. Given the limited choices for this type of camera, I'd buy it again, but if Canon made an SD870is that ran from 2 AAs, I'd have bought that. Unfortunately, they don't. Now that that hybrid NiMH batteries don't self-discharge, these are great cheap batteries for digital cameras. I really hope to see some high quality 2 AA compacts soon, but this will tide me over for now.
