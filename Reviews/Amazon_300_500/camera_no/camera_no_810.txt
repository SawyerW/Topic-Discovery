I did a lot of research before settling on a Nikon camera.  Apparently I didn't do enough research when I selected the Nikon Coolpix L14.  This camera made me think twice about the supposedly top brand of cameras.  In the two years I've had this camera, I've sent it to the repair center twice for the lens becoming off track.  It's not that I didn't take good care of it.  Sometimes when I turned it on, the lens does not open right - "lens error" showed up too often.  If that didn't make me hate this camera, it was the picture quality that did.  I hated asking other people to take a picture for me because they don't understand that whole face detection and anti shake setting.  Basically you have to press a button to activate this setting, hold down the picture button for a couple seconds, allow it to focus on the subject for another few seconds and then take the picture.  Without doing this, portrait pictures come out blurry.  What a waist of time!  Also the shutter speed is annoyingly slow.  My final complaint is a general complaint about all digital cameras - battery life.  Even the Energizer Digital Camera batteries did not last more than a day or two of vacation picture taking.  My boyfriend and his mother also have the same camera with the same problems.  So, no, it's not just me with these complaints.  I suppose if you are looking for a camera with advanced complicated settings, this might be a good prospect.  Yet, all I wanted was a nice point and shoot camera for everyday use.  My sister recently bought the Casio Exilim camera.  I was hesitant at first because I've always seen Casio as a cheap quality brand.  In no time I was borrowing her camera and I just recently bought one myself!  The shutter speed is fast, I love the rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the picture quality is amazing and best of all no blurry pictures!!
