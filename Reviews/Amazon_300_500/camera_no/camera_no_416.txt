I bought this camera because I wanted a camera that could both take high quality pictures of objects from a far away distance and took HD video.  The Quality of the pictures of this camera are good from a far distance.  I could easily read signs when zoomed in that I could not read from looking at them.  I am a structural engineer so I needed something that I could read the structure types and be able to idetify the structures from a distance, in this it did its job.Now the down side of the camera.  The video quality of the video was excellent as well as the sound. The HUGE overlooked flaw is that recording indoors or out there is a high pitched squealing noise in the backround of every video no matter if it was played on lcd, computer, tube tv, or the camera itself.  I tried the camera instore and it did the same thing (after I had taken it home and tested in depth).  I have also seen example videos online where you can here the distinctive squeel.If you are getting this camera for the picture quality only, look no further; but if like me you wanted HD video as well I would suggest looking at another camera.Update***I just purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3, and wow.  When comparing the photos I had saved with the Nikon and now the new photos I have taken of the exact same objects, the Panasonic clearly wins big.  Along with my complaint of the Nikon's video the Panasonic also has a clearer HD video and stereo sound with no annoying whine in the background.  And now the best part. I purchased it off amazon at $235, which is $65 less than the Nikon. I would highly recommend checking out the Panasonic Lumix first.
