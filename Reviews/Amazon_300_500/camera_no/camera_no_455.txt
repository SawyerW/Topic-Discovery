Well I decided to purchase this model when the price dropped to $129.I will update after I receive the camera. Before my DMC-FH3 broke, see below, I was very satisfied with the quality of the images.Update: Panasonic CS called me wanting to correct the mistake and replace the Pink camera for a Black model. I must credit them for stepping up. I had already purchased a new camera and the Pink model is already planned as a gift.I am looking to replace a DMC-FH3 with this model.But hesitant to purchase another Panasonic camera after my recent exchange experience.Overall I have always been satisfied with Panasonic products up until my recent camera exchange.Panasonic has a very poor exchange policy. You get a Refurbished Camera, Not necessarily the same model or color. You also pay for freight to ship it to Texas.--------------Panasonic Product Exchange Notice --------------In accordance with your model's warranty coverage, your product will be exchanged instead of repaired.  The exchange model will vary depending on availability, and will be of the same, similar, or comparable model in a factory remanufactured condition.  Color match is not guaranteed, and will depend on availability.My DMC-FH3K broke after just a few months.  The lens would no longer retract fully into the camera body the majority of the time, and had to be coaxed by repeatedly turning on and off. It also displayed an Error message saying to turn the camera off then back on again to resume.I sent my Black camera into the Panasonic McAllen TX Exchange Center and received back a Refurbished Pink DMC-FH3P (as in Pink) camera.  Seriously, a Pink camera to replace a Black model???I had even sent a cover letter with Bold Type stating "Please replace with another Black (in color) model camera", which they ignored, or perhaps sent Pink as a sick joke.On the Plus side.  I now have a Refurbished Pink camera to give as a graduation present to a young niece.But now I need to purchase a new camera.
