Wow, this camera is just freakin' awesome. I bought it to do some amatuer photography and was really impressed at the quality of the pictures. The flash is very impressive, I took pictures in complete darkness to test it, and it did not disappoint. I love the video feature as well, it amazed me how well it recorded the video and audio, almost picture perfect. And when I uploaded the videos to my computer they came out so big, another surprise. I was expecting 320x120 picture quality but its more than double that size.The intelligent picture mode it has, has the perfect settings for beginners who do not know how to configure the manuel mode settings. The only thing I would suggest to those beginners is to know when to turn on/off the flash. (because it can ruin some photos, it has nothing to do with this particular model but for instance, if you are shooting from behind a window at night and the flash is on the flash will reflect off the window and all you will get is a really bright picture and some of the window) I much prefer the manual settings because this mode has more options as to how to shoot each pphotograph.Another feature I love about this camera is face tracking and AF tracking. In face tracking mode the camera can identify faces of the individuals in any particular photo. (Very handy for focus and illiminating blurry pictures) Also, the AF tracking is very useful when it comes to shooting moving subjects. (I tested this feature as a passenger in a car, I was once again very impressed, no blurriness at all!) One down side  to this feature is it its almost too good, you must be ready in advance to take photos in this mode if you are using flash in manual settings)All & all, I'm very impressed, Amazon has never disappointed me, I bought this camera based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews and looking at its basic features and available accessories. This camera has earned a place as my next portable buddy along with my cell phone and iPod.
