I've had this camera for about a year.  I normally shoot with a 35mm SLR, but purchased this camera for informal, point-and-shoot gatherings and occasions when I didn't want to hassle with a large camera.Benefits:1. It's extremely small and handy to carry around in your pocket or purse for birthday parties and outings.2. It's durable and has survived repeated droppings.3. The pictures are sharp and crisp when properly focused.Drawbacks:1. The flash is blindingly bright.  Whenever you use it, prepare for your subjects to look like they've got a 2,000-watt white spotlight shining on them like crime scene photographs, and the background will fade to nearly black.  When used in indoor settings like restaurants, the brightness of the flash is just ridiculous.  Think "mug shot."2.  Camera shake/blur.  When the flash is not in use and you're indoors, it's very difficult to get a clear shot with this camera.  The problem with the flash has led me to try to avoid using it altogether so that I can get better color and even light, which means I've had a problem with camera shake/blur in low-light conditions.  For example, with the flash turned off it takes multiple attempts to get a blur-free shot in my living room, even in the middle of the day with the window blinds open.4.  The removeable battery.  You have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it, by inserting it in the battery charger that is provided.  This seems like an unnecessary extra step to me.  Why not just design it so that you can plug the charger directly into the camera like other digital point-and-shoots?For casual photographer who will be shooting mostly outdoors and desires a very portable, durable camera, this camera will work for you.But if you will be shooting mainly indoors or with flash, avoid this camera.I recommend the Kodak EasyShare series as a good alternative.  I don't own one, but I've been impressed with the quality of low-light pictures (indoors) that these cameras produce.
