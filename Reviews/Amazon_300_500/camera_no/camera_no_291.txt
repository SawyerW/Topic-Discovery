It all started at the Chrismas boat parade party in Huntington Harbor, CA. I noticed this guy with a small camera taking pictures across the room. I could see the viewfinder screen from across the room, and it was clear. I just had to see that camera up close. The user was from Hong Kong, where everything is knocked off and relatively less expensive than the US. That impressed me, because, not only was the user very knowledgeable about cameras, he owned a fairly large company and could afford any camera. Why did he pick Pentax? I looked the camera over, he let me take some shots. I made a quick decision, I had to have one. The camera just felt good in my hand. That night I found a new one for $219.00 on the inet and bought it from a new camera discounter. (Buy Digital)OK, now I have it, what do I think? I think 5 stars. 5 MP, operates on 2 AA batteries, huge LCD RGB quality viewfinder, quality metal construction, no flimsy doors like the Canon SD300, no red eye, easy to understand and operate controls, fantastic pictures, flash works for more than 6 feet away, pictbrige photo transfer. The only negative is it does not come with a memory card, you have to buy one. The camera comes with 11MB, built in. I might mention that I also have a Nikon D70, I tend to grab the Pentax first, it's much easier. I'd love to see a comparison between this camera and the highly reviewed Canon SD300.Reviews are important before buying a camera, but if an educated camera enthusiast from Hong Kong says good things about a camera, especially, if a bargain price is not an issue, it meant more to me than 15 Canon reviews. My observation proved to be accurate. If you don't believe me, buy on, if you don't think it's excellent, keep the box and resell it on Ebay.
