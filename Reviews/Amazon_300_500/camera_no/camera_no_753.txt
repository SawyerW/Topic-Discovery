The "HP PhotoSmart E317 - Digital Camera" is a very cheap digital camera with mediocre quality; however, it is extremely easy to use, making it not too bad a camera.First of all, the camera is extremely flimsy.  Just the slightest touch will turn it off once it is on which can be extremely annoying when you need it for that split second to snap a really quick picture.  Also, some of the little minor parts, such as the battery cover, break off extremely easily, and you have to go to extreme measures to make it stay on once it has broken.  In addition to these two faults, the picture quality isn't the best.  It is slightly blurry, and it gives people and animals a really bad red eye even with the special feature on that is supposed to get rid of red eye.  Also, after you take a video and get it onto a computer to view, the words and actions are severely out of sync, causing some confusion in the video.  Another con is that the camera destroys batteries very quickly, and unless you invest in some rechargeable batteries, you will be using about 2 batteries every 30-60 minutes with this camera.Even though there are some major cons to this camera, it still manages to have some pros to it.  For instance, the camera is extremely easy to use.  There isn't much that you have to learn how to operate causing even the most mechanically challenged to be able to use the camera.  Another positive feature of the camera would be that it has a relative decent memory storage.  You probably still want to pick up a memory card to be able to take many photos/videos, but the memory on the camera will suffice for quite a few pictures or about an hour of video.So, overall, it's not necessarily a BAD camera for the price, but there are many cameras out there that are much better for just a little bit more money.  I would have to say I recommend getting one of those and giving this camera a pass.
