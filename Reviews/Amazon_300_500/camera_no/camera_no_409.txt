I bought this refurbished Nikon S8000 (a black one) since Nikon discontinued it so quickly.  I bought a new one when they first came out (a red one)and was so pleased with it I wanted to get a spare.  My normal camera is a Nikon D700 which is huge, cumbersome, and downright useless when spur of the moment pictures arise.  The Nikon 8000 can focus down to 1/4"!  If I can't read some fine print, see a scratch in a gem stone, or really really get in close to something to get a shot, I take a photo with it.  It has 14.1 meg pixel resolution and a 10x optical lens with noise reduction software.  It is my perfect pocket point and shoot.  I can print some awesome enlargements (20 x 20 and above) from the jpeg files and it is super in low light levels.  Yes, it has some drawbacks. But you learn rather quickly to get around them.  The flash is sort of in the wrong place especially since I am left handed.  However, remembering where it is and staying out of its way is the only way to go with any camera.  It is also a bit delicate and the leaf shutter over the lens when it is closed can get a little sticky.  So I always keep my hands and other things away from it and use a puff of air to clean it out after a couple of uses.  Thus it has never failed me.  I bought an extra battery and use a 32 gig SD chip so I can take photos forever if need be.  Yes my Nikon D700 can take marvelous RAW and JPEG photos at extremely low light levels at up to 8 fps.  However, to have a superb point and shoot that takes photos at .75 fps and fits in my shirt pocket more than overcomes the trade offs. I use them both.  I love them both.  Raymond
