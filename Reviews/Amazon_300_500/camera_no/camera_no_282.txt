I just bought Pentax optio s4i on Wed, and it came on Friday, amazon is amazing about shipping. When I got the camera, there is no power in the battery, so I had to recharge it, took about 1 hour or so, not too bad to recharge. The user guide is pretty straight forward and explains everything I want to know about aking pictures, different modes and shooting movies. And I can easily use it now without referring back to the book. I put in a 256MB SD card and at the second smallest size (pixel) setting combined with best quality (3 stars)-which is optical for printing out 4x6 pictures, you can take 450 pictures. At the higest setting for both size and quality with a 256mb card, you can take about 87 pictures. I find that really good, and since I usually don't print out anything 8x11, I would set it to a smaller size and get more pictures out of it. And to comment on a previous user about fitting into an altoids can. He is right the bulging part on the left where the strap holder is does make it a little difficult to fit it into the tin, but what i did was stretch the left side of the tin a little by my thumb, and now it fits nicely without being too tight. The top doesn't close completelyy due to an uneven surface but it closes enough so that it wouldn't pop open by itself. What I would do is to go to a candy or toy store to get a cute coin purse that's that size and put in there. Coin purse fabric is softer so I think would protect it more. I have yet to print anything from this camera but i will try soon and see.
