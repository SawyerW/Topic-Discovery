I ordered 5 of these digicams last year for my workplace.  We use these to create training aids and to document problems and/or unusual situations.  Since then, I've recommended this camera to 4 of my friends, and they are all quite satisfied with the A70s performance.There are better digicams out there, but for the price, the A70 cannot be beat.  The A70s are fairly user-friendly.  There are many technologically impaired people at my workplace, and I've managed to train them on the most basic features of this camera with little effort.  And for those who require more advanced features (f/stop, shutter speed, exposure compensation,...), the A70 will provide satisfaction (although some of these features are buried deep in menus).The A70s size is compact, though not quite as small as many of the super-compact digicams (Canon ELPH, Pentax Optio, Casio Exilim, Olympus Stylus,...).  But for those with larger hands, the A70 is very easy to handle.  When I am using a super-compact digicam, I often feel as if it will slip out of my fingers.  The larger grip of the A70, however, provides a wonderful sense of security.The biggest gripe I have with this camera is the lack of a RAW or TIFF mode.  Granted, most users won't use these formats, but some of the more advanced users may appreciate them.We've printed pictures up to 8x10 inches with pretty decent results.  Most point and shooters will find the A70 to more than adequately suit their needs (when was the last time you had an 8x10 made?).If you do get the A70, definitely invest in a larger CompactFlash card (consider 128MB).  And don't forget to purchase a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a recharger.If you think you need higher resolution, the recently released 4MP Canon A80 may suit your needs.  The A80 also comes with a swiveling LCD, which is quite helpful in taking self-portraits or shooting from an unusual angle (it also makes an excellent real-time "reverse-mirror").
