I had a Lumix a few years ago, the picture quality was always excellent, and unfortunately it got broken.  I made a huge mistake of buying a different brand, which I quickly found could only take half decent pictures outside in good daylight, and was impossible to use in low light environments.I read all of the great reviews here and bought the Lumix ZS3, I am really glad I did!  I am a basic user, I like taking pictures of things going on around me, I don't want to be fiddling with the controls while the situation disappears.  This is certainly the camera for that, unlike many other brands, you can hit the on switch and straight away the Lumix is ready to go, the automatic settings are flawless, and I've yet to get a picture which is of not excellent quality.  The optical image stabilization function works extremely well, especially for those of us who don't have the steadiest of hands.  I also bought a 8GB Sdhc card separately, and according the manual I can take well over 1000 pictures at 10MP with this.The only thing I have not tried out is the HD video function, as it doesn't come with the specific HDMI cable, and must be ordered separately.  It does however come with an old school AV cable so you can watch your videos on TV in SD, until your new cable arrives.  The battery charger is well thought out, you can leave it sitting in the electrical wall socket, and push your battery in/out whenever you need to, without having to unplug it.I highly recommend the ZS3 to the average user who wants to take high quality pictures quickly, while the camera does a flawless job of taking care of all the adjustments for you.When this camera gets outdated, I'll be looking to buy another Lumix.
