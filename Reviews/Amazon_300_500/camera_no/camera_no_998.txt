This is my first actual digital camera that wasn't attached to a phone/video camera/etc., and i was excited to be getting it. Well, I've had my fujifilm for about a month an a half now, and it was really nice until a couple weeks ago, when a good chunk of plastic fell off. Now, i don't treat my camera like royalty, and I'm a student, so i often put it in my backpack with  my all my other necessities, however i do have a nice bag for it, and never dropped it more than a few inches, so this was a surprise to me. And now, for some reason, when I turn my finepix on, there are a bunch of blinking white lines across the screen, and if i leave it on long enough in this condition, the screen goes completely white. So, i tried to rescue this camera myself, so i unscrewed the plastic back, (which was very difficult because in addition to the 4 phillips head screws, there is one 3-notched screw on the bottom, that none of my screwdrivers would easily fit into) and picked up the screen that had some sticky stuff on the back, which was messing with the connection to the lens, and viola! all was well. Then the next day the same thing happened. only this time it was spoaratic. My warranty is still valid, and I am considering returning it, but doing so would cost me more money, and time. And this may be a one time thing, but I don't want to wait until my warranty expires to fine out. do yourself a favor. Get a canon.***EDIT***I sent my camera in, and since there are some miniscule cracks on the cheap plastic covering of the camera and the battery door, fujifilm REFUSES to fix it, they think i caused the internal damage. They want $53, nearly what i paid for the camera. So today I bought an olympus digital camera from goodwill for $6 that already works better. DO NOT BUY FROM FUJIFILM.
