I've had this camera for over 1 year now and I am nothing but satisfied.  When I decided that I wanted a digital camera it was important for me to get one that was small enough not to impede on my active lifestyle yet did not compromise on technical ability.  Sony's DSC P7 is the perfect mix.  I travel a lot internationally and so I just put it in my pants pocket and keep the charger in my luggage.  You can snap about 300-400 pictures before the battery dies.  The menu functions are very user friendly and allow you to highly customize the settings.There is also no compromise on other aspects.  The movie quality is not perfect but really good and the sound is excellent.  Another thing that is annoying about most digital cameras is how long it takes for the picture to snap.  With this one, it takes the picture as soon as you push the button.  This is also true with the movies.  I know on some digital cameras when you are done recording a movie you have to wait a while for it to "save" to the flash memory.  Not with this one; Sony seems to have gotten the right idea in that, flash memory should work in a flash.  The only problem I have with it is that sometimes in extremely low-light conditions when the flash is imperative, you have to wait about 6 seconds for the flash to build up.  But just to reiterate, this doesn't happen in the light.  The other cool thing is the memory stick.  You can get 512MB sticks and you can even buy generic ones (from the same company that makes them for Sony) at half the price Sony charges.  The picture quality is outstanding.  The user can select a variety of qualities along with visual effects such as B&W, etc...To recap: It responds quickly to user commands, picture quality is excellent, it's small & light, it's not that expensive, and the movies have excellent quality sound with very good video.Bottom Line:  I'm a tough customer but the Sony DSC7 gets 5-stars because it deserves it.
