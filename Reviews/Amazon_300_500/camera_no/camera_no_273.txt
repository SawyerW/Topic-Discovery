I've had this camera now for a little more than 2 years and I am ready to throw it out the window. I take flower and plant closeups as a hobby and the focus zones for the lens are unpredictable and uncontrollable even in manual mode. About 60-70 percent of the closeups I take come out Completely Useless because the camera has chosen to focus on an element in the frame that I did not want to emphasize. For example, a leaf to the side will come out sharp, while the flower itself is an utter blur, even on "macro" mode, although the frame was composed with the flower at dead center. What's worse, when the image is previewed on the screen on the camera back, it appears to be fine!It does an adequate job with meta-pictures (whole scenes) but try to zoom in on an interesting insect or a tender bloom and you will soon go bald as a rock with frustration over the results. I used to take film pictures and got quite practiced at it, so this camera really annoys me because it refuses to behave like a standardized photographic instrument -- that is, when you point the lens at something and have it dead center in the frame, the lens is supposed to look for edges on that dead-center object and calculate focus accordingly.This piece of "equipment," however, has a mind of its own, so you wind up with lovely background foliage and a muddy blur of color in the middle where a sharp image of a bloom should be.In short, if your photography makes any sort of technical demands and requires a sharp instrument to assist, Buy Something Else.If all you're looking for is a good snappy camera to take pictures of groups of friends or wide vistas, this camera will probably be fine.
