I am a professional portrait photographer who is incredibly picky about cameras. I've owned 3 point-n-shoots in the last few years, because I am also a Mom and wanted something small to keep in my purse for the random moments when my DSLRs weren't around. Every one of those cameras drove me batty and proved a waste of my money. I decided to give the pocket camera One More Try when I read about the ZS3, especially with its inclusion of HD Video. I LOVE this camera! Love it!!On my family beach vacation, I only broke out the DSLR twice for some artistic shots of my kids. The ZS3 stayed in my beach bag the rest of the time, and I am thrilled with the shots it captured. The images are clear, crisp, with beautiful color and detail. The exposures have been excellent. The 12X zoom is a great reach, and the shots are still clear zoomed in. The shutter lag on this camera is better than any PNS I've ever used. It's no SLR, but it's darn good for what it is! The burst mode also works great for stopping the action. And the HD video is just as great. I don't know that I'll bother picking up my camcorder again now that I have this.My only two minor negatives: the video record button is in an awkward spot, and I've accidentally hit it a few times just holding the camera. But it's not bothersome enough that it would affect my 5-star rating for the camera. Negative #2 is the ACVHD Lite video/software which is not Mac compatible. All of my computers are Mac, so this hiccup is disappointing, but again not bothersome enough to alter my opinion of the camera. I just shoot regular HD video instead and the problem is solved for me. Ok, so maybe I'd give this camera 4.5 stars if I could, but 4 stars would be too low so I stuck with 5.I never imagined I could like, much less LOVE, a point and shoot camera like I do this one. It's fantastic.
