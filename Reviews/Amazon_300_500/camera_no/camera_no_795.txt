I've hasd this camera for about ten days now and after a couple of days I'd already put a pretty troubled review on the UK Amazon site with three stars (I wanted to be generous)  And I can see what the two negative reviewers are on about; I've had those problems as well.  But getting into this camera more now I find that I'm carrying it everywhere as it's pocket sized, and taking pictures all over the place.  But to get the best you need to use the programmes - there's 5 settings for pictures and 5 for white balance.  The settings bring the best out of daylight photos or indoor electic light pictures.  The picture programmes get the camera set up for automatically getting the right settings for a portrait or a landscape.  The camera takes it's best pictures in good lighting and without or not much of the 3x zoom.  Low light is difficult, even with the flash it's not great - just OK - same as any inexpensive digital camera - not great, just keep it real steady.  But at this price, what do you expect from a quality manufacturer like Nikon (- a press camera at a disposable price?  Not going to happen is it?)  Take a look at the photos I've put on the UK Amazon site with my UK review of the Nikon L14.Given it's price and the pretty good photos I've taken once I got used to it, I think it deserves somewhere between 3+ and 4.Update - Well in the end I sent it back to Nikon to have the focusing sorted - it came back a couple of weeks later a Little better so I gueaa this is the best it can get.  Anyway at the price it's not too bad - it's the least expensive of all the cameras we have in my family
