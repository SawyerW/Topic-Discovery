We sell this camera at the store I work, and I think it's the best one Fuji has put out.  I have made several test prints from it and have been highly impressed:  excellent color clarity, sharpness, and the camera is a joy to use.First things first:  I have to applaud Amazon[.com] for advertising this camera as a 3.3mp.  Buyer beware--although you might see Fuji and/or other stores advertise this as being a 6mp camera, this is after the interpolation process that Fuji cameras use.  The sensor in this camera is 3mp, and through a special process the camera goes through, you end up with a 6mp image.  It looks good, but not as good as a picture from a *true* 6mp camera.  Go to Fuji's website to read more about the process.  Regardless of that, this camera is fully capable of making beautiful prints sized 8x10 and even larger.The camera is made really well.  The body is lightweight and feels "right" in your hands.  I was kind of shocked to see the use of AA batteries.  Normally they last no longer than an hour or so in digital cameras.  Somehow Fuji has managed to fix all that.  I use this camera all the time, and the batteries last several hours.  The screen as well as the electronic viewfinder are very clear and easy on the eyes.Typically the movie mode that digital cameras have are pretty poor quality.  The Fuji's movie mode features a 30fps rate and fairly good sound quality.  The best I've seen in a digital camera.Other features on this camera that really stand out are the implementation of a 6x OPTICAL zoom, a manual focus ring (really useful at times), manual modes, and a hot shoe for a flash.  Unfortunately the hot-shoe flash is not TTL and will require you to do manual settings, but at least it's there.A good effort from Fuji--highly recommended.
