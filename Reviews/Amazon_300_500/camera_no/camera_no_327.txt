Got it as an early birthday present in June. I picked it out. I loved it so much. Upon first opening it, the color isn't exactly as it looks on the site, or the box, but its good. Absolutely LOVE the one button video! It takes great pictures in every setting I used it in (well except when it was almost pitch black outside, but thats every camera). It was so amazing. I took it on vacation in early July to Silverthorne Colorado area. One one of the last days we were there, I noticed it wasn't in the van as we were going to Breckenridge. I figured I didn't need it that day, and didn't think about it. But when we got back to the condo we rented and it wasn't there, I was really sad. I must have lost it either at the Royal Gorge or at a resturant called McClelands that we went to the day before. I miss it so much. All the pictures I took were not on my computer yet. Overall it was a very sad story and I still miss it. My accual birthday was yesterday, and I am looking at this camera again. I knew from the minute I lost it I wanted another one. I see now that it is $10 more than when I got it the first time. I doubt my parents are buying it again, and I am seriously wanting to spend my own money on it this time. Thats how much I liked it. The only thing feature wise that disappointed me was that you can't set the shutter speed manually. This means I couldn't make those cool light pictures, but my mom's camera does that so everything is okay. Other than that one tiny thing, I LOVE IT! One more thing!! I had this for almost a month of almost non-stop picture taking, and other than the orriginal charge-up, I only had to carge it like Once!
