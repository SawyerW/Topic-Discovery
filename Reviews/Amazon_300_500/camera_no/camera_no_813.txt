We purchased two Polaroid i531 cameras for our boys who are 6 and 9 and are very pleased with the quality.  They are beginner users and have had no problems with figuring out the camera's functions.  They are able to take good clear picturs and record fun videos.  The good quality pictures are enhanced by the flash and zoom modes.  There are a variety of settings/modes that can increase the camera's basic functionality for more advanced users.  Battery life is pretty comparable to other digital cameras, so we use rechargables and make sure we have extras if the situation warrants it.  As with any digital camera, a memory card/stick is beneficial as there is limited onboard memory.  We purchased 1GB cards and will be able to take well over 1000 pictures and video clips with the settings we are using.  It's nice to be able to connect the camera to the television using included AV cable.  It's much handier for the kids, or to share with guests, than connecting or downloading to the computer.  The only complaint I might have with the camera is that the videos are a bit grainy.  This doesn't affect anything, but the clarity of the picture.  For everyday use it's not an issue, but I wouldn't record a wedding or something important with it unless it was absolutely all I had.I use a high end digital Sony camera and would recommend the Polaroid to anyone wanting an inexpensive point-and-shoot, beginner or not.  Both my husband and I will grab one of the Polaroids on occasion to take pictures because of it's simplicity and good picture quality.An added fun bonus for this particular Polaroid model is the changable grips provided.  Not only are there 3-4 camera colors available (silver, white, black and possibly pink/red), but there are 2-3 interchangable grip colors for even more personalization.  Also provided is a rubber camera skin that protects the camera from scratches, etc.
