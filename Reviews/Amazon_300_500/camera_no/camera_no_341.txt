I've been doing research on digital cameras for the past few weeks trying to decide which is the best for the money I was willing to spend.  I currently have a Canon A510 compact which I've had for about 5 years.  Its a great little camera but with only a 3X zoom and 3.2 MP, I felt as if I was missing out on some great pictures. To be honest, I'm not a professional photographer but I like taking vacation photos and lots of pictures and little videos of my grandchildren.After doing some research, I narrowed my search down to the Nikon L110 and the Canon SX130IS.  I really liked the Nikon L110 mainly because of the 15X zoom and 12.1 MP. About 2 weeks ago, I purchased the red Nikon L110 but returned it back to the store when I realized that someone had owned the camera before I did because all the settings were already in place and the batteries were missing.  I initially wanted to exchange it for one that hadn't been used but there were none left so I just got a refund.Today I went into Costco and much to my surprise, they were selling the L110 with a 4GB SD card and a camera case for very low price of $159.99 so I bought it again.  After setting it up I took some shots and they came out pretty good.  I even took some video which came out OK too.I am very happy with this camera because I realized that I could read camera reviews from now till eternity and will always read something bad about each and every one.  I decided to buy a camera that was in my price range that had the features I was looking for.  The Nikon L110 fits the bill perfectly.  Its a great looking point and shoot camera, is very responsive, and it's simple to operate.The only thing that I can fault on this camera is that you can definitely hear the clicking sound when you are zooming in and out while shooting video.  Since I have a separate compact video camera, this was not a deal breaker. Overall, this is a nice little camera for the price with some really good features.
