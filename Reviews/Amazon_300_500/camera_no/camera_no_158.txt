I recently bought the Olympus Stylus 750 w/o comparison shopping when I found myself on vacation without the charger for my usual camera.  On the whole, this has proved to be a pretty good pocket camera.  The 5x magnification is a big plus, and there is no size or weight penalty for the added magnification.  The camera fits both the hand and the pocket very well.  The Olympus also offers two levels of macro mode for closeups, and I got some rather good pictures using these (e.g. a full-screen picture of a dragonfly perched on a bush).  And in all fairness, I got a lot of satisfactory pictures using the Olympus.However, I did not end my trip loving the camera.  The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is essentially unreadable outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions is mostly guess work.  Since more than half of my pictures on the recent trip were made under outdoor, daylight conditions, I found the LCD problem intensely frustrating.This is my third camera with image stabilization, the other two are Panasonic Lumix models.  By comparison, I got a larger number of blurry pictures using the the Olympus than I usually do using the Lumix cameras.  It may be, however, that reading the advanced manual (which comes on CD, only a basic manual comes in print with the camera) will show me how to use the Olympus image stabilization to better effect.The number and size of the buttons is also inconvenient, as many reviewers (including those on non-Amazon sites) have pointed out.  And it is essential to carry a second, charged battery with you, since the battery life is at best average, and the system for warning of low charge is not very effective.Overall, I rate the Oympus 750 as a good, serviceable pocket camera with some significant plusses but also with significant minuses.  I believe that one can probably do better at the price.
