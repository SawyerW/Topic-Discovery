I am not happy. For this kind of money I was expecting (almost) the best.It's a very slow camera from every point of view: slow LCD refresh rate, slow LCD playback, slow autofocus that tends to fail in low light. Anyone who's considering buying this camera knows that there is no OIS or built-in viewfinder: I am sick of those "old fashioned" photographers who claim that such things aren't needed by "real photographers". Again - with such a price-tag - I would expect Leica to keep up with technology in terms of both optics-electronics interface and firmware, and I do think that OIS and built-in, high-resolution, electronic viewfinder would further expand the camera's capabilities in low light and also provide feedback on the current exposure/ISO,aperture settings without having to check the LCD/wheels and compose again. I am also disappointed by the manual focus control: I would have been happier with a ring on the barrel and with the possibility of further zooming on my subject to adjust focus (GF1 allows two levels of zoom, X1 only one level, which sometimes is not sufficient).Some of the button I use often (ISO) are on the left hand side of the LCD. This makes changing the setting tricky when holding the barrel with my left hand and have my right index finger on the shutter: having these buttons on the right hand side would allow me to change these settings while holding the camera ready to shoot.Image Quality: Judging on the basis of my raw images, the lens is sharp but has considerable barrel distortion. The sensor is capable of producing usable images at ISO as high as 3200.In conclusion, I am still waiting for "my camera", a tool that I could truly feel as an extension of my brain and heart. This camera is not the X1.
