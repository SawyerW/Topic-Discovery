Do not buy Canon G6. Buy this one instead.  I have done the research and paid the price for you.When I buy cameras, the most important thing to me is picture quality.  I have owned two digital cameras (3 MP and 5 MP, both are Sony) and I was upgrading to 7MP.I narrowed my search to Sony V3 and Canon G6.  I thought G6 may deliver better picture qualify because it has a bigger lens.  I found out in a hard way that in this case, SIZE DOES NOT MATTER!Here is the story:  I bought a G6 about 3 months ago (at $599.99).  I compared it side by side (same objects same conditions) with my 3MP Sony DS75 and astonishingly saw that my three-year-old Sony DS75 beat the G6 both in resolution and color of the pictures.  I was very disappointed and decided to compare the G6 and V3.  I brought my compact flash card to a local chain store that sells both the G6 and V3.  The sales person was kind enough to let me take dozens of picture at the store using my compact flash card in both the G6 and V3.  I compared the pictures at home.  Every single shot (in door) by the V3 was better.What about ourdoor pictures? I bought the V3.  After coming home, I take many outdoor pictures using both the G6 and V3.  Again, the V3 outdoor pictures have much better resolution and color.  I was totally convinced that the G6 was just a piece of junk.Another thing for the G6:  It does not have date/time stamp unless you print in out in a Canon printer.  Years from now, I don't want to check the time I create the picture file to figure out when the pictures were taken.  If date/time stamp is important to you, another reason to forget about the G6.I returned the G6 (paid 15% restock fee).  I have taken over a thousand pictures with my V3 and I am very happy with it.  Picture quality is much better with the V3.  An excellent product.
