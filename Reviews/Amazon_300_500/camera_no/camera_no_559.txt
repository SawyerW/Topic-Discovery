This is my second digital camera - the first was a point and shoot Fuji 1.3MP camera.  For under 200 dollars, this is the best 2 MP camera you can get.Construction:  There is no plastic except on the flash card cover.  It feels solid and fits perfectly in your hand.  (the s200 and others are too small to really be comfortable)  the battery compartment on the right side makes a great grip.Optics:  The 3x optical zoom lens is a great plus.  On the down side, it does not have too many steps but then again, its not a prosumer camera.AiAF does a decently good job in bad light.  Images are a little noisy but overall, a lot better than i expected from a camera like this.Excellent color saturation and white balance and the resolution is better than most other 2 megapixel cameras.  I regularly get 4x6 prints and sometimes get 5x7 prints.  always brilliant results.  even the low light results are fantastic.Battery:  The camera takes 4 AA batteries - this to me is a good thing.  Its all nice and dandy to have a custom rechargeable.  Till you are about to leave for the weekend and realize that you forgot to charge the baby up.  4 NiMH rechargeables last for ever in the camera and are not that expensive.  And if you do run out, every corner store you find will have AA's.Manual controls:  The three modes : automatic in which you can use it as a point and shoot and leave your head at home.program:  in which there are some preset modes to choose frommanual:  wherein you can control exposure, white balance, etc.Bottom line:  Ask yourself realistically - 'am i really into photography or do i just like to have an expensive camera to impress my friends' - that'll tell you which camera to get.  for day to day use and 4x6 prints, there is no camera i would recommend over this one.  period.
