I upgraded from a D80 which I had for more than 1 year.  The D80 is a very good camera, and the D300 is a significant upgrade.  What I like most about the camera is that the D300 has the ability to shoot with vivid colors while at the same time keeping a natural appearance.  This leads to images looking better than what they looked like in real life.The exposure of the camera is excellent as well.  Rarely does it under or overexpose an image. Autofocus is both quick and accurate.  It really makes taking high-quality pictures easy. I spend almost no time having to fix the image in Photoshop.While the high ISO performance is significantly improved from the aforementioned D80,  noise still can show up in poor lighting around ISO 1600 and above.  I sometimes shoot ice hockey and can find it difficult to get satisfactory shots if the rink's lighting is poor even while using a 2..8  70-200mm VR zoom wide open at 2.8.  That is , however, the only venue where I have had any difficulties.  Otherwise it is 10's across the board.If I were a betting man,  I would imagine that Nikon will come out with a direct upgrade to the D80 (D90?) in the near future.  If I didn't want the 6 fps of the D300,  I might be inclined to wait.In summary,  I am very satisfied with the D300 and imagine that I will not be getting any new camera bodies any time soon.  The only areas that I can see for significant improvement is high ISO performance and wide-angle photography.  I am not into wide angles, and the ISO weakness appears only under the most extreme of conditions.  The full-frame D3 would likely solve those weaknesses but is $5,000 and not worth the additional money from my perspective.
