I just recieved the monitor this afternoon and already have doubts about keeping it. I did not order the new one, I ordered the "used - like new". There was not supposed to be any scratches or signs of wear. However, as I was taking the camera out of the box I noticed a scratch on the black plastic rim about an inch long. I guess poor inspection on Amazon's end as it was from their warehouse. The screen is not near as bright and detailed as I was expecting. If anything it seems kind of dull. I read several reviews about people saying the intercom does not function well, this is correct. Unless your mouth is right up against the microphone and you wait a few seconds after pushing the talk button before speaking, it will not work. Also, the bottom of the screen as a flicker to it non-stop. I don't know if this is normal on the units or just a flaw of buying a "used - like new" one from Amazon. The range seems good, we have a 2400 sq ft house and I get great signal everywhere. I bought an extra camera to go with it, the pairing process was very simple so that was a plus. Still haven't tested the night vision yet, we shall see tonight how that functions. My friend ordered one yesterday from Amazon after I was ranting and raving about it (from my research it looked like a winning deal) but now I am kind of embarrssed about persuading her to order one... it's not as good as I was expecting.We shall see if I end up sending it back or not. I would like to find out if the picture is dull and poor quality on all of them or just because I ordered the "used - like new" one from Amazon. Along with the flickering at the bottom.
