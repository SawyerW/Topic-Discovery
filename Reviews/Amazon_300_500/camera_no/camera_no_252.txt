The A70 is a very decent entry-level digicam with the usual benefits that come from any Canon family camera: excellent options for a point-and-shoot lightweight camera. But, if you are looking for your first digicam purchase and a smallish camera to carry around, I'd recommend you to also consider at the sleek S series line from Canon, or the smaller Nikons, or more recent versions of the Minolta Dimage. Since I am recommending AGAINST the A70, I'll focus in this review on what is NOT necessarily so cool about this camera -- (1) The A70 comes with 3.2 megapixels. The S230 comes with 3 megapixels. Not that big of a difference especially if you consider the somewhat heftier price tag for A70.(2) Images are not as vivid as the S-series cams. The feel of the pics is a bit blurred (soft focus) and need sharpening in a photo-editing software. Quickly gets tiring.(3) You'll find the camera is prone to the dreaded "E18 error". Google for it.(4) Uses AA batteries, which means shorter usage time than Lithium-ion.(5) When you zoom in in dark surroundings, without Flash, the pictures have a problem with horizontal lining that is a pain to get rid of.(6) Miniscule memory card included with camera forcing purchase of upgrade immediately.(7) The ON-OFF button is a pain to operate in this design.(8) Frequent purple fringing, plus red colors appear frequently as purples in the pics.(9) Speaking of which, there is red-eye galore, even with the red eye reduction setting turned on. I'm speaking of a 2003 model and while you read this review, Canon may have released a newer series of these digicams. Caveat Emptor. I evangelize Canon in general but this cam I'd recommend you to stay away from. However, do consider some of the other excellent value for money offerings from Canon, including, as mentioned above, the S230, the S400 etc.
