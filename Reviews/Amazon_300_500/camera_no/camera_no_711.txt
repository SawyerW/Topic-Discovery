My husband and I have been on an aggressive search for the perfect Baby Video Monitor that suits the needs of our growing family.  After reading countless product reviews, purchasing and returning 4 other systems, we started to think that what we wanted did not exist - and then we tried the Lorex LW 2401 Live Video Monitor System - it seems to have everything we want!Pros:* Expandable - Supports up to 4 cameras* VOX (Voice Activation) - Lorex calls this feature "Scan".  The video AND sound go into a power saving mode, the cameras scan  the rooms for noises and if there is a noise detected, the video and audio is activated. This is a huge feature for my family  and was the reason why we returned all of the other systems we tried. In all other systems we tried the VOX feature could only  work on one camera / baby at a time.  Which was just silly to us - we wanted to hear either baby if one of them made a noise,  not just one!* Mute! This is a huge plus for me. I am such a light sleeper that on other systems the lowest setting is still too loud for me* Noise Indicator light (on the left side) - key for when the unit is on mute* Low battery indicator flashes on the screen! Not an annoying beep* Monitor has a stand (this model has a stand AND a docking station for charging - an extra bonus)Bonuses:* Multiple options for viewing your little ones:  -Single camera, sequence (rotates between cameras every 6 seconds), Quad mode (views all cameras at the same time)  -Video and sound on at all times  -Video screen off, but sound on  -Video screen on and sounds off (Auto mute)* Auto Mute - after a period with no noise, auto mute is activated to eliminate white noise* Sleek design* Large screen (3.5")* Volume buttons are on the front of the monitor unit (not in a menu)* Two way talk feature* Temperature gauge* Date and time on screenCons:* "Video" button turns on / off once pressed, but doesn't seem to work in Scan mode.  Not sure why that would be* Doesn't tilt, pan, zoom like some other units in the price range but not a deal breaker for me because it has so much of  everything else we needFeatures I have not tried and probably won't use:* Capture, store & share with microSD recording* Remotely view from anywhere through Skype* Alerts* Alarms
