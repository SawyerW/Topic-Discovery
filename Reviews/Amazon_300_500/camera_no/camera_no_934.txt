I looked for a economical camcorder to record my daughter's piano recitals and ball games. Most of the low to mid price camcorders is not capable to take still picture of acceptable quality. Their widest focus is typically 40-45mm only, which is not wide enough for volleyball games in a school gym. I read the DCRP review of the ZS3 and turned out that I bought it instead.This camera is very easy to use, those who have experience with digital cameras may even skip the instruction manual. The monitor is of high resolution and bright enough even under sunlight. Light and small in size considers its 12X zoom. The zoom range is fantastic but noticeable distortion in wide zoom. Lack of color accuracy when using flash. The flash itself is weak. ZS3 has many functionable settings like Intelligent Auto Mode, Intelligent exposure, Intelligent ISO, Face Recognition etc. In generally is a very big step forward comparing with Panasonic's older TZ3 & FX30 I used before. The photo quality is quite nice but never as good as my year 2003 Olympus C740 which is 3MP.As a compact camera, it produces excellent video. I used AVCHD format with Super high quality, and watch with the 52" LCD TV. The result(my HDMI connection cable from amazon.com cost me $2.10)is more than satisfactory. The professional reviews say AVCHD format is difficult to edit. I wonder how many compact cameras/camcorders users care to spend time to edit their video. Theoretically, 16GB records continuously 2 hrs+ video in AVCHD format. Actually, it is not possible. The battery runs dry in 45 minutes. Unlike most of the camcorders, extra capacity battery can be used to prolong recording time. This is the drawback of using the ZS3 instead of camcorder. The wide 25mm zoom is very useful both for still picture and video recording.I enjoy this ZS3 as general purpose traveling camera when I am lazy to bring along the heavier DSLR.
