This camera takes good pictures and it's easy to operate. It is well worth it's price. However, there are some problems.1. The CCD has known issues. It is highly susceptible to moisture and will develop problems. The images will have horizontal lines in them and the color balance will be wrong. Canon fixes this problem at no charge and even pays for shipping. However, in two years of owning this camera, I've had to return it twice for this repair.2. The LCD display is rather small and hard to see. It is even more difficult to see in bright light.Other than those two things, the camera works great. It's easy to operate and use the camera's functions, and the results are very good. Color balance is good for all white balance settings, especially incandescent when shooing in incandescent light. Pictures are sharp and free from image artifacts.One minor annoyance is that the zoom is electronic. It is difficult to get the exact zoom you want, especially for normal (the human eye's perspective). Another annoyance is the camera's widest aperature. It is not wide enough to make things n the background go out of focus. However, with a little skill with Photoshop, you can mask the subject and perform blurring.Connecting and downloading images to your computer is easy and painless. The supplied software is adequate but not stellar.A nice featuer is that the camera uses AA sized batteries. Get yourself rechargable 2500ma batteries and an inexpensive charger and you'll get a lot of photos out of one set of batteries.One very recommended accessory is the lens adapter, the LAH-DC20. Even f you don't attach an auxilary lens, this provides some protection for the lens in case you drop the camera while it's powered up, and it provides a means to attach 52 mm close up diopters, filters, and any lens hood.For it's price, the camera is exceptional.
