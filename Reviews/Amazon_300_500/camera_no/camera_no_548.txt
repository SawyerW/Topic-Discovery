I've received my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P71 today.  This is my second Sony camera.  My first one is a Sony Marvica CCD1000 (I was and still am satisfied with this baby).  I cannot resist comparing the two cameras.  DSC-P71 is a much more lightweight and compact camera.  It has 3.2 MP photo quality.  A good number.  What's impressive is that it uses 2 AA Nickel-Metal baterries - small rechargeable batteries can last roughly an hour in full function.  It comes with a battery charger too!  What is disappointing about this camera is that the photo files are so compressed (186kb with Fine quality) that they don't look good on my computer screen, nor do they look impressive on prints.  For Pete's sake, this is a 3.2 Mega Pixel camera, why wouldn't Sony let it produce uncompressed photos files?  Another disappointment: the camera does not come with an AC-adopter.  You will have to buy it separately. ... Another big Q for Sony, why wouldn't you include the AC-adopter?  I have one more disappointment: the lighting of this camera is poorer than my initial expectation.  I only tested indoor photos, but they (not including close-up photos) look a bit dull although supported with good lighting and with the camera set to the highest exposure.  I am not a professional, but I think this camera is better suited for bright outdoor photo taking.  I also tried the Macro, well, you cannot position your camera too close to the subject or else it will just become blurry. Well, it seems I have more cons than pros for this camera.  My take on it is, I will keep it.  Like I said, it's small, much smaller than my bulky Marvica CCD1000.  It's the size and batteries that matter.  For some reason, I am a Sony fan.  Hopefully, they will come out with a compact and  kick [butt] camera!
