This camera is great in some ways, but lacks in other ways.  First of all, it's the perfect size and is very user friendly.  It takes very clear close-up shots and works well in daylight.  However, allow me to outline some of the drawbacks.1. The glare on the screen is so bad that it's nearly impossible to see in sunlight.  Also, I've noticed that pictures which look very blurry on the screen tend to show up clear on my computer, so the viewing screen leaves a little to be desired.2. This camera does not take pictures at night.  There is a night setting on the camera, and I had a Canon that took great night pics, so I was really disappointed that this one doesn't work at all on the night setting.3. In very bright sunlight, the corners of the picture will look dark because of the reflection.  In other words the lens is placed inside the casing just enough that there is a shadow on the corners of a picture when the sun is very bright.  This has happened without fail on all my beach pics with this camera.4. I'm not sure if this is user error or not, but when the SD card is reformatted, the file names go back to 0001.  So when I import the pics from the camera into iPhoto, half the pics in iPhoto have the same file name which is a huge pain when I'm transferring them to folders later on.  I never had this problem with my Canon, so this was another feature I was disappointed with.All in all, this is a nice little $69.99 camera.  However, were I making the choice again, I probably would have saved my money and invested in something of a little higher quality with more desirable features.
