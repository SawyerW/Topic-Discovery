I bought the Nikon Coolpix S8000 for my sister. We went on vacation. I brought my Fujifilm Finepix J38. After a day of seeing the quality between these 2 cameras I left the Fujifilm in the room and we shared her Nikon Coolpix camera for the rest of the vacation. I cannot say enough good things about her camera. Every picture came out great -  it would not let me take a bad picture. We did many close up zooms, outdoor, indoor, evening low light - all came out amazingly good! It is very easy to use. Aim, shoot and it does the automatic adjustments to create very clear, crisp correct brightness pictures. Yes, it took a bit to remember to not put my finger on the flash but was easy to hold the camera without needing to have my finger on top of the camera. I think it must have a much better/bigger flash than most subcompacts so it probably needs to be on top for the space?  The 10x optical zoom is amazing! There were things at a distance I could not see until I aimed the 10x on the area and was surprised to discover things in the distance. It is light weight and small enough to easily take with us. I had it in my pocket alot and had to remember to let my sister use it, as it is her camera - smile. When I complete this review, I am immediately going to order one for me. The video quality is also amazingly very, very good. I recommend buying a 16 gig memory card. She took alot of video (sorry don't know how much time total) and we took over 400 pictures and the card still was only about half full. We used it for 8 days taking many pictures every day. I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix S8000.
