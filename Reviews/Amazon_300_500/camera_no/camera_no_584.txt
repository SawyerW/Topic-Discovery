Wow, I have searched for a quality digital camera and found one.It's only 2 megapixels, but it is more than adequate. The pictures I took were all great, the close up shots for detail shots are incredible perfect color and lighting everytime. I had a hard time between this one and a Canon A60. I had a Sony before this one and this one beats hands down. The Canon A60 has alot more features but a higher price tag. I got this one at my local Staples for $ 220.00 - BRAND NEW !!!!The case is small and sturdy stainless steel. Great pocket camera. It is not a pro camera, and not a basic point and shoot, it can record up to 1 minute with audio!!! It has a microphone!!!Bottom line it is a great buy and quality is excellent. I even took a picture with just a candle lit and it calibrated for light for a great shot!!!Why 4 stars, well the buttons are tiny, bigger hands will have a hard time with this camera, and a replacement battery is very expensive; although do a search on Ebay and many vendors have the battery for $10-15.00; as opposed to $50-60.00 on retail sites. As for memory cards go to Crucial.com for the cheapest memory anywhere!!! I got a 128 card for $25.00 !!! There prices do change.Pros: Compact and light, simple menu, easy to shoot, stainless steel case, cheap memory, movie mode, great shots, even in the dark!!!!Cons: Special cable for video(included) and USB, so don't lose them or you'll have to order direct from Canon; special battery- not AA's, too small for bigger hands.Final say: Great for trips, and to carry in your pocket, but if you have bigger hands and a few extra dollars, go with a Canon A60. The Canon A60 uses AA's and it's case is bigger(although plastic), and has a few more advanced features.
