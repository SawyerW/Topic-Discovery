This is my first digital camera - I've always been a technofan, but a thrifty one, so I waited a few years to get a little more for my money on a digital camera. Man, was it worth the wait!This camera is very easy to use, and takes great pictures. The menu system is easy to navigate, and pretty intuitive. My only complaint about the menu system is that some of my settings (such as 'close up mode') aren't saved when I turn off the camera, so I have to remember to re-enable the mode when I want to use it (thus far, most of my pictures have been for auction listings, so I've needed to take lots of closeups).This camera takes VERY high quality pictures.  With the 'good, better, and best' modes, I've found that 'good' works well for things like pictures embedded in online auctions, and 'best' gives me pictures that are at least as good as anything my 35mm camera produces.I also purchased a 256MB SD memory card, so I basically never have to worry about running out of film or memory.An unanticipated benefit of buying this camera is that I no longer have to worry when my young son begs to let him take pictures (worrying about the cost of 'wasted' film, development costs, etc).  If he takes a good picture, we keep it - if not, we delete it!If you're a professional photographer needing some new equipment for your next big photo shoot, this probably isn't the camera for you.  If you want a camera with a decent zoom that will let you take hassle-free vacation shots, family shots, and other general-purpose photography, this is a great camera.I would NOT invest in the optional camera dock. Even without it, all you need to do is plug your camera into a USB port and then turn the camera on - the software automatically starts, and with only one or two clicks you can download all of your pics from the camera to the PC, and delete them from the camera.
