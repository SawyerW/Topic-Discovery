I purchased this camera after reading Landale's excellent review and his patient assistance to the people who were disappointed in this as a point and shoot camera. I was also influenced by the reviewer who liked its low-light capability. It is interesting technology and the camera can take very nice images, but it takes some experience and effort (which is fine by me). I've used this camera for a couple weeks and a few hundred images so I will share my second-impressions. I've yet to see a great difference in its low-light capability from other $400 cameras. It's o.k., but not spectacular. I have not yet done any A/B tests so I may be mistaken. I /am/ impressed with its dynamic range (see Landale's "how to"), its macro capability, and its lens -- no obvious barrel distortion like common with cheaper cameras. I have not experienced the noise issues others have. As long as one limits the ISO to 400 where practical, I've had good images in both P and Auto EXR modes. The body has a nice, quality feel.I have accidentally turned it on while hiking and the barrel tries to stick out and the camera gets unhappy so I may have to buy the OEM case for it. That case doesn't enclose the camera but it does have a firm surface above the power switch to prevent it from accidentally being turned on.Initially I would have rated this camera at 3 to 4 stars (for the price), but I've grown to like this camera more as I use it more. I'd rate it at 4.5 stars but I rated it as 5 to counter the few "I just unboxed this camera today and don't like it" reviews here.I uploaded an image today in which the original shows great dynamic range and detail for a 6 MP image. After it is reduced for uploading it may have been compromised. UPDATE: Just added an ISO 1600 image today.
