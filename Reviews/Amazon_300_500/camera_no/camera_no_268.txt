First of all, I want to say that I am not a technical minded person at all.  I love my 35mm camera and was really hesitant about going digital.  The ONLY reason I even considered buying a digital camera is that I was traveling to Scotland on my honeymoon and wanted to be able to see the pictures as I was taking them because these were shots that I would never have the opportunity to retake, should they come out badly.  So, I did a lot of research and tried to get the most user friendly camera I could find.This camera has really been great.  There are of course a lot of features that I have never used, and a few that I have finally learned. The owners manual was a little intimidating - it was so thick!  But with a little practice, I've become a pretty good photographer.  The Zoom works really well.  Batteries last pretty well - we have a recharger for when they run out.  The editing software that comes with the camera is very easy to use.  The panorma feature (or photo stitch I think it's called) gave us some great scenery shots and the "auto pilot" feature allowed us to both be in the picture at the same time.  The picture quality is generally good.  At first it was no match to my trusty 35mm, but then I switched the setting to capture the highest quality pictures, and have had no complaints since then.In the beginning it was hard to get used to the delay in shutter speed - I was used to "snap and click", but with the powershot I had to hold down the button for maybe a second or so before the picture would take.  I was missing a lot of action shots. But now, I've learned to set the speed to action and that is no longer a problem.I would definitely recomend this camera to any novices like me.  As a matter of fact, now that I have the hang of digital cameras, I am moving up to a camcorder - Canon ZR85 here I come!
