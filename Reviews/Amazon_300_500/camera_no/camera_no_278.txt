Everyone has different Camera needs.....We started with a Nikon 995 (that we have had since it came out).** My wife wanted a purseable camera.  She wanted a Large screen and for it to be easy to use for good photos.I wanted it to take good pictures, have a real Macro mode (around 2 inches), remote (a  $30 option) + video out (for family portraits), Manual focus, good low light focusing, and to be a fast shooter, Tripod Mount and a good battety life.This Pentax Optio S4i does all this and more and it is incrediably easy to operate. Not just the basics, even the more advanced features.  I  considered its almost twin the Casio Exilim EX-Z40 (same lens)but worse menus, (Casio has No remote option or video out), but it has a 2 inch sreen instead of 1.8 (both screens are same Resolution though) the casio does have an almost double life battery that so far is not available separtely for eihter camera (the two take the same batteries).  Basically the Batteries last about 300 shots, the old around 150 (710ms vs. 1230mA [the battery model #s are D-LI8 and NP-40] Addiitonal and OEM and third party ones are $18 to $40).If it matters pentax is actually also smaller then casio about 2/3 the size.Also considered Sony T1, and all Minolta's Dimage X/t/i/g and of course Canon's Elph series.  For me they were all lacking a feature or two or three+ (Be it Macro, Tripod mounts, remotes or more).You can go to reads reviews on dcviews.com (a meta site for news and other review and news sites).  As I write this the Casio is reviewed the Pentax has not been.What could they have added still: 1) (a tiff/raw image mode) 2) An AF Lamp always helps even though this camera focuses 10 times better in low light then my Nikon.
