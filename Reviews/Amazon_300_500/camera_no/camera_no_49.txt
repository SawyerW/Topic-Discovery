This product can perform well, IF there is no signal interference present. In fact the quality of picture this system can provide actually surpasses that of more expensive systems, IF they are set up well & conditions are conducive to good signal travel. And by quality, i mean color & image presentation,. Simply put....what you can see through these analog transeivers looks better than a digital camera....my digital cameras have less true color & produce a somewhat choppy framerate.....whereas the Astek image moves at a true to life frame speed.Now their night vision capabilities are not too impressive....my digital cameras have an advantage in this aspect....yet they DO work.I have used these cameras for almost 10 years now... and while a few cameras & recievers have passed away.... the very 1st one i bought is still in service & works well.These make excellent day surveilence cameras, yes they are a bit unstable in the sense that they are sensitive to the electromagnetic enviornment....but when they work.....they are great!I use these for my day survielence system & a digital set up for night....the reason i do not run them simultaineously is that the digital signal over rides the analog to the point that the Astek picture becomes unwatchable.The REAL problem with these cameras is in how they are sold.... in that the reciever can employ 4 cameras & the cameras are numbered 1-4 respectively....the way they are sold there is NO WAY to select which # camera you need....so if you are sent a number you already have....you are out of luck because you cannot use two of the same number....one will overide the other [ usually the one closet to the reciever] so you will only get one picture out of two cameras....in other words.....one of them will be useless to you.They need to set up this page so that we can select which camera # we wish to purchase....it is pretty simple simon stuff....i mean if we can select which shoe size we want....then why not a camera # ??No these cameras are not total junk.....If you work within their inherent limitations they perform very well.....although some people's locations might be subject to signal interference sources that they have no control over....which could make thingns rather difficult to deal with.So.... it all depends.....on your location & ability to work with what you got that will determine whether or not these cameras will work for you.
