I got this camera over a year ago and I have not regretted it. It is compact, takes great photos with high detail, and it is not hard to use. While there are some downfalls (average close up focus and poor low-light capabilities), I find that these are not things that routinely prevent me from acheiving great photo quality. As for reasonably close-up photos, I use this in my dental office to take close-ups of smiles, and they turn out great. That should give you some idea of this camera's abilities. Many reviewers have hit the nail on the head regarding this product, so I will use my review to give you guys some great tips I've found.1. Buy the 128 Mg card, the carrying case, card reader, and an extra battery.2. Dont buy the charger. I find that if I have an extra battery, I usually get all the photos I need by just popping in the fresh battery when the first is low. Later, I charge the batteries with the camera's built-in charger. I actually bought the stand-alone charger, but it seems to take longer and is pointless since I am not using my camera at the time anyway.3. If you are like me and want to carry your camera in your pocket try this trick to protect the LCD: get some of those Palm Pilot screen covers and cut out the size of the LCD, and then place it on your camera's LCD. The screen can get knocked by keys in your pocket and not get permanently damaged. Plus, you'll never run out of covers because one palm sheet can make 4 lcd covers. 4. If you have a still shot to take in low light and don't want to drown out the subject with a flash, use the SCN feature to recover some detail. But it only works if nothing is moving.If you are looking for something to have on your vacations, birthday parties, and in the home that takes high res pics without the complexities and hassles of bulkier digitals, don't hesitate to buy this one. You'll be happy with it.
