I've been putting this camera to the test for a couple of months, and the more I use it, the more I love it.  It's intuitive, fast, and the automatic setting will make the photographer look more talented than she or he is.Before I go on -- I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.  It's too fine to be a four, but there's one thing that drives me crazy on small cameras: the lack of a viewfinder.After age 30 or 40 most people begin experiencing near-sightedness and unless you wear bifocals to truly see what you're looking at on a camera screen, you have to whip out the reading glasses.  This is a huge time-waster and general pain in the rear. With a viewfinder, you simply have it set to match your vision. No muss, no fuss.But, the Fuji has such a large screen that it's usable without reading glasses. Granted, I prefer to see it more clearly, particularly with closeups, but this little guy is very good at taking care of me, with or without.I've always gone for mid-size cameras because I use massive zoom frequently. The Fuji has 5X zoom, beating most other subcompacts by 2 degrees, but that's still less than half of what I'm used to.So, following the suggestion of one of the early reviewers here (he explains tech very well), I set the camera to 6MP to make room, most of the time, but I've found that if I want a long-distance shot, if I change it back to 12MP, I can take such an insanely high quality photo that I still get the bi-plane or soaring hawk. I simply crop it.I'm amazed at the length of time between battery charges, at the ease of use, and at how hard it is to ruin a photo.  I highly recommend this puppy!
