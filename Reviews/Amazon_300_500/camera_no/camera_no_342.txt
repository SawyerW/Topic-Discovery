I've had this camera for a couple of years now. It's a very good camera, and has survived several tumbles down rocky terrain. It has a lot of features, a very good 45x digital zoom, and it takes nice, sharp photos. It does a really great job in low light. Sometimes it overcompensates and the pictures still come out overexposed, but other than that, it's great.Complaints:* It is slow to recover after taking a photo with the flash. If seconds count, give up. My Canon Powershot never had this problem.* Flash photos drain the batteries really fast. You can take maybe 10 flash photos before the camera shuts down.* It's a bit slow recovering from any shot. Really frustrating for photographing small children or wildlife or anything that moves around a lot. Use the "sport continuous" setting if you photograph moving objects often.* Mine has a tendency to "freeze up", and I haven't figured out why. Lately I've noticed that it happens after I've taken several photos in quick succession with the zoom in use, especially if I've got the zoom all the way out. The camera just stops responding, and eventually shuts down. It can't be reactivated unless you open the battery compartment, take the batteries out, and put them back in again. Sometimes the camera gets really hot, but not always. If it does, you need to cool off the camera and the batteries. It also happens when the flash card is more than 3/4 full. I can get 750 shots out of my 4gb card, then the camera complains that it has no memory and shuts down. Not usually a problem, except when I'm on vacation and don't have access to a computer to download my photos to.* My pictures often come out overexposed. I've got to reset the exposure level almost all the time, or spend time correcting it with photo editing tools.* The color red usually comes out slightly blurry, or the red object looks fake.* Without a tripod, it's very hard to take a good shot with the zoom all the way out.
