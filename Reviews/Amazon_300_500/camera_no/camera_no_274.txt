I've owned this camera for two years now. It has its issues. It wastes a lot of battery power by constantly pushing out and pulling in the lens every time the camera is turned on and off. It has a automatic power saver feature that autoshuts down the camera to make sure this happens regularly.  It also continuously projects movie like images on the LCD screen of what the camera sees -- nice power wasting feature. I only need it to do that when I am actually taking a picture, not all the time. As you might imagine, you'll get tired of changing the batteries. Low light pictures were never very good.The camera comes with a bewildering array of options but I found that 95% of them I never used.  There is a dial on top with a dozen special settings for various pictures. In my two years I've only used one. The same goes for the various image sizes, compression levels, etc. The one time I actually needed a feature, it failed:My mistake apparently was to attempt to delete pictures on the compact flash card using my computer's file browser. After I reinserted the CF card back in the camera, the camera refused to take pictures. I had the camera reformat the flash card and still wouldn't take pictures. I tried another CF card and it wont take pictures on that either. New batteries didn't help. Canon says that the repair will cost $200. Gee, thanks guys. The camera cost that much.The fact of the matter is that I feel that these cameras are too feature laden and kinda buggy. I really would prefer a digital camera that took digital pictures. Period. The computer can do everything I need. I don't need the pile of features to complicate the use of the thing. Ultimately, I feel that all this stuff has left Canon with a camera that is simply not robust.  Buy if you want, but understand that once it breaks, you are buying a new one, and all those features just make the thing break sooner.
