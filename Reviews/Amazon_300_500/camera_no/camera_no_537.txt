I bought this camera as an xmas gift for my mother (she's 70) who just resently got into the Digital world with a Sony VAIO RX-650 Digital studio pc. I didn't know beans about digital cameras and it's always scary to try and get her into something new anyway, but after reading tons of info and all the reviews on this site for dozens of cameras this one kept coming up in the features for price catagory so I sprang for it.You will not be disappointed. I can't imagine getting a better deal. she was taking pictures in less then 10 minutes and at the 1600x1200 default setting they were excellent (16 for the standard 8 meg card and 64 for the 32 meg card that I got free with it).When we hooked it up to her pc it loaded so fast I wasn't sure that if it happened, but the pc reads this camera as another drive and automatically puts all the pictures into a folder for you. I can't rate the software at this time as we really haven't had time to use it, but photoshop was already installed on her pc and the quality of these pics are awesome. We printed out a few at 5x7 and I honestly can't tell the difference between those from the pc and pics that get developed from a regular camera. One of the things I worried about in this purchase was everything I'd read about low light and I was afraid they would come out dark in low light conditions. This was no problem either. The flash on this camera brings the sun into your living room and every picture we took came out very well. If your used to throw away cameras the D-380 will improve your picture taking in every area, not to mention no more developing. If your already into 35mm shooting, you'll be surprised at what very little money can do for you these days. get the AC adapter and the battery recharger and your set.
