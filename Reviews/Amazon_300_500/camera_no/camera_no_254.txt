I am an amateur photographer (vacations, get-togethers, etc.)  and I have owned a Canon A-10 for several years and it met all of my needs valiantly. I received the A-70 as a gift (which I researched)  and have been playing with it for a few months now,  before writing this review. All I can say is: WOW! You'd be hard pressed to find such a a great camera packed with so many features at such a great price.What I like the most:-Canon reliability and superior lens-small size (smaller! than the A10)...really fits in my pocket-no lens cover to worry about-super-sharp pictures (both for web-publishing and up to 8X10 prints...SUPER!)-fun movie function let's me take all the video that my friends could bear to watch (I've only reached up to 3 minutes so far)-VIVID color-the numerous manual feature options, which are allowing me to learn more about photography and experiment at my own paceWhat I found useless in this package:-while it's nice that it runs on AAA's, there's no use packaging with regular batteries (only useful in a pinch...you need NiMH rechargeables!)-the accompanying memory card is nigh-useless...I carry it on vacations in case I fill up, but really, if you want to have fun you need a minimum of 512MB for peace of mind and room to make lots of mistakes and throw in a few video clipsBOTTOM-LINE: after months of research and endless reading, all roads led me to this camera and it is WELL WORTH IT! This will keep me busy for the next couple of years exploring and learning. In the meantime the AUTO options produce FANTASTIC pictures, and the video clips are great. QUALITY wrapped in a FUN, EASY and TRULY COMPACT package.ALSO, as a Mac-user, this camera is completely Mac-compatible and a snap to use...plug-and-play in OS X...my dog could download pictures it's so ridiculously easy.
