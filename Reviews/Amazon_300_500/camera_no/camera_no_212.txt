I've had this camera for a while and taken it on several trips. My APS P&S camera has been gathering dust ever since. The FinePix is very easy to use.  It responds quickly upon power-up, so you can leave it off between shots, which makes batteries last a long time.  Downloading pictures to Win98 over the USB interface couldn't be easier; you just drag and drop.  Picture quality is decent at the maximum resolution in "fine" mode, but poor at the default "normal" compression mode.  (I wish more digicams would offer uncompressed output modes!)  Get additional memory; I have found that 64MB is enough.  At the high-resolution mode picture preview and time between shots is a little sluggish.  The LCD preview has a nice high frame rate but is slow to respond to its on-off switch.On the con side, the biggest problem I have with this camera is its poor performance in low light conditions.  Even fairly bright overcast conditions sometimes result in shutter speeds that preclude handheld use without blurring.  Even with a steady camera, shadows and darker areas in medium-to-low light conditions show a lot of digital noise.The macro mode is frustrating to use because it's fixed-focus.  I wonder why this feature made the cut.The color balance is on the saturated side, though you can adjust the color balance in manual mode.  In general, skin tones are a bit reddish for my tastes, but nothing that Photoshop can't fix.And lastly, there's no lens cap.  Although I have yet to scratch the protective cover over the lens, I'm afraid to, so I always carry this camera in a bulky bag which makes it less convenient.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera which got me into digital photography with a minimum of expense and fuss.  I have taken some very nice pictures with it and when I show friends 4x6 prints from it almost nobody can tell it from film.  But for available-light photography I stick with my 35mm SLR.
