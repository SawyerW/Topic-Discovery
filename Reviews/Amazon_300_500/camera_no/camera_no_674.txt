I finally made the jump from film SLR cameras to digital with this camera.  Since none of my film lenses would work with a modern digital camera, I had the luxury of picking from all of the brands.  Reading review sites like dpreview are an excellent place to start, and if you find the reviews too technical this class of camera is probably not for you.  Buying a camera really has a lot to do with knowing what you want and need, and for me I needed full manual control (f-stop, shutter speed, color balance, RAW, etc), good low light, and swappable lenses, at as low a price as possible without entering knock-off territory.  I got that with the Kx.Following is stuff that I didn't expect, but was happy to discover about this camera.* Honestly, the low light performance and image stabilization are what has amazed me the most.  I was able to take pictures of the recent lunar eclipse with the kit lens (not telephoto), by hand (no tripod), and capture the fine details of the craters well enough amaze me.  1/200 shutter speed, 800 ISO on the full moon; 1/40 and 1600 ISO on the dark, fully eclipsed moon.* Though I've only dabbled in it, and there's a strong anti-IR filter on this camera, you can get some IR shots with an R72 lens.  Not the best camera for IR, of course, but not as bad as some people online say.* The noise, which is pretty rare, is great.  One reason I never made the leap to DSLR before was the ugly RGB dots I'd seen in the noise of my friends pictures.  This camera manages to produce a film grain style of noise, when it has noise.  Check out the DP Review page for this camera for examples.Unless you already have a pile of lenses marrying you with another brand, this is the best camera of this generation, in my (hobbyist) opinion.
