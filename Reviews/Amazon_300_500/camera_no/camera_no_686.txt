I'm not even near to being a professional photographer. However, it's a long time since I started to think about getting more photo-power in my hands.My previous "super zoom" camera has a number of weaknesses that became more and more frustrating:* inability to shoot in low light (ISO 400 is the maximum and that is with terrible noise)* slowness - from turning on to being ready to shoot, zoom, focus, frame-to-frame lag, etc., etc.* ergonomics - it is really hard to perform some basic adjustments, while not using the automatic modeAnd, in addition, I wanted to go up a level with the image quality, to preserve good looking memories.Of course, first thought was to go the Canon/Nikon path. But the following considerations outweighed in favor of Pentax K-x:* price for DSLR with two really-not-so-bad lenses* great low light performance* availability of great second hand manual lenses for bargain prices (we are talking about quality here)* in-body image stabilization, making the previous paragraph even more attractiveWell, the camera delivers what it's promised. Getting the pictures I want has become so easier!Pros:* all of the already said* great pictures even in automatic mode, making it easy for "consumer mode" usage* absent AF point indication - not an issue, instead, you choose where you want to focus* lightweight* chance of running out of battery power is very low - AA available everywhere* ergonomicsCons:* somewhat problematic focusing in live view mode* no weather sealing - rain together with wind could prevent you from taking the pictures you want (however, no chance to get such a feature in this price range for up to date technology)* Pentax has much smaller market share than Canon/Nikon and even Sony, it could become an issue while looking for lenses, spare parts, services* the LCD is hard to see in direct daylightThe bottom line:Great camera with a great price tag allowing daring amateurs to make a big next step up.I would recommend this device for anyone who doesn't afraid of "being locked" in the Pentax niche.
