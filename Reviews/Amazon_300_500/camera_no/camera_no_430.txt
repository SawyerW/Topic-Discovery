This is my review of the Samsung TL105.Let me start by saying that i was looking for a camera that would cost under $150. and be able to record HD video but it had to record in the new MP4 H.264 format because this is what is needed for uploading to YouTube.The TL105 is the only camera in this price range to have this format.My first impression of the camera was it is small but well built with it's stainless steel body.After using the camera for a week i am very impressed with the video quality and pictures from this diminutive camera.The HD videos download to the computer from the camera very quickly because of the H.264 format and look very good on YouTube.Just make sure you are using a class 6 SDHC card or better.A big plus is the software that comes with the camera (intelli-studio) it is very good.You can do all the editing you have to do like cut,trim,splice and transitions and even convert your video to a different format if you like,bravo samsung.Just made sure your computer has been built in the last five years to run the software.The only negative and it is not with the camera is that the USB cable that comes with it needs to be a little longer.Let me end by saying if you are looking for a compact camera under $150. that you would like to post HD videos to the internet i highly recommend the Samsung TL105.Videos taken with the TL105 can be seen at richpin06a on YouTube.P.S.The camera comes with the zoom set to mute so when you zoom it does not record sound when you get it.If you want it to record sound while zooming put the camera in video mode press the menu button.Then move down the right frame to voice there are three options the middle one will let you record sound while zooming.One last thing to use the digital image stabilization in video mode you have to turn off Smart Auto mode.
