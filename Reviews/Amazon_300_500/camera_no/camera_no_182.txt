I purchased these for a company I work for to be installed at all of the remote locations.  They fit within the budget and had features that were asked for.  However: I have rated this product at a middle (3 star - It's Ok) rating due to several factors.  I do want to say that for the price/features it seems to work great.Reasons for my rating:* Would like to see better quality image.* Secure View (the software that comes with it) lacks a few features that are within the admin area of the camera itself and are very useful tools.* Lack of instructions for a more advanced set up.* Sound quality: These camera were installed in a store/retail environment and due to the different sounds within this environment, the built in mic leaves a little to be desired.  It has a difficult time filtering out background noise.  Might be ok in a less noisy environment.Configuration where cameras were installed:* WiFi network Dlink routers* High speed internet (cable or DSL 4Mbs/768K) Found it to be slow and jerky in the slower locations, we have upgraded our ISP to accommodate the cameras eating up the bandwidth.* Configured camera with static IP/Web address (DynDNS). I would highly recommend this! can be a little cumbersome to a non-IT person, but Trendnet support was helpful (it may take a little time, so have some time to work with support).All in all my experience with these cameras was a little frustrating in the beginning and the setup, but once I understood what Trendnet was looking for I was able to configure the others very easily with very little problems.I would recommend this camera to someone who wants to watch their home or a single office space (1000sf and under), etc...Hopefully my review helped in some way.  Good Luck!
