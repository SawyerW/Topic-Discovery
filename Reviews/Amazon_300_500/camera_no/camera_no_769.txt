I had this camera and the D3 on order ever since they were annouced, with my luck the D300 came in first! I just picked it up today! Although I need the D3's full frame more! However, it is an excellent camera for the $$, I only paid $1800+ tax, mind you  I spend a lot at my dealer over the years! I owned and still own a couple of Nikons, so for me it was a very easy transition, and finally Nikon has a good comprehensive manual to go wth the camera ifyou need any help. Also, for the first time the Capture NX is included - sort of: Ok I had to download it, and insert the product key, regardless this is a good step by Nikon, and it was about time!!The focusing screen is much better designed now, and if you get the MD-D10 multi-power battery pack for the built in motor drive, it will  be faster than my D2X and also has a lot bigger buffer up to 100 shoots for jpg, vs only 35 on my D2X, and with the  right adapter BL-3 it will take the same high capacity battery as my D2X uses! The only drawback is that nobody has the BL-3 adapter in STOCK!As for image quality, it is excellent even at higher ISO, I tested the D300 at 400, 800 and 1600 ISO, unlike the D2X which is only good up to 320 or maybe 400 before some noise is noticable and gets worse very fast after that as ISO is increased. (I am not talking about for 4x6" prints or just looking on the monitor but for 11x14"prints and up!!)I highly recommend this camera, it is better than my more expensive D2X or D2Xs, performance and price wise!!! In fact you could buy 2 DX300s for the cost of one D2Xs! Finally Nikon has a winner!
