I'm very pleased with the Sony Alpha 700.(1)  PLEASANT SURPRISE:  the Sony (Alpha) A700 is only slightly bigger than my Minolta Maxxum 7 film SLR.  Many digital SLR's are big and clunky; the A700 is almost as easy to carry as a film SLR.(2)  EXCELLENT CONTROLS!  Three buttons on the top right of the A700 give immediate access to Exposure Compensation, ISO setting, and White Balance  - each of these can be adjusted quickly, for each shot.  (ISO setting is like being able to change film speed, for each shot;  White Balance is like setting film type - Daylight, Tungsten, or other - for each shot)(3)  EASY, QUICK MENUS.  I never imagined I would praise the menus on a digital camera.  On my 3 megapixel Olympus point-and-shoot, changing a setting requires laborious searches through stacks of submenus.  The menu layout on the Sony A700 is head-and-shoulders superior to any point-and-shoot I have used.  Two or at most three clicks suffice to change any setting.  Using menus on the A700 is almost a pleasure.(4)  PHOTO QUALITY.  The Sony Alpha 700 uses essentially the same photo-sensor that Sony supplies to Nikon for the top-of-the-line Nikon D300.  Its picture quality is at the top of the class.  I first bought a digital camera 8 years ago, but never enjoyed using point-and-shoot digital cameras. Poor controls, really lousy viewfinders, sloppy and inaccurate autofocus, long shutter lags which make action photography impossible, all made me dislike point-and shoot digital cameras.  For photography where the pictures mattered, I continued to use a high-quality film SLR camera. The Sony Alpha 700 is the first digital camera I have used that performs as well as a top-quality film SLR. This is the first digital camera that I enjoy using.  SONY 18-200mm LENS:  the Sony 18-200 mm lens may very possibly have the optical system of the Tamron 18-200mm lens, mounted in a Sony lens mount (Sony owns Tamron).  Tamron introduced a newer 18-250mm lens in 2007, which also comes in a Sony version, and the 18-200mm has become essentially a closeout item.  Originally priced at $499, the 18-200mm lens is now offered for only $200 extra when bought with an Alpha 700 body (the newer Sony 18-250mm lens now costs $549).  But the 18-200mm is close in optical quality to the highly praised Tamron/Sony 18-250mm, it is very sharp at most focal lengths, and my copy is mechanically perfect, with smooth zooming and no `creep.'  For only $200 extra with a camera body, the Sony 18-200mm lens is not just a bargain, it's a steal.
