This Elph packs a lot of features in a small package.  I bought it for it's size.  You could get a digital camera with greater resolution but not in the Elph size.  It fits your shirt pocket.  There is bascically 3 modes of quality for still pictures and AVIs.  The best quality is what I always use and I can still pack in 100+ pictures before my 128MB card is full. The media is easy to swap out with the PC or you can connect it directly to your PC with an optional PCMCIA adaptor.  You can also do a slide show on your PC or TV.  It comes with all the cables.  The camera is rugged and well built.  I like the stainless steel case and it has both a LCD and viewfinder for framing your subject.  The maual mode allows for some control of flash and exposure, but you have to learn the menus.  It's basically point and shoot. The flash, red eye reduction and self timer works well.  Autofocus is accurate, but sometimes has to think about it awhile before shoooting depending on subject and background. The battery life is excellent, but recharging takes some time.  Among the drawbacks:There are a lot of menu choices that you need to learn if you want to get really fancy with all of the modes.  Navigation is fairly simple, but you have a lot of choices. The AVI "best" mode will only do a few seconds of AVI at a time.  This isn't very clear by just reading the manual. Don't expect to shoot family videos though.  Just short snippets with audio. The 8Mb flash card that comes with it is a joke.  I recommend buying 128Mb as an add on.  I also recommend a softcase to keep the camera in for it doesn't come with any kind of case.
