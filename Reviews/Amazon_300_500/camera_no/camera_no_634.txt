This is an excellent camera for the money. The resolution is good enough for a clear 8x10 glossy. It is easy to use and the panorama feature is great. I also like the 35 mm format option that can be selected. It would be nice to have a better zoom. The 2.8X optical zoom is good and is mainly useful for framing. Most of the 10X zoom is digital and I found that if you zoom much over 3X the pictures loose their sharpness. The size is perfect and the appearance and quality is excellent. I was only interested in the models that had the sliding door over the camera lens, so I sacrificed the zoom quality for this feature. I found the instruction manual to be lacking. There are features that the manual does not address, like how to make a panorama, and how to download to your computer. This information is in the software that comes with the camera but they could mention in the manual that one can basically use the camera like a drive on your computer. You don't really need the software to get the pictures to your computer. My only real complaint is with Olympus support. When I loaded my software, I could not run the Camedia Master 4.0 on my Imac because it required a serial number that was supposed to be on the sleeve but it was not. I got the run-around from tech support. They said they would send me new software but did not. I persisted and finally received the software, but it took nearly three months to get it and countless communications with some individuals that had no communication skills and in one case barely spoke English. I was disappointed in the software because it did not have "slide show" as the earlier versions did. To get that you have to pay for a $20.00 upgrade. In my opinion that is just a "rip off". All-in-all I have been very pleased with Olympus products, I just wish they had better technical support.
