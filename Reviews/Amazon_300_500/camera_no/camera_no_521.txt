I've had this camera for less than a week now, so this review is quite premature and, hence, the 4-star rating.  I can at least comment on its storage card functionality.  When I inserted a Kingston, 4-GB microSDHC card into this camera and powered it up, I got the "Card error" as stated on p. 83 of the user manual.  And no matter which button I pressed next, the camera would not navigate away from the screen showing the suggested remedies for the card error.  So, I surely believed that it would not allow me to properly format the card. The Kingston, 4-GB microSDHC card was readable and writable on my laptop running Windows 7 Enterprise.  I even tried the suggested remedies with no luck before submitting a support e-mail at Samsung.com.  They gave to me the same remedies.The Kingston, 4-GB microSDHC card was formatted in the XFAT, FAT, FAT32 & NTFS formats on my laptop.  For each format, the camera still yielded the "Card error" message.Next, I decided to experiment.  I took the Samsung 8-GB microSDHC card out of my HTC smartphone and used it in the camera; the camera properly operated.  Based on this, I formatted the Kingston, 4-GB microSDHC card in my smartphone and used it in the camera; the camera now properly operates.  I submitted a follow-up support e-mail to Samsung reporting my resolution in hopes that it might help someone else.Anyway, I have not played with a majority of the features.  Navigating the menus was quite simple because of my experience with my Canon Powershot A75.  I have taken only a few shots (at the 5 MP resolution) with it so far.  I did record a brief, indoor video; it turned out well.  I will play with it more and take shots at the higher resolutions and upload them to a PC to post a better-educated review.
