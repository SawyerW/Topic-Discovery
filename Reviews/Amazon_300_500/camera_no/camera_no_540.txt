While a lot of people will rate for ease of use, some who have experience with computer graphics will realize that the camera is limited to JPEG images (no option of using TIFF's which are pixel for pixel stored, no loss).. I'm getting a pattern on my images that looks a little like what one sees with video cameras in dark rooms, the images are slightly blurry, the images have inconsistent tones with patches of pink - purple - blue - black - etc. This would say to me that although its high resolution array, the per pixel tone is shabby.. I've seen better pixtures coming from my brother's Kodak digital camera with a similar pixel resolution. There is no way to adjust image loss (what if its set to Jpeg's default of 85?).. Also its a macro lens, dispuportionate images, stuff at the edge is blurry.. Flash direction is not adjustable.. Its only been an hour that I've had it, I'm thinking about sending it back.. And yes it was quick to get the software setup, download from USB is quick, About 8 seconds or so to download from a 8 meg card (USB is usually about 800K a second), I got about 20 images out of the camera in low light, tried flash white balance, incadescent white balance and auto, tried with flash, tried without, tried light metering settings, in all cases (except where there was overexposure) the blackish areas and greyish areas were multi-colored without a continuous tone over large areas where there should be say white or gradations of black, and so forth.. If you really don't care about your images, or find as much beauty in single shots from a video camera, you will be okay with this camera, but forget about using it for photo-quality work.Hey I haven't tried it in sunlight, I took pictures at 10 at night, so its probably a different camera in the day time. I compared all images to images my brother took with his camera in low light.
