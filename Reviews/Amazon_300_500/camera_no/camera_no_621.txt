Honestly, if you can get past the three problems I have with this camera, go out and buy it!! I have taken almost 6,000 pictures in less than a month- it's one of the best! But I have a couple complaints.First, is that it's too slow for it's "class". With a camera this size and with so many features, you would expect faster action than with the pocket-size compact cams. Not so. OK, I will give you that's it a good speed, but if you are trying to take quick snap-shots, it's going to be difficult. Maybe I am asking for too much in $600 but it's gotten t be annoying. The focus ring doesn't do much good because the sensitivity is too slow/low.Secondly, the playback is rather slow for today's cameras. I have an old Canon PowerShot 300/IXUS 300, and it reviewed pictures pretty well, and it's two and a half years old! This isn't a big thing for pro's, but since this is for the crowd that probably likes to take pictures of people and show them back as well, it's annoying having to take 10 seconds of looking at a black screen. Also if you try to switch the camera on and then off quick forget it.Thirdly, the camera has no way of naming each picture in serial fashion, at least if you are using Compact Flash. It's a small detail that has caused me to go through all 6000 pictures and renamed them manually using the Windows 'rename' function. Sure, I think there are programs for this, but I like to keep my stuff out of programs, beause software always changes, and it's just not worth my time.OK, small minor infractions in the whole long run but now I am looking at a Cannon or the new Sony DSC-F828 that's comming out soon. If you like to take pictures for fun, and want more control and flexibility, then this is a great camera. If you like being a control freak when taking pictures for fun, and want to get more serious and take pictures for $$$$ or EUR, then look a higher in the price range.
