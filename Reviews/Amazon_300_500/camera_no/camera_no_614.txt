We looked at the 2megapixel versions that were out plus the 22X zoom cd mavica before purchasing this particular model.  Had there been a zoom version upgrade with the cd rather than the memory sticks, we probably would have purchased it because we liked the zoom feature so much.  We wanted 4 megapixel with the cd option, which left us with this camera.  Having had access to use all 3 cd mavica cameras, we chose this one because the zoom isn't bad, the Zeiss lenses are great and the options are all there.After taking this on a trip to Washington DC, we used only 2 disks using 2nd from the highest resolution.  We also shot a few mpeg videos, which were an interesting endeavor.  Because it isn't a full camcorder, you cannot zoom in and out while making a video.  We didn't find this out until we filmed the changing of the guards at Arlington.  Also, at highest res, you only get 5 minutes 28 seconds of video.  The next step down gives about 28minutes.  All in all, it was great to only have to carry cd's and knowing what we know now, we can go completely high res on our next vacation and not have to worry about disk space.  Also, the functions on the camera allowed us to take pictures of items behind glass at the Smithsonian museums.  We could instantly see if we had a glare or not and the camera offers a few different ways to eliminate the glare completely.  Other than the "wow, this is a different camera" comments through airport security, we had little problem with it.  The battery life was impressive - 3 days before recharging.  If you want to do videos, we would recommend purchasing a separate unit that has more functionality, but it was great if you only wanted to carry one camera.
