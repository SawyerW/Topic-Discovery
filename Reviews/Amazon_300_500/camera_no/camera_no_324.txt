I had been looking for a while for an inexpensive camera to replace my old Vivitar, but every camera I found that had good reviews was over $100.The Vivitar I had is very confusing, and most of what I needed was buried in the menu.  I no longer have the manual, so I frequently ended up with effects that I did not want because I couldnt figure out the controls.  It also ate batteries at an alarming rate.I found this camera at a VERY good price, and the reviews were favorable, so I ordered it.I LOVE it!I love the size - its about half the size of my old camera.I love the rechargeable batteries - no more hunting for AA batteries.I love the simplicity....if I want to take a video, I simply press the video button, and press it again to end the video.  The camera uses a format that can easily be uploaded to the internet (which my old Vivitar did not).If I want to take a picture, I simply slide the cover open, look into the nice large screen, and snap.I love the automatic features - I am usually taking pictures of my foster dogs for the shelter website, and, of course, they tend to move when I snap the picture.  This camera captures them anyway, and adjusts the color nicely regardless of the light.I do have the manual for this camera, but I havent even needed it yet. I have already take new pics, taken a video and uploaded it to the shelter website, all from just studying the buttons.The only thing I DONT love is the software.  It is glitchy (when I loaded it onto my computer it immediately quit working, and asked me to download a fix for it).  Its not intuitive, and I havent been able to dowload anything with the cable yet.But thats okay - I just removed my card from the old camera, put it in the new one, and avoided the whole issue by using the software I already had.
