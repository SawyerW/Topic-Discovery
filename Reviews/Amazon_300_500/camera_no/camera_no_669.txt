I had a nikon D60 before getting this camera.D60 is a great camera but what I hate about it is that:1,no auto focus motor build in, greatly limited lens choice;2,no build in stabilization, have to relied on lens, greatly limited lens choice again;3,bad iso performance, not so usable after iso 800;4,no video function, I want to record happy family moment w/o buying another portable camcorder again.I got myself a k-x, and it solve all the above problems, and I even got extras wit it:1,HDR function which is great and fun to use;2,able to use all the cheap but great old film lens, just manually;3,iso performance actually exceeded my expectation, high iso is not a pain anymore, but a joy to use;4,more color available, I got myself a white version, it is very bright and attractive.However, there are defeats to the k-x, but not critical: (and that's why I gave it a 4 stars but not 5)1,battery reading isn't reliable, it shows me one pair of battery(in full charge)half but another pair full;got away with it easily, simply bring yourself 2 or 3 sets of batteries, and swap them when the camera goes off;2,no focus point confirmation in viewfinder; very critical to some people but I use center point to focus and composite anyways, plus I installed split focusing screen, make the problem even tinnier;3,focus and shutter is quite loud, this might not be ok to some people but I actually like it that way, it gives me a "sturdy" feeling.About image quality and controls and build quality, everyone had mentioned it and there is no point for me to repeat again.As conclusion, this is the cheapest entry level dslr out there with way more than entry level functions.If you are new to dslr world, and would like a entry dslr that accomplish many mid-level functions in a fairly low price tag, the k-x is a no brainier.I got myself a kit of 18-55mm 55-300mm for $650 in 4/2011 just for your comparison, I think their price raised a bit now.
