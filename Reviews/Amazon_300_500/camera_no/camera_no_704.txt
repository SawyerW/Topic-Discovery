Defender Color Video Intercom System GK300-7M2 / B002OL2I30I guess this is a "get what you pay for" situation, since a lot of the other video intercom systems on the market are so much more expensive; presumably, if you really want a video intercom system yourself and don't want to spend an arm and a leg, this will meet your needs.However, this system feels cheaply made and I'm not terribly impressed with it. The video is nowhere near as clear and crisp as the advertising photos - the colors are washed out and sepia-toned, and everyone's eyes look strangely dark and creepy, like Hollywood vampire versions of themselves. The picture is good enough to tell if you recognize the person at the door, but not good enough to describe a stranger to the police.The video duration is extremely short - about 40 seconds - after which, you have to press the button again; if you're watching to see what the stranger at the door does (and whether they leave when you won't answer the door), then you'll have to keep jabbing the video button over and over. This is problematic, as the buttons are big and cheap - they sort of "pop" up and down when you press them, so if the person at the door is listening for movement, they may hear you pushing the video button over and over. And since you only have about 50 feet of cord to work with, you'll probably end up mounting the intercom close enough to the door to be heard.The "talk" button, too, demonstrates a lack of craftsmanship; the button is 'sticky' and if you press the button at the bottom, then you can speak over the intercom, but if you press down on the top half of the button, the video immediately cuts out - I can only assume that the talk button is shorting the feed in some way.We were pretty disappointed, overall, with this video intercom. It's better than nothing, of course, but the advertising photos were much prettier and seemed to indicate a more sophisticated, better made system than what we received.~ Ana Mardoll
