Getting the fullest picture possible has sometimes been a problem with single-lens digital cameras, especially in close-ups. This new dual-lens concept, which combines a 23 mm ultra wide-angle lens with a 39-117 mm optical zoom lens, tackles that problem head on. Getting everybody in the picture on that group shot is a sure thing with the 5 megapixal V570.Another great feature is the in-camera panorama stitching that allows you to create a wide-angle 180-degree picture with just three shots (and an easy to use zoom button on the back of the camera). This is a great feature when taking pictures of rooms in a house, for example, where very simply you can get half the room in a single image - very impressive.The high resolution LCD screen produces clear, sharp images; the color quality is excellent. Also helpful is the picture blur alert and distortion correction feature inside the camera that reduces poor-quality pictures. The camera also has 32 MB of internal memory and can play video and photo sideshows on the LCD screen, though I haven't done any video yet. Of course, in terms of editing, organizing, and printing pictures, the V570 can do what any top-notch single lens can do. Also the sleek black camera body is very classy, and it's no heavier or wider than a single lens.One fault is the need to use a dock (which is included) to hook up the camera to a computer with the USB cable. It's not that much of a big deal, but is another space-wasting piece of equipment and can get in the way in a cramped workspace (like mine).It looks to me like this is only the beginning of what's to come regarding dual-lens camera technology, so some might want to wait for what's ahead. But anyone looking for a great camera purchase today, let me pull your coat to this superb new wide-angle/small size/great resolution dual lens creation, the EasyShare V570. It's a beauty.
