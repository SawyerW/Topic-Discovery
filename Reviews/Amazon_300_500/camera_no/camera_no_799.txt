The Good:The camera takes great pictures with vivid true color in many different lighting conditions.  Image stabilizer works great, I've taken many zoom and low light shots with no blur.  In a low light restaraunt, I was able to take clear, sharp and non-noisey pictures with no flash.Camera has many scene selections and settings as well as a simple point and click mode so it can take good pictures in most conditions.The L15 has a larger than normal screen for this type of camera that is very clear and bright.  Very impressive display, have received may comments about it.Video quality is very good for a small digital camera.  Looked smooth and decent even when played back full size on a laptop disply and a TV.The Bad:As others have commented, the shutter speed is slow.  It took me several attempts to get a decent picture of my three year old.  She would blink or move in the period of time between pressing the shutter release and the camera taking the actual picture.  The delay is far less with no flash but it still creates a challenge getting a pictures of kids or capturing quick moments.After taking a flash picture, you'll need to wait a couple/few seconds before taking the next shot.  I didn't find this to be a very big deal, it has never tken more than a few seconds but some may get annoyed with it, as you can read with other reviewers.Overall:I think the L15 is a great bang for buck digital camera.  I purchased it mostly to take pictures on a trip over seas where I will primarily be taking the usual shots of scenary and people standing in front of scenary so the slow shutter is not a big deal for me.  I wanted an inexpensive small digital that took good pictures in various conditions and I'm very satisfied with this camera.
