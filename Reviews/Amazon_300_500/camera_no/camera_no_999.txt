A Amazon email landed me on the Fuji Z30.  I checked the reviews and I always read the worst one first. And then a few of the "good" ratings reviews. Well after a lifetime in professional photography and 10 years retail cameras sales, this last review is typical. And is way off base. Some one buys a product, it is defective, but do they take it back right away? No they sit on it for 30+ days.  Returning two items to Amazon. I followed their return policy and had no problems.  I returned ( had in the mail) 2-3 days after I got the items. I purchased knee braces. I ordered one size- too small. The next size  was too big. I started amazon's return immediately. Amazon accepted the returns and credited my charge card. What did this experience tell me? Don't order clothing items from on line vendors! It's not Amazon's fault, but my odd size. Now lets talk about Fuji. I have a the Fuji S20 Pro ($1500.00  & a few years old). One day, I pick up the camera and 1/2 of the screen is blank. I called Fuji, not the place I bought it! Fuji said that is sounded like a sensor defect, please send the camera in. I did that. Long story short, Fuji fixed the camera as it was in fact a defect that they took responsibility for. All it cost me was $8 for shipping to Fuji and I had an out of warranty camera repaired at no charge. Now of course this is not the norm for out of warranty repairs, but Fuji could have charged me and I would have not known the difference or they could have told me to "take a long walk on a short bridge".  The moral of my story find out the return policy of retailers and follow it quickly. For service try to deal direct with manufacturers. They normally go out of their way to helpful.
