Bought this as I wanted my wife to really only have one device to carry in her purse for good, quality pictures and HD video. Bought a 32GB SDHC card and sent here away. Has room for thousands of pictures and more than a couple of hours of AVCHD video. Being able to use the zoom during video is great as well (though the HD cable will cost extra if you're planning to hook up to a TV for HD). All in all, one of the best point-and-shoot camera purchases I've made to date. I'm usually a die-hard Canon pocket camera fan (A series up through all the power shots), but the zoom with video was my mitigating purpose.Pros:* Picture quality is great* Very few modes of camera operation, easy for non-photographers to figure it out* Facial recognition with priority focus means I know my daughter or wife is focused on first in a group picture* Video quality is stunning!* The Image Stabilization works amazingly well, and can EASILY be seen when doing video at full zoom (works better than my Canon HD Camcorder, that's for sure!* The 12x optical zoom is MOST impressive!* AI mode is fantastic, it seems to almost always pick the perfect settings* Automatic Red Eye removal works like a champ* Small and light weight, with an aluminum body, makes it tough in my wife's purse* Huge LCD screen on the back* Picture browser is awesome, especially with the Calendar feature!* Quick to power on and ready to take shots* Easy to get great results, just pick the right mode, works awesome (sports, nighttime, indoors, gymnasium, etc)Cons:- Depends on if this matters, but to get great video compression, you need AVCHD, which is sometimes a PITA to edit- No manual controls- Grainy pictures in VERY low light
