I was disappointed by this camera. I read a gazillion reviews before purchasing and expected to be impressed. I was hoping that it would take beautiful pictures indoors and of my pets.  It did not do either of these things.  I had an issue with my previous camera with redeye indoors, and hoped with the technology in this camera that it would correct that.  It did not, and I actually had more pictures with red eye than I did before!  The pictures indoors were no better than my 3 year old cheapo Kodak EasyShare.  The zoom was nice and pictures at a distance did come in clear but it did not zoom as far as I thought a 12x zoom would.  There were several little things that bugged me about this camera, one being that I had to move a switch to go from picture mode to review mode.  My biggest complaint is the time it took to take a picture.  The delay caused me to miss shots. I kept the camera for a few days and played with the different settings, but still was not satisfied. I am sending this camera back.The button to immediately go to video mode was GREAT, and the videos I took were really good quality.  If video quality is important than this may be a good choice for you, but since I already have a really nice camcorder it did not factor into my choice of buying this camera.  I think this camera took high quality photos, but the advanced features and intelligent auto that I thought would help me to take great photos did not meet my expectations.  IMHO I think a cheaper camera would be just as good. The feel of the camera was nice and sturdy as well, and the screen was beautiful.
