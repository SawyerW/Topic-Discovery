I bought the S602 five or six years ago, took about 5,000 photos with it, and then sold it.  I wish I had never sold the camera because of all the great memories I had shooting high school sports photography with it.In it's day, it was a great camera.  Almost DSLR experience except it's a 3.3mp sensor.  Shutter lag was somewhat noticeable - I had to work around it to get great sports photos.Ability in low light was limited.  The Fujinon lens is a nice, fast piece of glass but the limit was always noise at anything above ISO 400.If you can pick one of these up used for about $50-75 on Craigslist (October 2010) then you have a very interesting camera for low $$$'s.I think I paid nearly $600 for it back when it was new.  These days nobody really shoots with a 3 megapixel camera any more.  However, with the manual controls of this camera a person new to photography could learn a lot working with this one.As I got to be a better photographer I kept hitting the limits of the S602 so I replaced it with a Canon d20 DSLR which was a huge jump up from the S602.I found the DSLR's a bit heavy for vacations and casual use, so I picked up a Canon S5 IS (used) for very little money - primarily because I wanted a nice light camera like the S602 however updated with faster processor and more megapixels (the Canon S5 IS did the trick!)I gave the S602 five stars because it was really a classic.  When it first came out it was one of the few "near DSLR-like" cameras that was affordable to the serious amateur photographer.  It's still a classic represents a good value if purchased used at a steeply discounted price (like $50-75 US dollars).
