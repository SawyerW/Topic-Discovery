I purchased this camera as a replacement for a Canon Sure Shot that died after years of giving me excellent service as an inexpensive easy to use camera that took quality photos and videos. I wanted to replace it with another inexpensive point and shoot camera of equal quality and the one I was replacing was no longer made. I saw this Nikon L22 for very good price and trusting the Nikon name purchased it. It has been a big disappointment. My Canon had a sports mode that I used to reduce blur and I could take pictures without flash in very low light and still get bright pictures with correct colors. The Nikon not only has a sports mode but also image stabilization but I can use them together and get a blurred image of an inanimate object. The only way I can get pictures that are not blurry is to use the auto mode with auto flash. But then the flash fires in any setting other than bright sunlight and I end up with pictures that are washed out and colors that are not even close to being correct. They say you get what you pay for but if Canon could make a good inexpensive camera why can't Nikon? The canon also had an instruction book and the controls were so simple it took no time at all to learn to use it. The Nikon comes with a CD only so you have to learn to use it before leaving home and the controls are complicated and buried in layers of screens accessed through the menu button. Want to take a macro shot of a prized flower in your garden? That setting is a sub-setting under sports. Yeah, that's intuitive. If you want a good point and shoot that is inexpensive, look at a camera other than this one.
