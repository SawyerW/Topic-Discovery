I love small cameras and am always in search of the best new small camera.  The F70EXR is at the top of my list for small cameras.  The 10x zoom is what did it for me.Most compact cameras come with only a 3x - 4x zoom lens.  The F70EXR has 10x optical zoom, which makes a huge difference in being able to capture details.  Birds built a nest in my second floor flower box.  Taking pictures of the birds from directly outside the nest caused them to panic, so I went to my roof (two stories up) to take pictures.  I was able to zoom in with the camera and take the pictures.  The quality of the zoomed in images was nice.  There was some noise, but that's to be expected.The F70EXR also has a feature that allows the photographer to take pictures in low light without using the flash.  In this case, the camera snaps 3 quick images and then combines them, thereby reducing noise in low light situations.  I found this feature helpful.  I was able to take images in a dark room without a flash and have them turn out, provided people were relatively still.  They weren't perfect images, but without using a tripod, they were the best I have seen with any camera.For general use, the F70EXR takes nice pictures too.  The colors are lush and I especially like the way this camera handles greens.  The greens look vivid and detailed and actually look better than my previous favorite small camera (Ricoh R6).The size of the F70EXR is perfect.  I feel comfortable putting it in the front pocket of my jeans or throwing it in my purse.Overall, I love this camera and it's my favorite small camera at this time.  The 10x optical zoom is amazing to have in a camera this size. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to zoom in and who wants a small camera.
