This is my 4th digicam, the 3rd for Canon brands.  I have powershot a20, a40, and fuji finepix2800.  You notice that all I've been using is only 2MP camera because to me, 2MP is good enough for me.  OK, Love this camera.  Very small, same features as A40 in general.  I don't really care about the zoom feature.  I know it's only 2x optical + 3x digital zoom.  But that's not really important to me.  If you want zoom than buy yourself a high-end price camcorder.  The camera has lots of features.  When I first got the package, I charged the battery and it took only an hour to do so.  Very fast.  The body is nice, strong, and very fit to my hand.  The battery somehow takes about 1 hour to fully use it even with LCD.  I'm talking about constantly taking picture in 1 hr and the camera needs to be recharge.  The results is exclnt in most cases with lots of effects such as black & white, sephia, vivid color and lots more..... I know you're gonna love this camera, cause I do.The reason I bought this camera cause I have a 3-month old baby boy.  I just can't get enough of him so I want to make sure I can take picture of him every moment and every second in between.  It really fits in my pocket without bothering me at all.  The camera it's just somehow heavy a bit but still considered light.  I was going to wait for the S230 to come in november but I think It's not worth the wait.  Anyway, I don't need 3MP.  I'm just an average users, not a pro.  Just for fun.... P>So guys..... remember, digicam is all about having fun with it.  Don't fall into 4MP, 5MP or maybe 6MP.  The quality is somewhat the same.  People has a tendency to get the biggest of everything to make them big as well.... typical human being.  Not everything big is always big, sometimes small things can bring you happiness as well.  That's what I think about my Powershot S200.  Affordable in price, powerful in features, and small enough to carry it anywhere you want to take it.......
