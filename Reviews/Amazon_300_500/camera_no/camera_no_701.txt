After much research, mostly tending towards nikons and canons, I came across this one. Caught my attention immediately with the metal body, 100% view finder, weather seal, compact size, in body shake reduction (which works nicely). An insignificant detail I like is the omission of scene modes from the settings dial. Already a little biased towards Pentax having used a spotmatic for many years, this is the camera I ended up with. My first D-SLR.  Have to say, I'm not disappointed. Its fast, responsive and fairly easy to use. Feels great in the hand though the N90 might be a shade more comfortable. K7 captures high quality images, good colors, sharpness etc. Would expect that from any high end camera. Continuous shooting hangs after 4-5 shots for memory transfer, maybe I need to use a faster card (using 4gb, class 4).K7 gets criticism for noisy high ISO output, but this doesn't really bother me - if I'm taking pictures at a party or indoor (not professionally), 14 mp of noisy image is enough to down sample for flickr/facebook etc. or regular size prints. Besides, the noise at 3400 ISO is not objectionable. Anyone recall 400 speed film!One disappointment is a limited selection of pentax lenses, e.g. I'd like an equivalent of canon's 24-70mm 2.8 L. Would be nice to have an option for the $99 50mm 1.8 prime (nikon?) vs. the $350 1.4 aperture. Happy with the 18-55 and 50-200 weather seal ones for now....Update (1/2)- discovered a bad pixel on the sensor after downloading images to computer. Little disappointed. Decided to return the camera instead of dealing with customer service. Amazon was great about this... Not to say good or bad about pentax customer service, just didn't want to deal with them a week after purchasing a product... All the same, excellent camera... miss it already. Will probably wait for the next generation.
