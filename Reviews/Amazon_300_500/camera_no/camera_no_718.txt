After going through two other video monitors with poor picture quality (especially at night) that stopped working in less than a year, I purchased this Lorex monitor. The picture quality on this is so much better than on the Summer monitors I had previously. I can actually see my daughter, not just a lump that may or may not be her in the bed. The audio quality is much better and the additional features (such as the ability to view over Skype) are nice. The battery life is much better than on the Summer monitors as well.However, I have had this monitor for 9 months and the receiver unit has broken twice. About 3 months after purchase, it just refused to turn on at all. I contacted Lorex and after an overly long, drawn out process, they agreed to replace it. That meant sending in the broken unit and waiting for a replacement so I was without a monitor for about three weeks. Now here we are 6 months later and I once again have a problem with the receive. The connection for the charging adapter is shoddy and I can only get the monitor to charge if I hold the cord in a very specific position. Needless to say, this makes it impossible to leave on all night. Now I am just down to using it to make sure my daughter stays in bed at nap/bed time but then I have to immediately turn it off and try to get the cable in a decent position to charge it a little bit. I can probably go through the hassle of getting another replacement from Lorex (I haven't checked to see if they will yet), but that will mean being totally without it for several weeks again. In 9 months I should not have had so many issues with this thing. Very frustrating.
