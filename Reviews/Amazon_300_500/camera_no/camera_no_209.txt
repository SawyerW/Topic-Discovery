I picked this camera up when it first came out, i paid a little over a thousand for it, the deal here on amazon is amazing. This camera, is definitely worth the money that i paid, therefore it is without a doubt a hot buy here for its current price.The camera is truely state of the art, one of my many favorite features of this camera would have to be the usage of a 3.5 floppy disk. thats right folks, you simply insert a 3.5 floppy disk into the side of the camera, and vwoala! you snap pictures, when that is used up, insert another one. if the disk isnt formatted, the camera will format it for you. you then insert the disk into you hard drive (Computer drive, that is) and view your pictures.The picture quality is wonderful, its clean and crisp. I actually used this at my brothers highshool graduation, took the pictures home, and printed them out. The pictures came out fantastic. not only did i snap pictures, and delete the ones that i didnt like right from my camera, i recorded approx 30 seconds worth of video footage, which can be used with real player.This camera is one of my favorite electronic goodies around my house, and i have a lot of electronic goodies. The zoom on this camera is quite good, but it pales in comparison to the 1.4X zoom lens that i bought for this camera, man, now that thing is sweet. can we say telescope?!This camera is definitely worth the mula. whether youre looking for a camera for recreational use (like me), or if youre going to use it as a professional photographer (like my dad's friend, who introduced it to us) this camera will satisfy your needs, and then some.It's a fun little gadget, its easy to use, and you'll love it. It's true, it gets the complete 5 stars.
