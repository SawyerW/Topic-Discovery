I purchased the Olympus E-520 Kit for $400 after much online research. The reasons were as follows: photo quality, great price with "must have" features including body anti-shake, smaller size/weight 4/3's lens mount (so you will actually bring the camera with you), 3+ actual photos per second to capture your child on the soccer field or freezing a ball in mid-air, live view, Through The Lens (TTL) Auto-focus/Flash, anti-dust, many manual configurations and a true 10 megapixel sensor. After owning this kit for 2 years I discovered: ALL the above is TRUE! The BATTERY LIFE with the standard battery pack IS AMAZING, often I would go for weeks at a time taking 50 - 100 pictures per soccer game without the need to recharge the battery pack. I soon discovered that I needed a better Tele-focus lens, again after much research I purchased a refurbished Zuiko 70-300mmm lens Olympus Zuiko 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 ED Lens for Olympus and Panasonic Standard Four Thirds Digital SLR Cameras, this is the lens that I ended up using 75% of the time and the standard 14-42mm 25% of the time. I noticed that with my previous point-to-shoot I ended up missing shots and deleting blurred shots about 20% of the time and with the Olympus E-520 about 1% of the time (or 99% of my shots were as intended). My wife noticed that even some of my photos were now suitable to be printed and framed! Another noticeable feature that use of the older Compact Flash (Type I and II) allowed me to purchase an 200x 8GB Lexar card for about $10 which even on vacations was never more than half full with 2000+ photos. Summary: Great value for the money for those that will use auto features 80%+ of the time anyway (that is in point-to-shoot mode). Only CON is no video however, my phone does 720p so I didn't miss it. Remember: The best camera is the one you have when you want to take a picture!
