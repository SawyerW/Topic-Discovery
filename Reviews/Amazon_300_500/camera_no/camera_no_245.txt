Being that this is my first digital camera, I was a little skeptical of its capabilities. The samsung was given to me as a gift by my dad, but not before doing quite a bit of research on digital cameras and choosing this one. Being that my dad is a professional photographer, he was looking for a camera that would fit my needs. Someone who occasionally takes pictures, dosen't want a lot of gadgets & buttons galore. Basic quality pictures with a few amenities. For the asking price this camera has much more megapixels than a camera that is twice the price. It's ease of use is straight forward, and uncomplicated. I had the camera 2 days b4 going on a road trip to monteray calif, and I didn't even read the manual. Within a few hours I knew how to use all of it's features as if I had owned it for many months. I took some great pictures in all different lighting situations, and even a few movie pic's. After downloading them onto my computor, I was amazed on how clear and precise they came out. One of two drawbacks this camera has is it's view screen. When trying to see what it is your taking a picture of during the day, the screen becomes so washed out, it turns white. The other draw back is that it goes through two double AA'S in one day (no lie) And that isn't even having it on but for only a few minutes here and there!! My solution was to purchase "NIMH" rechargeable batteries that should last a least two days. On a 2 or 3 day trip a couple extra sets should be plenty. A week trip or longer, you should carry a least a dozen and don't forget to bring the charging case! In all fairness talking with other owners of digital cameras, The general consensus is that they too with their different brands of digital cameras, have the same issues.
