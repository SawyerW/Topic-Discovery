After reading the reviews on this camera I thought this might be the one I was looking for.  I had some concerns with others thoughts on the long time for the flash to go but I have not found issue with that.  However, the real test will be when I'm at a live performance and am trying to capture the moment presented on stage.  Will see.A little about me:  I have been taking photographs since I was a child so consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable about basic photography.  I have been ''afraid'' of the digital camera as it seemed like there were so many options to research it would just be easier to stay with my APS camera and the old Nikon 35mm standby.  A camera clerk chided me on the APS cartridge one day and suggested I just go get a $100 digital and let the computers at the camera shop do the rest.  Somehow that conversation inspired me to DO IT and make the purchase.  My upcoming vacation helped with the decision also.Overall I am thrilled with this little camera!  Very small and easy to carry.  I am a manual reader and didn't have too much problem figuring out how to use the special features.  Initial set up was a snap!  I took this camera on a vacation immedately after purchasing it and was very pleased with how easy it was to use.  I made a point to read the manual before heading out for the day - over coffee so spent maybe 15 minutes TOPS reviewing the features - and all went well.  I had no problem uploading the photos once I returned home.  Have to yet to print them but I am not concerned.I saw the television commercial for this camera last nite -- with Ashton Kutcher -- which I had seen prior to purchase but did not realize I bought the same camera.  Overall, I love this little toy!!
