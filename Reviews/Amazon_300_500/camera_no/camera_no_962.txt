I always read reviews, but i never write one before. now, this my 1st one, why?... because i am so happy i have my sony H20 camera. Just got a new born baby and want to have a smaller camer can do video. i already have SLR olympus E-330 for years. i started my searching 3 months ago. no doubt ... panasonic ZS3. so many good reviews. so, I waited the price down or a big discount. I finally got my ZS3 from costco with around 249 and with sd card , camera bag. tried 1 week ( I did not read the manual). I was disappointed. i think, maybe this is the limit of P&S; camera. I returned it. I decided to buy a SLR with video funtion. Nikon D5000, I deccided. 2 weeks ago. local big-box store had a big discount for sony h20 for 199. I googled the reviews , not bad. i gave it a try. wow... what a different. ( I did not read the manual) clear pictures right out the box. I showed baby's pictures to my wife. she smiled and said WOW... that's really clear. some picture do blur because baby moving or bad lighting. i do undstand. But I definitely keep this H20. I totally confused, why? I readed the dpreview, they compared them. but... ZS3 should be the best.well... I don't want to study to find out anymore. please check the 3 stars review by Steve N. since, i am going to keep this H20. I read the manual from sony web site. not much help for better picture. only smile button that i need to learn. I have been help for reading reviews here. hope this will help.  I still thinking my returned ZS3... ( maybe I got a lemon  or ... maybe I should read the manual )
