This is the latest Busch's industry-best guidebooks, offering a comprehensive manual for the Nikon D5100 mid-level digital SLR. This one is a companion for Nikon's ground-breaking upgrade from the entry-level D3100.  The D5100 features a swiveling LCD, full HDTV movie making, 16.2 megapixel resolution, and other features not usually found in a low-cost D-SLR.  Busch gives them all a workout in this book, going much deeper than the run-of-the-mill camera guide to offer advice on how to use every control, select every menu option, and take the best pictures of your life.  The author's friendly style leads you through the camera's features and tells you not only what each capability does, but gives examples of when you'll get the most benefit from using it.  Busch explains all the new features for the D5100 in a way that's easy to understand. His novel approach is to condense all the essential information about each and every control on the camera into a multi-page "roadmap" that explains their functions without the need to leap around from page to page, as is the case with the Nikon manual. He devotes several full chapters to outlining every menu option, and actually provides much more detail than you'll find in most of the other "expanded" guides for the D5100.Although this book is a weighty tome, it's easy reading, and if you want a condensed version to carry around with you, Busch offers that too.  His David Busch's Compact Field Guide for the Nikon D5100 is a worthy replacement for those laminated cheat sheets that fold out into six index card sized tabs with one-sentence summaries of most of the menu settings, too. While the portable version duplicates some of the information found in this book, the two make a great pair for home and field. You'll want to buy them both to have the information you need on the go and for study at home.
