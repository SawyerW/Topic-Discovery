The Lumix DMC-ZS3 is a point and shoot camera (no manual controls) which performs very well and produces a very good picture quality in good light while it is working. The low light performance is less impressive, pictures appear to be a bit grainy. Overall, I liked the camera.The LCD of my red Lumix failed after six weeks and I then experienced the poor quality of their customer support. They promised to send me a new camera. Instead they shipped a refurbished one (the sticker on it said 90 days warranty and that tells you in how far they stand behind their product) in black. It had escaped their quality control (if existing) that this camera looked more like a ZS1 than a ZS3 as the AVCHDlite HD letters on the front were missing. The accompanying letter, however, stated that it had been "refurbished to exact factory specifications". I contacted customer support again and was told that under their warranty terms I could claim a refurbished camera only. They would check, however, the availability of a different color. Later I was told to return the refurbished camera, they would send a new one. This "new" camera had the correct color and came in the original box. The box, however, showed signs of extended use and the enclosed invoice stated that the camera was "factory reconditioned". The firmware version  was outdated. Would you trust their oral statement that this camera was brand new? However, what else could I claim for a 6 weeks old camera under their warranty terms?If you decide to buy the DMC-ZS3 you are lucky if it fails during the first four weeks of use because you then can return it without problems to most stores. Thereafter you have to deal with broken promises and additional shipping costs and you may end up with something which is not identical to what you sent in, with a sticker on it "Refurbished in Mexico for Panasonic".
