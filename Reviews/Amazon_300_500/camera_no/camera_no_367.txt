We got this camera as a Christmas present for our family bc we've been wanting a nice and compact camera that would take fairly decent pictures and not take too much time playing with settings.  We really like the camera for these aspects.  The only issue I've had w/ photo quality is that sometimes the camera will decide not to use the flash for you, and I don't like this feature.  I'd prefer to choose whether or not I want the flash.  It's not that I can't choose this option myself, but I have to change settings when I'm trying to take a picture sometimes, which is just a little annoying, but happens rarely.  The video quality is decent, not great, but I don't really expect it to be more than that from a small relatively cheap camera.As for durability, I didn't give it a high rating bc we haven't had it that long so I don't feel like I really know yet.  We did have one incident in which I placed the camera on the floor while the lense was going back in.  I didn't realize it hadn't gone in yet, and the lense got stuck.  At that point we thought I had just broken a brand new camera.  Thankfully we were able to fix it and I have been more careful.  Another thing about durability w/ this camera is that it's plastic.  I'm sure it will get some scratches eventually, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not durable.I only gave 3 stars for delivery bc it came a day late.  That's not too bad, but if they tell you the camera's coming on Wed. and you dont' get it, you start to wonder if someone may have stolen it.  Also since it was delivered by the USPS, I was a little more concerned about whether it got stolen.  However I know they can be slow so I gave it the next day and the camera came.  It was perfect in the packaging - no damage - and everything seemed as it was placed in the package from the factory.Overall, we give this camera 2 thumbs up.
