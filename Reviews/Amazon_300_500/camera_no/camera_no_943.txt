I will begin by addressing the one thing that I like least about the camera, but it is true of EVERY digital camera of any name brand I've ever used -- my own and those handed to me by other people to take pictures of themselves on their own cameras.  And that one thing is:  I can't see the stupid LCD screen outside.  This camera does have a setting that kind of looks like A* which is supposed to adjust the brightness of the screen and it actually works reasonably well, but in some situations I still have a problem.  I am just one of those people who apparently really needs a viewfinder.  Not really a problem with the camera, just me.Everything else about the camera is great. Nice size: small enough to fit in a jacket pocket but substantial enough to feel solid in your hands.  Love the red color and it seems to cheer up passersby as well.  Photgraphs are sharp and well saturated whether in normal or vivid mode and at all focal lengths.I do NOT recommend using it on Intelligent Auto (IA) for macro shots.  It just simply can't seem to figure out what your subject is even though you're almost bumping the lens against it.  I suggest using "Program" and the macro setting for that, along with spot focus (which by the way, is TRUE spot focus).I'm very pleased with this product and it is our third Panasonic camera.  We really like the other two as well.  This one has both shorter and longer focal lengths than my husband's, but lacks a few features of my FZ8 (being able to choose shutter speed and aperture for example) but the FZ8 is much larger and more awkward to carry around.  This is one we share or take with us when we only want to carry one camera for the two of us.Excellent value for the price.  You get more than you paid for!
