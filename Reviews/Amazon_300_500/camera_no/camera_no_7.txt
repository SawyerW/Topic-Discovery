All of those concerns about poor results with the built in flash are true -- I'm just an amateur who loves taking photos, for whom this was a first SLR of any kind.  So, I love fiddling with the options, and right now, black and white is my favorite mode.  This camera makes picture taking a joy, I don't have to miss that fleeting moment anymore  with the incredible number of continuous shots per second you can take.  But 1 week after buying this camera I had to invest in the speedlite 580EX flash, and I bought the EF-S 17-85 lens as well.  With those two additions, I can't take this camera anywhere without forethought.  So now, I've gone back to a sony cybershot p200 for all those family pix when we're just hanging out.  I would say skip the 18-55mm lens kit alltogether, since I was not impressed with the lens performance, and low light / indoor performance is much better with the 17-85mm EFS  for all purpose use if you don't want to do too much post editing.All things considered, 6 months later, I am planning on staying away from EF-S lenses in the future, since when I upgrade this camera a couple of years down the road, I want the lenses to be compatible with the full 35mm film size sensors of the EOS 1Ds Mark II equivalents.  I am beginning to love the picture taking power afforded by an SLR and would love to have access to true wide angle.  So if you don't want your $$$ to be wasted, stick to adding on L series lenses.I would not hesitate at this point in time to buy the 20D again, i.e. I wouldn't wait for the next latest greatest camera, and truly for my use at home and school activities this is more than I'd dreamed of being able to do.
