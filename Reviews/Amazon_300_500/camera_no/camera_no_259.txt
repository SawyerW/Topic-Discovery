I chose the A70 looking for a entry-level model, and this camera has met my expectations.  I feel it is a good value because it offers more than I was looking for but is still priced well within where I would expect it to be.This camera is easy to use out of the box.  It has a lot of features and shooting modes that I would not expect at this price.  The manual is easy to follow, and the software is easy to install and use.There are only a few improvements that I would like to see.  Regarding the body, the terminal cover seems flimsy and can be difficult to slide open, and the LCD monitor is glossy and seems prone to scratching.  There is also no battery meter other than a "low battery" indicator.  None of these issues would deter me from buying this camera.I've also noticed inconsistent quality in low-light shooting.  That may be the operator rather than the camera, but keep this in mind if you will use this a lot for low-light pictures.I like being able to use 4 alkaline batteries, and I got around 215 shots (most with flash) before having to replace the batteries.  The 16MB Compact Flash card it comes with will of course need to be upgraded, but this is true of most digicams.  The A70 does offer a wide range of picture size and image quality, so you can get anywhere from 8 to 150 pictures on a 16MB card depending on what resolution you shoot.This is also a popular model, so there are a lot of resources on the web. After a month of use, I have not had any problems with it.  I'm very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality entry-level digicam.
