I am a camera buff. Have used many cameras and have shot thousands of photos. Having said that, the 20D was dissappointing to me for a few reasons.1. The white balance is pathetic, especially under incandescent light - absolutely no improvements over the rebel.2. As with the rebel, many of your shots get over exposed by default. I have consistently been able to reproduce this problem with the rebel 300, rebel 350 and the 20D.3. Sharpening algorithm looks almost same as what is used in the compact powershot models.4. No spot metering - was this a hugely complex thing to incorporate? Canon responds to most complaints by "well, you have options to do things manually...". but at the same time, they leave out spot metering which is by far the most dependable manual feature when doing macro photography.Agreed these are not too many shortcomings. But, these are just so basic that I am not able to understand why the most expensive prosumer dSLR on the market today cannot have these...Statements like "best value for money.." are very subjective. If you are the kind of guy who could easily afford a 20D, and keep it in your closet and go get another Nikon D70 and still not worry about your budget, then yes, for you this may be a good value for money - lots of features and options to play with.But if you are like me, for whom an investment of 1500 bucks is like once in a few years thing then this is NOT the best value for the money. You would be far better off getting a cheaper camera that does not have a lot of fancy features but one that does have all the basic features well laid out.If I have to rely on "Digital dark room" to perfect my photos, I do not need to spend a fortune getting this overly hyped up camera.I would strongly recommend the Nikon D70 instead of the canon 20D. It does great on all the 4 basic things that I mentioned above which the 20D fails to have....I do not work for Nikon and these are just my personal opinions.
