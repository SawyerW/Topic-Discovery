Hello,I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago. I was very skeptic about it but i gave nikon another try.I had an old 2.5MP from nikon I loved, so i bought the Nikon L1 and hated it to death it was garbage - slow, worthless video and so on.I returned it and purchased the canon with 6MP..it was nice but i still missed the old nikon.After going back and forth i decided i give nikon another try - i love it !The Nikon is quick even with Flash but you need to know which setting you need for what type of pictures.I work in a daycare and tokk pictures of kids today i caught them in the position i pressed the shutter...awesome.Took a picture of my daughter playing with water and you can even see the single water drops when she splashed.the macro is awesome - you can see every single detailIt has a little shutter lag when you take pictures in low lightalso when you just to far away and the object is moving. but thats ok.you can however adjust this yourself and yes after reading the manual you can take awesome pics and FAST !!!The video quality is like TV or DVD...i have an samsung camcorder 8mm tape and the nikon takes better quality video..and my camcorder is only 2 years old.You can use up to 4GB SD Cards and the battery life is long.I took at least 1 hour of Video and maked the rest of my 4GB out with Pictures and I am still on the Batteries that came with the camera...If you just want to take some camera out of the box and shootthis might not be the one but if you dont mind going through the manual for 30 min, so you know what you doing you will get rewarded withawesome pictures, awesome video and of course a reliable brand with little costs.I am back with Nikon and i love it !!!All i can say this camera has no negative side effects for me since i went throught the manual and know what i'm doing and yes i am not a geek or anything like that, just a mom and a daycare provider and i was able to manage it.if you want a real good camera for lessthis is the one, is not only small and handy but very light.It can easy fit in a pocket and no one would know.and besides that it looks nice and shiny,BTW you can see the display in direct sunlight.I am still discovering the camera and with each day I love it more!
