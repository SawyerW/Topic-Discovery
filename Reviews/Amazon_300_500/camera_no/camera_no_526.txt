After doing extensive research both online and in stores (where you can actually hold the cameras), I decided that the Olympus D-520 was a great blend between features and price. Unless you're a pro photographer, you're not going to need more than 2 megapixel detail. I don't even use the highest setting, so I can store more pics on my memory card and computer. The camera has so many options, it's awesome. Read the manual for all the details.Having used an older Olympus 1.3 mp model, I knew what I wanted in my OWN camera. The 3x optical zoom is, IMHO, essential. Taking big pictures and cropping doesn't make up for being able to zoom in. A store salesperson said that zoom lenses have to be of a higher optical quality than normal ones too. I wanted a small, lightweight package, which this definitely is. It only takes 2 AA batteries, and it's a lot smaller than previous models and those ones with the big 10x lenses. It takes Quicktime movies (in 15" or 1 minute segments, depending on resolution), but they don't have sound, so it's pretty useless, in my opinion.Recommended accessories (in no order):  1. NIMH batteries (I got a set of 4 with a rapid charger)  2. Extra memory card (I already had a 64 Mb card, but it goes up to 128 on this camera.)  3. Carrying case (Bring your purchased camera, batteries, and memory card to a bunch of stores until you find one that fits well. I got a Tamarac that fits like a glove!)  4. USB Smart Media card reader (If you won't be using rechargeable batteries. If so, the included cable is just as fast and more compact for travel.)If you plan on doing serious editing, the included Camedia software probably won't cut it, but it works fine for the casual user who just wants to view and edit pics.I hope this helps your purchasing decision. It's an awesome camera!
