You should all know that Canon makes the best 2X Megapixel cameras in [that price] range. Above that range - I would buy Nikon or Fuji.I was looking at: Canon S330, S200, A40 - in that order. I went to [2 different camera stores] for all my information and learned a lot. I threw out the S200 because of the 2X zoom rather than the 3x optical zoom of the A40 and S330. I looked at the S330 and A40 and went with the A40 since it was [less expensive] and the features the S330 had over the A40 was not enough for me to spend [that much] more. Here are the differences: * The S330 is the ELPH model and smaller than the A40. The A40 sits in your hand better with the curve. The S330 was easy to drop and not any lighter.* The A40 uses AA batteries. The S330 uses rechargebale Lithium ion batteries. I use rechargeables AA already. The S330 also comes with a charger and the A40 does not.* Both view screens are the same on the back - 1.5 inches. Both can use AUTO, Manual, Macro, Portrait, and Landscape.* Both have the same flash functions - red eye, off, auto.* Both cameras can shoot 30 second movies with AUDIO.* The S330 has the ability to set personal settings, like when you turn it self-timer - you can record yourself saying" Get Ready!". The A40 does not.* I don't think the A40 lets you record AUDIO per picture like the S330 does. For example, the S330 you can record your memories of the photo while you take it. Not on the A40.* Both have same software - it's very good for downloading. It uses USB to the PC (I have XP) and auto downloads new photos. A snap to set up.* Both have same resolution - Large, Med, Small. Same Compression - Normal, Fine, SuperFine.* Both come with 8 MB card - not enough - get a 64MB.* Both come with all cordsGood luck. For me the voice controls and smallness were not worth [the extra money]. The A40 works great. The pictures are very clear, sharp, and easy to load into the PC.
