This is my first experience with DSLR photography. I have been very pleased. I really like having both lenses, because it allows me a vast range of zoom, which is important to me since I like to shoot a lot of nature shots, and many nature shots require a high zoom because subjects do not stay still, nor to they like man to approach very closely. Even people are more easily photographed when you are farther away.I saw in reviews that battery life was short, primarily because live view and flash eat a lot of power. I have turned both off for the majority of my shooting, and have found that the batteries can last for several days of intense photographic experience. I am extremely pleased with the photos that I have been able to take without tripod and in poor lighting. I have had a little difficulty with caves recently, but night seems not to be extremely limiting with natural light, particularly near the city. Moon light is adequate for my purposes.I wish I had a compact case in which I could carry my camera, two lenses, and a spare set of batteries so I could always have fresh batteries on hand when I need them.I was a little disappointed with the movie feature, since it appears that it can not shift focus while shooting video. I have trouble telling whether or not my shot is perfectly focused using the view finder, or even the live view, and I certainly am not skilled yet in shifting focus manually in a smooth way. However, I am sure that practice will help and future models will resolve this problem. I can keep the lenses and use them on future models, so it is not a dismal disappointment. Besides, I would need to improve my tracking skills to get a long movie anyway.
