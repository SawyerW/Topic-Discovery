If you are a camera snob, and you like fooling with the controls and settings then this camera is great for you.  If you are like me and you want a great quality camera that takes point and shoot great photos in normal conditions than you will feel like I do, this camera is a pain in the ass.I am used to the cannon powershot digital elph series.  There is no doubt that the Lumix takes slightly better photos but the ease of use and the ease of picture transfer is way better in the cannon.Here are my pros1. Great quality photos2. Good flash for the size3. Wide Angle lens is helpful for my work (real estate)Here are my cons1.  Funky controls that are loose and can be accidentally pressed or moved by normal handling2.  If the camera is not completely still when taking a photo at normal setting the picture is blurry.  Even with the "optical image stabilization" on.3.  They have a special cord to transfer photos to your computer.  The stupidest design feature is the panasonic specific cord that is necessary to connect the camera to the computer.  The cannon uses a standard USB so, even though i mis-placed the cord that came with the cannon I have about 20 other standard USB cords so I am never slowed down.  I mis placed the Lumix cord so now I have to either take out the little SD card and transfer it to the cannon to upload or use my home computer that has a reader for that chip size.  Basically their design is costing me time and eventually money cause I will need to buy another cord.4.  Not really that small. Yes it is compact for the features but it is heavy and about 40% larger than my cannon so I can't just put it in my pocket like I did the cannon, i have to specifically carry this camera.
