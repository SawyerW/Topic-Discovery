I received my Canon A70 about a week ago in the mail.  This is my second digital camera- my first being an old Olympus D360-L point and shooter.  Thus far, I love my new camera!  I can go on and on about it, but I'll try to summarize what I like and don't quite like about it.Likes1. Lots of manual controls - shutter speed, real manual focus, white balance2. Great pre-sets - these let me take great pictures for certain pre-set environments (fast action, portrait, panoramic, slow shutter, etc...)  Easily accessible on dial at the top of camera3. Nice size - not too small and light, so my twitchy hands don't mess it up too much, but not bulky like some of the other cameras with manual controls4. Battery life - I still have not run out of a charge, during a day or two's use.  (Note: I use 1600 mA LiMH batteries and charge them after every day or two)5. Sharp screen - hi-resolution screen, though not terribly bright in direct sunlight6. Great looking pictures!7. Video mode, with sound up to 640x480 for 30 secs, and lower resolutions for much longer.8. Looks great!9. Able to fit additional lenses as well as waterproof housing (Not that I'm planning on getting these yet, but its nice to know I have the choice to!)Not Likes:1. Takes a bit of time for the zoom lens to extend when turning the camera on.2. Plastic tripod mountI've printed my cropped 8x10" photos out on my Canon S600 printer on glossy paper and they look awesome!Anyways, I really like this thing a lot, so I heartily recommend this to people who are looking for a point-and-shoot, as well as those who are trying to learn to dabble a little bit more with their camera's manual controls (like myself!)
