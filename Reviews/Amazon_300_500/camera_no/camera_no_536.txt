I've been waiting for a while to get a 2 megapixel camera for [this price].  This one fits the bill nicely.  The image quality is good (as expected from Olympus), the battery life is good (surprisingly so), and the control interface is OK (too few buttons control too many features, lots of back-and-forth).  I particularly like the body design form-factor. The clamshell case is nice and tough, feels good in your hand, and -- this is a BIG plus -- does not have that wacky pop-up-flash that the Olympus D-5*** models have.  I suppose they had to do that to make room for the zoom lens, which this model lacks.The lack of optical zoom is, of course, the biggest drawback of this camera.  Bear in mind, though, it's what enables the...price, so it's a trade off.  The optical zoom works acceptably, though the image quality does degrade.  Again, that the trade off.Finally, a word about the software.  I'm a long-time Photoshop user, so (in my experienced opinion) the freebie "photo-editing" software that comes with any digital camera is [cruddy], not worth the CD it's burned onto.  They may offer some value as a way to catalog photos, but their retouching abilities are a joke.  Just out of curiosity, I tried running it on my Mac. It crashed the machine when I tried using the red-eye reduction.  I realize that non-pros are not going to buy the...full-version of Photoshop -- but the [less expensive] Photoshop Elements (formerly "LE") is pretty good.  Quite frankly, a digital camera without decent photo-editing software is a bit of a lame duck.  Consider investing in such software as you would any essential accessory, like a tripod or case or memory card.All in all, I'm glad I bought this camera and feel like I got a good deal.  I haven't made many consumer electronics purchases recently I can say that about.
