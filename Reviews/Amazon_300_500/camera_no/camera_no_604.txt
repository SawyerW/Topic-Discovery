Hey i bought this camera because of the other reviews but it did not live up to its hype or its price!  The cons of it are:-Terrible shots at night (when it needs flash)  If you want to go to nightclubs and take shots, or take shots at night, you are limited to 6feet distance.  The good cameras for night shots are the Nikons and Olympus.-The video mode will only goes to 30 seconds maximum.  It should go to as long as the memory card allows, but it doesnt.  For that feature get the Canon A60.-Only 2x Optical zoom, digital zoom should not be used with any camera.-The picture quality is not as good as it should be at the lower pixels levels such as 800x600.  But a plus is when you shoot at higher pixel levels.  But at that level all digital cameras shine.But on the positive side:+Small(its really compact)!!!!  I take it everywhere.  I took it to me when i go places where i 'should not' be going, and it was so small i had no problem taking it out, shooting a picture, and putting it away in my pocket (pant pocket, or jacket pocket, or even shirt pocket) and no one was the wiser.  Its really useful when shoping and i need to take pictures in the store of merchandise.  Most stores(especially Frys, Walmart, etc) dont allow that but its so small the stores dont even notice.  All in all for the price premium, if you can wait till better small cameras come out, or if you have to buy a compact camera now, this is an average quality compact camera.  For a good compact camera go for Nikon, they have better night time flash, then i would recommend Olympus, then the new 'Pentax Optio S 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom.'
