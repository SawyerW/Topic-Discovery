I bought this camera in the Spring of 2007 after owning a D50 for almost a year. I shoot a couple hundred shots a month unless I am going to an event or attraction and then that number goes way up. You can see examples of my photography on Amazon under the D80, Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras,  Nikon D50 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only),  Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens, etc. under the Customer Images area.Here are my thoughts on this camera compared to the D50.I am glad I updated because the D80 lets you do more tweaking then the D50 and the performance is at a higher level. The increase to 10 from 6 MP is visible on large photos. The increased buffer and slightly higher frame rate then the D50 really helps in action photography. The Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 Digital SLR Camera is a great addition that the D50 does not have and that allows for longer shooting without changing the batteries and for better camera control when the camera is turned sideways in portrait orientation.  But the D80 is not perfect. Here are my Pros and Cons.Pros-Easy of use and of changing WB, Exposure, Image Format, etc-Large viewing screen on back of camera-Large buffer and 3 fps-rugged construction-detailed 10.4 MP photosCons-Low level ISO noise seems worse then D50 even with in camera High Iso Noise reduction maxed out-Lower number of exposures on battery charge then D50-Well documented problems with over exposure (set EV to -0.3 or -0.7 to compensate)-Does not have the water resistant seals of D200I would buy the D80 again, but I really would like to upgrade to the  Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) someday. It seems to have 99% of what I want in a camera. Having to buy the pricy battery grip and switch to CF cards after spending $1800 are the only things I don't like about the D300.UPDATE: Those considering this camera may want to wait a couple of months. Speculation is that there is going to be an updated D80 being announced soon (end of Jan 08 or beginning of Feb 08). Google either D80s or D90. It is speculated that this model will have some of the cool new features of the D300 such as live view and bigger sensor. I would think it would go for around $1000, the msrp of the D80 was $999 when it was launched in 2006.
