I have a love/hate relationship with my CX4200, but overall I rate this as a good little camera. I must admit there are some annoying features, the 16mb internal memory is worthless for instance, offering storage for only 20 photos. The LCD screen on the back is too small, not very good for reviewing pictures, and when using the (slow) internal memory, the picures in review mode take a few seconds to sharpen up. The internal memory is also painfully slow when taking pictures, with an annoying, long wait in between pictures. However, the camera becomes a different thing all together with a high performance SD memory card installed, offering better reviewing, picture taking and transfer speed to the computer. The picture quality is very good for a budget digital, colors are vivid, detail good. I find it doesnt perform very well in low light conditions however (like all digital cameras) and you must be careful to press the shutter button halfway down before taking pics, or risk over/under exposure. However, all cheap digicams share these problems, and i find the quality of the pics very good, i find this camera easy to use. With good quality Nimh batteries, it gives a reasonable shooting time in daylight, althought the flash reduces the battery life greatly. I also find the flash a bit too powerful at close range, although I'm sure that power would come in handy when illuminating a dark area from a long distance. All in all, this is good and I prefer the simplicity of the design, I even like the lack of zoom. The lack of zoom also increases the battery life. If you want a fancy camera, get a DSLR, if u just want to snap family pics, the CX4200 is a bargain, especially at the hugely dicounted prices I have seen lately. (they are obiously running the model out)
