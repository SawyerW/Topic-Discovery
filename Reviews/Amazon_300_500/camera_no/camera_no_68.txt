I got this camera a month ago for my birthday. When i opened it up i was astounded. The camera is tiny and extremely thin, yet it has a giant bright screen on the back. I'm an artist and i like to have my camera at all times, making this one perfect since it fits in my pocket along with many other things. There are many pros and few cons. First off in other reviews people said the flash was week and sound playback quiet.  These are both completely false, both are outstanding to what i have seen in other cameras.Feature wise it's decent.  It has a lot of good themes for taking pictures of certain things, and its extremely comprehensive.  Changing simple settings like flash on/off and macro mode are extremely good and easily visible on screen.  The one quible i would have is the lack of extra specific adjustments for getting the picture just right.  If your not a big time photographer the features are by far enough.  Now for picture quality etc.  First off this camera has a rediculous number of pixels for its size.  This is both good and bad.  Lots of pixels means lots of detail, and with the right lighting this camera can get some very crisp shots.  However in low lighting pictures can be blurry and if you blow up the pictures big enough you can see little bloches of color.  For the most part this is no problem especially if you are proficient in photoshop.  Video recording is excellent the quality can completely replace your video camera (aside from the zoom).  Which reminds me, zoom isn't great, but there's so much detail in the photo that you can just crop it down and it looks just as good.In conclusion this camera accomplishes all of the following- wow your friends, fits anywhere, easy to use, takes good big pictures, takes great video, and is generaly a great deal
