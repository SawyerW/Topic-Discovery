This is a neat little camera if you want an inexpensive digital camera and don't need high quality pictures.Picture sizes are 640x480 or 1280x960.  It holds 53 pictures regardless of size.  Each image takes 2 to 6 seconds to download on my 700 mHz machine; it varies with picture size and complexity.  The 1280x960 pictures do indeed have better resolution than 640x480.It's the size of a credit card, but about 3/8" thick so it won't fit in a wallet.  At the lens, it's about 1/2" or 5/8" thick.  It's light enough that I forget I have it in my pocket.  I plan to keep one in my laptop briefcase, to take pictures of whiteboards before they get erased.  (I won't be able to read all of what's written; the image quality isn't quite good enough.)Very easy to install and use.  Once the software is installed, just plug the camera in.  If there are any pictures in the camera a popup appears.  Just click OK or hit space to move them to your computer (or click Browse to navigate).  Fine for even techno-challenged folks, if they can find the USB port.  The unreplacable battery recharges through the USB cable.The biggest limitation is no flash.  Takes OK pics in a typical well-lit office setting, but you have to hold it very still.  Fine outdoors even on cloudy days.Optics are not great (what do you expect from such a tiny lens?)  There is very noticeable radial lens distortion (straight lines near the picture edge bow outward).  Resolution problems are noticeable when you display the images at full size, but images are fine up to a print size of 4x6" -- like an Instamatic or a disposable.Of course, it doesn't have any of the nice features we expect from bigger or more expensive cameras.  No zoom, no image display.For example shots, see ...".  The first image is 640x480, the second is 1280x960.It's a great novelty or convenience, and it's very affordable.
