I'd been thinking about buying a small digital camera for about 3 years. My girlfriend continues to impress me with her pont and shoot, on the go picture taking ability with her tiny camera. That's what I was looking for, a camera that disappears when you don't need it.I was originally looking at the Nikon 3100. However, while visiting in CA, I was introduced to the Optio S4i. What a small camera! And 1 megapixel more than the 3100. All for about $50 more (or more than that, now that the 3200 is out). I did some reasearch online that night and decided to buy it the next day.Have not been disappointed yet.The picture quality is very good (not the bestest). The lag time is negligable and I find the interface for the most part intuitive. It has a lot of handy modes to help one take a great picture. The idiot modes included in the camera's software are great! Makes a spontaneous picture look even better. I know that a lot of people gripe about not being able to manually control the camera, but his is not what this cameral was built for. It's built for take-along point-and-shoot fun where you don't have to think too hard. Continuous movie mode at 15 frames per second is also very nice. The size is also perfect. About the size of an Altoid can - slips into a pocket easily. Tamrac makes a great carrying case which accomidates the camera and a couple of SD cards.The only gripe I have with it so far is a minimal "fishbowl" effect that is only noticeable when a lot of straight lines are present (took a picture of a tiled floor). However, this is found in most point and shoot cameras (some more than others), so no big loss.Overall I'd say I am very satisfied. This camera will keep me happy taking pictures for a long time. When I get used to digital pictures, that's when I will go for the SLR, control everything camera. And even then, this camera will still be great for vacations and outings where a 17 pound camera bag is a third wheel.
