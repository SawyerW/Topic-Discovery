......you do have to be smarter than the camera as it is not exactly a point and shoot....It has a host of likable features that someone with old photo experience will appreciate, as well as a host of imaging modes....If its not outdoors in bright lights, you will likely have to change settings to maximize the odds of your getting the pic, and you will definite need to follow the fundamental rules of low-light photography; those whining about blurred pics clearly are not smarter than the camera. I'm getting some really nice/pleasing pics with it in non-point & shoot lighting conditions, particularly with the 1600ASA.Its light weight, I love the 15x optical zoom. I get a good run on NiMh bats, but I shoot mostly at 5mp, I've turned all the sounds off except for the shutter, and turn it off after every pic.Mine has been on a mutli-night hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and to the summit of Longs Peak, with pics that stop folks in their tracks, in all lighting conditions from the dark of an alpine night, to moon light, to noon desert.If you're looking for a no-brainer point & shoot, and you are not up on the basic rules of sharp picture, not in sync with getting mentally & physically in tune with snagging a pic, this isn't the camera for you. Though, it does point & shoot like a champ in the correct point & shoot conditions.Like I said, I like it, a lot, but as an old 35SLR guy from the days when they didn't have internal light metering systems, I am smarter than both the L110 and the conditions in which I like to take pics. This was a no brainer for meAs the prices come down, I'll likely be picking a couple more L110s up for the out years as the technology rapidly moves on. But then, I'm still packing a couple Olympus C-2100s and C-750s as I really like them too.
