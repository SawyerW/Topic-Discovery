A lot of people say this is a great camera but a little too pricey. I say this is a great camera at a great price. Sure there are other 2mp cameras that are a little cheaper but after using this one and its predecessor the S300, the others don't compare in overall ease of use, speed of use and quality of construction.Although this camera can still give you better results with a little tweaking, the automatic settings are better than almost all others in this price range. And of course this is one of the most Pocketable cameras out there. Don't get me wrong there are some very cool manual features on this great little camera. My favorite is the slow shutter control. You can set the shutter to several speeds from 1 second to 15 seconds. And the camera comes with built in processing to eliminate hot pixels (those bright spots that appear on most long exposure digital pics). I have used this several times always with good results.Overall there is little to complain about with this package. It comes with a good battery for general use, good software, all the cabling you need to get going and even a fairly well written manual. If you are planning on using this on long trips where you will not have access to an electrical outlet very often, then you will want to get the extra battery. And I highly recomend the Canon PSC-300 Case, it is perfectly sized for this camera and still has room for extra memory and battery.Do yourself a favor and get a Viking 128MB compact flash card. The reviews I have read tell me this is the best memory for the dollar. Very fast and very cheap....These are bar none, the best digital camera reviews on the net.Buy this camera and enjoy!
