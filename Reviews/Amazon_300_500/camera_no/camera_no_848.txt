Took the camera out first day to a local florist shop and a nursery to test it on flowers.  Very pleased with the result.  Auto focus worked perfectly, images are sharp, high in detail, well saturated, true greens, reds, blues; no color cast problem, no fringing.  The tele macro pulls in flowers from 15 feet away, or longer if you go down to 3 mp, as if they were inches from the lens.  Can't complain.  Next day took it to the local produce market to test macro, and was again very pleased with focus, sharpness, color, everything.  Last night put it to its real work at an art opening doing casual posed shots with celebs and video of speakers.  Flash worked fine for the posed shots.  The high-speed burst mode is great for doing talking heads; just hold down the button and out of 20 shots you can pick the good ones.  The best is the video.  You can zoom to the full 12x and fill the frame with the head from 18 feet away, and the sound is excellent for a built in mike.  The MPEG video mode yields sharp, clear images. The multi-layer menu structure lets you pick from a simple menu, a medium menu, and a full menu with zillions of options. I have a big 35mm digital with a stack of lenses from 12 to 1000 mm, and it can make fine pictures, but it weighs a ton.  I also have a little Kodak V1003 10mp pocket digital that takes good pictures within its range.  But the ZS3 runs rings around the Kodak, and still fits in a shirt pocket.  Both the Kodak and the big 35 mm are going to be gathering dust, I'm afraid, now that I have this talented little performer.  The downside is the software.  The Panasonic Photo Fun app crashed on Win RC7 so many times in so many different ways that I uninstalled it after 48 hours.  Google's Picasa3 does so much more, and it works.  But the ArcSoft video utility and the panorama stitcher, separate programs supplied with the Lumix, are OK.  Bottom line, great camera, five stars from me.
