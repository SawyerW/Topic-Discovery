Ok, so the max resolution is 3.2 MP. In and of itself this isn't a problem . For years I toted around a Sony DSC-P30 (see my other reviews) 1.3 mp camera with great quality that I could print out to 5x7. I guess i've been spoiled by my Nikon 5700 and 8800. For what you pay for in this camera, you get mariginal results. OK 3.2 mp isn't gonna cut the mustard at 8x11 or higher print size. The image quality is nothing your gonna desplay at a gallery. However for point and shoot events like a party, this camera comes into its own. Its form factor is tiny and I imagine anyone that buys this camera is looking for something small. When I don't wanna lug my huge Nikon 8800 around, this is what I take. I hope its not a fleeting moment at the party because it takes 3 plus sec between shot to shot with flash on this camera and there is no burst mode (Casio give us one with a software update!) For the casual photographer this will work just fine. For the price it can't be beat esp for the low 200's that its offered for online. Color reprudction is of but stick to bright natural light, otherwise the camera will default to iso 200 for scenes, noise fillled, that  don't really need that setting. I use this camera at parties for the small form factor and not really for the quality. 5 x 7's are fine. Anything larger is not. Its a great cool looking camera but by no means the best in photo quality. Future gererations of the ceramic lens i'm sure will be great but because of the slow shutter lag I have to resign this to party events when a samll camera is required or for ebay photos. Plese see my test shots then look for my others for the Niknon 5700 or 8800. You be the judge. Personnaly i like the camera for its small size but the quality left me wanting. For ebay its fine for practical imaging, you let me know.
