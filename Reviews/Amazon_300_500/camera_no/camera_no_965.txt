After looking at most of the cameras that fit the needs of my wife, I chose the Nikon - S630  COOLPIX.  I read dozens of reviews - some good and some not so good. I think that the poor reviews were mostly from people who had too high expectation of this little NIKON.  Well here is mind review. The camera is small and the controls are well thought out.The camera fits easily  in a pocket or purse.  One of the best features is the 7X zoom lens, that works great. I took a picture of a wall and window to a restaurant in the City Centre, Las Wages and then zoomed in thru the window to see a chef making Japanese Sushi,  awesome pics.  The camera is fast and the quality of the pictures is almost as good as my expensive DSLR. The only thing is does not take pictures while swinging the camera around, but who does that?  The camera worked well in dark situations on AUTO. and also with the flash turned off. I shot sunsets and scenes in the desert with good quality. Inside shots were better than I thought they would be. The old camera was a Canon and it took great pics too, but the S630 Coolpic was even better to my surprise.  Another great feature is the lens is out in a second or less ready to shoot, so you don't miss a shot. We got about 200 shots per charge on the rechargeable battery and used a 4 GB memory chip which gave over 1250 pictures at the highest quality. I have yet to use the movie feature and some of the other manual features. The camera can even tell when a person smiles or blinks - amazing.  If you are looking for a compact camera and very good quality, this Coolpic S630 fit the bill for me.  Now my wife want her Christmas present back, so she can shoot some pics and she did and her pictures came out great too. She liked the Zoom right by the release button. the 2.7 inch view is plenty big too! Happy hunting for a camera at $200 with a case and memory chip  too. :)
