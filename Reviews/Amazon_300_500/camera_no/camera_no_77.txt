My wife and I have owned the Casio Exilim for over a year.  I am writing this review now to give an impression of our normal usage and how the Exilim has performed.I have been extremely pleased.  The big pluses are:* FAST! Camera turns on and is ready to take pictures almost instantly! - one of the criteria I looked at closely when purchasing was the "boot" time.  We tested the display models at a store before purchasing.  This model was the fastest by far.* SD card easy to access - I strongly recommend purchasing a large SD card and a card reader for your desktop or laptop.  It makes transferring and managing your images fast and simple.* Comes with excellent dock - I have come to love a good docking station for electronic products.  The Exilim comes with a dock that is well designed and works great for recharging.* Is very slim - this is truly a pocket camera.  The best camera is the one you have with you.  Period.* Large screen size - nearly the entire back of the camera is screen!*Takes great pictures - we have taken some pretty spectacular outdoor images.  As is typical of digital cameras, indoor images are fairly grainy and not nearly as lovable.  However, it performs as well or better than other small digitals I have used indoors.*Battery - we have never had problems with the battery life during normal vacations.  The occasional recharge at home is all we need.  The battery has also survived a year of normal use without showing signs of age.  If it does become a problem, Casio has made it extremely simple to swap out batteries - it's a matter of seconds.Summary: if you're looking for a small camera that can be kept on hand and trusted for special occasions like vacations, I highly recommend the Exilim EX-S770.
