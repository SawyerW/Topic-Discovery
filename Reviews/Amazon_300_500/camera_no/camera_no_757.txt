Now I do not know much about Digital Camera's so when my old one broke I started to look for a new one online by reading all the reviews at Amazon.com, Target.com, etc.......to see which was the most popular and had the best reviews in my price range!This camera won hands down and I researched for quite awhile before I finally purchased it!It not only looks good and is compact (but still easy to hold), it is easy to use.........it comes with a quick reference instruction page that are very easy to follow!  The LCD wasn't as big as I wanted orgininally (wanted 3") but I was very happy to find that it is plenty big enough.  The best part of the camera is that it takes GREAT PICTURES and they stay looking great even after you download them.........all of my family was amazed on how good the pictures came out over the holidays.  I guess you can thank the 10MP for that of course and everyone that has seen my camera can't believe it is a 10MP as you can't find them out in the stores yet!Like other reviewers I agree that it can be a bit slow to actually take the picture but it is much better then any other digital camera I have used (of my friends or families) and I would not return it just because of that.........I also think it has a lot to do with the picture taker too.......some shots are just to hard to get if they are moving to fast so use the great VIDEO feature on the camera which works great.I have not used everything by far on the camera but so far I love it......and the BEST SHOT feature is amazing........we use it for eBay stuff all the time and it works great.OVERALL I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE........IT IS A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE!!!
