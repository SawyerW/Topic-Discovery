I was never been a big photography buff, but this camera has made it possible for me to do more than I ever imagined, and has me thinking about where I should go next to take more pictures.  This is my first digital camera, and I found it to be easy to use and full of features.  I have used the videocamera capability at the beach and at other things, finiding videos will last about 20-25 seconds with audio.  I have upgraded my emmory card to a 128, and would definitely recommend that nothing smaller be used.  At the superfine resolution I am now shooting, I have been getting about 125 pictures on the disk.  The USB cord will do an adequate job at uploading, but for much faster results, you will want the Compactflash card reader, especially when you have a lot of photos to upload.  One other thing that I would definitely note is that the camera can be expanded- rare in a beginning digital camera!  The telephoto zoom is impressive, but when digitally zoomed in after the picture is taken, the detail I have been getting is very impressive.  A virtual must-have is also the wide angle lens.  The landscapes and buildings I have been taking for work have made it extremely useful, and the attachment of any one of the three accessory lenses is easy, but does require an adapter, all of these sold separately.  I have gotten nothing but good comments on the pictures I have taken and shown to people thus far, and the camera itself convinced several friends to get the same model.  Because of the additional possibilities that the other lenses add, and for all of the features the camera has, I would definitely encourage you to look at one at a nearby store before you order if you are still not convinced- I am THRILLED with mine!
