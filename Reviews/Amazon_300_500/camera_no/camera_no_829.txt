Buyer beware!!  This camera does not even survive the warranty period and Panasonic does not honor its warranty for the Lumix ZS3. If you have to send something to Panasonic be sure to completely document it - 3-D pictures of the item, serial number, ...  This camera was a big waste of money - Panasonic has lost a customer for life.  For the first couple of months the camera took excellent pictures no complaints.  One day walking through a park I pulled it out to take some animal pictures and the image was fuzzy / blurred. I'd done nothing different, weather was clear, no reason for it not to work... I called about the warranty and after being put on hold for over 20 minutes I finally got a live being who told me to send the camera in.  They said they would call or email me once the camera arrived and they examined it.  After waiting three weeks I finally called to see 1) if the camera arrived and 2) how long the under warranty repair would take.  Surprise it was there but they never contacted me!  The warranty company told me I damaged the camera because there was a scratch on the side.  There was no physical damage on the camera when I mailed it - I packed it in bubble wrap in peanuts in a cardboard box.  No way was that camera scratched when I sent it to them - my word against theirs of course and I did not take a picture of the camera before I sent it in so I lose.  But it was clear from speaking to the warranty customer support that Panasonic had no intention of honoring the warranty no matter what.  A camera at this price should function properly for more than three months. By the way I own a larger Cannon Powershot that I've had for 2 years and taken hiking and it still works perfectly - it was a little big for a pocket camera and I thought the Panasonic Lumix would be the answer - NOT!  I do not recommend this camera or any Panasonic photographic product based on the complete farce of a warranty for a defective product.
