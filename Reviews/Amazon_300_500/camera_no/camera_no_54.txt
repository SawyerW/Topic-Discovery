I've been a long time user of Sony digital cameras. The two I currently have (P5 and P100) have performed beautifully over the years. I've never had a lick of problem with either. So, when I decided to buy a small compact camera that I could throw in a pocket I decided to go with Sony again. After looking at the T1 model, I wasn't too impressed with the picture quality. Too much of a compromise was made to get the unit small. Then I can across the L1. It has been the perfect little camera. It's small- about the size of a Snicker's bar- so I can keep it in my pocket. The pictures are terrific- 4Mp meets all my needs. The picture quality has been superb too. Much better than the T1. Although I mostly run it off of full auto mode, it does have nearly as many manual options as my P100 has (ISO, scenes, quality). And to top it off, the camera is fast. Power on to first shot plus shot to shot timing is lightning fast. I've been very happy with this camera.There are a few things that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars. First, while the LCD is sharp and works well in most lighting, it's still on the small size compared to other cameras. There is room on the camera where they could have put in a 1.8" or even 2" LCD instead. That would have made a big difference. Also for some reason, Sony chose to go with a separate bracket for tripod attachment instead of putting the screw mount right on the camera. This is a pain. Fortunately, I don't use a tripod with the L1 very often.Overall the L1 is a great little camera. For the cost, it's portability and picture quality can't be beat
