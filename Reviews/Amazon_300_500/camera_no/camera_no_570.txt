I've had this camera only two weeks, but I LOVE it.  Was able to unpack and start shooting pictures right out of the box without using the manual (and I'm not even an engineer!).  Pics at a butterfly festival came out unbelieveable, and inside shots have been excellent.  Wonderful people shots with excellent skin tones.  So far I've only used "auto", and haven't tried the "movie" mode yet, but am looking forward to trying out all the bells and whistles.  I bought an extra NB-1LH battery, a Card reader (which is a must, in my book), and a 128 card.  Planned to get the adaptor when it is in stock, but with extra battery and quickness of downloads with the card reader, I don't think I need it.  This camera is so easy to hold, and fits in your pocket so I am taking it with me to lots of places I wouldn't normally lug a camera to.  It's ready to shoot almost instantly, and ready for the next shot very quickly.  I was on the point of buying the G2, until I read so many reviews about the camera freezing up -- decided not to take the risk.  I do wish this was 3 megapixels, as the name sort of implies, and that it had a higher optical zoom -- but I can't cut my rating for those options as I knew what was offered when I bought the camera.  The Zoom Browser software has worked well, tho I have hardly had to touch any of the editing features as the colors have been wonderful.  I'm very happy with this camera and highly recommend it.  I purchased from Amazon and while I could get it at a slightly lower price at eCost, by the time I factored in the free shipping with Amazon it was a better deal, plus I had the option of returning the camera if not satisfied.  If you're looking for a great, small 2MP camera, this is the camera and site to buy from!
