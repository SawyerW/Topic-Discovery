Bad points:-Battery life is the worst part about the phone however with Juice Defender App I can make it through an entire low usage day.-Cellular signal reception is poor and contributes to poor battery life, note I mostly run it on 3G only unless I am in an area where the 4G signal is strong.-Only way to wake up the phone is using the main on button.-Cannot change the volume while phone is locked.-The camera takes decent pictures but does not deal with low light or too much light well.-The back, home, minimize buttons are on screen and cannot be used until the phone is unlocked.-Heavy screen use will drain the battery even in airplane mode.-Backing does not fit well and is very slippery without a case.-It does get warm when the processor and battery are being stressed from heavy use.-The vibration ring tones are not strong enough even if an external app is used.  For me this is very annoying since I tend to rely on this.Good Points:-Fast processor, easily runs multiple apps simultaneously.-Nice screen quality and its big, nearly the same size as the Galaxy s3.-The latest Android OS, even on Verizon I was one of the first to get 4.2.2-Plenty of storage for my needs.-Relatively slim so it fits in your pocket even though the screen is large.-Has flashing indicator for alerts, new messages.-Plays music, videos, streams without any problems.-The Wifi signal reception has no problems.Overall a bit disappointing but I have adjusted to the bad points enough that I will get plenty of use out of the phone.  Thankfully I am not locked into a contract since I bought it used and activated it with Verizon.  In my opinion this is the best way to test drive a device.  And the Amazon seller I bought from did a great job.
