I thought I was getting something better, based on the numerous positive reviews. When I purchased this phone 2 months ago, I was replacing my old Samsung Transform. The phone is pretty, has a better camera, and has a more recent version of the Android software on board. The phone feels like a toy: The back is plastic, and it is very light and thin. This is great for those looking for that sort of thing, but I like durability as well, and this is just not the case here, so I bought a super-durable case for the thing. It runs programs very slowly. Load time was double that of my Transform. The camera is slow, has a really useless white balance function, and takes lousy pictures though it has over twice the megapixels the Transform had. After a couple weeks I started losing my cell reception. Often. At first the customer service (if you can actually figure out a way to get to a human) blamed it on the local cell tower. Once outside of the thirty day return policy time, however, they said it was my handset (phone). They had me do all the stupid things they normally tell you to do, take the battery out, look for updates, etc. No dice. Well, I've learned to deal with the unpredictability of service and then yesterday my camera stopped working altogether. It may seem trivial, but with children having a camera on the phone is important to me. Customer service referred me to the LG customer service which told me that they would take it for up to ten days, determine themselves whether the phone is defective, and either 1.ship it back at my expense, 2.try to fix it, or 3. send me another one of these. This would leave me phone-less the entire time, with no guarantee of anything fixed. Unacceptable. Anyway, long story short, avoid this phone if you can.
