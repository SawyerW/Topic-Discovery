As I write this I am loosing service for one of the best cell phones ever made. This is an IDEN phone and will onlywork on these carriers mentioned in this review title. I have used one of these phones since 2003. I have 4 of them and one is new, still in the box.The IDEN service is being discontinued and they say will be completely phased out by June of 2013. (So, don't buy one)This phone was first designed with the military in mind, and can still be used in many places in Europe and Israel onthe Amigo service, and in some countries occupied by NATO. The IDEN service is loud, crystal clear, and has the abilityto use 'Push To Talk' service. They are  'Were'  excellent phones to be used on construction sites because of their rugged quality, for hunters in the woods, and just active people in general.It's a real shame that an excellent phone and service to match is being phased out because of a fad where kids can dnload music & video files or text their girlfriend  'while driving a car'  and surf the web on their 2 to 5 inch screen.I do hope that someone will find a way to flash these great dependable phones over to another service, but even at thatI'm sure the Push To Talk service would certainly be lost and probably the dependability of the IDEN service would not be there, or the loud crystal clear voice service we once knew.A truly GREAT communications device along with the service is almost gone in the US anyway.  It will surely be missed by those of us who insisted on a quality phone and quality service without all the unnecessary frills of texting, "which could be done by this phone, but it wasn't made for that" internet, "it was available, but limited"but no downloading files or streaming video's.  Just a Great Tuff phone for communications!
