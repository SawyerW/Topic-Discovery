I bought this phone recently with a good price from Gold box deal and I'm very pleased with it. It has everything I need for my business, is easy to navigate, slim, comes with cover, nice camera and good battery! I wouldn't choose any other phone for business needs and I do believe it is 1st best Nokia phone launched in US. If you want cheaper version but also great phone, look for nokia e77. the only difference between these two are: plastic cover instead of metal, no GPS and just 1 camera instead of 2 as here in e71.My husband also bought this phone from Amazon Store but he wasn't fortunate enough with a price. He paid for it $342 and after 2 days price has dropped to $319. He asked Amazon for a refund of a difference but unfortunately they don't have Price Protection Policy.A price protection guarantee extends assurances to a consumer that upon buying an item, if the customer finds the same item cheaper from another or same vendor, the original seller will match the price by refunding the difference to the buyer. A time restraint of 30 days is typical, and other conditions apply which can vary among retailers. Price protection guarantee provides a powerful incentive for building online customer loyalty in an economic model that allows for easy comparative shopping and highly competitive pricing. Even before a customer buys an item, he or she can use the price protection guarantee to ask a vendor to match a lower price. I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't have it. They are allowed to change prices daily and if you aren't lucky to get a really good deal, you can get ripped off from your purchase just in a few days :(Today you can buy the same phone for way under $300 with free price protection plan from other vendors. It's a good lesson for me and my hubby to look more careful for items we wanna buy and really reconsider other sellers not just Amazon.
