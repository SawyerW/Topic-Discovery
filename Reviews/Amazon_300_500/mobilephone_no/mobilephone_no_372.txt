I bought this phone for my t mobile plan because i liked the solid slider look as well as the generally positive reviews. This phone has a beautiful LCD screen for a simple slider phone and a nice blue lit key pad as well as lots of memory for texts and contacts. The phone also supports multitasking which i thought was great (and odd) for a lower end slide phone. The only thing i have bad to save about this phone at all is the home screen menu is NOT customizable at all meaning your stuck with the "Menu" button on the left soft key and the "Options" button on the right soft key. But worse then that is this phone is unlcocked and my sms and calls work fine but whenever i tried to send an mms message my phone would give me a strange comm error. I talked to a t mobile rep about it and said i would have to purchase a data plan for my phone. Not wanting to do this for this particular simple phone i decided to tackle the problem on my own. After wading through pages of google searches i discovered this is how you send and receive mms using t mobile on this particular AT&T; handset. On the phone itself go to Menu>Messaging>Message Settings>Multimedia Message>Message Center. You will seen the active profile labeled AT&T; MMS. Press the Options button on the right soft key and select "New". Then enter the following information:Name: T-Mobile MMSMMSC URL: [...]MMSC Proxy:216.155.165.050MMSC Port: 8080Connection Mode: TCP without ProxyNetwork Profile: MEdia NetworkThen save the profile and activate it with the left soft key. Reboot your phone and voila tmobile mms on your LG Shine. This may sound complex but dont let it stop you from buying the phone once you have the phone in hand you'll see what I'm talking about. Also make sure your service says T-Mobile at the bottom of the home screen before sending an mms because sometimes it will say you have full bars but it means full bars for AT&T; and no bars for T mobile. Hope this helps.
