It is a great phone.  BUT . . .  The keypad is too damn sensitive!  Even when locked out, the keypad will come unlocked & dial the "sos" code '112' which in turn will call the local 911 dispatch.  And since it will do this in the holster or pocket that you have it stored in, you will be totally unaware of this until they will call you back "what is your emergency?".There is no way to disable this "feature".Also the little nubby-pad used to navigate will change selections at the pressure of a mouse fart at twenty paces.  Trying to get through menus, or viewing texts is an extreme hassle to do without it flipping around all over. [read:  you get a text and try to scroll down to continue reading, and all of a sudden you are in an entirely different message OR menu]  Or while replying, it will select a different message[and addressee], and you will not know until AFTER you hit send.And the space bar will take over a week before it will stop double spacing [and giving you a '. ' then a capital letter of the next word typed [ex. This. Will. Be. What. Everything. Will. Look. Like. In. Everything. You. Type.] And even when it breaks in, I can only get a normal space if I hit it on the right hand EDGE of the key.OH, and make sure to only hit your righthand soft key once to back out to the menu, otherwise it will launch the browser and take two keystrokes to get out of.  This is another thing it will do in your pocket or holster to rack up time used.Otherwise it is a great phone once you get past the hyper-sensitive keys & the many piss poor coding mistakes in its programming, and extremely non-intuitive menus.  And, yes, after have to speak with the police five times in one day [two of which I wasn't even touching the phone or its case], I may sound bitterly negative.  But it actually is a good phone.
