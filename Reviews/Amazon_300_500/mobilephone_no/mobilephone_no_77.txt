I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.
