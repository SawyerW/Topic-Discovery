I totally agree with other reviews about all good things of N8, such as fast boot, great camera, good signal,...I will not repeat here.I have two main problems with N8:1. UI not friendlyYes it's fancy, but all those simply functions should be kept as simple as possible. for example, I want to save a number from incoming call list, when I touch that number, it dials the number automatically. I know I can figure it out after searching/reading something (BTW, no paper manual with the package, you either use "user guide" on the phone, or googl search; using "user guide" is painfull too), but why should I spend time on making these basic features work? Hi man, is it a SMART phone to test how smart you are??2. the biggest problem for me: no multiple language supportI bought it at AMAZON, US version. If you speak English only, please forgive me, it's not a problem for you. you can ignore here now. But if you plan to use N8 to read SMS or browse webpage or input something in other languages, such as Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Japanese, Spanish, French... Read this"Nokia has decided that each phone sold to each region (Europe, China, North America, Middle East Africa, India, Thailand) would have separate language packs. If you live in North America, you probably get Latin Fonts without support for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew.... etc. and the Keyboard is limited to English, French, Spanish, maybe Italian..."After searching google several hours, I found a not perfect way to hack N8 and change language package. But again, why should I do this with a risk to break the warranty?? I am an end user, not a developer. When my iphone/Android phones are able to browse web pages, read text messages in these languages..., where is Nokia?? Maybe Nokia doesn't need to compete with iphone/Android phone."Connecting the World"?? Come on, I can't!!! In the end, I return the phone.
