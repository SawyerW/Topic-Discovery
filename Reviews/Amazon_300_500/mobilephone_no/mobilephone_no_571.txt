owned this phone for a couple years. got mine through att but it is very durable, I work for a utility co. so i dig ditches fix water lines and run heavy equipment. just about a month ago i was fixing an 8 inch water line and it broke and drenched me from head to toe and both my backflip and my work phone (which is a samsung slider from verizon) got wet, my verizon phone quit working but my backflip still works. i have dropped it on concrete many times and gotten mad and thrown it across the room and still works fine. I upgraded the droid software about a year ago and it did slow it down but don't notice any more.  it does reset itself from time to time. the app store is easy and i am constantly on the internet with it. the touch pad on back is a great idea but i use it very seldomely. Usually when on sites where my fat fingers keep hitting the wrong link. i would give it to my daughter but dont want to start her a data plan yet. it does have its flaws but i like the way you can customize the screens the way you want. i watch a lot of youtube videos and that will kill a battery very quickly. but if you don't use the phone all day the battery will last about two days. and the keyboard is nice but usully i just use the on screen keyboard. its more of an entry level droid but still a great phone.I like it better than my wifes iPhone 3gs. it has a better camera with flash. the screen isnt as smooth but i have had to replace her iphone screen twice and mine still works like a champ.
