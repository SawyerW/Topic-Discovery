I have really enjoyed owning this phone. The massive amount of applications that are available for nokia s60 v5 phones makes it awesome to use. Even stock this phone rules!! At first i was a little disappointed by the screen size. Having owned some touch screen phones. Samsung behold and samsung star. The screens of which are just a little bit wider. But after a couple of days i totally forgot about them. The wifi web surfing is awesome and even tho there is no 3g the edge connection is still actually quite fast. The fact that this phone has flash lite 3 installed while other newer  smart phones have still yet too is another point for nokia. Such as the mytouch or g1 which without completly hacking will not play flash videos on youtube. Of course flash videos over the stock web explorer take sometime to load unless your on wifi. Also the ability to install apps on the memory card instead of only on the phone is another point. :-) There are so many great features on this phone. Take the camera a 3.2 mp that completely destroys my samsungs 5 mp camera both for images and by far for videos. And for those who are social media addicts such as myself well your in luck with the apps available for facebook and twitter. Not to mention some that i don't use.  over all i would say anyone who is looking for a smart phone with a decent price should get this phone. I prefer nokia's os over windows samsung motorola or huwai. Those are all very disappointing compared to nokia's touch screen user interface.  on the downside... Some times while texting i have gotten slightly annoyed with the speed also predictive text if you use numeric keypad instead of qwerty, is good but doesn't offer suggestions on larger words.
