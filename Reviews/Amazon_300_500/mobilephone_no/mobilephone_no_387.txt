First I must compliment the triple minuets. I am a big tracfone fan and triple minuets for me is the way to go. I buy the 1500 minuet card from trafone at 200 dollars, which gives me 4500 minuets at 4.4 cents per minuet or 1.3 cents for a text.Most unlimited texting and calling plans float around 35 dollars a month which is 398 minuets of talking and 1346 texts, much more then I would use in a month. For me the triple minuets is a great deal.For the phone, it is not a good phone. For these reasons:1. The lock button is with with the star button. Which means that you must be in home page to lock the phone and it talks a couple second to hold it down.2. There are two soft key buttons and for the home page they are "Menu" and "Browser" this is unchangeable, which means that there is a high chance of butt activating the browser which uses minuets. Since I don't want to use the browser ever, I would like to deactivate it. If I do deactivate the browser I deactivate texting.3. The menu color is set and unchangeable. The only reason that this is a pain is because the set color is pink.4. The texting menu is a hassle to navigate, the texts are not grouped by respondents, you can not see who sent you a text before you open it, and selecting a text require you to press 4 buttons before you start writing the text.5. The phone will only hold around 250 texts6. The reception is not as good as my old tracfone.All in all I am unhappy with the phone, but if this one breaks, I will probably get it again for the triple minuets. Tracfone is great, this phone is not.
