Good Stuff: Its an ok phone, has good call quality and really good battery life. Also takes really good pictures, specifially the color and tones of the pictures are very rich and almost look touched up. Looks cool, people that aren't that into phones think its something special. [...] has some good info on the phone.Bad Stuff: the charger/usb plug is propietary <sp?> so you have to buy that stuff off ebay or somewhere to get them. After taking pictures, i think you are supposed to confirm that you want to save or delete it, so if you dont answer it will delete. i usually end up with the last picture i tried to take. Lots of people have this phone, i have sat down for dinner where 5 of the 6 people set their blackjack on the table.I dont like not having the ability to copy and paste text. i sometimes find myself typing in the "to" field of an email and cant just copy the text from there into the actual message body so i have to just delete it all and retype it which is a hassle. Cant create or edit work, excel or .txt documents, all you can do it look at them acrobat reader style with something called piscel viewer. it sucks because i have to put all my notes into my outlook calendar and then find them later when i get to my pc. you can set mp3 files as ringtones but they have to be in the regular memory and not on the storage card. i think there is enough regular memory for about 4 songs. I was hoping the windows mobile upgrade from 5 to 6 would help me get over some of the little things i dont like but they keep pushing it back every time the get to the production date.Overall i really feel like i got suckered into the hype of this phone and it really isn't any different from all the other smartphones out there. I've had this phone for about 10 months. I wouln't reccommend purchasing this phone but if it was free or [...] with contract then it might be a good choice.
