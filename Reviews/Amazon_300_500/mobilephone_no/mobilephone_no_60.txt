I had to downgrade my phone recently, as I needed some cash and my Treo was more of a luxury than a necessity.  So, I sold my Treo and bought the Nokia 6225.  I shouldn't have done that.  Even with whatever deals I got and the pocket cash I wound up with after the fact, this has got to be the worst phone I have owned.First off, the built-in camera stinks.  Now, I understand some people will say that it's a VGA camera, and it's not meant to make prints.  I don't mean that.  I mean that compared to other VGA cameras on phones, this one stinks.  It's constantly blurry and grainy, even in the best of lighting, with noticeable discoloration and aberration in lowered lighting.  I've played with other cameraphones, and none of them had picture quality this bad.  Even the Sony Ericcson T610, with a smaller picture file had better results.And then, let's not forget how Sprint disabled the ability to beam the pictures to other devices, which mean you have to use their PictureMail service as the only way to keep the pics.  Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!  It's a good thing the picture quality stinks, as I probably wouldn't even want to keep the pictures anyway, thus saving me money.The reception on this phone is decent, however, and I can receive calls even in my office.  My Treo's reception, however, was much better.  The speaker on this phone, though, isn't very good, and I sometimes have trouble hearing the person on the other line unless I have it pressed up against my ear a certain way.And then, battery life stinks, too.  After a 30 minute call and checking football scores a few times, my phone is down to only two bars, and if I take another five minute call, I need to worry if my phone will die on me.  Terrible.The only positive thing about this phone is that it's small and light, so it's easy to pocket.You get what you pay for, and this phone shows it.  Spend some money and buy a better phone--you'll be glad.
