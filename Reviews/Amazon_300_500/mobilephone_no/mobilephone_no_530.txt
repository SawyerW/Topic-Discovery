The Palm Pixi is my first smartphone. I bought it to finish out my contract on Verizon and to port over to Page Plus so I can have a smartphone without paying for a data plan.The Good: The basic functionality of the phone is great. WebOS is a wonderful, open platform, and the way the card system works is pretty intuitive. The notifications system was way ahead of its time, and I miss the gestures whenever I'm using someone else's non-WebOS phone. The gesture area has a cool glowing slit whenever new notifications appear on your phone. The keyboard is nice and clicky, though I often end up using my finger nails to operate it (and I'm a guy). The available Touchstone cover and puck make a great charging station; why don't all phones do this? (probably some patent devilry) It doesn't have all the apps that iOS and Android users have available to them, but WebOS has a great open-source community with a non-official app store through "Preware." It's definitely a tinkerer's phone.The Bad: Google Maps seems not to work at all when on a 3G connection. I don't know why, but it's frustrating as hell when trying to find something on the go. I wish the home screen had all my apps on it rather than having to "Swipe up" to get the app screen. Worst of all, the hardware in this phone is just too underpowered to deliver a smooth experience in the OS. Why should the phone choke when trying to switch from the Texting card to the Mail card? I've never had a "too many cards" warning, yet it seems like it can barely keep up with some basic functions. That's not to say it's unusable, just frustrating. Overclocking the processor has not seemed to help any. The camera is nothing to write home about, although it's usable enough to share mobile pictures.Overall, I'll stick with my plan to go on Page Plus with this phone, but I'll still be keeping my eyes peeled for a cheap Android or WebOS device with some more "oomph" to it. That's the beauty of pre-paid!
