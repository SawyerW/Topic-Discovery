When I got my first Kyocera Loft I first noticed how easy it was to activate the phone for my existing number, which was great! The battery life was okay and it was very slow. Every time I got a text I would have to unlock the phone and wait 3 or 4 seconds. Then the menu popped up and in order for it to respond I had to wait another 2 or 3 seconds then press "view". Yes, it's that slow. To open the menu it take about 2 seconds; the same goes for opening up the contacts list, pretty much everything really. The only thing it did fast was dial phone numbers. So I ended up breaking it on accident by cracking the screen. After calling Kyocera themselves I was told to call Virgin Mobile. When I called Virgin Mobile I was told to call Kyocera, so horrible customer support. After calling Kyocera AGAIN they said none of the parts were replaceable and that I had to buy another phone. Later on at Virgin Mobile's website I found a "protection plan" that was hidden behind a bunch of stuff that was $5 a month. The thing is the phone had to be registered within 2 weeks of purchase. Thanks for telling me about that Virgin Mobile, just a few days after I actually needed it. So I went out and bought another one because when the phone broke it was entirely my fault. So I got the other phone and about a month and a half later the phone would refuse to turn on beyond a blue "download" image. It didn't show a moving bar or anything it just stayed like that. After about 2 weeks of that the phone refused to turn on. At this point I was frustrated enough to just throw the phone away. I've had problems with Kyocera's products before I bought the two Lofts and I can safely say I will never buy from this company again.Pros: decent battery life  nice sized screen  nice designCons: poor customer support  very slow  cramped keyboard  feels flimsy  no warranty, just insurance
