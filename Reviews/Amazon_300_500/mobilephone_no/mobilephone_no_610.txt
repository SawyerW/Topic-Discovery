So far this phone has been stellar. I can echo the previous comments on the sexy form-factor and the utility of the phone. After custimizing the home screen, my fiance' played around with it and insisted on getting one too. Easy navigation is a big deal for her, and the sidebar feature (push and hold the scroll wheel) - which is customizable, as is most of the interface on this phone - was a big selling point.My phone came with the extended battery and cover included; that was actually a pleasant surprise. However be aware that it doesn't ship with a belt clip or case. You'll want to pick one of those up as well as a car charger and a microsd card.The phone is light and sleek w/ the standard battery, but the extended battery gives it a much nicer feel in the hand. My fiance' actually prefers it w/ the extended battery in, and she's got a strong bias for small phones.Of course it's not quite perfect. I have 2 major beefs w/ this phone:1. No Wifi. This is extremely annoying because the SGH-i600 in Europe has Wifi, and it is essentially the same phone.2. Battery life: not utterly miserable, I can go two days of regular use (texting, regular calls to the missus, minimal browsing) before the battery goes out. This is on par with my previous phone, the Audiovox SMT-5600. But it should be better, considering they did so much to keep the power low, all of which annoy the heck out of me:-Proprietary USB cable-Three button presses to unlock keypad (since the keypad is locked no user activity is anticipated and the device drops into a deep sleep mode. Power button wakes the phone from this state - that's my guess)-No LED-Default 10s till screen turns offThese things do work (and the last is customizable), but my previous phone had none of these 'features' and it still had generally the same battery life.All in all this is a great phone for the smartphone newbie or geek alike.
