Okay so this was initially a 1 star review for no fault of Amazon.com but Nokia because the N8 i bought through Amazon was bad, it rebooted, froze etc. I got in touch with Amazon and they sent me a new one on overnight shipping. Many thank to Amazon.com for prompt service and great customer care. This unit now works great so far, its 3 days now, i have it going into the 4th day, got it on June 14, 2012. The Symbian belle update will cause the phone to not play flash content such as videos that are on your favorite websites like youtube.com(desktop version) so if watching flash videos are your thing then right now this not gonna do that for you. i have no complaints as it relates to the hardware of the device, it feels really solid. the Belle update works good too minus the inability to load flash content, funny enough you will see ad banners work, but if you wanted to stream a embedded video its a no go for that, its been 6-7 months since the release of the Belle update and still Nokia has not corrected the adobe flash problem so im not sure what happening there. I do wish that Nokia gave it more memory on the C: drive. The tiny 256Mb is a joke when the mass memory has some 14Gb of storage...lol, i wonder what is the reasoning behind that???? oh the front camera not that great either. it does take picture but it would seem like a 0.3 or 1 mega-pixel, a 1.3 mega-pxl would have compliment the rear 12mp. Well like i said its a good phone, but Nokia has yet to fix the issue of playing embedded flash content and the C: drive or phone memory is too low (256Mb), im a keep mine for now and see if Nokia gonna fix the Flash issue.-UPDATESo in regards to the flash player, im not sure if there will be an update for the Belle that will allow us to watch flash content embedded on websites or stream from youtube desktop site as the current flash lite 4 does not support those contents. if you get the phone stick to Anna DO NOT update, or you wont be able to play flash.
