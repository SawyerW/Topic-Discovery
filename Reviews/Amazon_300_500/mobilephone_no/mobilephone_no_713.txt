I got my phone recently in March 2011 when i recieved it in the mail i was super excited i got it! I used to have the exact same phone about 2 years ago but i had lost it so when i found this one online for that price i had to get it! I got the phone and right away the "t.v" didnt work but i didnt care i just wanted the phone so i didnt make a big deal about it, about a month after i was using the phone it started acting weird turning on and off by itself not letting me click on the items i wanted to click on but i didnt pay to much attention to it since my 30 day refund or exchange had already expired. Well two weeks after all of that started happening the phones battery wouldnt charge and if it did it would die super fast and i had to recharge it again and again throughout the day! then after three days of that crap the phone completely gave out on me, said it was dying and when i would hook it up to the charger it said it was charging but kept making that noise to tell me it was dying over and over again while connected to the charger but had the charging icon on the screen like the charger was connected! so then i just left it connected to the charger the whole day and when finally stopped making those noises it said it was charged so i disconnected it from the charger and two minutes later the stupid noise comes back and my phone is dead again! i went on with this for about a week till i went to go get the phone checked out by at&t; they checked it out and it wasnt the charger, it wasnt the battery it was the stupid phone so i after leaving i got the phone and smashed the crap out of it! i will NEVER get another phone from here AGAIN!!!! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!
