I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now. I must say I love it. I've owned the apple iPod, and iPad, but this phone blows those away.  It has so many more features.  You can create custom music settings, watch flash content, and there's a nice 4.7 inch high definition 1280x720 pixel screen.  And since it's a flagship phone, you get a lot of updates and improvements.  This phone always gets better. The battery life is great to.  I can usually comfortably get through a whole day of moderate usage with maybe 15-30 percent left.  It also has NFC (Near Field Technology) built in so you can share pics and videos with friends by just touching phones or being close together.  It's very light and easy to hold for its size. Typing is very natural to. I'm typing this review on my phone right now. The camera is also great.  You can snap pictures instantly. It's fast and full of detail. It's also incredible in low light situations. HD video is sweet also. And wow is it tough. I was on the treadmill and I dropped mine. It hit the belt and spun off across my cement floor. Not a dent or scratch on mine. So I can definitely say that this phone is a great phone for anyone. The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.  It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor. I know it's not a quad core like some newer phones, but it is still very fast at doing everything. It has 2 gigs of ram, which is still on par with the newest phones, and apps almost never close on me even when I've opened many other ones.  It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.  For the first time, I might keep a phone even when I can get a new one.
