So a couple of weeks ago, I finally got fed-up with my old phone (the HTC EVO V 4G). It was laggy, the battery life was dreadful, and the camera on it--even though it was a 3D camera and claimed to be "high quality"--sucked. Heck, ONE scratch on the lens part of the camera made it so the flash function added a greenish hue to every picture I took; I could basically not use my flash. Just imagine my frustration, especially considering this happened just a couple of months after owning it.What sucks is...when I bought this phone, the white, standard version of it was sold out, so I was forced to purchase the titanium version of it. Aside from the color, they're the exact same phone. Not too big of an issue, I guess.After having the Galaxy S2 for a bit, I can honestly say that this is the best phone I've ever owned(inb4 "iPhones are the bestest!!1!") No, they are not. I own the latest generations of iPad and iPod Touch and I can honestly say that I hate the iOS platform with the burning, fiery passion of a thousand suns. But that's a conversation for another time.I've owned several phones while being a member of Virgin Mobile - The Samsung Intercept, Motorola Triumph, Kyocera Rise, HTC EVO V, and now the Samsung Galaxy S2.Since I've had it, not once have I had an issue with the battery draining rapidly, the screen ALWAYS moves as quickly as I swipe it with no input lag. This thing is basically--as numerous reviews I've seen say--a mini supercomputer. Plus since Jelly Bean is now out for the Virgin Mobile of the Galaxy S2, the phone is even better than it was before. What more could I ask for, aside from it turning into a Transformer and assisting me in taking over Earth?I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this phone to those who are looking to purchase, especially if you're as tired as I was of scouring all over the place for the perfect Virgin Mobile phone.
