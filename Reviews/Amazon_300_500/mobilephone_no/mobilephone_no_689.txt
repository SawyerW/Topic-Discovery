Nokia has stopped Blackberry Connect support with this phone, so unlike the E61i (which I have), one has to get a separate data package if one is on ATT. This makes this about as expensive to own as an iPhone on ATT, in which case the iPhone makes more sense.The keys are also much smaller than E61i, making texting and email much slower. Screen is brighter and phone is lighter, but that is about it.For a world traveler this remains a half-baked solution as the 3G support is region specific as well - even the iPhone and Treo support 3-band 3G. So, if you have 3G in the US, it won't work in Taiwan and Japan, which really sucks if you are in the tech business. This also means that you can't use VOIP programs like TruPhone outside the US - which is exactly when you actually need to save on ridiculously high roaming charges. And if you get the Asia 3G version ...it works only there.Basically, this is a cute non-iphone for folks who will not travel out of the US, and have very limited data package needs. Apart from that, it's an expensive paperweight and a poor replacement for the E61i. Nokia needs to get back to basics and develop phones that meet solid needs. A smartphone should be smart. And useful. And be real improvements on prior models - not just nicer candy wrapping. And we all (including me) need to really read the specifications in detail and not just assume Nokia knows what they are doing.I bought this, then had to return it after a detailed tryout which is what my feedback is based on. I was and remain rather irritated at Nokia. I expected more.I'm now waiting for ATT to get me a Blackberry Bold that's actually useful in my line of business - which is data heavy and has tons of travel useful features across US, Europe and both South and East Asia.
