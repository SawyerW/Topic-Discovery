I have had the HTC Evo 4g for a year and a half. It has exceeded all my expectations for a smartphone. I still haven't utilized all of its capabilities and still learning new things about it. The phone is very underrated and lives in the shadows of Apple iphone and samsung galaxy phones, but i think in many ways it beats those phones. There are a few minor gripes but nothing in comparison how solid the phone is.Pros: Screen at 4.3" is big and amazing. Every time I look at an iphone the screen looks too small. HTC did a great job filling the screen close to all edges. Very little wasted space. HTC sense operating software is excellent and very stable. The capacitive touch buttons are very useful and saves a ton of time to navigate around. The text wrapping on the internet is excellent and a necessity in my opinion. Text wrapping that is absent on the iphone and that is a deal breaker for me. Voice calls are very clear and speaker phone is pretty good. Bluetooth works excellent on my car stereo and links easily every time I get in my car. Ability to swap out batteries is huge bonus. There is a lot more to say but I won't get too wordy.Cons: Battery life isn't the best but at least you can swap a battery out instantly. No photo gallery organization so it just lumps photos in the pre-made categories. I would like to see the ability to customize your photo folders. The camera isn't the best under certain conditions, but can take some great photos. However, you don't know when you are going to get good photos or not, so you can't depend on the camera too much. Phone memory isn't the best. Some pre-installed programs take up space and you can't delete them or move them to the sd card.All in all this is a very competitive phone that stacks up very well against the competition. I think it is a better phone than the iphone. I think that says a lot.
