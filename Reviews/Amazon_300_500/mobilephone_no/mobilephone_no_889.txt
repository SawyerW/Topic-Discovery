I've had the Note for a few days now. I was waiting to test drive it for a bit before I posted a review. Coming from the Captivate, this thing is ridiculously fast. Not a hint of lag in any way whatsoever. Quite a few minor upgrades from Froyo, swype is even better. Great speaker phone, sound quality. This is the Android experience I have been looking for. The stylus thingy, pulled it out once or twice but haven't found much use for it, I'm sure there is use for it but will find time to figure it out. As for the size and screen, the first time I saw it, I said to myself "what the hell have I done - this thing is silly big". Then I used it for 10 seconds and that thought changed to "where have you been all my life?" I can never go back to a small screen. The extra row and column for apps on the home screens is great. You can use those giants widgets you never used before cause you were trying to save screen space. You can actually surf and feel you're not struggling and it is an almost tab experience. You do get the odd stares with it stuck to your face, but who cares. I am retraining my thumb, as it is a bit of a stretch to hold it with one had and use the same thumb to do everything but small price to pay for this beautiful screen. It is only 1" longer and .75" wider, fits nicely in my back pocket still. Anybody who is a droider and has been thinking about getting this thing - don't wait. This thing is incredible, amazing and a pleasure to use all the time. Slightly too big for some, but I would call this the best device I ever had.
