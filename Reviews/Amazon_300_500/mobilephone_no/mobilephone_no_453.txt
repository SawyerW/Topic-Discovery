I purchased this phone to update my old 31/2 yr old phone that I was using. I have straight talk and after 3+ yrs my phone was just not getting a good signal anymore so I thought I'd give this phone a shot. I have to say I really am not crazy for this phone. I was looking for a simple phone. I'm not really into the high tech phones. I am just wanting a simple phone that makes calls and texts. Using the web on my phone isn't a big deal but being able to from time to time is ok. The more I use this phone there are things I like but some things I hate. One big pet pev is that everytime you get a text is the stupid phone shows you how much its deducting from your minutes. It drives me nuts! I do not want to see every deduction of my minutes everytime I use the phone. There is a feature in it that shows that so I can go there to see it if I choose. I think it should not show that until you get to 100 or less minutes on your phone. There is no way to shut it off from showing it. I have looked and looked. Not crazy about the texting either. When I write a text and go to send I type in the persons name and it will not let me send it that way. I have to go in and find them in contacts to add them and then it will send. It's just kinda dumb that I can't type their name and send. These little things drive me nuts. If I could have tried this first I would have not kept this phone. There are better phones. I guess I will have to learn to like it for now because I am not buying another one. I'll deal with it for another 2 or 3 yrs and I will upgrade again. But other than those things, it's not a bad phone. The sound is good and it does have some nice features. I would really like this phone if I could stop seeing the stupid minute deduction everytime I use it!!!
