I should have written this review earlier, I bought this phone in September of 2011. The camera is amazing and takes fantastic pictures. What sets it apart from all, other camera phones is the Zennon Flash. Interior pictures requiring flah look amazing. If I am out with friends at a social gathering and we want to take few pictures they always want to use my camera. They all have iPhones 4s, 5's and Samsung galaxies. These other phones can not compare to the picture taking quality of Nokia N8. Below are my pro's and con's:Cons:- doesn't use android so there are not a lot of apps, games etcPros:- super amazing picture taking quality- Zennon flash revealing true colors not that blue LED color of all other smart phone pictures- tight tight sealed package, I dropped this phone into a sink full of water it sat submerged for 30 seconds it worked fine when retrieved no damage at all- battary charges incredibly fast using nokia charging port vs mini USB port charges 100% in 30 minutes- full office type software; word, excel, ppt- huge standard memory- FM RF transmitter can play music directly to any radio, use it all the time when on trips using rental cars- map software GPS doesn't require data connect, when traveling abroad I don't have to worry about data charges- wifi hot spot is amazing, it works well with Joikuspot, my cell service requires wifi tethering charges but this phone being unlocked gets around this. As long as whatever computer, ipad etc your using to access the web through the wifi hotspot appears to be mobile device your provider will not block it.- Has DLNA capability I can share videos and pictures wirelessly on my home network with one touch- essential applications are available for sharing amazing pictures and videos, Dropbox, Facebook, twitter etc...
