The reason I purchased this phone is because I did not want any data plan, yet I wanted fully functional GPS, WIFI and a good camera. This phone has all I wanted. You can choose to stop mobile data (home country or abroad). You can also download any map over wifi for any country of your choice for free and use it for your GPS without the need of a any data plan or Internet! It works even without a sim card. To give you an example: I was on the cruise ship between Bahamas and Miami and I had my GPS functioning, which actually showed me that the ship was going 27 miles per hour! The camera is awesome: Carl Zeis lens, autofocus (allows you to take pictures of business cards, texts, text from TV or computer screen with 100% accuracy). Most of the phone cameras will not let you do this, since they have fixed focus only. Unlike other camera phones, this phone has a real flash light. Your pictures will be bright just as if you used your regular camera. HDMI works flawlessly and will let you see pictures and videos on your TV. FM transmitter will allow you to use your phone in any car not equipped with a bluetooth or an auxiliary input. Many folks complain that the FM transmitter does not work. It is because they do not transmit on the right frequency (adjustable). Google "fm vacant frequencies" and you will find the website, that will tell you which radio stations in your area have the weakest signal or if there any empty frequency slots. Then your phone will play music over the radio with no static.  It is also useful to know where your car radio antenna is.  For instance: some cars have it integrated in the rear window! So, if you sit on the rear seat you can transmit on any frequency you want, since you are close to the car's antenna. However, if you are on the front seat you need to select the most optimal frequency.  Overall, N8 is the best phone for the price with absolutely no doubt in my mind. Nokia N8 is simply the best!
