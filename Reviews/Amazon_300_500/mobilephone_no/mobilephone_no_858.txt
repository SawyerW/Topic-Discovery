I bought the Tracfone 800LG, triple minutes, less than a month ago. This is my 4th Tracfone and I have never had a problem before but this is the 1st 'smart' phone I have bought. I set it up so it would never lock the key pad and set up all options for non-locking. Guess what - the key pad locks up within 5 seconds. I call my voice mail and usually delete before the msg is over but the key pad is locked and I cannot delete. Its a very precise control that you hold the unlock button a few seconds. A bit like Jeopardy, where you are locked out if you cannot press the button perfectly.Another issue is that the 3 weeks I have used it, I was able to answer 2 calls out of 20. I have it set on Press Any Key to answer but I must be a Fat Finger bc it does not work well. Just missed a call from a friend in Africa and I am not returning that call.Another issue is that the back plate does not stay on. I went to the Dollar store and bought a case and when I pull out the phone the back plate flies out. I have yet to try out the camera, web browser bc I cannot even answer the voice or text option.I have never heard the text msg notification even when its in my pocket. I have missed all text msgs so far. I am turning this phone back in and getting another LG Flip phone that has the obnoxious text notification that the neighbors can hear. Turns out I do not need all the bells and whistles but I do need to answer the phone, retrieve messages and get notified of text messages!!!
