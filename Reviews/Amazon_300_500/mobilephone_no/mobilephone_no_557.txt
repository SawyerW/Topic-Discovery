I had a Palm and discovered that there are not a whole lot of apps available for it, so I wanted an Android phone instead.  Found this one but was wary with the reviews saying how horrible battery life is and how slow it is, but I've had my phone for a month now and I have had no problems with it.  I've used a Motorola Droid X before (my bf has one) and I don't think the Eris is any difference in speed of opening programs, etc, as that phone (except for angry birds, it won't work, but I got aggrevated at the game on the Palm so it's no skin off my nose).  The battery life is actually amazing, compared to the Palm I had. The secret is to condition the battery when you first get it (the Android forum explains this, just charge it fully and discharge it fully, to 15%, three or four times in a row).  I did this and now one charge can last me anywhere from two to three days, which is great for what is basically a small computer, depending on how much I use it during the day.  2 days is for medium usage, three is when I'm busy at work and can't do much on the internet or play games during the day (stupid work!).  Another secret is to make sure you aren't getting the "Time without a signal" problem, that will drain the battery quicker, like only lasts  12 hours. The fix for that is easy though (plug it in, go into airplane mode, unplug it, get out of airplane mode and then turn the phone completely off, then back on; i did this once and it's been fine ever since).  It's also a very nice size, a balance between small enough to fit in a pocket (unlike the Droid X, which is huge in my opinion) and large enough to have a nice screen for internet surfing. I very much recommend this phone if you don't want to pay as much for an android phone as the motorola droid.
