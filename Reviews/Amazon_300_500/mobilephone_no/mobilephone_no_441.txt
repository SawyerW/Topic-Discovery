TracPhone is the way to go.  I rarely, if ever, need a cell phone.  I have never owned one nor know how to operate the darn things.  Since deciding it made good sense to have one in the car for emergencies (don't forget to buy a car charger separately), I did a lot of investigation as to the absolutely cheapest, most reliable way to accomplish that.  TracPhone!...hands down.  I researched Target, K-Mart, Rite Aide and Radio Shack.  All were the same price but none had a model with the features I wanted.  The difference was that only at Radio Shack could I find anyone who knew what the heck they were talking about.  My criteria for a phone included a camera (still and video), web access, full QUERTY keyboard, easy to use/program, voice commands, well built, all the other bells & whistles (WI-FI & Bluetooth, MP3, voice activated and easy APPS) and reasonably priced.  All, and more, were included with the Samsung S390G....plus it came with Lifetime Triple Minutes.  None of the mentioned stores had the model that would do all that.  The Samsung was listed at $50 everywhere online except on Amazon.  I got it for $32.  Then one must buy both 'minutes' and 'air time'....two different things.  The TracPhone web site had a special on both.  Combine the special and my 'triple minutes', I now have a years worth of air time and over 1400 minutes...all for less than $80.  The same type deal in a store was over $100.  Don't forget to purchase a large memory card.  I started with only 4G until I see if I need a larger one.  I have now programmed the phone with all my needed phone numbers, added my e-mail accounts, recorded my personal greeting and downloaded my favorite ring tone...the theme from Law & Order...  My overall opinion is one can't go wrong with this deal if it meets your economic needs.
