My daughter has been using this phone for 6 months, and she loves it. So we decided to upgrade to this phone from our clamshell phones at the end of holiday season. We have been tracfone users over 6 years, with this new phone, our experience with the company is more satisfactory. It was very easy to transfer both my wife and my numbers to the new phone by calling customer service center. With promotion code, we have a new phone with 1400 min and 425 days. As the touch function, it is not as responsive as my ipod touch, which is expected. But it is good enough to me. I also have a 4g microSD card loaded with my favorite songs and audiobooks in the phone, so I can enjoy the music or audiobooks on the go. The voice recorder is another function I used a lot. I can record lectures in a big auditorium, even though the quality is not great, but it is good enough to me. All in all, a great deal.update on 02/11/2012:After using the LG800G for over a month, my family have fallen into the love with this little phone. However, the accuracy of the touch screen is really not very impressive. I had to use a ballpen or a stylus to key in a message. Somehow, I found out a trick to improve the touch precision recently: to calibrate the touch screen using the tip of a sharp pencil or ballpen, do not use your finger. When you are calibrating with the pencil, try the best to make the blue dot match the red dot. Then you will find the accuracy of typing is dramatically improved. All three phones of my family have been calibrated in this way, and my daughter is really excited with the new typing experience with re-calibrated phone. That is my two cents to share with you.
