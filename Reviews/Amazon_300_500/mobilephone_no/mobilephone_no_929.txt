Love love love this device, lost the same model 9 months back in the woods (#1 was with me for about a year, I hope to keep #2 with me forever and ever) and life was not the same. This thing takes a the drops, the water plops, it can take the heat and keeps on kicking. At work I us it to listen to internet radio with headphones (some head phones don't connect so be sure try a few if it doesn't work at first), while I drive I use a GPS the speakers are nice and loud, the screen is great (you have to push a little harder than a normal touch screen but not by much), photo quality is 'so so' but it get the job done (they come out grainy and higher res pics can't be sent out for some reason), I don't like the pre-loaded rooted apps like Bing but you can't get away from that (at least not) and I love that I can rinse (I make sure the seals are closed)  it off when it gets dirty.Battery life is like any other smart phone, it depends on your apps and GPS usage, if I'm using it to navigate it will last for about 2 hours, if  I'm listening to internet radio 3 hours, normal texting calling 5 hours so I just keep it charged.As a person who is prone to dropping anything I'm hold this phone is amazing. 2 of my friends got the same device and really like too... One fo them killed every phone she had within 3 months but not this one, this keeps working and she loves it more than I do.Phone call quality is great, other phones I had would drop calls or have calls go straight to voice mail (on the same service provider) but this little guy picks them all up. I get service where most other people don't (on the same service provider), there's one place I didn't but I think they have lead walls becase no one ever gets service there.Syncs with blue tooth easily.Bright flash light.Nice design.It has some neat 'adventure' apps pre-loaded, not anythig you couldn't download yourself but its there.Like any device it's has it's great, it's good and it's meh features. It's great features make up for any of the so so ones (for example I have stubby fingers and the 'trace' typing rocks)
