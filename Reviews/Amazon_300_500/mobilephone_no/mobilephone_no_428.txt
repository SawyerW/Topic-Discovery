I purchased this Verizon phone because of the prepaid plan for 50$ a month for unlimited talk, text and web. That seemed to be a great deal. Also the prepaid plan has no contract to keep you bound to this service.Unfortunately, the web access is almost useless, as the technology to  get there and move around is very awkward. Access is extremely slow and filled with landmines that blow up unexpectedly and you land somewhere  Verizon tries to sell you ring tones etc. (This happens repeatedly) Meanwhile, back at the web, you haven't gotten anywhere and are still waiting for a connection with your fingers crosses that you won't be side tracked again.I attempted to go to my Gmail account and found that I could get onto a Google search page, but not sign into my Gmail. If email is important enough to you, there is an option for Verizon "Mobil email" which I assume make it easier to send and receive email, but the charge for it is about 7$ a month.From my point of view, if you talk and text to the point that 50$ will save you money, it is a great deal. The web access is all but useless.The sound of the phone is good and clear with un-muffled sound. Conversation is easy to hear and understand.The keys on the phone are smaller than what I have been used to, but think that most women would find them workable. I frequently find that I am using the tip of my thumb nail to hit the keys, as opposed to my finger tips. If you are a man with even a medium size hand, I recommend that you handle the phone before purchase to see if it will work for you.I found this Pantech phone at Best Buy in October 2011 for under 60.00$. Verizon charges 35$ to get it up and running and is capable of allowing the use of a different existing number that is yours, like a home phone number you are ready to terminate.
