I gotta say that I love this phone, me and my husband have been with sprint for going on 10 years and quite frankly I'm so sick of paying a bill every month! I did our annual calculations of what and how we could save over half of what we're paying with sprint and come down to one carrier=TRACFONE! This phone is a triple minute phone so that's an extra added bonus,(we plan on paying for the yearly service on these phones), I recently terminated one of our lines since I bought my daughter a tracfone last November due to the fact that she barely ever used the phone I was paying $10 a month for! Now were down to $5 bucks a month for her cellphone usage she always has minutes when I add another card to her line, I gotta say I ported her number over by phone(customer service) and they had her number ported in less then 5 minutes(with the same sim card)! Excellent customer service I can add! Me and my hubby haven't set up our lines just yet(with the number port) just yet we have another month or so to go but at this point the WiFi and email are already set up on my Samsung and I can still check my email on any WiFi spot that's available for FREE! Even without the phone even activated! With my current phone I cant even do that! All in all this phone is very simple to use, tons of features and the WiFi makes it even more then worth it! The only minor issue is that it takes a little(and I mean little) while to get used to the track-pad(the home key)but other then that this phone is an excellent phone that's why I gave it 5 stars! NO complaints here!
