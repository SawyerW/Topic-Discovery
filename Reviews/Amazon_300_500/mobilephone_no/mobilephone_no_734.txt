I recently purchased this phone after going through numerous prepaid cell phones.  I previously had the LG touchscreen Go Phone(which I purchased off Amazon).  Not only were the daily charges bad, but I kept receiving text messages that ate not only my $50 airtime credit, but two other $15 airtime cards.  So, I wanted to try a different cell phone.  And, I'm sure glad I did.Tracfone is without a doubt the cheapest cell phone service availible to prepaid users like myself.  I had it previously, but during that time, they had no ringtones, free double minutes for life, or extended 90 days of service with each airtime card.  Those are features you just don't get from other prepaid providers.  The phone itself was $15, which is great for someone on a budget like me.  I also bought a 60 minute airtime card for $20, so between the two I only spent $35.  That is an unbelievable bargain, but it gets better.  Activation on the Tracfone website was simple to use, and after adding the airtime card, it gave me 150 service days with 140 minutes.  Compsred to the Go Phone I had, that is a much better deal.  Go Phone only gives you 30 days of service with each card.  With Tracfone, your service days extend with each airtime card you add.  So, one could easily get close to a year of service after activation and a few months of airtime cards(each airtime card adds 90 days to your service days).The LG 420 is a great phone as well.  It comes with all the standard features you'd expect.  It even has a camera(which most $15 phones don't).  Reception on it is phenominal.  So, if you are looking for a cheap(but great)prepaid cell phone this is definately it.  Tracfone, in my opinion, cannot be beat for the price.  Less hassle and more quality...
