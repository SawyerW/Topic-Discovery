I just ordered the Note after selling my GSM Galaxy Nexus.  I have AT&T; in the US.  After reading numerous complaints from Note users on AT&T;, it seems they are receiving texts from AT&T; saying they need a tablet data plan.  If ignored, AT&T; simply shuts down the data, rendering the phone useless.Is this even legal?  I am nervous about putting my SIM in this thing when it arrives since I have grandfathered unlimited data.  If AT&T; plays games and tries to cancel my plan, claiming this large phone is a tablet (which it is NOT a tablet) I will be supremely pissed.So, AT&T; users in the US.  When did you put your SIM in for the first time and how long have you used it without threats from AT&T;?  Those who did get a threat, how long did it take?*** 12/20 edit ***In an effort to fiend off the angry mob of negative voters, I'd thought I would add to my review.  Received my Note yesterday, rooted it, backed up and deleted the EFS folder, set the APN settings and all seems to be well.  Working fine and it's an amazing device.  I do still, worry that AT&T; will hunt me down with the accusatory text saying I'm using a tablet not a smartphone.So, for now, I plan on keeping this for a long time as it's an incredible device.  If AT&T; acts up, I'll return it and get something else.  So, if you are on the fence and have AT&T; in the US, don't just plop you SIM in and go unless you want to open a debate with the carrier about a tablet vs. phone argument.*** Additional Edit ***Keep down rating me all you want, but I have a gift for you all.  I personally worked with product managers at AT&T; and they realized the Note's IMEI's were incorrectly classified as tablets.  Because of my working with them, an issue was identified and corrected with the Note's IMEI and now they are recognized in AT&T;'s system as a smartphone.Since links are deleted, go to XDA-developers dot com, forums, Galaxy Note, Q&A; forum and see the thread titled "AT&T; users of Galaxy Note - I was able to remedy the tablet issue!!!"Have a good one and I would appreciate all the knee-jerk negative ratings to be re-thought.  This took me many hours to accomplish and it's for the greater good of us all.
