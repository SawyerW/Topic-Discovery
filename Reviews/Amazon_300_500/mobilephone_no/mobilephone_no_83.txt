I purchased this phone to replace a Windows Mobile based HTC that also had a full QWERTY keyboard. The HTC was a great phone but I had issues with it deleting contacts when it was sync'd which was completely unacceptable to me.I have owned several Nokia phones previously and the Symbian OS is hard to beat with its features. I'll agree with other reviews that state that it takes a bit of 'seek and destroy' to find various options and settings on this phone. On the other hand, it has a plethora of customization options.The phone is constructed very well and looks great to boot. Its ultra thin construction along with the extra length the front keypad add has made it somewhat difficult the find a quality case for this phone. The case included only provides bare minimum protection and it is not easy to remove the phone from it.The keyboard is relatively easy to use but takes some getting use to since it is completely flat. The buttons do provide good positive click feedback. I do wish the keyboard had a dedicated button to send text messages. As it stands now, you have to use multiple key clicks to send each text message.Text messages are not displayed in a linear, conversational format. Instead, they are divided into folders for Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc. It's not an issue for me but those coming from other smart phones may be bothered by this.The camera, as with almost all phones, is pretty lackluster. It will do in a pinch but it won't turn you into Ansel Adams by any means. It does have a built in flash which helps in dark situations.The Nokia PC Suite and included data cable make this phone a breeze to sync and tether.Battery life is excellent with Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off and entirely acceptable with either or both turned on.Sound quality is excellent at both ends of the conversation and the built in voice dialing feature works exceptionally well.
