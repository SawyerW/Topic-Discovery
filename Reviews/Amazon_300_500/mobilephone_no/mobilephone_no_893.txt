This phone is awesome!  I added the $3.99 to get it overnighted with Prime so I wouldn't have to wait.When I unboxed it I had to laugh at how ridiculously huge it is.  It took a day or two to get used to the size but now my old Atrix feels tiny.As soon as it arrived I plugged it into the charger and while it charged I read up on how to root and flash ICS onto it and so I did that before it was even finished charging.Mine booted up in German so make sure you don't toss the piece of paper included in the box to tell you what options to press to switch it to English.I bought 2 TPU cases for it.  Black one for $14 and clear one for $4.  They are exactly the same except for the color.  I ordered the clear one first but then read reviews about it not fitting right so I ordered the black one of a different brand.  They ended up both fitting great.Black Boxwave TPUBoxWave Samsung GALAXY Note DuoSuit (Fits both AT&T; and International Versions) - Slim-Fit Ultra Durable TPU Case with Stylish "S" Design on Back - Samsung GALAXY Note Cases and Covers (Jet Black)Clear S-LineClear S-Line Soft TPU Gel Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy Note / i9220 GT-N7000Protecting the screen is a very nice SPIGEN SGP Samsung GT-N7000 Galaxy Note Screen Protector Cover Film Steinheil Unlocked (International) Version ONLY [Ultra Oleophobic], Oil Resistant 2 pcs Included.I locked myself in the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get it nice and steamy to minimize dust floating around and was able to apply it with no air bubbles from dust.It attracts a lot of attention and some people make fun of it and say it's way too big to hold up to your head.  Well I rarely talk on the phone (heavy texter) so it's fine for me.
