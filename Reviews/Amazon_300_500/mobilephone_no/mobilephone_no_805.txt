I have had this phone for a week or so. Almost everything works fine out of the box.Android market is full of some good apps. Plus if you are adventurous you can build your apps with Android SDK. They have plenty of documentation and examples.Only issues so far. The battery seems to last (less as per my expectations) only for 1.5 days with little (1.5hour) wifi and 2 hour talk time (I use loudspeaker so this might be more if you don't) and 2.5 hours of games. Could not get gingerbread installed via Kies (might use 3rd party ROM flashers, Odin??,  which seem to be available in plenty)Note this phone ships from outside US. As advertised you have no warranty and US Samsung customer support won't help as it is a non-us device. So wrt tech help you might be on your own. Or buy the warranty version.Could not get GPS to work as of now. Need to understand all the settings.Pluses.. awesome screen with no lag. Android community for support and development.Love it and would recommend if you are looking for a cheap unlocked phone.Update:  Got gingerbread update from Samsung using Kies, so no unlocking or rooting required (will have to see what happens for later Android upgrades). Now the battery has improved significantly. So no qualms for the money spent.  3G speeds from Att&t; in my area are decent, tried gtalk and youtube and multiple app download with no noticeable lag.And writing apps for android is fun!! Wish I had more money to upgrade to more powerful newer phones :(. But no regrets from this one so far!Update: Almost 1 year now after purchase. Upgraded the firmware to 2.3.6 (I know no ICS or Jelly bean). But it does make the phone feel more responsive and snappy.Loving it so far.
