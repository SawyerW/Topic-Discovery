I have one of these. Initially bought back when my original AT&T; Samsung Impression went kaput. I have now been on a smartphone kick, progressing from the MB860 Atrix 4G to the MB865 Atrix 2 (This was actually a downgrade from the 4G unfortunately, it sucked) and now onto the MB886 Atrix HD.Back onto the subject oof the A107:Call quality was good-to-excellent:Never dropped a call, others heard me loud and clear, hearing them was loud and clear as well. If I recall, this does have a speakerphone through use of the ear receiver.Features were poor/lacking:It was able to call and text, I'm not sure I remember ever being able to connect to the internet on it however. I know it's not an HSPA/EVDO device (3G) but I should have still been able to pull up a single page on Google or Yahoo, however that was not capable even on the 1X data connection.Reliability was excellent:The phone still works to this very day, it's never bugged out on me or not turned on or made a call when I wanted & needed it to.Ruggedness was excellent:I am notorious for dropping my phones. I have dropped this thing numerous times but it functions perfect, the only thing apparent is the scuffs and marks on the outside of the case.Battery life was excellent:I remember using this phone for days with plenty of talk and text going on and not having to charge it very often at all. When I did charge it, I'd charge it overnight (8~hours) and use it until it was about dead again. It would last for days though, I am positive on that.*Not sure about if you're seeing this at the $27 price I am now, but I can honestly say I'd hold off on it for that price. I got mine for $19 + tax in Wal-Mart years back.
