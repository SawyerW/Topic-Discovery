I am unable to find these mystery 1200 minutes or triple minutes.  I called Tracfone (was on hold for full 1/2 hour and then spoke to someone I could barely understand) and was told this has nothing to do with Tracfone and I need to contact the seller and complain.***Update:  After much time researching, I did discover that the random white piece of paper taped to the outside of the box that said nothing but, "PIN" and a number, was a number I was supposed to use to claim the minutes. I had NO idea -- there are no instructions or labeling or even the slightest hint about what that number is for.  For anyone stuck in my situation, go to the Tracfone website, select "add minutes", and enter that PIN number taped to the outside of your box.  The Tracfone representative I talked to had no idea about the minutes and apparently had never heard of such a thing, and there is nothing in the Amazon product description, either. I wasted a great deal of time and effort, and my daughter went for a week unable to use her Christmas present, because of this glaring lack of communication.It also took me about six attempts to even get the phone registered.  First there was a call, then I tried to open a trip ticket on Tracfone, but when I entered the serial number of the phone it refused the ticket and said "that phone is pending, try again in 5 minutes".  Kept trying that for a few days. Finally called again and was cut off.  Called yet again and finally got a roboperson who gave me about long strings of numbers to enter.  The phone was at least connected at that point. But the phone only had ten minutes and it was a total mystery how we would get the 1200 minutes.The reason we got a simple Tracfone was to avoid the complications of adding another line to our Verizon account.  There has been nothing simple about getting this phone up and running, however.  I blame both the seller's mystifying lack of communication and Tracfone.
