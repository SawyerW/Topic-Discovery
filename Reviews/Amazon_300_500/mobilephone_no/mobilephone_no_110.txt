I purchased this phone about 3 months ago from Amazon for my team here at Real St. Lucia Tours. So far the smart phone has proved to be absolutely amazing; since I received it I have been totally obsessed in tinkering around with its features.If there's one thing which totally stands out with the Nokia E63 is its price, I had been shopping around for BBs initially and was turned off on their price. I wanted a phone with many business features, quality and don't cost an arm or a leg. The E63 was my answer, at just under $200.00 this phone can stand everything thrown at it.The fact that my team and I arrange adventure travel excursions for international clients means that we are often in many different environmental settings and call quality on the thing seem to be always perfect. I have had a few dropped calls though and am not sure whether that's the phone or the network "Lime" I am using.The phone has basically all the features you would need in a smart phone and much more, podcast, radio, maps and a whole host of apps. We conference call on Skype with our partners from Australia every Friday and having the Skype application installed on this handset just makes it a whole lot easier than sitting in front of a computer with a headset.The battery life is more than sufficient, I personally run about 6 applications on my phone at any given time "Wi-FI Enabled" - Skype, Opera, YouTube, office, and Nokia mail and the E63 make doing all this a snag.One of the main downside to it is the fact that it doesn't come with much on-board memory and you will have to buy a micro SD card which doesn't cost much, but hey, at least you are not forking over an extra $100 to by a BB.The phone is well built and doesn't look cheap at all, you can view my team and I using it while on the road at my website [...].Thanks to Amazon, the fact that we are in the Caribbean, we received our phone in less than two weeks. Comes with a not so fancy headset and well packaged. I am hoping to use the E63 for about a year and depending on the full experience purchase another Nokia."Good Job Nokia & Amazon"Janus Gyan
