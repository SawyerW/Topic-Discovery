I've had this phone for about 2 months and it provides basic multimedia (pix, camera, audio), reasonable contact functions and fairly good phone quality. I don't use my phone a lot so battery life is acceptable for me. It's not as big or as solid as a Razr, but the price was right -- free with a family plan.The speakerphone could be a little louder.  The menus are ok and are somewhat customizable, and I think better than my inexpensive Motorola.  Switching silent to ring profile is easy.  It also has a flight mode which shuts down the cell phone but allows you to use the multimedia and phone book etc.I got a plastic shell and a leather case that both work fine and protect it as it is a bit fragile.I ordered it from ATT with a handsfree mono earbud which works okay, but is uncomfortable and rubber earbud cushions seem next to impossible to find.  I also have not been able to find a stereo headset with mic.  I tried the Nokia HS-47, HS-42 and HS-40 with no luck.  You can get a 3.5 to 2.5 adaptor, but you won't have a mic.I had no luck with the 3rd party SIM card reader in backing up the address book, but the I did get a data cable that worked.  You have to put it "Nokia mode" for the data cable to work right, the data and music mode don't seem to work as well.  Bluetooth worked ok on my Mac, but I didn't try the "Nokia Suite" on the mac.  I have not found a video format that will work, but takes most audio files, although some it won't play.  MP3's seem fine.  I added a 1 GB microSD card without any problems.  It has both phone memory and a memory card with is a little confusing.  I can only sometimes get the voice recognition to work.
