This phone has a lot of potential, but is just OK at best.  On the plus side the screen display is AWESOME.  The picture is bright and the colors are crisp and clear.  It takes great pictures outside, but like most phone cameras, is poor in low light conditions.  The size and thickness of the phone are great.However, there are some low points.  When I first got the phone, it wouldn't text pictures to others (MMS).  I played with the APN settings, had AT&T; play with the APN settings, then contacted BLU support.  They eventually had me reset the phone to factory settings and install a new version of Android on the phone.  The install went fine, but the APN settings were now worse and I couldn't get ANY data.  AT&T; was no help (can't blame them since I didn't get the phone from them).  BLU support was zero help on this.  I had to search quite a few forums on the internet to find APN settings that completely worked.  I probably had about 7-8 hours into solving this problem.  Also, as others have mentioned, the battery life stinks.  One day is all you are going to get out of the phone, even with a good app killer.  One really odd problem I have is feedback.  When I use the phone to actually to talk to someone I hear an echo of my own voice.  It's annoying.  Finally, the GPS is horrible.  Not only is it slow to connect to satellites (several minutes), the accuracy is WAY off.  You can't use the phone for geocaching.  I wouldn't use it to locate a business.  Last time I attempted to use it I was about a mile away from where the GPS said I was.Will it work?  In a nutshell, yes.  However there are better phones out there, but the price is hard to beat.  So...there's lots of potential here, but not enough to make me want to buy the phone again.
