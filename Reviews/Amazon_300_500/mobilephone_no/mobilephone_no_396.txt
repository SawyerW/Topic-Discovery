This is a great phone, but it definitely has faults. It comes in a variety of colors and has a lot of cases. It is kind of hard to find cases at just any store, but you can find cases at your company's store. I have a case on my HTC and have dropped it too many times to count. I have even dropped it down a metal staircase and it didn't crack. It is a touch screen phone and sometimes it does not respond. When I first got this phone I was surprised on how many apps were pre-installed. Most I have never used. There is a music app already installed and that is nice. What is really annoying is you can't just hold an app down and delete it. You have to go in to settings, find the app, delete it or go on google play, find it and delete it.It took me months to find out how to take a screenshot. Turns out all you have to do is hit power then home, just like any other phone.I know I have been going on about the faults of this phone, but it is great a great phone. The speakers are great and the earphones work amazingly.You can lock the phone and that is great if you don't want sneaky people getting onto your phone. You can have a pattern to draw or a number combination.It has tons of space. I have a good amount of apps on my phone and I still have over half the space left.If the phone is being stupid then just turn it on then back off. The only problem is it takes a few minutes to start back up.It has a good price of around $100 for a touch screen phone. It is a great phone if you are updating.Overall this is a great phone. I would recommend it to anyone.
