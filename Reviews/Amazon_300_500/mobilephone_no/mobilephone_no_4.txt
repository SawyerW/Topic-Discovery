i love this phone. a few years ago i knew a guy who had a phone with internet service. it was a big and bulky thing, like a shoebox, almost. the internet connection sometimes took 5 minutes. i thought it was so cool.i didn't know what cool was. the bright color screen of this phone is very vibrant and contains good-sized text. all kinds of different ring tones can be downloaded. from tones to actual songs, it's an awesome feature, but you cannot prelisten to the tones before you download them. that is a real letdown. i downloaded "diff'rent strokes" blindly and was very accepting of it's replicated melody. but when i downloaded "goodtimes" it sounded like a mixture of "cheers" and "taxi."photo quality is a notch less than average. about what you could expect from a celphone in this day and time, with no zoom. the feature of choosing different frames for your photos is cute and it's even better that you can email them to any address you have loaded.this is a phone review, so i won't talk about the sprint service as it is immaterial. let's just say that it could be better, but i won't count that against the phone.it's got a huge phone address databank and you can apply photos and rings to certain numbers. when my fiance' calls, her picture lights up on the screen with her "american pie" ringtone blaring. supercool.included is a calculator, calender with daily schedule alerts, a strong gaming system and lots of different applications that you can download, such as mapquest or the weather channel. if you're lost, the ability to pull up mapquest on your freakin' celphone is a godsend. the phone is compact and comes with pc connection inlets.with all these features, it manages to actually allow you to dial phone numbers and talk to people who also own phones. that helps too.AMENDMENT NOV. 18 2005.THIS PHONE'S BATTERY LIFE SUCKS! AND THE SCREEN GOES BAD AFTER A WHILE TOO.
