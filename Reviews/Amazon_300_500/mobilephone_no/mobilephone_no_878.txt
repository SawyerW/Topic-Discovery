I have owned this device since November 2011 and it is as much a pleasure to use today as when we first got it.  Easily one of the best devices to ever run Windows Phone 7, it is a seamless, fantastic experience.  The tile UI which makes up the home screen is a unique and very useful tool.  Your favorite tools, apps, web stes and shortcuts can all be attached to the main screen in a square tile, and one tap opens it up within seconds.  Tired of it, or want some bloat gone?  Just uninstall it.  It is like Microsoft was the first to find out this is your phone.The Media plays very well on the Focus S, and Samsung's screens continue to perform well.  Bright and vibrant, images pop off and colors excel.  There are great tools- Microsoft Office has a very useful mobile version of Office installed, the Calander is as useful of a tool as I have ever come acrossed, "Local Scout" is great for food, movies and events, Zune player is a fantastic music/video service.  If you are a social media nut, WP has changed the game with the intergration of your mobile sites into the "People" hub.  Load up your information, and addresses, contacts, pictures, and phone numbers come in automatically and Birthdays get attached to the calander all at once. Samsung also provides an exclusive called "Chat On" which also does wonders for social media. "XBOX LIVE" hub is fun and will keep the Gamer happy.  The app selection is now over 100,00 and still counting.  The on screen keyboard is decent with good spell check options.  Reception and call quality are great. IE9 is smooth as the web browser.Only concerns:  16 GB hard storage with no expandable memory, the camera is decent but nothing special, the speaker phone quality is only average, and there is no support for "Flash" video. Cannot say enough good things.  Do not worry about support- Microsoft is pushing a major upgrade out to WP 7 devices dubbed WP 7.8 and apps will continue to be written for these devices when WP 8 comes out.
