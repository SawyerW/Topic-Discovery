I picked this phone up in early December for $250 from a Boost Mobile retail store, just a few months of it coming out in October. I had made the switch to Boost (from Verizon to save cash) and the Samsung Prevail was my first phone; yet I was in need of something with more functionality for email and text. Prevail's a fairly basic device for one who don't want too much flair. So I went with the Venice. Looks nice and it's lightweight.I was satisfied with the Venice until February of this year when the phone randomly crashed on me. Of course I sent it back and it was working like new...for a month. From that point, my calls would drop and I lacked a consistent 3G signal. I did multiple resets within the phone and holding the Vol Down + Home + Power buttons but it didn't fix my problem. Yet my 3G signal is fine on the Prevail so that right there says it's not an issue with Boost.So I reached out to both Boost and LG on a replacement and Boost told me to contact LG about this. LG said that this defect isn't under the limited warranty; despite it being an internal issue with undesired functionality. I believe a wireless radio within the device is burned out and it's something that should be honored by the warranty. So now I'm stuck with a $250 paperweight...that I could use for a MP3 player I guess, since the Prevail isn't the flashiest phone around. But at least I can make calls without them dropping.I would strongly recommend looking into other phones. Anything from HTC or Samsung is a nice fit, like the Evo Design or Galaxy S3. Personally I don't trust LG or their devices anymore and this is the only product of theirs I own. I would expect better from a well-known company.
