What a fantastic little phone.  I originally decided to go with Tracfone when I learned that Verizon and the rest of the market were putting chips in cellphones to send nationwide alerts and disaster messages from the White House and DHS.  I don't need anything from this dumb White House and the dumber DHS, thanks anyway, I'll hear about it long before those beauracratic dodos tell me.Anyway, I originally got an LG500G from Tracfone which suited the purpose very well.  I don't use a cellphone that much but its good to keep around for the few messages I get and the attached camera is a plus.  The LG was a simple device, small enought not to be annoying.I happened to come across the Samsung S390G and decided to try it.  Wow!  What a cool phone.  Its good looking, easy to use, and does EVERYTHING!  I am really impressed.  But if I find out it has one of those chips in it, it goes in the trash, straightaway.  I've had the phone a week and it works great.  Just ordered a 32G microSD card and will stuff that in there.  The camera on this one is about twice the pixels of the LG model.And, of course, cost is an issue.  Well, with this phone you get TRIPLE minutes for life.  For around $50 you get 1200 minutes of airtime.  Not bad.  What this means is my old Verizon phone was costing me more than $60/month and that's with a veteran discount.  With these triple minutes PLUS the cost of the device, my cost is less $20/month.  That's a $500/year savings!Buy this phone and enjoy every minute of your time with it.  Its the best deal on anything I've gotten in a long time.Added 10/2/2012.  I love this phone!  It really is a good looking device and it works great.  I know when I'm getting emails all day long, I can add files on the microSD card, I can reply to emails, it holds a long charge, and it works great as a phone.  What more could I want for a few bucks?
