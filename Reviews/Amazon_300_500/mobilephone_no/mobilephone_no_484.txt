Four and a half stars.  I have had this phone for about 7 months now and I am very pleased with its overall performance.  Cosmetically, it is a very pretty phone.  I love the dark blue color and the curved glass of the screen feels great in the hand.  That said, it is also a bit slippery to hold because of the smooth plastic on the back of the phone, so I generally keep mine in a case.  Even with a case, this is still a slim phone, easy to hold and easy to type on, even with my relatively small hands.  Software wise, I like what Samsung has done with their Touch Wiz user interface.  It is easy to use and customize, and there are more features built-in then most people are likely to ever use.  The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.  Call quality on Verizon in Southern California has been very good (the only reason I have stuck with them as a carrier is because of the reliability of their network).  Data speeds are fast both with WiFi and 4G.  The only real complaint I have about this phone is the battery life.  I know it has a very large screen and that the 4G service is real drain on the battery, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to charge this up every night.  It definitely makes in through a day without any problems, even with reasonably heavy use, but I've never been able to take it for two whole days without having to charge it up on day 2.  Still, with a user replaceable battery, you could always keep a spare on hand and switch between the two if need be.  Overall, I really like this phone.  When I first got it, I thought it was too big for me, but I find I really like having that extra screen real estate, even if it means I can no longer carry my phone in my pocket.  I know the S4 has been out for a little while now, but this is still an excellent device with tons of features and great overall performance.  I would highly recommend it.
