I was so excited when buying this phone but now I'm most disappointed. I am an avid HP fan but they have let me down big time. The device is crap! And here twelve of the sins of HP with this device that I have found:1. After a while the keys stop responding at the first press - so darn annoying and makes me want to throw $450 into a wall sometimes. Also, they are not soft  enough.2. The device accesses applications sometimes independent of user input. e.g. I don't like to remain connected all the time to the internet through my mobile  provider, but sometimes when I about to use the phone and I press the action button to do, I see that I'm connected to the internet. And this seems to happen  when the signal strength in the device fluctuates.3. The device heats up very quickly when talking.4. It seems to have such a mind of its own that it picks up signals sometimes when it decides.5. The audio output is abysmal:  a. The earpiece seems to automatically attenuate - sometimes I can't hear a thing and other times it's just suddenly deafening.  b. The speaker is definitely a manufacturer's anomaly - it is annoyingly weak - the worst I've heard.6. It is so darn difficult and seemingly impossible to customise the sounds for various sound output applications.7. Some applications are not user-controllable.8. The screen is a disaster:  a. The options to customise are next to non-existent.  b. It is way too small when most of the face of the device is like wasted real estate.9. The camera is a nightmare. It captures what it feels like capturing it seems.10. Sometimes I am standing in a area of excellent signal strength and the signal icon/indicator is fluctuating.11. I was hoping that I would be able to create PowerPoint slides, but alas, the device does not allow.12. As for style, what's up with this terribly looking & black plastic on the face and sides of the device. Apply some chrome finish already.And the list goes on. HP should replace my device.
