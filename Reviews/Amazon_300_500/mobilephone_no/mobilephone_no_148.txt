Okay, so I've had this phone for a few weeks now and I dunno why people bag on it. No, it's not a smartphone. If you want a smartphone, go get a bleeping smartphone. No, it doesn't have all the latest bells and whistles, but again, it's 5 bleeping years old, when it came out it had all the bells and whistles.That said, let's get to the actual review.It's fairly well built,the outer casing seems to be made of a mix of lightweight aircraft grade aluminum and high density plastic. The flip open bit works fine and there's minimal wiggle in the hinge. It's not milspec, so it's going to have some wiggle. That's a fact of life. Making things super precise costs super money. When this came out, yeah it cost super money but it had super tech.The keys are all flush with the body, they don't stick up, but they're reasonably large and light up for night use. The speaker on it's decent, and the ringtone I loaded (You need special software to do that, but it's easy to get) plays fine, though since this is the V1, it doesn't have much memory or a way to expand the memory, so whatever ringtone you pick is going to need to be either downgraded a bit in quality, or short. I went with both, and it's been fine. Not concert quality, but you don't need concert quality sound for a ringtone.The only problem I've had is the left side hinge plug. It occasionally starts to wiggle out a bit. It's not a huge problem though, just push it back in and keep an eye on it.I got this as a downgrade from my old smartphone and I'm glad I did. A smartphone, even the hunk of junk I had, was too much phone for my needs. Like using a bazooka on a fly. Sure it'll work but the word overkill comes to mind. This makes calls, receives calls, almost always has full bars, it cut my phone bill by more than half, and I can have the ringtone I want. Of course when I see it I kinda have flashbacks to school and keep wanting to revert to valley girl mode, but that's just me lol
