Pantech FlexThe Pantech Flex is a very good budget Android phone that competes with the higher priced phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the HTC one X.  The processor is the latest dual core snapdragon running at 1.5ghz with 1 GB Ram.  This may sound like technical jargon but what this means is that the phone will allow you to load even the most demanding apps and the play the latest games without a problem.  The screen is very large and vibrant (though not as large and bright as a Galaxy S3) and is readable in most conditions.  The only feature that is a disappointment on the phone is the camera which has a slow response time leading to blurry photos in most conditions which is a shame because the video recording is actually very good.  Overall the Flex provides a great low priced alternative to the higher end Samsung and HTC phones as long as you can live with its imperfect camera.*** Positive Points Include: ***- Fast processor- Large Screen that is bright and very readable with great touchscreen response- Front and rear cameras that allow for face to face Skype calls- Excellent 4g LTE speeds (at least on ATT)- Very good HD video recording using the back camera- Very bright flash on the camera that doubles as a flashlight- Bluetooth 3.0- Good construction with plastic and metal construction that feels more solid than the all plastic HTC and Samsung phones- Has an easy mode which is great for older users or those who are not fully tech literate*** Negative Points Include: ***- Camera has a slow shutter which makes it difficult to take clear pictures- No upgrade to Android 4.2 (at least not yet)- Speaker is monaural and is on the back of the phone so the sound is muffled if you put the phone flat on a table- 8gb memory is a bit on the low side (though there is a micro sd port)- No USB or HDMI out like you get on the Samsung Galaxy
