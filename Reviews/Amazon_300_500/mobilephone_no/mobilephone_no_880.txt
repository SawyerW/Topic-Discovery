I am a current apple junkie.  I love the simpliity of their devices and OS's, that said I have to say I was pelasantly surprised when I got my hands on the Samsung Focus S.  I was looking to leave my iphone after 4 years with the various versions and I could not find a phone that really fit my needs.  I tried out the Samsung Galaxy S Epic whatever it's called and although I loved the hardware, the andriod operating system kind of sucked to me.  For my taste, it's "too customizable".  That may be OK for some but not for me.  I read a random review on windows phone 7 from one of the editors on CNET and it really intrigued me, but it wasn't until I got my hands on both the Focus S and the Titan that I was sold.  The concept of live tiles is so simple that it's awesome!!  I always hated having to always go from app to app to see things.  On WP7, I can see facebook, twitter, MSN, & XBox updates all from one screen!  Everything is super fast and the 4G is a big plus over the speeds on my iphone 4s which was incredibly slow for some reason.  Even when I tried the Samsung Galaxy S Android version, I loved how rich the screen was.  The super AMOLED screen pops on blacks, reds, and blues espcially.  The focus S was so light that I was scared I would break it but once I put a case on it, the extra weight made it feel more comfortable.  another concern I had was syncing my music/movies/podcasts but with the Zune interface it's seamless.  All in all this phone has given me a better experience thatn my iphone or android ever has.  Ifyou are a long time Android/IOS user then you are robably hesitant but Windows phone 7 is worthy try and Samsug has really knocked this try out the park.
