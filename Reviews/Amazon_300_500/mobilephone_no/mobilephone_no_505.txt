OK, many things have been told abour Blu products, however after a LONG wait I've recieved my Vivo 4.3.I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SII, great phone, very useful, but due to business (I travel around the world very often) it's very important to me to have a dual simm phone for not to carry two phones.I looked for chinesse dual simm phones, but the most of them are cr@p, very cheap, but very low quality.Then I looked for a "branded" dual simm phone, and I found a Galaxy Y DUOS, good as all the samsung phones, however I needed more "power" in processor and a bigger screen, I use a lot the GPS and the screen and the processor of the Galaxy Y DUOS were a little "awful". I also use the phone for watching videos while traveling and the 240 x 320 pixels, 3.14 inches screen didn't help a lot.I found Blu company in one travel to Miami, I looked to their phones and I was about to buy the Blu Studio 5.3 but the reviews stoped me from doing that, the processor wasn't good and the screen resolution was not what you would spect from such a big phone.Then I read about the Vivo 4.3 specifications, and I really wanted to have one of them because the super amoled 4.3 480x800 screen, and the 1GHZ dual core processor.I recieved mine two weeks ago, and I'm really really happy with it, when unpacked is about the same size of the Samsung Galaxy SII, but lighter even with the battery installed, when turned on the screen responds fast and run the most of the apps almost inmediatly.I installed a 32 Gbytes micro SD and the phone went to its full potential.I downloaded Waze social navigator and NDrive GPS app and tested both, the response is FAST, just the way it should be when you are driving.Simm 1 carries the 3G, Simm 2 carries 2G only, so when I'm in my country (Mexico) my first simm is the local carrier (Telcel) when I'm abroad I switch the simm for the local carrier, I was in USA last week and used a H20 simm card for data and voice and worked as spected.Next week I'll go to Europe and I will try it with Movistar in Spain and Orange in France, I will let you know how it goes.What I didn't like was the horrible start screen, and the theme that Blu is using in the interface, I found it very anoying. However I installed SPB Mobile Shell and the experience was much much better.I'm strugling with the phone ring tones, but I'm sure I will find how to change them soon.I'm happy with the phone, so far I haven't found any thing that dislike me.My advice..... because of the price and the performance.... get your Vivo 4.3, you will not regret.,
