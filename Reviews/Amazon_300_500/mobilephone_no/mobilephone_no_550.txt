I had to put my review on item since it is a great phone and I recommend it to everyone... I purchased this phone when it came out at the begining of 09 and I still currently have it in use. The cell is very easy to navigate, it takes good pictures, videos and easy to use keyboard. The cell has a memory card slot so you can store your pictures, music, videos on the card instead of phone and it doesn't eat your battery life. Good loud volume for the ringtones and music. It is very though since it's been dropped several times and the phone still good, looks like new and in working conditions. The only downside of this phone is that the battery life won't last like the phone will but actually is not a downside when I have used the phone 24/7 (talking for hours and hours (more than 4 hours at a time), texting as well while talking, taking pictures and videos all the time; more that 800 contacts with addresses, email addresses stored in the phone, and a lot a lot of music like an ipod) and that battery lasted for 2 years. I tried to get the battery at the cell company but they wanted me to upgrade (saying that my phone was old and they had new ones) but most of the new phones have way less battery life that this one. Too bad the cell company stopped selling this specific phone because is the best basic phone I have owned and that is me owning a lot (more than 39) of cell phones through out the years. I bought a new battery for the cell and it's back to working like before, I recommend this cell to anyone, it's a greta buy for any age.
