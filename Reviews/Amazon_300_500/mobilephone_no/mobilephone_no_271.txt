I've used Nokia smartphones for awhile now starting with the E63. This is the first N series I have used. I also use a Google Nexus One and thought I would leave Nokia behind. I decided to replace my E72 (my work phone)with another hardware qwerty phone but AT&T; really didn't have a suitable replacement. Where I work, AT&T; has the strongest and most reliable signal. I was planning on waiting for the Nokia E7 but the price was a bit much. I took the plunge and ordered the N8 back in February thinking I could return it if I didn't like it. When I received the phone I was surprised at how good it looked. The press and blog photos don't do this phone justice, it is a sleek and handsome phone.The build quality puts most other phones to shame. Set up was straight forward and easy. I was up and running in minutes. I use Nokia's ovi service and synced my contacts and everything OTA. Nokia did a great job with symbian^3. It is fluid, fast and intuitive. There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to symbian but I experienced a similar learning curve with android. This is a big step up from symbian 1. The camera is great as the reviews have said. I thought I would miss the hardware keyboard but I found myself typing just as fast on the (according to the tech blogs) "substandard" on screen qwerty. I couldn't understand this because I struggled with the Nexus One even with swiftkey. The reason for this I think is that Nokia's touch screen is of a higher quality and thus more accurate than the N1.I installed swype and I love it. The only thing I miss (being a USA user) are local apps. No apps for programing my dvr etc. Nokia has released things like "Sleeping Screen" and other useful apps for this phone and a large UI upgrade is in store for summer. This phone has pushed aside my Nexus as my main phone.
