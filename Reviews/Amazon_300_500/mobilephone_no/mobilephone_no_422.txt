I NEVER write reviews but I feel that this phone is a bit better than everyone is saying so I will try and tell you guys everything I know/like/don't like about this phone. Ok to start I had an Optimus V and I HATED it kept doing crazy things and the keyboard situation aggravated me every time I used it. So I saw this cute little keyboard phone decided to give it a try and I could bring it back if I didn't like it. Now I was going to get the Optimus V slider but it was a bit expensive for me. So I will admit that the keyboard is a bit cramped even though I like the size I do push multiple buttons a lot but it doesn't bother me as much as the V did because it ALWAYS got the word wrong and this I just push the backspace key and type what I wanted to say. Also a con I found is that I can't see my email it says here is your email but a blank screen comes up which is a bit wierd but oh well i can use a computer for that I guess. But to be honest it looks just like the Optimus V, button and menu wise, must be the android so I really didn't notice a difference. I did notice some obvious PROS which are more memory ( hated the V for that), slightly faster when it comes to downloading stuff and of course the keyboard! I hate to say it but maybe just get it and try it out first because that is the only way to know if YOU like it because I did see 2 reviews about the phone before i bought it ( only 2 because it was brand new) and they both said it sucked but I was like well it is cute, $99, and has a keyboard lets try it lol. So that is really the only thing I can say is try it but I Love it so far and won't go back to the V anytime soon.
