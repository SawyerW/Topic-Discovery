I was excited when Nokia announced the E6 - I've been awaiting a worthy replacement for a my trusty E71 which, although it was served me very well, is getting long in the tooth. I read the reviews of the E72 and from what I could gather, it seemed to take a step back from the E71 in some ways. I thought for sure that Nokia would take the best from the E71 & E72 and create a great phone.All I can say is, they failed miserably. On paper this looks like a great phone, and the hardware is great (the screen is beautiful) but the interface is jerky, and the function hierarchy  is  ridiculously complex. The "Fully Customizable Home Screens" are only somewhat customizable (the three panels on the left are fixed).The worst part is the email - it hasn't taken a step back, it took a ride in Doc Brown's DeLorean back to 2003. I suppose it might work fine for folks with standard Exchange or web accounts, but I use different outgoing (SMTP) and incoming (IMAP) mail services and the Nokia software wants to assume that the account info is the same for  both accounts. If it's not, mail appears to be forwarded through Nokia's own SMTP servers, completely with mangling of the "from" addresses. To be honest, the E71 had the same quirk but I was at least able to work around that. Those work-arounds don't work with the E6.On the plus side, the social media (Twitter & Facebook) integration is pretty good, and the touch screen interface (with it's haptic feedback) seems to blend well with the keyboard. The battery seemed to go strong after messing around with it for a day. Also the free Maps program seems to be somewhat improved.But all in all, this was a big disappointment and it's going back. Maybe after a couple of firmware upgrades the phone will meet it's potential, but it's not there yet. As for me,  I'm stuck waiting to see if there will be a decent unlocked iPhone in the fall, otherwise I may be using my E71 for another year.
