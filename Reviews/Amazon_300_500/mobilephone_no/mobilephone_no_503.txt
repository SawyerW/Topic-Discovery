cell made in Korea, Assembled in Vietnam. It is something that has been mentioned on the phone. God knows where the phone comes from!!!!!!!!!!!!No matter where you buy the phone, you have no warranty and the seller just reply you 2 weeks after selling it to make sure you won't ask for a return/refund. the Phone is an international device, right but you must know that there is NO WARRANTY in any country, I paid more than 600$ for this phone assuming that it has 2 years warranty . now I have a problem with the phone and nobody is responsible,  I have contacted Samsung, but they told me that since I didn't buy it from an "authorized seller", they will not honor the warranty on this phone and told me ask the seller where the phone is from!!!!The seller easily ignores your emails because you already paid the money, so they don't care about you any more. I asked Amazon's customer services to send email to the seller but the seller ignored Amazon's emails as well. since I bought the phone more than 90 days ago, I cannot use Amazon's a-z guarantee.  I also blame amazon because I trusted Amazon and supposed that it is a reliable place to buy cell phone , while they don't even have a phone number from the seller and cannot do anything other than sending useless email to the seller who never replays , If I knew that the phone has no warranty, I wouldn't buy it at all.so DON'T waste your money on some thing that you don't know where it is from. If you do want to waste your money at least be aware of that.9-18-2013----------------------------------Update-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this phone for use 4G net, but unfortunately by Tmobile I cannot use 4G and I can just use 3G. I am so sad, be aware that this phone cannot provide 4G internet for you and even using google map will be a pain.
