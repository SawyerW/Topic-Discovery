This unlocked Samsung Galaxy S II phone does not function on the T-Mobile 4G network in the USA.This is an INTERNATIONAL phone made for the UK/Ireland market.  It supports Quadband GSM/GPRS/EDGE frequencies of 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz, only.  Unfortunately, T-Mobile offers only 2G service on any of those frequencies (850 MHz and 1900 MHz).T-Mobile uses UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ frequencies of 1700/2100 MHz for 4G, and for the future implementation of 4G-LTE (needing both frequencies for uplink and downlink).  This Samsung Galaxy S II does not support 1700/2100 MHz.  Therefore, this phone cannot operate on T-Mobile's current U.S. 4G network.So, while a T-Mobile SIM card does work in it, currently (as of April 28, 2012),  T-Mobile supports this phone at a maximum speed of only 2G.According to Wikipedia, "T-Mobile's LTE network will be rolled out on the AWS spectrum, and their HSPA+ network will transition to the PCS band, in order to achieve compatibility with other networks and phones in the USA."Regarding the 1700/2100 MHz speeds, Wikipedia states that T-Mobile is the "First carrier in the U.S. to deploy services on AWS frequencies. Markets HSPA+ as '4G.' Will be used for LTE in the near-future. UMTS frequency band IV".Further, regarding the 1900 MHz speed, Wikipedia states, "According to reports from users, T-Mobile started to use PCS for UMTS in some areas. Will be expanded during LTE upgrade. UMTS frequency band II."  Relatedly, Wikipedia also shows:  "Band II (W-CDMA 1900) in North America and South America (ITU Region 2)."  Band II (W-CDMA 1900) refers to 1900 MHz.So, hopefully in the future, if T-Mobile has any sense, this "flagship" Samsung phone will work worldwide at 1900 MHz at 4G speeds;  but currently it is stuck at 2G, maximum, when using T-Mobile in the USA.REPEAT:  This Samsung Galaxy S II does not currently work on the T-Mobile 4G network, in the United States!
