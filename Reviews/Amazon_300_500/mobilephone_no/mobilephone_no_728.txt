Well i love this phone since i picked it up last year and have had nothing but good things to say about it. Great high volume, especially on speaker phone, the drop down keyboard in the back is great, and just overall the whole phone is great. One thing i will nit pick about is the sliding back panel on the phone which will not stay on to save its life, i noticed i couldnt get it on(thinking it was me) back when i bought it. So it may be that, but i've lived with it all this time, so small potatoes. This phone has everything i need without all the extra crap. No fancy net or chat, just good texting, pic and other features to use. Net 10 service is ok if you don't TALK a lot, which i don't, just not a phone guy. Texts equal out about 5 cents which isn't bad at all, but if your not careful you can go over pretty quick. The only bad thing is when people call you(not knowing you have a prepaid phone) or you have something major to do like a service, or someone who puts you on hold, that will burn up your minutes faster than fire and dried leaves. On the plus side the minutes aren't that expensive, but then again you'd probably be better to get into some sort of contract deal if your a major texter or talker. I just refuse to though because of all the additional fees, and garbage you have to put up with in a contract, so i just pay what i pay, with no extra hassle. So this is the best of the Net 10 phones, who cares about androids, and Iphones etc, its a phone, i use it for talking or text. I already own two computers for everything else. They have gone to far with that junk!! Love this though, all i need.:d
