When I got home and logged on to MyVerizon website after activating my phone, I noticed that my contract had been extended for extra 2 years. I called Verizon's customer service and sorted things out but not before I mailed in (yes, by snail mail) a copy of my Amazon invoice and packaging to prove that I indeed bought a no-contract phone from Amazon. The customer agent told me that when their employee registered with the phone with Verizon, it showed up as a subsidized phone on the system (meaning that the vendor has already received a kickback from Verizon). I do not know whether this was true or the Verizon guy who activated my phone simply made some type of mistake while he was activating it. (To Verizon's credit, they not only undid my 2-year extension to my existing contract, they actually completely wiped off my contract (that had three more months left in it) and offered me a $50 upgrade credit and a waiver of my phone bill for one full month instead of the $30 upgrade that I had previously as part of new-every-two-years deal.) So, buyers beware, this particular product from Amazon may not be a no-contract phone as another reviewer has pointed out already. Please put a comment on this review if you have purchased a phone from this seller and was able to activate it without a problem (with no contract). This seller needs to be reported to Amazon if they are indeed selling subsidized phones disguised as no-contract phones.That said, the following is my original review of the product:=====================================================================I got my Pixi Plus about three weeks ago now and this is my very first webOS phone. It is very capable and does pretty much everything I need it to do. The Facebook integration is top notch, I browse the web, balance my checkbook, take quick memos, chat on Google Talk, manage my schedules, read and write e-mail, look up addresses on Google Maps, use online banking, watch Youtube videos, and play online chess occasionally. WebOS is simply amazing. At around $50 without contract for a very capable smartphone, there simply is no excuse to be buying a feature phone at this moment. I actually wanted a Pre 3 from HP and was going to use Pixi Plus as my interim smartphone and a primer to webOS, but I can definitely see myself using this device for a year or two without having to upgrade. Very happy with my purchase. Make sure you pick up a Touchstone or two and a Touchstone-enabled back cover as well. Oh, and instaling Preware and overclocking with UberKernel and Govnah will make the operation so much smoother.
