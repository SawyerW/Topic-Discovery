Product had some issues but nothing major..Display wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It is very crisp than any other phones but colors are not spectacular and seems washed out.I switched to Xperia SL to Xperia Arc and even Arc seems to have more accurate colors than SL.The phone feels very good but the overall build quality is just alright. Quite a lot of dirt might get into edges.I was quite worried about the embedded battery since it's amount isn't very much (1750mAh) to power dual core processor and HD display.However, sony did a good job of managing the better life quite well. It will last a full day use with normal usage[web browsing, txting and calling] w/ 50% brightness of the screen.Snapdragon S3 1.7ghz dual core processor is quite outdated(2011) but the phone itself is pretty fast.However, the phone has stopped and been non-responsive unexpectedly twice already and it was pretty frustrated since it's battery is embedded.I don't know what's the deal with unexpected stop and it happens when i watch youtube videos.. hopefully sony will fix this problem by software update or something.Navigation touch buttons on the bottom of the phone is not really responsive and you kind of have to figure out where the touch sensor is and then once your fingers get used to it, its no problem.The camera takes little bit longer to capture and focus than such phones that has Snapdragon S4, S4pro, Nvidia Tegra3, Exynos 4412 Quad, A6 processors. (Ex. IPhone5, Galaxy S3, HTC OneX, LG Optimus G)But the quality of the picture is comparable to any other phones.Lastly, Design of the phone is the best out of all the other phones in current market right now.Transparent bar at the bottom makes the phone look distinctive and unique. It's square and arc mixture of design makes it look very sharp, clean, and makes comfortable in your hand.I would give this phone 3 and a half stars cuz of it's overall build quality and price but since there arnt any option for half star and I'm a sony fan so.. yeah:]If you are a sony fan and care about the design the most then this is it.Pros.-Unique & distinctive design-Matt finish and rounded arc design makes not slippery and comfortable in your hand.-Camera-Battery life-Clear and loud speaker-High density pixels(342ppi) HD displayCons.-Colors of the display is not as accurate and seems to be washed out.-Unexpected stop issues-Non-responsive navigation touch sensor.
