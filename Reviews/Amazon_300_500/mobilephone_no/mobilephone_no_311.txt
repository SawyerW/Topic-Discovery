I've been complimented several times on the photo quality for pictures taken with this phone but the most impressive thing is the video quality, the N8 shoots 720p (that's HD people!).  I then was able to connect my N8 to my Panasonic Plasma TV to show off my HD videos to family and friends.  This was done using the HDMI adapter (comes included with the N8) and a regular HDMI cable I purchased from Amazon.The application I use most is ovi Maps, the free Nokia tool that turns your phone into a GPS receiver.  That has rescued me several times already when driving (or walking) around in unknown places.Other applications I use on the N8:  gmail, ebookreader (currently reading "A Tale of Two Cities", my first e-book), angry birds.  Some applications come with the phone, some you have to download and from these, some are free, and some are not.Other features I use from the phone are wi-fi and 3G for internet connectivity, both work seamlessly.I've had a lot of fun with the N8 since I got it on early November of 2010 (that's about 3 months ago).My previous smartphone had a slide-out keyboard and that's just about the only thing I miss (and just a little bit) from my old phone.The operating system on this phone is Symbian^3, which came out in 2010, so the applications developed for Symbian^3 may not yet be many, but so far this hasn't been an issue for me at all.I also got the Nokia CC-1005 silicone cover for my phone, it's hard to find, but it fits great, protects the phone from scratches and falls and makes the phone look cooler (according to my niece).Oh, and I almost forgot, I can also make and receive calls with the N8, call quality is excellent.Liking the N8 is what motivated me to write this review, I hope it is useful to you.
