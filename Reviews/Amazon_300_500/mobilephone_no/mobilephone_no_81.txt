I have used quite a few Pre-Paid phones before and i have to say that the i855 is the best for the price.This phone doesn't play Mp3's and it can't record or playback videos but it does take pictures.The i855 isn't jam packed with all the entertainment features of the more expensive phones but what it does,it does very well.The i855 has nation wide Boost Walkie Talkie which allows you to talk to any Boost Mobile or Nextel customers for only $1.00 a day.There is a web browser that loads pages pretty quickly and lets you view most mobile web content without any problems.This phones web browser is a bit better than earlier Boost Mobile phones.It also has Multimedia messaging which means you can send & receive Picture,Text and voice messages.This phone is Java enabled which lets you play the latest 3D games and use applications like Gps navigation.The call quality is very good and the external speaker is clear and loud so you can hear it even in a noisy area.The screen is a bit larger than older Boost Mobile phones and it's very bright,clear and colorful which makes it great for playing games.It has a clamshell desighn and also has an external blue LED display that lets you see who is calling before you answer it.There is a "Smart button" on the top of the phone that lets you connect to the last person you talked to quickly which works very well with the Walkie Talkie function.You don't even need to open the phone to use the Walkie Talkie,just press the "Smart Button" and you will see the persons name on the external display,then press the PTT button and you are instantly connected.Just talk into the external mic while holding the PTT button and you don't even need to open the phone!Very nice feature.I like the i855 very much but i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason.When i first got the phone i noticed that all the Java apps didn't work at all.Even the Java download apps didn't work which meant i couldn't even download games or other applications over the air.I had to buy a USB cable,hook the phone up to my PC and re-install the Java download app.You can find this iDEN Download Apps Utility on the Motorola Website.I must say that if you are using Windows Vista you will need to run this app in Windows XP Service Pack 2 mode to get it to recognise your i855.Otherwise you will get an error message.After fixing the Java issue i couldn't be happier with this phone.If you are looking for a well made pay as you go cell phone that doesn't cost a ton of cash,get the Boost Mobile i855.
