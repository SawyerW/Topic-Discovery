I'll echo the two previous reviews.  I love the clarity and brightness of the screen, and the many thoughtful features.  It takes a while to get used to the tiny keys which are harder to use than the Blackberry or Treo products, but eventually quite usable.  The scroll wheel is a big help and the back key really helps, once you figure out where it's likely to take you.  The menus are NOT as user intuitive as they could be, however, and I hope they'll revise them in a future iteration/upgrade.  They could have given more interesting choices in the included ringtones.  One fabulously annoying thing: the LOUD whooshing sound they included for the "turn on" and an equally noxious sound for the "turn off" of the device.  And all the other sounds can be changed or muted or added to, but not these.  You just can't get rid of them and that makes it astoundingly embarrassing when trying to turn your phone off at a meeting or in a conference.  This was simply stupid designing by some committee somewhere.All in all, the best sound quality of any phone I've yet had; a great form factor which is easy to hold and deal with, and easy to use synching with Outlook --- if you have just your own computer to deal with.  When dealing with Microsoft Exchange Server -- you're out of luck unless you have a great IT tech (as we do) who after an hour of fiddling, found a document by googling that gave a work-around so we could synch with our Outlook, Calendar, etc.  However, it will only synch with your 'personal' calendar and since we've got a company wide calendar and a personal, it would be helpful if one could synch with two calendars as some phone/pda's can currently do.I recommend the phone most highly.
