I have owned my W175 for at least ten years. It is my first cell phone. ( I since have added a tracfone LG840g but I will return to this ) I never tried to use this w175 for a hammer, but the durability of it is real good. But here is the point: mine still charges me by the second, not the next full minute. ( the 840 ; next full; w175 -2x minutes; 840-3x minutes. )I buy the cheapest card and at 2x we are talking 6 cents per minute. Keep the thing loaded. I have 4899 days and have let it slip to 10 minutes. Panic and get my hands on a card.Buy a new one and the by-the-second- option  is likely not your option. Want a good loyal companion? This is a very good bet.You can text with this but it takes one half ( 1 /2 ) minute per so I generally do not. Given the durability, you might buy a "Double Minute" card or shop around for one that is set up that way. I did buy a back-up battery and charger from amazon at one point. cost about ten bucks. There are a few things in addition that can be done with this phone but I do not frankly use them.And my second cell is tracfone. Tracfone lets you carry over minutes. That should tell you something as well. I am in no way benefitting from this review, no affiliation to tracfone, and I could use a job. Do your homeowork.And the 840 ? I am glad I bought it. $20.00 at Dollar General, on sale, I had done my homework and amazon is a place for that. And I am not affiliated with amazon and I could still use a job. Once I learn how to use this new one I will like it better.I will keep using my 175 until it gets ripped from my cold dead hand.
