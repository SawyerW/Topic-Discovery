I have had this phone since November and have twice now had to switch back to my Samsung Galaxy Fascinate.  First off the phone has ultra poor battery life.  I am not a heavy user of this device.  I use it mainly for a phone and occasional internet use.  No watching movies or downloading music.  If I charge the phone over night and don't use it at all I will be at 78% by 11am.  I have been in to Verizon multiple times and all they want to do is have me buy an $80 emergency charger.  Sorry Verizon, I just paid $200 plus insurance and extended my contract for another two years with you giving you over $3600 of my hard earned money and you want to charge me $80 for a charger.  No Thanks!  AND....  This phone doesn't even let me make calls.  It continually drops calls before the other party answers.  No rhyme or reason to this.  It happens at home and away from home and I do not live out in the boonies either.  Words can not express my disappointment in this phone.  I had my first one replaced in less than a week because it wasn't updating and locking up 3-4 times a day and I had to remove the battery to get it to restart.  After hours on the tech support line with Verizon they told me just to go back to the store and get a replacement.  Thankfully my replacement doesn't lock up but the battery life and inability to make outgoing calls make this phone completely useless.  I called Samsung and after going thru a battery of questions they are having me send it back for testing.  Still waiting on them to email me the shipping label.  Lucky for me I didn't get rid of my very reliable Fascinate.
