I intended to replace both mine and my wife's aging i90c phones with i730.Purchasing and delivery was OK directly from Nextel but then the fun began.First impression: Cheezy, cheap looking flimsy construction. Battery cover thin sheet of Al, difficult to open and close, data/charger socket covered with a rubber piece which is difficult to open and gets on the way of the plug. Very annoying...Initial Setup: This is where it started getting awkward. I charged both phones overnight and unplugged both of them next morning. They were both fully charged. During the charge, they display "Device Attached" sign. When it was first turned on, searched for the service but since they were not activated, couldn't find the service but dismissing the tab shaped logo covering entire display took some effort to figure out to be able to change settings etc.One of the phones completely drained in less than six hours with no use what so ever. I plugged in to recharge but phone starting it's funky light dance and finally after several plug/unplugs recognized the charger. Called the tech support, they said it was faulty. In order to get the replacement, I had to be charged for the replacement, call the finance office of Nextel to dispute the charge once I send in the non-working one. Otherwise it takes two months credit to be given back to my account. That's more than annoying!!!Then next day, when I was ready to activate my wife's phone (once she came back from out of town), I discovered that that phone went crazy as well. Dancing lights and turnig on/off by itself and finally "Incompatible device" sign for the charger.That was it for me. I decided to return both and be over with it. It is going to be a painfull experience to sort out billing problems I fear.Overall, i730 fells like, looks like and acts like a cheap version of i90c with color screen and shinny skin! I pass....
