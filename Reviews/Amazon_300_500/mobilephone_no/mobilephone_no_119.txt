I got this thing to replace a perviously broken razor.  The phone works great, camera is great (although NO FLASH) and the accessories all are great.  Would not recommend specifically for the music and video players, but overall a good phone.UPDATE:I had to drop the rating for this phone, as after only owning it for 4 months I've noticed some problems.  The memory stick I put in there (standard mini card) sometimes is lost in the phone.  So when I go to take pictures or videos, it will say that it has an "error reading memory."  So then I am forced to use my phone memory.  The video quality is not very good at all.  The USB cable connection, as well as the programs which the phone uses, are extremely slow so what I did was when I wanted to upload something, I took the back cover off and threw the memory stick into my computer (when the memory stick worked on the phone).  This caused the back cover to become so lose that I must use tape to keep it on.  I only took the back off maybe a max of 10 times, so this should not have caused the back to wear out so quick.The alarms are fishy now, me and my wife set alarms for each other and hers are usually earlier.  For some reason when I have an earlier alarm set for her, it disables mine.  Even though they are still clearly ON, they simply do not go off.The battery life is aweful as well.  Texting and calling are ok, but messing with the applications a couple times through the day will make the battery last one day.Overall the phone is not absolutely horrible, but it definitely is not good either.It is also a HUGE pain that the headphone connector is not a normal 8mm jack!  The LG headphones are crap, and whatever kind of weird jack they use wears out way too quickly.
