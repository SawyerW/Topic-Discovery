I've heard about this handset for months before I really went for it. Two weeks ago I bought it from Telus with special data plan promotion (C$15 per month for unlimited emails and web browsing). After 7 days I returned it to the vendor and replaced with a Blackberry Curve.Telus' Diamond Touch is a sister model of the "real" Diamond. It was called "Victor" in Asia. Most of the hardware and softwares are the same but "Victor" doesn't have a diamond back, which is the reason why it is called Diamond.I've been a Blackberry user for two years. I also own an Apple iPod Touch (1st generation) for a year. They are good comparison to the Diamond.After receiving this tiny sexy Diamond Touch, I couldn't stop playing with it for the whole night. However, the touch screen was far from good as the iPod Touch, which is identical to my colleague's iPhone. The touch screen of Diamond was annoying to control. The web browser virtually didn't work. I touched the links of webpage but it couldn't go through, no matter I used my finger tip or the stylus. I read the user manuel to find out if I've done anything wrong. No, it just doesn't work. iPod Touch is much better in web browsing experience.The email function is okay, and of course far as good as the Blackberry. The Contact and Calendar are also hard to use. I should blame Windows Mobile for it, not HTC.Eventually, I hit the trigger to return this handset. It's input stuck on number mode. I couldn't make it back to ABC mode, until doing a hard reset and gave up all my data.I have gotten the Blackberry Curve for 4 days and very happy with it. If you want a fancy toy with powerful multimedia and web browing, get the iphone. If you use your handset a lot to talk and receive/reply emails, get a Blackberry.
