I tend to be abusive to my cell phones and I must say that this Sanyo 8100 has seen the worst. It has been dropped in the mud, skidded across asphalt parking lots I don't know how many times, been subjected to rain.....you get the idea.  I was at film school when I first purchased it and it is still wokring great 3 years later.  I did buy an additional battiery up front, so they have been swapped on and off as I needed more talk time.  The screen is still bright and clear, I love being able to set ringtones for certain callers, and I won't ever get another phone that doesn't have the photo caller ID on the outside.  This is great because I can just glance at a photo and see who's calling.I have the Sprint Vision plan and while I don't access the internet on a daily basis, it works well when needed.  I like being able to subscribe to the Weather Channal and looking up weather radar when out in the woods.  Gaming is okay for those moments when you're stuck waiting.  My only gripe is that to retrieve SMS messages (called Short Mail) it s a two step process, rather than them just showing up on your screen.All in all, I have been very happy with my Sanyo phone and will likely stick with Sanyo in the future.  And Sprint has been reasonably good to work with.  They have service in remote areas and I rarely have dropped calls which seem to plague my T-Mobile friends.  Just be sure to check the latest plans from time to time.  I've been paying too much for what I get and need to switch.  Just remember they reset your contract when you do so, but that isn't a problem with me because I like their service.A happy Sanyo user.
