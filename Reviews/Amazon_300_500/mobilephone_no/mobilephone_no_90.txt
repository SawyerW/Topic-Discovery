Let us hit the drawbacks first in case any of these are deal breakers...*  Perennial S/E complaints - non standard headphone setup and usage of M2 memory*  Keyboard a tad cramped*  Decent but not stellar RF performance*  No wifi*  No GPS*  Broken for Gmail java applet*  Battery life problematical if you push the phoneOnce you get past these there are some outstanding points*  Supplied unlocked and unbranded*  Excellent display*  Excellent keyboard*  Excellent build quality*  Excellent camera cover*  Good enough camera resolution*  3G bands compatible with AT&T;A number of features shared in common with other modern unbranded / debranded SE phones are*  Java capable of backgrounding several apps*  Ability to load and use a number of Java apps, like Opera Mini*  Ability to sync contacts and mail (for example with Gmail)*  Superb mail tool, usable with servers supporting POP3, IMAP, and IMAP idle*  Excellent music playerOf all the drawbacks, the most annoying one to me is the issue with Gmail applet.  I have used a half dozen S/E models starting with W810i, and this is the first time I have seen the issue. Considering that all the other phones work well, I think this is an S/E issue.  You can get gmail on the phone if you want but you cannot easily select an addressee.  The stock mail client is arguably better than Gmail applet as it will use phone book contacts and is capable of handling attachments as well as receiving push mail.  With this mail tool you can do all the "text" and MMS you want via email and using only a data plan for "dumb" phones.Some practices that will sink your battery are watching youtubes and setting up push synchronization plus of course running a bunch of apps backgrounded.  You can of course sync on demand or not at all.  I would like to find and buy a dongle that supports charging plus usage of hands free head set at same time.All in all, I would rate this phone 4 out of 5.  At under $200, I am pleased, very pleased with it.  I declare the C510a a worthy replacement for the renowned W810.
