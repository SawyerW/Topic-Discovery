I own this product for about 2 months. I am quite happy with this phone. Yes, I love Sony and I always support them. This phone is battle tested during my 2 tours to China)DESIGN&ERGONOMICS;:This phone has distinctive design and it's not Iphone that everybody around you has. Xperia S lies perfectly in hand, it's easier to hold than Iphone 4S or Samsung Galaxy S2. This phone is good for mens hands. This phone uses Micro SIM only. Comes with preinstalled screen protector.SOUND QUALITY, DISPLAY, CAMERA:Great sound quality for calls, nice selection of ringtones (some of them are very unusual). Display is also topnotch. Colors look more natural than on Iphone 4S and Galaxy S2. Camera makes good shots during outdoor sessions but a bit noiser in low light conditions. Still it's very good camera. I used this phone once to shoot a rock show, results were far from perfect. Sound was very messy.ANDROID APPS, GMAIL, SOCIAL NETWORKINGThere are plenty of apps for this phone. I have downloaded Amazon mobile which works perfectly. Also I have some other apps - Topface, Russian "Vkontakte" app and others. Gmail is very well made - it's easy to compose a letter, you can search thru your e-mails. My only gripe is about calculator - there are no M+, M- and MR buttons, which are very useful. Shame on you Sony! Anyway you can download free calculator from Google Play. Social networking is very convinient. I have even downloaded one game - "Wind-up Knight" which looks good and fun to play.BATTERY LIFE:I have never ran out of the juice completely but I can tell that usage of photo camera and Wi-Fi takes a lot of power. I am not big fan of smartphone gaming (I have PS Vita for gaming) that's why I can't comment on power consumption in games. All in all you can use it up to 3 days without recharging if you don't use much of Wi-Fi and camera.Another solid effort from Sony. Get well guys!)
