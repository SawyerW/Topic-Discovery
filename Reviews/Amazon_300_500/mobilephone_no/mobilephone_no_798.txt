I bought this phone because it was less than $200 unlocked. Unfortunately i did not investigate to find out that it does not support AT&T;'s 3G network. The R800a does but this is the R800i. Anyway, i like the phone (and especially Android) so much i have abandoned my iPhone 4. it does need some memory management, but it is truly unlocked. I can do everything i want with the phone and do not even see a need to root it right now. The playstation games are ok, nothing special and the joysticks (touchpads) are kind of weird. i prefer the d-pad. not many games work with it and to be honest i rarely slide it open. Now that i like android, ill be looking for a faster phone (dual core, 1G RAM or higher, and some other nice features). The screen is dim (everyone notices this) and it is hard to see in sunlight. The speakers are AMAZING. speaker phone is the best i have heard so far on a phone and playing music sounds like it is coming from a laptop with a nice soundcard. Just got update today for Android 2.3.3. The experience with Sony Ericcson PC Companion was not the greatest but it was bearable. I am glad to be off iTunes and the frequent jailbreaking (including app searchingn in Cydia). If you get an android consider Chomp Sms and Swype. These two programs will keep me an Android customer. The responsiveness of the Play is quick but i have noticed some lag, which seems to come from specific apps. I stopped using those apps and the lag/screen-freezing went away. Overall this is a nice phone but not worth anymore than $400. also, make sure this phone is supported by your carrier. I am currently running on AT&T;'s Edge network because i failed to pay attention to the product info. Oh, and the battery life is pretty decent. I am a frequent user and my battery typically lasts a full day at work and may even carry me a full day without needing a charge.
