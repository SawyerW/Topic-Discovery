Sometime ago I got fed up with my iphone 3g, especially with the fact that Apple let me upgrade the system to iOS 4, which was too heavy for the phone and made it quite slow and almost a paper weight. Another reason was the lack of a file system sort of thing, to have direct access to my files. To top it off, this messy and buggy change from Mobile Me to iCloud did it for me.Then I got a Samsung Galaxy tab 8.9 that I am very, very happy with, and which I find much better than the ipad, so I wanted a simple android phone to go along with it, and decided for the Galaxy Ace.However, I am quite frustrated with the Galaxy Ace.Primarily, the battery just sucks. The phone doesn't last a whole day if I check the web sporadically, and doesn't last half a day if I am traveling and need to use a little bit of GPS, Navigation, and internet. That is basically the main thing!Another big thing is the display, which is also very bad and hard to see if I am outdoors in a bright day.There are also a few minor things I miss from my iphone (when it was working properly), like a better Mail software, a hard button to mute it, and a lock screen in which I could still easily see the time. The App Store by Apple is still much more reliable and the iphone apps are much better looking and don't have the amateur feeling like many android apps have.However, there are a number of things that I like about android, though, and overall I don't miss Apple, but it needs a better phone to make it worth it.I just ordered a Samsung Galaxy S and I hope it will be significantly better.
