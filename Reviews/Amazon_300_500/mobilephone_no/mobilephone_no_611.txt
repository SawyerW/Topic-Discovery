I have had this phone for a little over a month now and it has worked great. Here are the highlights:Pros:-Slim design for a PDA style phone. I carry it in my front pocket along with my wallet and it doesn't seem any more bulky than my old flip phone.-Windows Mobile OS... so far so good. I synced up wirelessly to my Outlook acct. within minutes of starting the phone up. It actually receives email faster than my computer does (I also set it to sync in non work hours so it doesn't buzz all day long while I am at the computer). Excel files and PDF's open up with ease. I also set up Yahoo Messenger which I use for work within minutes.-Buttons are fairly easy to hit and the scroll wheel works great (also works as a select button when depressed).-Clear Display.-Comes with extended battery (which I have yet to use but appreciate having)-Google Maps works really well but only if you DOWNLOAD it (a must).-Fast downloads.Cons:-Unlocking the phone is a chore... Power button on top...then soft key...then star. Not very one-hand friendly.-Camera... 1.3MP of poor photography-Searching for contacts. If you search for a name beginning with "M" it pulls up every contact with an "M" in the name. Why can't it just take me to the people's names that begin with "M"?-Some webpages are hard to navigate.I have not really used the media player nor tried it with a bluetooth headset so I can not speak to those features.The bottom line is I am happy with the phone and would recommend it. I wanted a phone that would sync up to my work email, open microsoft office attachments and run Yahoo Messenger. The Blackjack is a great business workhorse and performs all of the functions I need very well.
