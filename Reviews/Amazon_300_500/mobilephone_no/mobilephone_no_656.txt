I've had my E71 for about a month and I'm just thrilled with it. I've owned many smartphones and most recently tried an iphone. I loved the ipod features of the iphone- easy sync with itunes, big screen for videos, etc., but found it not the best for my business and communication needs. And I really never got the hang of the soft keyboard. Even after several months of use, I kept making many typing errors. The first thing that struck me about the E71 when I saw it in a store was how beautifully designed it was. However, when I found out it was a Symbian phone, I was a bit leary as my past experience with that os was not at all positive. However, after reading a few reviews I decided to give it a go and I couldn't be happier. It's a great email device. I have it set up to sync my work exchange account for email and PIM info and I'm using Nokia's free (for now anyway) push email client to get my .mac account pushed to the E71. The phone is really fast responsive and the keyboard is lovely. Unlike the iphone, I can type quickly and accurately. There are many other great features, including Nokia sync to itunes on my mac, GPS, loads of 3rd party software like audibleplayer for ebooks, 3g tethering to my laptop using the joiku hotspot software.One negative is the Wifi. Sometimes it works great, but other times it is very tempremental and just won't connect. The only other negative I can think of came from a friend who also bought an E71. He has trouble reading small type and was used to the font adjustment feature on his BB Curve. There is no way to enlarge the fonts on the E71 and they can be a bit small for some. Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone.
