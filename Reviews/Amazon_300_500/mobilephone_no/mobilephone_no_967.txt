I bought this phone because I needed an Android phone and didn't feel like spending $500 for one. It's a great little phone with decent everything, amazing standby battery life (advertised between 500-700 hours, I've seen several days standby time on the thing), and dual sim capability. It has a hardware based FM radio too!I found that tech support for the wireless providers don't currently have this phone in their database for compatibility information, so the tech specs are something you should keep in mind when thinking about service.The technical specs are a bit dubious listed above.. the phone is rated and supports GSM850, GSM1900, WCDMA Band V 850MHz, and WCDMA Band II 1900MHz according to the FCC information about it.The frequency allocations this phone runs on means it is perfect for worldly travel, but has problems within the US currently. AT&T; supports both GSM 2G and HSPA+ 3G on both 850 and 1900, however T-Mobile is just starting to modernize their equipment for the global bands (they used 1700 MHz for WCDMA HSPA, which is very foreign) by enabling HSPA service on the 1900 frequency.What all this means is that currently, T-Mobile offers lots of GSM EDGE 2G data everywhere on 1900 MHz, but not HSPA speeds unless you're lucky enough to live in a refarmed area. AT&T; doesn't have this problem.The backplate of the phone feels rubbery and solid, but the phone as a whole is surprisingly very light. The included onscreen keyboard really fails at spell checking anything, and the phone comes preloaded with GO Launcher EX, King Office, and some other apps that cannot be removed. This was one of the largest complaints I had, because the limited space made me want to switch to apps that I know took less space and performed better, but I couldn't because internal memory and RAM are very small.I quickly noticed that many Google apps are listed as incompatible with this phone in the marketplace, but sideloading them quickly fixed the problem with no issue.Overall, it's a cheap $100 android phone that does what it's designed to do. I can't complain, really...
