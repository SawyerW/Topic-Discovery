I won't attend to reviewing Cingular or Amazon here. I'd simply been through my second razr and asked if Cingular warranty services could send me a different phone that would actually last. They offered this as a replacement.In regards to the razrs: I finally realized the phone is form over function. The first lost most or all reception - its replacement had a problem with the buttons (a common problem I've read - the metal template for the buttons is great at first but 'sticks' or malfunctions eventually).Within an hour of getting this phone in the mail, I had the SIM card installed, and it asked me if I'd like to transfer all the contact information to the new phone. Well, yes, thanks for asking! How simple is that... Also had the phone connected to my computer via bluetooth and transferred all my Outlook contacts to the phone. Took a few test pictures, a test video (with sound!), transferred files between computer and phone... including MP3 songs that will play via speakerphone (not so great) or included headphones (w/ jack to use only on this phone). Within that hour I was convinced I made a great choice, and 3 days later I'm still a happy camper.I've not yet tried my bluetooth hands-free with this phone yet.This isn't the smartest of smartphones, but I don't need something as complicated as a treo or blackberry. The 6682 comes with a program to view office documents, web browser (Opera), and more. If the browser and email program work as well as everything else, those that use the programs will be more than satisfied. I personally won't need this connected to the internet.Reception seems better than anything else I've owned. Phone is  very well-built (like most Nokia's, I've heard).I'm very satisfied thus far. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
