When I ordered this phone it was about a 160-170, which was a sweet price for this phone. This phone is my first android phone, I love it, its not perfect, but it does get the job done.It comes with froyo 2.2.2, comes with 2gb and adapter, screen protector is already applied. so no need to purchase a second oneMy major negative about this phone was that the keypad for texting is too small, in vertical or horizontal mode. Listen, I don't have big hands, so when my txts come in as "so.mmmmmmwww" instead of "some" it can be frustrating at times.My gf has an android as well, and her keyboard is well spaced out. Her Phone is a little bit bigger, but still..LG could have added a few cm to the thingThere are unlimited possibilities to this phone. You can root it and overclock it, and even update it to froyo2.3(must be knowledge about hacks and rooting of course)Its only a 600mhz processor, but if you overclock it, you can get it to at least 800mhzBattery lasts a long time. I've tried it with 2g on all day, it drains a little faster, Wifi is a drainer, so if you're not using it, please turn it off. According to the settings, Wifi takes 4% of battery power. That's doesn't seem alot, but when you're browsing and playing with your phone+the 4% your batt will die quicker. This goes the same with 2g, if you're not using it, I suggest you turn it off.Without any internet networks connected, it lasted about if I had to guestimate, ballpark a day and a half.I recommend buying the otterbox LG optimus commuter case, and buying it from amazon. Despite otterbox's claim saying it does not fit this model(optimus 1 is optimus T in america) it fits like a beaut! And its cheaper on here than the otterbox site. Tough reliable case for your!
