I received this phone from my carrier as a warranty replacement for the Motorola Atrix I originally purchased after the Atrix's screen froze.  The Impulse is a pretty terrible phone all around.  The processor is very weak, so simple tasks like sending text messages become frustrating.  It's fairly common for me to be typing two or three words ahead of the phone because it's lagging to catch up.  Games that require quick reactions or moderate amounts of memory are unplayable.  Touch screen sensitivity is poor.  It often does not recognize where you are touching or sometimes does not recognize touches at all.  Recalibrating does not help.  Camera is borderline unusable.  It will only take pictures in excellent lighting with no motion, and often times even these are blurry/grainy.  Auto white balance makes every picture come out grey or yellow, and manual white balance is often worse.  Yes, it has a flash.  The flash actually makes most pictures worse.The worst thing about this phone is that it often doesn't recognize my SIM card as being valid.  This is easily corrected by restarting the phone.  Unfortunately, there is no warning when it stops recognizing the card.  It just turns the phone onto airline mode and says "emergency calls only".  You will not be able to make or receive any calls/texts/notifications while it is in this mode.  My phone was doing this daily when my wife was 9 months pregnant and there would be times where I wouldn't notice for an hour or more that I haven't been able to receive calls from her or the hospital.Just stay away from this phone.  I love the Android platform, but are so many better phones at similar prices.  Even a previous generation model from Motorola, Samsung or HTC will be more advanced than a Huawei Impulse.
