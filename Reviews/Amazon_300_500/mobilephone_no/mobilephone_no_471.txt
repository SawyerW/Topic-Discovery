This phone initially had great reviews- however, having owned this phone for over a year, I can say it is the worst phone I have ever owned in my history of owning cell phones (which includes the old-timey flip phones). The reception is worse than terrible. What has frequently happened is that while calling, indoors or outdoors, if i accidentally cover any of the tiny holes on the back of the phone, the person on the end can no longer comprehend what i'm saying. When I change my finger placement it then improves.  The speakers on the phone, no matter who i am talking to, are also horrendous. Even if the reception is fair, the speakers render your voice incomprehensible.The battery life has become extremely poor. Without doing anything but sitting on the counter, it will run down to half life and require recharging.The docking station has failed on and off as a speaker.  I am not aware of its current functionality as a speaker - i refuse, after already having had to replace the phone within the first 6-8 months, to waste more time on it.  The docking station recently failed altogether even as a phone charger. I switched to charging by plugging in manually, and ended up cutting off the plug that covers the phone's charging port b/c you really have to have a pry tool or long, strong fingernail to get that open. The plug is designed to snap shut automatically, so cutting it off was the best and only solution to dealing with it.The battery is not removable, so if you ever get stuck and have to do a reboot, you have to memorize a the key sequence that will restart it, you cannot simply pull the battery.Everybody i call regularly hates this phone and is incessantly bugging me to change it due to its lack of reliability - ie, horrible reception, anytime I need to make a call.  If I were stuck in an emergency somewhere, this is definitely not the phone I would want to have with me.
