This is my first smart phone, didn't know what to expect even after reading reviews, after setting up on Page Plus I couldn't figure what is so smart about it. There is no voice record on the phone (I like to have my nephew and niece sing and turn to ring tones) you can hook it up to PC and do it but that was on the first dumb phone I ever had. No back cursor for correction you have to tap and it can be hard to tap the spot. I like the feel of the phone the numbers are small but not a real problem the battery life is one day. I keep data off except for checking for pictures or sounds in texts,and set to be off when phone is in sleep mode. There are no notifications of Picture or voice text with data off. Some of the phone genius should come up with apps for these little things (that really aggravate me for some reason.) Everything that works on the phone works well so far, I have a lot to learn. Palm help is available on the phone and they do a great job with  "Live chat" bet they get to know me. I am still torn if I want to keep this or go back to a feature phone type. I would recommend this phone for people that know more of what they can make it do. So many of the apps are for the 2.1 (or what ever the number is  and not for 1.4? It has tried to freeze up a couple of times but came out OK. I guess if someone was learning on it it would have a chance or freezing up....lol.I do like the rubber feel back makes it feel safer in my hand, and the touch screen is easy maybe to sensitive. I want to love this phone in time maybe I will. Now to say a word about buying on here some sellers will raise and lower the price daily I had it in my cart to think about it and the price went up then when I went ahead and bought it that day the price came back down. Be aware of sellers, read their feedback, the phone did appear to be new as stated.
