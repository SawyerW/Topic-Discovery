I've had this phone for over a year now.  When I first got it, I loved it!  I wanted the qwerty keyboard, and going from a 'regular' cell phone without the keyboard to this, was fabulous!  In the beginning, it was easy to text (compared to the 'other' way), but I started to realize it was missing letters in the texts.  For example; I would type 'momma' and it would type 'oma'.  So you have to go back and add the missing letters.  Sometimes when you go back and type the absent letters, it would type two letters in its place, seeming like they were in the queue from the last time it was pressed.  Now, instead of being 'oma' it would be 'mmmoma'.As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, sometimes the text messages don't send (or receive) without turning the phone off and back on.  This is certainly an inconvenience, especially if you don't know you were receiving a text.  When you turn the phone back on, it takes a few minutes to find data again.One disappointment is the locking/unlocking button on the right side of the phone.  The placement of this button is really an annoyance.  When you try unlocking it with one hand and as you're holding it, trying to push the button, the screen starts sliding toward the button.  This makes the button go underneath the screen and you have to grab it with the other hand to slide it back together.  This is something you can get used to and master but still a major aggravation in the beginning.  Not to mention when other people need to use your phone and try unlocking it.The lack of apps is another disappointment.  I know this isn't a smart phone and if it is supposed to be, it is clearly lacking in apps and ability to handle data.  If you are looking at this phone for texting or as a cheaper way of having a 'smart phone', I suggest looking at another brand and/or model.  I do  caution on the Samsung brand 'keyboards' though.  With the three samsung phones I've had, the qwerty keyboards all skip or double letters when typing.
