TAKE HEED OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, DON'T SAY "OH MAYBE MINE WILL BE DIFFERENT." RUN! JUST GOT THIS PHONE A FEW DAYS AGO, SCREEN IS ALREADY FREEZING! IT CAME WITH A SIM IN IT WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN USE THE INTERNET OR DO ANYTHING ON IT BECAUSE IF I PUT MY OWN PERSONAL SIM IN IT, THE SCREEN LOCKS AND I HAVE TO ENTER A CODE. IT SAYS UNLOCKED IN THE TITLE (IF THE SELLER HASN'T CHANGED IT ALREADY) BUT IT ACTUALLY ISN'T. I EVEN MESSAGED THEM AND ASKED IF IT'S REALLY UNLOCKED BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AND THEY SAID YES. LIARS! I'M IN THE BAHAMAS AND SHIPPING COMPANIES GIVES US A HASSLE TO SHIP THINGS BACK. SELLER REFUSED TO PAY TO HAVE THE PHONE UNLOCKED OR REFUND ME SOME OF THE MONEY OR WHAT IT WOULD COST TO UNLOCK IT ALTHOUGH I SAID I WOULD FAX THEM A RECEIPT. THEY KNEW THIS PHONE WAS UNLOCKED AND WILLING SOLD IT TO ME! NOW I HAVE TO USE ONE OF THOSE ONLINE SITES THAT UNLOCKS PHONES OR GO TO A LOCAL STORE AND PAY $75.00 TO HAVE IT UNLOCKED! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOTTO "CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT"? PHONE IS FREEZING, CONSTANTLY RESTARTS AND BLACKS OUT, I DON'T MIND THE PHONE BLURRING WHEN IT'S SWITCHING FROM VERTICAL TO HORIZONTAL SCREEN AND VICE VERSA BUT IT STAYS BLURRED AN HOUR! I CAN'T DO ANYTHING OR SEE ANYTHING! DON'T TRUST THIS SELLER OR BUY ANY PHONE FROM THEM! MAYBE I'LL JUST SELL IT TO A PHONE STORE OVER HERE, THEY CAN UNLOCK IT, FIX THE FREEZING AND CRAPINESS THEN RESELL IT. BATTERY LIFE IS SHORT, MAYBE I GOT A REFURBISHED ITEM (ALTHOUGH IT STATED NEW AND NOT REFURBISHED BUT THE SELLER'S WORD DOESN'T MEAN MUCH NOW DOES IT? RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS PHONE, IF I CHARGE IT FULLY IN THE MORNING AND KEEP IT IN MY POCKET ALL DAY, NOT USING IT AT ALL NO TEXTING OR ANYTHING IT'S DEAD LIKE 4 HOURS LATER, IF I TEXT AND CALL OR USE THE APPS OR WHATEVER IT'S DEAD IN AN HR... SELLER HAS A BAD ATTITUDE AND PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM EVER AGAIN. THIS WAS A WASTE OF TIME, I NEEDED A PHONE IMMEDIATELY AND IT CAME LOCKED! IF I COULD GIVE THEM AND THIS PHONE A NEGATIVE STAR RATING I WOULD. THEY WILL PROBABLY COMMENT UNDER THIS WITH LIES...IN 3...2...1....UPDATE:I TRULY BELIEVE THIS PHONE WAS REFURBISHED. BESIDES IT CAME WITH A BENT, WORN OUT SIM CARD IN THE PH THAT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD BEEN USING. NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO TURN IT ON IT SAYS "BATTERY OKAY TO PROGRAM. CONNECT USB ETC" SOME KIND NONSENSE. I SEARCHED ONLINE FOR HELP BUT THERE WAS NONE. THE ANSWERS I GOT FROM FORUMS WERE USELESS. SO NOW MY PHONE IS UNUSABLE. HAD IT BARELY TWO MONTHS, NEVER DROPPED AND CAMERA STARTED WORKING FOR NO REASON. CHANGED SD CARD AND SAME PROBLEM! MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN!!
