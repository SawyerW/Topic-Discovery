My wife and I text back and forth on our lunch breaks and I was getting tired of texting on my old clamshell Tracfone. This was the cheapest phone with triple minutes on Tracfone and the wifi feature sold me on it. The phone features a 3G connection, wifi connectability, a browser, and e-mail synching.The full blackberry-style keyboard has made texting MUCH faster than a normal clamshell phone. However, the keys are somewhat small and the spacebar frequently glitches and puts in periods if I press it towards the right rather than the left. You can set the keyboard to automatically lock and I've had no problems with it pocket dialing. However, you can still dial 911 while the phone is locked (you press the numbers and it asks you if you want to call SOS).I liked the idea of the e-mail synching on the go but not the execution. Everytime the phone automatically checked my e-mail, I was charged minutes for using the 3G connection. I ended up turning the automatic synching off and I haven't checked my e-mail on it in probably three weeks.For my purposes, the 3G connection is a useless feature. 3G makes sense on my wife's Droid 3 but this phone doesn't have the goods to need a fast connection. I know this is a Tracfone phone but I expected the browser to be better than it is. I hoped against hope that I would be able to watch netflix on the small screen. However, the browser is the same "fake internet" browser you'd get on a clamshell phone except with a faster connection. Many sites are incompatible and surfing is difficult. After checking it out the first couple days I had the phone, I haven't used the browser at all.The wifi makes using the fake internet on the phone fairly fast but I just can't get over how clumsy the browser is.Altogether, I'm happy that the phone has made texting about three times faster for me but disappointed in the internet features that initially interested me in the phone.
