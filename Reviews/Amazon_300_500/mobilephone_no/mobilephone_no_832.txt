I got this phone to replace my HP Veer, which I had worn out.  This is my first Android phone.  I bought it because I wanted a physical keyboard and I am on T Mobile and I wanted a phone that worked well on T MobileThe Bad.Android 2.1 requires all apps to be in internal memory.  This phone has 171MB of internal memory.  Android 2.1 doesn't allow WiFi hotspots.  Android 2.1 can't be updated on this phone.  There aren't a lot of options for getting to work with the multiple e-mail systems I use.The Good.The processor reasonably handles the OS.  The keyboard is backlit and works much better than virtual keyboards.  Once I reduced the frequency it checked for messages, calendar updates, etc, the battery easily lasts the whole day.  It seems very durably built.  It easily seems to take impacts that would shatter a Samsung Galaxy screen.  The signal strengths are higher that I had on my Veer.  This may be because the Veer was made for ATT and this was made specifically for TMobile frequencies.The WorkaroundsNow that I am more familiar with Android, I realized I did this all wrong.  I spent 4 hours figuring out how to make this work with my e-mail and calendar accounts.  Using the Android marketplace (Google Play), I could have just downloaded an Exchange compatible email client.If you root the phone, you can get WiFi hotspots to work.  You also can get link2SD, which will let you move your apps to the SD card (I still can't install an app over 54 MB, because I still have to install it in internal memory before moving it).Overall:  I like it, it does what I need now.  If I had to do it again, I think I would have gotten a Motorola Defy Pro because of the Android 2.3Gingerbread.  Now that I have it the way I want it, it isn't worth it to try the Defy.
