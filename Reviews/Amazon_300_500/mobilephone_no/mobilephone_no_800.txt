PROSIncredible S is a very capable device with good battery and worths the money depending on what meets your fancy.It comes off as a sturdy looking device, easy to grip, good internal storage and offers a very good camera functionality.The Incredible S is running with a Qualcomm 1GHz Snapdragon CPU supported by a plentiful 768MB of RAM and 1.1GB of ROM. The Super LCD display is four-inch and WVGA 800x480 resolution. The Super LCD screen on the Incredible S exhibited top-notch color reproduction, excellent contrast, and terrific outdoor screen visibility (not very far from Super AMOLED)Battery life on the Incredible S was very, very good, thanks to its relatively large 1450mAh battery. Under a heavy use scenario, you'll get through a day and a half. With moderate use it can go about two full days.For radios there is Wi-Fi (with N support), Bluetooth, FM, and UMTS with HSPA+ support. It can do UMTS 900/1700/2100, allowing it to work in Europe or on T-Mobile in the USA. The camera on the back can take 8MP photos and 720p videosThe Incredible S does also a neat trick...the buttons can rotate when you flip the phone into landscape!There is also notification LED notification (for me is essential!!!!!) behind the top speaker grill which blinks green when you have a new email, SMS, or missed call (configurable in Settings), or glows amber when charging.The Incredible S ships with Android 2.2.1, but HTC already made available a refreshed version of Android 2.3 Gingerbread. I will install this weekend...From a performance point of view the Incredible S (Quandrant 1518) has nearly identical specs when compared to the Desire HD and on top of Nexus One, Moto Droid X and Samsung Galaxy S...CONS- Doesn't has dual-core (not real important since the apps are not optimized yet to dual core processors)- Lack of video out could be an issue (not important for me)- HTCSense.com is not working properly for this phone (not really the phone to blame)
