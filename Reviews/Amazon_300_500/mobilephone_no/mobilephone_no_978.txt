After trying out a Lumia 520, I decided to upgrade to a higher level WP8 phone.  I have been using my 520 as a media device with my primary phone being an Android.  Although the 920, 1020 and 1520 seem to be excellent devices, what made me go with an 820 is that while it may not be the best at any particular feature, it has all the features that I'm looking for.  I have the AT&T; Deathstar version.1.  4G LTE2.  At least 1 GB RAM3.  Replaceable battery4.  MicroSD slot expandable to 64 GB.5.  AMOLED screen6.  Glance7.  Wireless charging with a shell8.  Front Facing Camera9.  Camera Flash10.  Decent Camera with Carl Zeiss lens11.  Relatively low cost (I purchased mine used for $65)12.  Compass13.  Here+ vs. Here (although with the latest news, the 520 will get Here+)14.  Audio Equalizer.  This has Dolby.15.  FM radio16.  Double tap to wake17.  NFC18.  GyroscopeThe screen is beautiful.  I love AMOLED's.  Glance is a great feature.  Call quality is good.  Fast web surfing.  It feels solid in the hand.  I think the 820 is currently the best all around WP8 phone.  WP8 is a good, smooth, lag free phone.  It'll be even better with the upgrade to 8.1.  Sound is great through headphones.  Speakerphone volume is decent.  The only downside is the relatively poor app store.  Very few Google apps, which I rely on.The battery life so far is good enough for me.  The camera, again, while not the latest Nokia masterpiece like the 41 MP on the 1020 or 20 MP on the Icon or 1520 takes decent pictures.For the money the phone is a 5/5.  Compared to other phones (high end included), it's more like a 4/5.Update 4/23/14: I updated the OS the WP8.1 Preview for Developers.  The phone is even more awesome with 3 columns, action center, and Cortana.  So far, it's running well with WP8.1.
