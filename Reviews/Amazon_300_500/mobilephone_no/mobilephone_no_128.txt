Most of the criticisms about this phone are justified.  It is clunky, the menu system is obsolete, the screen is small and it is a European version.  If you are looking for a smartphone this is not for you.  However, if you want a phone that will take abuse and keep working this is the best I have found.  I have been using mine for 3 years on a island in the Pacific Ocean.  It gets soaked daily with sweat, rain and salt spray and has never failed.  Most electronics around here last about a year even if you don't get them wet.  If you want an inexpensive, tough, phone this is the only reasonable choice.  Even the US military contingent here uses them. Others saw my phone and wanted one like it.  Now there are about a dozen around the island, including with the governor.  The only failure was one that was bad out of the box.  More people are asking me to bring them "a phone like you have" from the US.  I paid $130 for mine and current price is an incredible bargain.  The speaker is surprisingly loud for music playback.  The SD slot allows these things to double as a music player.  Headphone jack is the non-standard Samsung jack and you need to use headphones(included) for the radio.  This phone is the only one I would consider if I needed another rugged, water resistent, phone(never dropped it in the ocean so can't verify that it is waterPROOF).  My advice is to get it if you value having a phone that works for telephone calls and text under extreme conditions over playing games and a slick interface.  Buy an adapter that changes the charger prongs from European round to US flat for about $2.  (Sometimes the adapter comes with the phone.)  If you can't figure out the menus or how to get it to English, find an 8-year old child to help you.  I will be taking another half dozen back with me from the US for islanders.  By the way, the sister-phone, the Samsung B2710, is not nearly as rugged or water resistent, although it has a nicer screen and keyboard.
