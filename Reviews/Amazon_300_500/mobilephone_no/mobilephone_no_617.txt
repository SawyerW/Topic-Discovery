I've had the blackjack for almost a month now.  Overall I think it's a great phone.  This is my first smartphone.  I didn't want to purchase a blackberry because I simply can't use all its features.  I need to check email and surf the web.  My business doesn't have a BES(blackberry mail) server so I decided to get the blackjack.It is a little complicated at first to get the hang of everything.  The navigation buttons are close together and I often hit the green or red call buttons on accident, which is annoying.  I also use the task manager way to often to close programs that have no "exit" function.  I would have given this phone 5 stars if it had built in GPS and wifi.I really enjoy this phone becuase of its applications.  I've found all sorts of usefull programs like Google maps, IM+, Fizz Weather, Facade.  You can really customize the homescreen a lot since its just xml.  I was able to setup my POP3 accounts easily and retrieve/send email with it all day long.  The battery holds out just fine for me as well.  I have yet to use the extended life battery.  Docking with my pc works everytime and is easy to use.  The phones reception is also great.  I kinda live away from the city and I still get clear calls and constant Edge service, sometimes 3g.  I have movies and mp3z as well and both play great.  The speaker is good for me.  I don't usually play loud mp3s in a room full of people...I bought a 2gb microsd card for $26 at Brandsmart and it works fine.  I also got unlimited data from AT&T; for $19.99 a month, so I'm not sure why I see others complaining about paying $40 a month.  The camera on this thing is great as well.  I had a razr before this and its camera was good, but it doesn't compare to this phones cam.  Overall I'm very happy with it and use it a lot more than I thought I would.
