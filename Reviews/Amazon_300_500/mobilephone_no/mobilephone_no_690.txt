I tested for Nokia and loved their phones ... even tested their voice dial in 2005.I have had this 3 days, have NOT read the manual, but browsed it to find missing featuresThis beautiful phone needs 3-4 hours with the manual - then  I will rewrite this review.I OFFER this to you and TO NOKIA as an "OUT OF BOX USER EXPERIENCE".When Nokia decided to save 1 day of developer/QA time they multiplied their CUSTOMER SUPPORT costs 1000 fold, and risk WAVES of customers migrating to iPhone, HTC, Android and even Motorola...I chose this unit because it was rated 4 1/2 stars and had a 2 year model run ... certainly ALL THE BUGS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WORKED OUT??PLUS:  Read all the other reviews, the "plusses" are undeniable  *AND* it's INACCURATE to call it "GRAY" ...it is silver/steel/iridescent ... solid, BEAUTIFUL !MINUS - right out of the BOX deal breakers! A. VOICE DIAL - FAILS AND RESETS / CRASHES PHONE ... I never read this in any review.  SOLUTION: Many have reported this in Nokia's forum.  The fix?  NOT a software update!  But Nokia's analyst Huddle offers this MOST EMBARRASSING fix. 1. "Change language to Philipino (only Auto, English, Spanish and French on my phone, I chose Spanish) 2. Phone announces will restart and does 3. "Change back to your language" (I chose English not Automatic)... restart again 4. IT NO LONGER CRASHES, .... it has 30-40% accuracy and does NOT confirm which number of contact it will call.  My much maligned Motorola models from E815 to Z9 had absolutely natural and accurate voice dial. The Nokia E71 has a robotic voice that starts dialing before you can find the STOP button in a panic.B. GPS - menu navigation is cumbersome, it bumps you from level 3 back up to level 1, and says SEVEN DAY TRIAL ... although this was NOT what I read here in Amazon before I bought it.C. Text Message In box not found ... I'll spend a day with the Manual and update this review3.9 STARS *if and only if* you commute by train and DO NOT DRIVE NOR NEED VOICE DIAL.  The handy keyboard SACRIFICES dialing safety for EASE OF MESSAGING ... very critical for SAFETY1 1/2 stars or less if Nokia thinks SO POORLY of their customers to offer a CRASHING PHONE for the MOST BASIC function  ... offer such an embarrassing fix ... What good is GPS, Barcode Reader (yes! 2D not the 1D simple stuff you see on retail labels), Wireless Keyboard interface, if it will not make a handsfree phone call in traffic when the technology has had 5+ years to be refined?  Motorola and Nokia ought to swap engineers and MAKE THEM USE THEIR OWN PHONES before selling it.  I'm mad because this phone has the beauty of a top-of-the-line-Audi or BMW, yet but leaves customers trying to look cool in the parking lot making vroom vroom noises when the key breaks in the ignition.
