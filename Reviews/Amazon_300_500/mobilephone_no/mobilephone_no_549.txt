Edit: 091913Please read the comments after my review.  My experience with Verizon was inconsistent after having spoken with several more customer service reps.  One explained that the enV3 was indeed compatible with prepaid plan....for $50-70 per month: about the same price as a low-end data package for this phone.  Another just plain wouldn't offer a pre-paid plan at all.  Verizon is schizophrenic with regard to this phone.  I continue to look for the $35/month plan explained to me at the Verizon store.Further, my review can't be about the phone itself because of conflicting activation information.  I submitted this review because I felt that activation issues were just as important as the phone's performance and features.  That, and if you've been encouraged to buy this phone because it's supposed to qualify for a Verizon pre-paid plan, you should also know that those monthly fees are probably going to be more expensive than even the Verizon store managers actually know.  This is important for people on lower, fixed incomes who want a decent, modest phone with a tactile keyboard who can't afford a data package.____________________________I bought two of these phones recently based on advice from the Verizon store near me.  I explained that I used wireless very little and mostly for texting.  I wanted a dedicated qwerty board.  So, I tried to to activate the phone today and three different folks at Verizon (online) told me that the ENV3 is NOT considered a "basic" cell phone and requires a data package account.  What that means is that instead of $35/month for a basic phone (LG Cosmos, et. al.), the least charge for an ENV3 is $70 with a $60 activation fee.  Verizon considers the ENV3 a "data-ready" phone, the same as a smart phone!Misinformation from Verizon stores sucks! I'm not sure who's responsible for the misinformation but I think I'll just take a little hike down to Walmart to see what they've got.Live and learn I guess.
