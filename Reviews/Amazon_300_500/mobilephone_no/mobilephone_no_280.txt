I love this phone, but it's seriously trouble prone.  And Nokia has turned it's back on Symbian.This review is actually for TWO N8's, one is the phone I purchased new, the other is a phone my sister purchased new.  Both phones have had many issues, but all turned up after the one year warranty expired.First let me say that I don't 'overwork' the phone, I've not downloaded any apps (ovi store is limited anyhow), or modified the OS in any way. Both phones are fully updated running Belle.  Doing full factory resets have not cleared up any of the below problems, and no, it's not a setting somewhere.List of problems:My phone-1.  Drops cell tower connection randomly, and never comes back on it's own, I have to restart. (won't recieve or make calls)2.  Screen will not light up while outdoors (sunlight) upon incoming call, which makes it impossible to answer call.3.  Cannot install the maps update, because phone is out of memory, 16 gigs of memory should be more than enough.Sisters old phone - (which I've been using)1.  Asks for a security code on start up (i just enter 1, it says fail, but unlocks anyway)2.  Battery life is horrible.  Still terrible with new battery (unplug at 7AM, completely dead by 4pm with no use at all, standby only) the other N8 will work about 1.5 days of moderate use before needing a recharge.3.  Update icon won't go away.  Even after checking for new updates (and it confirming it's fully updated) it still shows up.The phone is great when it works correctly, but considering that Nokia is shooting 0 for 2 on N8's, there will be no more Nokia's for Us.  My sister has moved on to a work provided Blackberry, and I'll probably make the move to Android.  At least there is support for them.  I've had Nokia's since the late 90's, but this one is the last one I'm going to throw my money away on.
