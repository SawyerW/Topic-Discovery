I've never been big on the whole Smartphone craze, I only use cellphones to text and make short phone calls (Do we need milk?) so I never saw a big point in them, but as that is where the world is ending up, and I needed a new phone I figured I'd get one of the cheaper smart phones and settled with this one.It works fine for my use, but I do wish the keys while typing were a little larger, sometimes while even actively trying to hit a letter I'll end up selecting a different letter. And I wish the question mark was on the main keyboard instead of having to shift for it all the time. I had a full fledged qwerty keyboard on my last phone in which the question mark was on its own key, and got use to it, so its a minor annoyance for me.For the heck of it I decided to download some games, the phone itself works fine with basic games but it was so slow with a game like Fruit Ninja that I couldn't even play it.For the first month the battery life was fine. I would have to plug it in every few days like any other phone, but after about a month the battery life dropped amazingly. A full charge would only last until about 12 in the afternoon, and that was with little-to-no use. A few texts here and there and checking the time every now and then.  I deleted some apps and put the phone on Battery Saver mode and that seemed to fix it. . .for a few days. . . where it went right back to needing to be charged everyday.I'm fully willing to chalk it up to the battery life being the case of just a lemon though.
