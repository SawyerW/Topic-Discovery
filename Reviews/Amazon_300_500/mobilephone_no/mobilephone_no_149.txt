firstly i should point out that i live and work in the UK so am amazed at the price you have to pay for this phone and yes i have taken the exchange rate into account. also i work for europes largest independant mobile phone retailer and so feel i have some valid insights. the company i work for is also the only company to sell the pink v3 in europe. we also supply amazon in europe.granted our networks are further ahed in there sophistication than your own so we get stuff a little quiker than the US and  i understand the phones popularity with it being a quad band phone and therefor its abilty to work across the country.i feel i should set the record straight about the v3. i agree it can make calls and is great at being pink but thats it. it is a poor phone. the camera quality is extremly poor and lack of video capture is a real let down. i have read that motorola are correcting this as part of a software fix that can be added later if your phone requires fixing. which leads me to my next fault. the phone is very unreliable but this is due to the massive volumes motorola is producing. i alsop find motorola's menu infuriating and very unfriendly compared to Nokia or Sony Ericsson which are far easier to pick up.the new version of the phone, the v3i is still not as good as other brands leading handsets such as the incredible sony ericsson w800i, the nokia n70 or the samsung d600. all with 2.0 million pixel camera's, expandable memory and amazing other features. the nearest motorola has come to making the V3 respectable is the new V3X the 3G version.in summary i am amazed at the popularity of this phone in the US as sale's of the phone are driven by its looks alone and not fatures. however if you really love it and want to get something for the man in your life look out for the light blue version that goes on sale this week in the UK and will probably be out soon in the US.
