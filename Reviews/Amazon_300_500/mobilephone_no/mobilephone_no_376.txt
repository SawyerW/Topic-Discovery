Let start with basics:1. Battery life is unbeatable: Heavy calling (including SIP over 3G and WiFi, mostly bluetooth headset), e-mail, web , GPS, online radio and I'd like to top it off with  Angry Birds.All above with E6 for 1 day and 1 night and you don't look scared of your shadow thinking? Where's my charger! Note: Activate Power Saving option disables 3G/3.5G, reduces screen brightens continuous e-mail sync with gmail and ability to search though your contacts on the server (in this case gmail contacts). I can't tell how long will battery last with this option activated - I'm guessing longer then required.2. Screen is small but so is the phone and thanks to that fits well everywhere: jeans, sport coat, business suit: Screen is responsive and touchscreen experience is fluid as it should be with 25.8 update3. Contacts! Pure goldmine. Any piece of information can be saved and sorted and accessed. Ability to access your contacts on gmail finally implemented -no workarounds necessary.4. Using phone as hotspot works well. No need for additional charges for privilege of tethering from T-BloodSuckers.5. Multiple VoIP/SIP accounts configurations work well except for the fact that you have to download and install Nokia Symbian^3 SIP VoIP 3.1 separately6. GPS nav and search is trying to compete with google maps and overall experience is great -garim stays @ homeFact that I've never experienced many problem previous reviews point out only speaks volume to the fact how Nokia quality assurance slips and customers feel like beta testers. I lived through E71 (best phone and innovation at the time) than came E72 (some kinda mistake) and here we are with E6 (big relieve and improvement in my productivity department). My home is full of android HTC's and LG's and Samsung G2 so go figure.To summarize this phone works when I need it most with price point that was right for me. Thanks for reading and good luck.
