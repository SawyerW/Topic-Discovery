What Ever Happened to the DEALS?Last year I paid $79.99 and the year before that I paid $74.99, for a "1 Year" card. THAT was a good deal! But now $94.99 plus $4.99 shipping equals $99.98! THAT is NO DEAL!!I have bought one year Tracfone cards for the last three years. We use it very little though but cheapest cell phone you can get if you don't use it a lot! I mean $100 works out to about $8.33 per month. Since we do not use the Tracfone (or any cell phone) a lot we now have ACCUMULATED over 2,200 minutes. However, we WOULD use it more IF we got service AT OUR HOUSE, since we do not have long-distance on our home phone. We are retired and on a FIXED income so try to save all we can!I don't understand when the ECONOMY is SO BAD why EVERYONE is raising their prices. Our Gas and Electric, and water are both gong up, taxes going up. ALL THIS will ONLY make the economy WORSE!!------------- UPDATE 12/15/2013 ------------WOW! The deal AT Tracfone was awesome.I paid $99.99 for it, but this month they have a holiday special! You get an extra 250 minutes! So I got the 400 minutes, and when I bought the phone 3 years ago I bought a "Double the Minutes" card so that made it 800, plus the 250 extra for the holidays, which gave me 1,050 MORE minutes with my purchase.AND I got a second deal, for us any way. With all of those extra minutes that keep 'Rolling Over'. You can purchase an extra Year of Service for only $49.99, that doesn't include any more minutes, only 365 more days (a 2nd year) of service. But hey that is one year at half the price! THEN - since we NOW have a total of 3,250 minutes it is just what I needed.
