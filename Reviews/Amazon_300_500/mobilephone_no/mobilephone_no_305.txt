I am your average un-techie type user. When I buy something I like it to work without a lot of fuss. I am pretty familar with Nokia and Symbian. I've owned various older Nokia bar style phones, and most recently, an e61i(first smartish phone for me) then a MusicXpress 5530.I'll start with the things I liked:The look and feel of the phone: I think it looks great. It is on the heavy side and I like a heavier device. It feels very solid and the weight in my pocket reassures me of its presence with me. If I don't feel its weight, I know I need to stop and find my phone!The camera: Wonderful camera, best camera I've had on a phone. In fact, one of the reasons I bought the phone in the first place.Very good call quality and email. I prefer a qwerty keyboard for texting and the touch screen keyboard worked very well.Ok music player, lots of memory, removeable memory and all the hardware mentioned in other reviews tempted me into buying this phone.Now on to why I'm returning the phone.This phone had trouble connecting to it's own app store(Ovi) I would get "unable to connect to service" messages repeatedly from the Ovi store even though my service provider's internet was working fine.I wanted to read a book(Kindle or Mobi Pocket) without converting anything. I wanted to listen to audio books(Audible). I wanted to stream Netflix and Pandora media on my phone. For $450.00+ dollars I had hoped I could be entertained on my N8, I was disappointed. When the phone did connect to the Ovi store, these applicatons are currently nowhere to be found. This hardware is crippled by lack of popular applications! I keep reading that they are adding more and more applications to the Ovi store each day, but not the apps I want to use.I feel like I paid a premium price for barely a step up from my last Nokia(MusicXpress 5530).
