I bought one of these phones last year to keep my verizon unlimited data.  There are newer phones, and there are better phones.  The radios on this thing aren't the best, but I keep my unlimited data and 99% of the time it's just a nice, smooth phone with a great screen and adequate internals.I run it with a Hyperion extended battery and a Seidio Convert case.  The hyperion WILL fit in the case if you scrape a little of the felt lining out.Keep in mind the reason that these phones are so readily available is that they shipped them new with a TINY battery and everyone returned or sold them.  With that battery you might not make it until lunch.  You HAVE to run the extended.Run it with:http://www.amazon.com/Hyperion-Extended-Compatible-SCH-i515-CAPABILITIES/dp/B007C8XRJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1398914910&sr;=8-1&keywords;=hyperion+galaxy+nexusYour phone is going to eat one of these batteries about every four months, but they get replaced for free by Hyperion's amazing customer service team.  The battery will get really hot and then stop holding charge.  Before then, it will give you all day power if you're using it smartly.http://www.amazon.com/Seidio-BD4-HKR4SSGNL-CONVERT-Holster-Samsung/dp/B006ZGB4FI/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1398915075&sr;=8-6&keywords;=seidio+galaxy+nexusI was a little concerned about ordering a case from a company I'd never heard of, but this thing is a beast.  Otterbox quality.  Tough and excellent, and fits the extended battery like a glove.Finally, you want to run it with one of the Cyanogenmod 11 preview builds.  They're really stable, so don't worry about them not being totally done.  The thing that makes the 11 build so much more desirable than the 10.x buillds is that it's based on android 4.4 kitkat, which was designed to use RAM much better on phones that don't have a lot.Like this phone, which has less than 1GB.  New superphones have double or triple that.I was about to get rid of my nexus before 11 came out.  It was buttery smooth after I installed it.  READ UP on the process before you do it.  It's fairly simple but you could have a $200 paperweight if you rush in and don't do your research.So, there you are.  These components and setup will get you a beastly, hotrodded, modern phone for less than $300.  Good luck.
