I bought the phone at my local store (Santiago) for about US$260, which is actually pretty cheap for any sort of smart phone here (most phones run like 2-4x the price of in US)It ended up like the story of the three little bears.I was looking at the L3, L5, and L7.L7 was wayyyy too big, but it had tempting specs.I liked the L3, but it seemed like specs from 2-3 years ago.I picked up the L5 and it was juuuuuuust right. Or was it?Hrmm... while I don't use the phone in all too serious of a manner (light internet use, simple games, watching videos, etc. etc.) I find the specs just right for me. No complaints.However, I find it too big. It just doesn't fit into most of my (female) pockets. I had the LG Optimus P970 (I think) for a couple years and that fit well in my pocket. The L5 is noticably thinner, but it's also longer and wider.I do wish I had a L3 sized phone with L5 specs. That would've been perfect for me.Anyways, some of my favorite things about the phone include that you can choose what tools you put in the drop down menu. I toggle wifi and 3g connections all day long, so those are obviously there. I don't use blutooth, so I took that off. The dimmer is wonderful, but I wish it had more than 3 settings. GPS can also be put up there (never use it). There's also a screen rotation lock, but it only lets me lock vertical, not landscape. I wish that there was an alarm quicklink here because sometimes I want to access it when surfing the web or whatnot.They seem to have gotten rid of the LGsocial app which I absolutely loved on my old phone. :( The regular apps just aren't as good for Facebook and Twitter.The batter seems to last a long time with Wifi always on (about 2 days) but dies pretty quick (1 day) when 3g is turned on.Anyways, I've had it for about 2 months now, and I like it. I just wish it was smaller. If I had to do it all over again, I would still buy it. I can't imagine a better phone out there for the price.
