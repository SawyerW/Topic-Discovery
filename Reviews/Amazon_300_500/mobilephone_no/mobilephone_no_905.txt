This is my opinions of the N7000 not the downgraded AT&T; version.I currently use a Galaxy Nexus i9250 GSM and I have been using Android OS4 for about two months so this will of course color my opinion.The N7000 I used was running Android 2.3.5 and had a broken SIM socket, I bought this from the Amazon warehouse outlet and now I know why it was there in the first place. I was unable to use the cellular parts of the phone because of this.I was intrigued with the Note since it launch due to the impressive specs and I felt the very large screen would be a plus since I read a lot of e books on my phone.I was hesitant to buy this because of my very poor experience using ATT's Captivate primarily because of TouchWiz but this phone has the latest TouchWiz version and no carrier bloat and had very good reviews so I decided to give it try.First impressionWow! beautiful phone,awesome display, bright, and vibrant.I like the home button, its convenient having a very easy to find way to wake the phone in the dark.Camera took very nice pictures, a bit better than the Nexus but not nearly as fast as the Nexus.No Carrier bloatware and tethering is enabled just like it should be.The bad (my opinion)TouchWiz, I really enjoyed the minimalist software approach the Nexus has. TouchWiz has taken the opposite approach, there are loads of apps I may not use and nearly every application has been modified from the stock versions in some way. This wouldn't be so bad except you can not uninstall them for example social hub, music hub, readers hub, and photo editor. These are just some that I would have chucked if I could.I find TouchWiz to have no advantage over the stock launcher and would rather just not have it to start with.What I would like to see from Samsung and for that matter any android phone manufacturer is a stock Android install where the custom applications and launcher are optional and can be installed or removed at will. This would perhaps make updating the OS quicker and get the Android community closer to having a current os on every device.Yes, I could have rooted and installed custom firmware but would rather not spend my time fixing something that shouldn't be broken to start with.I returned the phone due to the SIM socket problem and ordered another Nexus because of TouchWiz.
