I have only had the phone for a few days and it is the first phone that I have been able to access the Web.  I read many of the reviews before deciding to purchase this model.  I do NOT find it very user friendly. The majority of the issues I have with the phone are in regards to the online functionality.  I have wasted at least 20 minutes from pushing the back button, or the ok button once too many times  ( on and off line...and when I was trying to learn how to use the on-line features)  I would not recommend this phone if want to go online and do not have experience.  The book that comes with the phone does not give much information regarding the online function of the phone.  The website wasn't much help either... For example, I tried to get on Facebook.  It takes a long time to connect.  You need to press the OK button frequently to move from box to box..to sign in etc.  Finally was able to get on after it failed 2 or 3 times because it was taking too long(timed out) I logged in..tried to leave a comment and could find no way to get the comment to post.The first issue I encountered was the extremely small font size while online.  It took a while to figure out how to make it larger. I also wonder about the amounts that have been deducted for web access, texts etc.  I haven't had the phone very long...maybe 3/4 days.  I have only sent/received 10 or so texts and limited phone calls.  I have gone through 130 minutes which is A LOT for me.I do like the weight and feel of the phone. The contact list was easy to set up.  The full keyboard is a nice feature and it works more efficiently than the T505 model.Will write an update in a week or so...
