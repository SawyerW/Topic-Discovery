A TracFone representative confirmed for me that they know of the connectivity issues with this phone. This phone will suddenly lose connectivity to your wireless router and if you don't notice the "inaccessible" message you will have the minutes sucked out of your phone when it switches over to 3G.I set my phone up to access my wireless router. The WiFi indicator turned green to show it was working. I opened what they call a browser on the phone and within two to three minutes the "inaccessible" message was displayed and the WiFi indicator turned blue to indicate that there was no WiFi connection. This happened several times and prompted me to call TracFone for assistance.When I told the rep that I read a lot of reviews stating problems with WiFi connectivity, the TracFone representative confirmed that they  know about the problem and they were expecting Samsung to come up with a fix. Probably not going to happen.So, they offered me a replacement phone or a refund. I accepted the refund and had my old DMFL plan phone reactivated with a TMFL plan. I'm just waiting for the prepaid return label to arrive.I know a lot of people don't like TracFone customer service, but I must say that they were very good in resolving my problem with the phone.I might add that my Samsung Galaxy phone has never dropped the WiFi connection in my home.I hope this saves you a lot of time and potential headaches.UPDATE: 03/26/2013 After promising me a full refund for a defective phone, TracFone refunded only half my money. I called about he partial refund this morning and I got a customer support person who put me on hold every three minutes telling me he was updating my information for the "support" team and they had all sorts of "tools" to help them with my problem. It turns out TracFone will not refund the original "FREE" shipping charge or taxes. They tell me it it in their Terms of Service. I told them it applies to phones that work, not phones that are known to be defective.After hanging up on "Arnie", he had the audacity to call me back. I told him that he had no reason to be calling me back unless he was calling to tell me he was refunding my money. He told me we got disconnected. I told him it was going to happen again and promptly hung up.I take back what I previously said about TracFone customer service. They suck.You have been warned. Purchase from TracFone at your own risk.TracFone Trivia Fun Fact: TracFone has owned the TracFoneSucks subdomain name for the .com, .net and .org domains since August 2000. Why do you think they would want to own those domain names?
