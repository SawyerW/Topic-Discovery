Sony Ericsson W580i Gray Phone (AT&T;)I'm a former Motorola customer. My last phone was the RAZR. I recently purchased the Sony Ericsson W580i after reading several reviews. The size of the phone is comparable to the RAZR (with the RAZR folded) however I find the W580i more comfortable to hold when placing calls.This phone is feature packed. The MP3 player has a great interface and is easy to navigate. The shake to shuffle feature is also useful, just hold the walkman button and give it a quick shake, then voila a new song starts playing.The fitness feature is what sold me on the phone, over other MP3 capable phones. It keeps track of the steps you've taken in a day, and if calibrated (easy to do) keeps track of your distance and calories burnt also. There is a training log, and easy to use application to keep track of your training progress.The phone has the usual calendar and appointment reminder most phones have these days. But the W580i comes with software and a data cable to sync with your Outlook Calendar also. This is a great tool for those who are shy of needing a more powerful PDA, but could still use some help with weekly or daily reminders.The camera is decent, compared with the RAZR it is fantastic. I do believe there are better cameras out there, but my main concern was the MP3 player, and the camera was an added bonus.I could write forever about the many features and possible uses for this phone. It is easy to customize, looks stylish, good battery life, and so on. But on top of all this the most important part of a phone should be the phone. The W580i has great call quality and good call coverage. Even my callers claim they can hear me better. What more can you ask for?
