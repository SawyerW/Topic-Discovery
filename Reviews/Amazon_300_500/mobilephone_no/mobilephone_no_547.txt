I want to give the distributors no stars, I have never written a scathing review of any product I have bought off of Amazon or any seller. I have never encounter such rude sellers either. I returned a phone because it was not what I needed and asked for a refund. I was certain that everything was in the box because I had only open it for ten minutes and realized my mistake. So I put everything back in and sent it off to wherever it came from. I received an response a few days later, saying that there was no battery cord. I sent them a polite message insisting that I did not have the charger and distinctly remember putting everything back in. The distributor sent me back a rude short message about returning the missing item or I would have to pay some fee. I wrote them back to tell them to keep the phone and bother me no more. I could already tell by the way the seller wrote his or her message that he or she was going to be a pain in the ass to deal with. You can always tell how people are by their writing. His or her style of writing screams: "I am a douchebag and I will be a pain in the ass to you." I do associate with such people, so I decided to end the contact with the sellers even if it meant losing some money. I think customer service should be top priority when you are selling products. Sellers shouldn't send them back sarcastic and condescending response, it rude and unprofessional to treat your customers like they are kids or beneath. Perhaps they should teach their sellers some manner and how to deal with customer complaints with more tact. I will not be purchasing  anything from these distributor again. I would never recommend World wide distributor products to others, they are in my opinion, horrible for a lack of a better word.
