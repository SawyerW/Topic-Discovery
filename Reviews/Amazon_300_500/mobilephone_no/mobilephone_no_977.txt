Ordered and received this phone in a very timely manner from Electronics Mart. Was able to set up the WLAN quickly and so far it is very fast. I'm using it with the ATT Net10 plan and the SIM card installed flawlessly with the instructions provided by the vendor. One Walmart I called said they wanted $67.00 for the 3 sim card pack. I bought the same pack on sale at Radio Shack for $10. Phone vendor corresponded promptly regarding a couple of questions. Evidently APNs change occasionally because those given by the vendor and older ones on the internet were not helpful.  I found the correct APN settings on the Net10 site and the data kicked in almost immediately. I turn off the data connection whenever I'm in range of wireless. App has a setting that gives a warning and then the shut-off for data. You can adjust those to whatever levels you want. Net10s data is not unlimited, but I think it will be enough based on past analysis of my former Verizon account. At this point I haven't had need for a second SIM, but wanted the flexibility of using that. Good screen, comes with all the advertised items including an extra battery and screen protector is already installed. The camera isn't great, but I don't think most phone cameras are even if they are high pixel count. As a DSLR user I don't depend on it except in unexpected situations. The biggest benefit is a good phone going from my $85 monthly Verizon plan to a $45 Net10 plan ($50 initially and $45 thereafter with on-line registration and auto re-fills). I like the larger screen size but didn't want to go all the way to 5". The google browser has quite a few Chinese(?) characters, but I downloaded the Firefox for Android browser and it works fine. I'm not a super-techie but I was able to work my way through this phones setup.
