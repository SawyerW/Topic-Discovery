Really satisfied with the Fusion 2. It's my first Android phone. I moved from a standard non-smartphone on a standard monthly plan to a GoPhone plan. I did not want a data plan, but wanted Wi-Fi at home and at work. It's possible with this phone.One thing I thought I would mention is that if you want the 10 cents a minute pay-as-you-go plan, it seems to me that AT&T; makes it difficult for you to select this plan when activating from either the phone, or activating from the website. I simply could not find the option. You can only select 1 of 3 plans when activating from the phone, and they are all monthly packages. And if you can find the 10 cents a minute plan on the website, they make you "add a device", and this device is not in the compatible device list. You will find a land line number in the book that comes with the phone, call this number and you can select the 10 cents a minute plan. I suppose you can go to an AT&T; store, or talk with someone. The live chat folks could not even tell me how to do it on the website. If you call the phone number listed in the book that comes with the phone, you will go through an automated procedure that will allow you to select the 10 cents a minute plan. Just say no when they ask if you have a smartphone.I also had trouble trying to cancel my monthly service and port my number to the GoPhone. I called and was told to go to the store, the store told me to call. No one would get it done. If you want to port your number, I would recommend just talking with the GoPhone customer service, they were fantastic and got it done.You can root the phone as well, and then remove all the apps you do not want, it comes with a lot of stuff you won't want. But the rooting process does not interfere with your service, minutes you paid for, etc..Great starter Android phone!
