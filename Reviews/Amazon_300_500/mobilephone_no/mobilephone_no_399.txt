I purchased this phone in March 2011 when the hype was out about it. It's a great phone but the software is too much for the hardware of the phone. I have had 4 of these phones (3 of them were given via the 1 year warranty)and all of them stopped working at some point. I owned the first one for 6 months when it decided to go into a black HTC start-up screen after I had turned it off to prevent the battery from dying. The second and third phones tried to restart but remained stuck at the start-up screen after having them for 30 minutes. The fourth one kept restarting after a phone call or a text. I was able to download the update meant to correct it but caused more issues in use. Calling ATT for a hard reset did not correct this either. I stopped using it and purchased the ATT Avail. However I had to switch back to the Freestyle to avoid the data plan and only used it for less than a month (with the same restart issues) when the screen went blank. I would've gotten a replacement but it's now 3 months after the factory warranty expired so I am out of luck.ATT did discontinue this product due to customer complaints.Pros: pretty and small phone; easy to customize and navigate; with small fingers you can easily text and place phone calls; decent talk time; good phone reception; speaker works.Cons: sends and receives multiple texts, SD card slot is inside the phone; phone can be slugglish and laggy with heavy use; tends to overheat with use or while idle; internet connectivity issues; updates cannot be downloaded or don't fix the issues; little to no selection of games and applications; heavy in comparison to new phones; speaker for the ringer and music are on the back so sound is muffled.
