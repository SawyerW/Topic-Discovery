I had already purchased two of these a few months before: one double minute direct from TracFone for $50 (20 minutes included), and one triple minutes for life from HSN (1200 minutes included) for $140.  1200 minutes is a tripled 400 minute/1 year card which sells for $99 at TracFone. So just subtract $99 from the price you pay for a TML w 1200 minutes to get what you paying for this fabulous little phone under this offer -- $10.I bought two more LG 800G's just this week from this vendor because this is one of the best cell phones ever offered by TracFone.  Now I have four LG 800G's -- one for myself, one for my wife, and one for each of my daughters. I also purchase a Motorola EX124G TML, but I sent it back to TracFone.  In my opinion the LG 800G is a much better value.These LG 800G's under this offer are all Software version 10d (S/W V10d) which is why they are discounted with triple minutes.  What you get are new double-minute phones with a pin to convert to a triple minute for life with 1200 minutes.TracFone is phasing into a later version LG 800G with software version 10e (S/W V10e). But you can only get the newer 10e version at Net10 - without triple minutes (in fact, not even double minutes.)[EDIT 18 Dec 2011:  All new phones now being shipped are versions S/WV10e]Some early users of the V10d LG 800G's reported having text message issues.  I never had any issues with text messages, but the real kicker is that if you do, TracFone will replace your version 10d with a newer version 10e for free  - and your TML and all you minutes transfer -- You can't lose.If you are new to the LG 800G, I suggest you frequent the Turk Forum for clues on how to use all the many features of this jewel, as the documentation that comes with the phone is very skimpy.  Amazon doesn't allow hyperlinks, so I have inserted spaces in the link below -- to use the link copy it into your browser then remove the spaces before activating the link.http : // s1 . zetaboards . com / Turk / index /Another useful link is the LG 800G tutorial on StraightTalk (another sunsidiary of TracFone).
