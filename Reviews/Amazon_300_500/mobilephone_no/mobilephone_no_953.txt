Let me begin by addressing some of the concerns some viewers have.  My phone did have the same issue of freezing up and uncontrolled screen lock several times after updates.  It is caused by the internal flash memory.  The phone does have a small amount of internal memory for storage(only 512 MB and about 256 MB user accessible), whenever the internal storage memory has reached its capacity, it will shut off android OS service thus freeze up the phone.  Simply by moving your apps to flash storage card manually or installing few apps will solve this issue.Now as for the phone itself it is a very decent phone for starter.  Its hardware is outdated compared to modern phones, considering it is still running Android 2.x.  The processor is a bit slow and the screen has a rather slow refresh rate and not optimal for video streaming but it still renders very good photos and text.  The phone has an elegant design, along with its rubbery enclosure and small form factor, makes the phone very comfortable to hold.  It's interface is rather primitive and can only be compared to first generation smart phones, but I personally find it simple design less frustrating and rather easy to use.  For the past few months using this phone I was able to get pretty good reception on most of my calls and browsing 3G internet was a but sluggish mainly due to it slow processor and an outdated web browser.  But since I only use it to check news and highlights, it is tolerable.  Let me sum up all the pros and cons below and let you have a better grasps of this phone.ProsElegant design, small form factor, rubbery feel enclosureLong batter life(2-3)days of usage between chargeGood reception for callsGood build quality against dropsReliable3G Enhance speed 7.2 mbpsConsSlow processor, low memory capacity(only 512 MB)Screen could use better viewing angles, its slow refresh rate makes it not optimal for videoObsolete OS, it is running Android 2.37 and won't support modern appsSmall internal storage capacity, user can only use 256 MB of the storage.
