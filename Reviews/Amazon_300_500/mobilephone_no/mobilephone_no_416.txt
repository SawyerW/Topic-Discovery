UPDATE: DO NOT BUY, THIS IS A SCAM! Please read and learn from my experiences!I ordered this phone NEW a week ago. It came in on schedule. I have owned two identical ones (same model) in the past. Would have given those past two phones five stars. When I took it out of the box for the first time, not only did the box not appear new, but the phone also appeared used. There were marks all over it. In addition to this, the screen was severely scratched, as if someone had thoroughly rubbed it down with sandpaper before packaging.For a "new" phone, I was very disappointed. It does seem to function well; however I haven't had a chance to activate it yet at verizon. I will try to do that tomorrow, and maybe try to get a refund.My suggestion? Buy it from intensity, not from Samsung. I have owned three.First one from verizon, I was pleased with all but the bill. :)Second one from Intensity, here is the link, http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-U450-Intensity/dp/B004U3HZMO/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid;=1369070163&sr;=8-7&keywords;=SCH-U450 which I was very pleased with. I got it on discount, right now it's around 90 but when I ordered it before it was about 65.Third one from here, samsung, which I am displeased with considering I ordered it new.Two stars for poor business practices. Will add a star if the phone works when I go to activate it or if I can get a refund. I highly suspect it is a refurbished phone. If not, someone at the factory needs to be fired.Btw, previous two phones broke due to excessive abuse on my part, but they did handle it very well!UPDATE: Went to verizon today. Had the expert there inspect the phone. It had signs of previous water damage, had buttons that wouldn't work properly, and had dirt in areas (such as the speaker) that clearly indicated it was a refurbished phone, NOT new! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! Buy it from another retailer. Not samsung.
