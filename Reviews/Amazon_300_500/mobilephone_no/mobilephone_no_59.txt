I got the Nokia PM-6225 phone about a month ago and I have generally been very pleased with it. This phone is PCS Vision Enabled, which means it can take advantage of all the online features that Sprint offers for a 15 dollar fee per month. This includes downloading games, ringtones, applications, and screensavers which all cost extra money. It also includes web access, email, and text messaging. This phone also comes with a digital camera, though the resolution is poor as camera phones go. You can take pictures using the phone and send them in an email to anyone with a computer or a camera phone. The games look great on the 128x128 pixel display, though the keypad can feel a bit cramped. You can only access the web about 60 percent of the times you try, but this can be blamed on the Sprint service, not the phone and may be different in places other than New York. When you do gain access it runs pretty well and takes about 5 seconds to load each page which is good for a mobile phone. The reception is clear most of the time, and voices usually sound good though they can get staticky occassionally. The phone comes with a speakerphone feature that works pretty well although people on the other line have told me that my voice appears distant at times. The phone also gives you the ability to listen to FM radio, though this requires an extra 30 dollars to buy the antennae/headset. The reasons this phone did not receive five stars were:-Fairly low quality on digital pictures.-The power button is on the top of the phone and does not stick out so it is hard to turn the phone on/off.-You cannot gain access to the web a good portion of the time.-The keypad can feel cramped while playing games.-The screen can be hard to read in bright sunlight.Overall the Nokia PM-6225 is a great option for the Sprint customer who wants a cheap, PCS enabled camera phone, and I would recommend it. (The Nokia 6200 for ATandT is essentially the same phone without the camera feature.)
