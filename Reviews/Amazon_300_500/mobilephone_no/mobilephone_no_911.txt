I purchased this as a refurb to run with Ptel's Bring-Your-Own-Device program. I was able to stick in my SIM and get it working right off the bat!What I like:-Clear voice quality, and ring is loud. Vibrate on the phone is very strong, too. On most devices I can't feel it at all when it's in my pocket -- not so for the Pantech Link.-Conversation-style messaging interface -- very convenient.-Keyboard keys protrude and are rounded, having a lot of depth. Keyboard is very small so this makes it easy to type.-Display is bright and clear, even in direct sunlight.-Very light and thin! My previous phone felt like a brick compared to this thing, but I can barely feel this thing in my pocket.What I don't like:-Sending texts is somewhat slow, and there is often a delay of 5-15 seconds before the text would send successfully. I also have a lot of trouble with texts not sending successfully, getting sent straight to the Outbox to be resent. Resetting the phone usually fixes the problem. I fear this may be a Ptel issue, but I'm not sure.-I can't send or retrieve MMS messages. It turns out the default MMS coding is for AT&T;, and I worked with Ptel representatives on multiple occasions to get this issue resolved to no avail. If you're getting this phone for AT&T;, you're probably fine. For anything else, though, you'd better look elsewhere. UPDATE: Finally got it working fantastically after another chat with Ptel.-Confusing interface. I had to dig through the menus to find how to change ringtone, find the calculator, etc. Pretty much I set everything I'd ever use into the Shortcuts menu.-Right side of the phone felt... arthritic. The buttons there would creak uncomfortably. Not sure if this is due to my phone being a refurb, though.Overall, I like the phone. It's very light and inexpensive. For those with AT&T; who want a device good for calls and texts without spending too much, this is the way to go.
