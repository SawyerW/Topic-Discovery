I'm admittedly a gadget geek and cell phones in particular 'flip my switch'. I've have a countless number of phones over the years (buying/selling on Craigslist etc.) and always strive to get the best available. This phone is that. I came from a Galaxy S2 Skyrocket that I had rooted and was running Android 4.2.2 but wanted something a bit more stable. This phone is that. The One X+ is arguably one of the finest constructed phones on the market except for perhaps the upcoming HTC One. I've used and compared this phone against the Nexus 4, Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2. Of those the Note 2 is probably the best but just too big for me to be lugging around, loved the screen though.The One X+ however excels in so many areas that for me it is the best 'all around' phone. It has gobs of storage (64GB) is thin & light, a fantastic screen and great sound quality. No need for a case on this one also as the unibody design is solid, grippy and apparently you can pound nails with the Gorilla Glass 2 screen and not damage the phone. Nice to be able to have a phone that I can throw in my pocket 'naked' and not have to worry about it.The latest firmware update from AT&T; last week addressed a bunch of issues and now wifi & bluetooth work without a hitch and the battery lasts alllll day. Knowing that HTC has already committed to bring Android 4.2.2 and Sense 5 with Blinkfeed to this phone in June/July eases my obsolescence fears a bit.If you are interested in this phone be sure to go to an AT&T; store to try one out. The feel of it in your hand is unlike any other.Highly recommended. Oh, I bought it on Amazon from the seller Mobile Image and they were great. Shipped it quick, identified it properly and addressed all my post sale questions promptly.
