I bought this cell phone, only problem I had right at first was setting it right ! I went to a local Verizon store, where they help me set it properly, they did it for me free, took maybe 10 minutes, all they had to do, was do a data transfer from my old flip phone to newer Pantech Caper cell phone.What this did was transfer all of my old phones data, contacts & photo's. I thought at first I had lost all of that stuff, only thing we did was after the Verizon associate did something, we had to keep the phone close to each other, this new Pantech Caper cell phone has Blue tooth same as my old flip phone so they could talk to each other and transfer everything.Boy was I happy, I had a ton of phone numbers and emails, house address with cell / house phone numbers and everything you would ever think to have in the way of contacts on my flip phone, now I have on my Caper, plus I have all of my photo's too :o)I'm very happy with this newer cell phone, so far a lot easier to operate now than other cell phone, plus key pad a lot easier to text and type in info. The cell camera is adequate for the screen size, its not a fancy expensive cell phone, but for the money it is a pretty amazing pre paid cell phone. I would recommend anyone who wants a prepaid cell phone, not smart phone, but prepaid account like I have to buy this cell phone, I would buy another one in a heart beat, no second quessing that one :o)  if it had a data card it would be perfect just about :o)I have a lot of friends who own, fancier cell phones with expensive cell phone plans, I use my cell more for a phone than play games or texting and surfing the internet, I have a tablet for surfing the internet I have with me if I want to do that kind of thing, lot bigger screen and easier to see and do things.So this phone is just what I was looking for.
