I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now. I can say for the price on Amazon dont hesitate on this phone.I read many reviews before deciding to give it a try. The phone is well put together despite being made out of plastic and made in China, but not as good as my various SE phones, HTC phones and not as good as nokia e models (well, look and compare prices). I understand now why people called it cheaply made because when I press its buttons it makes little creaky sound, and that's exactly the result of the design ( 2 flat piece of plastic cover most the buttons and the keyboard), I dont mind this, the phone is stunning looking both on and off.The symbian s60 on this n85 is a really good. It will take some learning for all the short cuts but very nice compared to window mobile 6.1 on my htc wing phone. (the os did freeze one time in 2 weeks use and required battery removal)I'm from Orange county Calif, and the phone pick up satelite signal very very quickly, it feels just as fast as my garmin 680. Google map around here is better than Nokia map. But I dont use any GPS that much (returned the Garmin)Music player works just fine, FM transmitter work nicely, internet radio sound good. (have not try OTA radio)Camera is one of the things  I get this phone for and I'm happy with the result (Camera performance is not as snappy as SE). Video recording feature works beautifully, no freezing or zittering.Web capability is quite good, s60 browser is fast, even though I wish it has optical d pad as in say samsung innov8. Wifi is strong, no problem bluetooth connection with my motorola headset.Cell signal is strong and voice quality is typical good nokia phone.I recommend this phone. (Dont buy houses, cars...such an exciting time  to buy so called "cell phone")
