I purchased two of these phones while Verizon was still offering the Unlimited Data packages a few weeks ago.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received them.  Despite the fact that I have HUGE hands and thumbs.. I quickly overcame the size of the keyboard and was able to tap out texts as fast as I can now on my Droid.  The touchscreen was very impressive and responsive, as was the gesture bar.  While holding in one hand.. every operation was very accessible with that one hand.  The only item that I feel has a learning curve is the Palm OS.  I have not had a Palm since the VII days, so it took me a day or two of thoroughly exploring and researching the features to get the hang of it.  The phone itself is VERY solid feeling, and satisfying to use and hold.I suggest you immediately turn on "Developer Mode" and install "Preware".  Google the instructions.... this allows you to customize darn near every aspect of the phone to your liking, including on screen information, and change system behaviors as well, including OVERCLOCKING the already 600 Mhz processor.  Thank you to HP for allowing this access to this device, if only every manufacturer would be so open to us controlling our own devices.The ONLY downfall... is if you compare the Palm app store to the beefier Android and Apple stores... there's not TOO much of a selection, but definitely enough to please the average user.  This utilizes .jar files for games and apps, so don't expect a whole lot of detailed 3D games to appear on it.EXCELLENT buy.. even at the price I paid, $48.  My Mom and Brother now have these only  because I upgraded to a Droid... but I think I may pick up another of these for a spare.
