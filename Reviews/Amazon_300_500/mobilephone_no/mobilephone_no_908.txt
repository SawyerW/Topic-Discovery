What I expected when I bought this device was to finally have one device that I can use one device as a tablet and a phone. But what it ended up being was it was too small for a tablet and too big for a phone. This phone is uncomfortably big for it to be no longer a one hand device. Only when you lose the ability to use your phone one handed do you realize how much of an inconvenience it is. I already knew that size might be an issue and was fully prepared to deal with it for the ability to use it as a tablet. But disappointingly that was not to be.  The problem of using this as a tablet is the screen resolution (800 pixel width in portrait mode) is just not enough to read web pages and books(pdf). The text is slightly smudged when displayed on 800 pixel width display, but becomes really hard to read when that screen is 5.3 inches, 800 pixel width is perfectly fine on a larger(7 inch or bigger) tablet as the slightly smudged text would still be large enough to easily read, but not on 5.3 inch screen. I ended up using the landscape mode to read books and webpages, which made the point of having a device of this size pointless. I can do the same with no difference on a 4.5 inch screen too. The point I am trying to make is when I went for this device the expectation was to be able to read webpages and books in portrait mode without having to scroll, but the device resolution fails at this. So Samsung if you are reading this review, you have made the almost perfect all in one device, please bump up the resolution(width should have more than 1000 pixels ideally 1600x1000) of this device, other wise this would be a almost but not enough device.
