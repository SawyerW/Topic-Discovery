I am so disappointed this phone did not work out.  I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71, except for one essential.  Due to a hearing problem, I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100% of the time.  I tried this one in my pocket, and in a good quality waist/belt case, and could never feel it even though I'd just called it myself from our land line, and knew full well that it was ringing.  Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good?  Because I can't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option.  Even if I had good hearing in both ears, there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate (school, church, work meetings, etc.).  Without it, I consider there to be no reason to own it.  No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve, and really like it, but I'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one "be aware" item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option.  I don't know why, since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe.  But I was not deterred by that, and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone (I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it, and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line: except for the vibrator being very weak, this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating, and very likely 5 stars.
