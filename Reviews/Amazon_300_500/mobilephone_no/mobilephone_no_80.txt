Im a long time treo user and have had 2 600s, 2 650s, and a 680. I was happy with each and still have an old 650 (bigger than the 680 but has lasted so long I have to say it may be the overall best treo). I ordered this as an upgrade and because I found out I could use an external wifi card that fits into the mini sd slot. I was a bit worried about using Windows Mobile but willing to give it a try. The first one arrived but didnt work. Ive had the second one for a few months and must say the functionality and ease of use of the Palm OS was completely lost with the transition to Windows Mobile. It takes longer to get to applications, notifications appear and disappear too quickly (hanging up after a call can trigger the closing of any notification that comes as a result of the call you just made), the screen unlocks on its own at times and makes calls from my pocket, I cant see how long previous calls were for or what time they occurred at, the today screen is messy, and the mini sd slot is less usable than a full size sd slot (since I have plenty of sd cards but no mini sd cards). Alarms take more steps to set, I still dont know how to set shortcuts though I havent dedicated lots of time to trying, and the sync application is a pain in the butt. It took days and some creative computing to transfer my contacts from my 680 to my 750. Menus dont include the full set of options youd like to see. To lock the screen you have to exit out of any applicaiton you are using, return to the today screen, and then lock the screen. It has been an enormous disappointment. The rubber exterior is nice but other than that there is little difference in the hardware. Ive given up and just bought a replacement 680 on amazon a few minutes ago. If you are buying this because you like treos and are looking for an upgrade, I strongly advise against it.
