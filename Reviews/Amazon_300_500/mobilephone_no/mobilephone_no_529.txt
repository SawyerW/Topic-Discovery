Given that it was discontinued (and Palm basically only exists for tax purposes), I wasn't expecting much and therefore I am pleasantly surprised with the Palm Pixi Plus. I purchased this as a backup to my Droid X, which needed to be shipped in to my warranty provider to fix some issues. Initially, I was thinking I had made a mistake and wasted my money on this backup because it was extremely slow, has an extremely small screen, and a keyboard that is made for 13 year olds (aka people with really small fingers).However, after running the updater and settling into how webOS operates, it really isn't that bad of a phone and the keyboard/screen take some getting used to, but don't expect this to come even close to the experience provided by Android, iOS, or Windows phone (there's a reason Palm went under).Phone/Call Quality - 2/5 - I like the form factor as it really fits nice in the hand & pocket, but it weighs virtually nothing and has a terrible audio speaker (literally the worst I have ever heard on a cell phone from the past decade). Additionally, the "Silencer/Vibrate" button constantly slips down so basically I'll never be able to hear a ringtone or noise from it which is pretty annoying.webOS - 3/5 - for a virtually dead OS (it's open sourced), it runs decently and has some interesting ways of handling apps / gestures. However, I didn't realize this phone didn't get the webOS 2.0 update; therefore, it's two years old and less face it, outdated when compared to the current competitors. It still blows away any "feature/gimmick" phone that the major carriers offer and that alone makes it worth purchasing.Apps - 1/5 - Application support is minimal so don't expect to do much other than surf the web, check your Gmail, and maybe use a really cool Twitter app - that's all I've found literally. Google Maps has been replaced by HP/Bing and it's absolutely terrible, and all social networking apps outside of Twitter are terrible.Backup Potential - 5/5 - It's cheap, a smartphone with data connectivity, and some okay apps.Hey, for under $50 bucks, I can survive with this for a month or so and use it in case my primary phone breaks.
