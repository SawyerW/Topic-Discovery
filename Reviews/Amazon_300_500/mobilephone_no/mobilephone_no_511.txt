I've had this phone a week now. I replaced a Nokia 6102i and I wanted a phone that did not need a data plan with my provider. One drawback is that the text message interface is presented as conversations, so it's a little different when it comes to finding sent messages or saving messages. You can't delete the facebook, store, online games, and other "data" icons, although there is a provision to customize one of the three screens that opens when you swipe the lock screen. The ringtone is loud enough for me to hear from another room in the house but I'm not sure it would be for someone with much hearing loss, and it takes a couple of swipes to get to the menu where the ringtone volume can be turned up. Also, I had to work a couple of hours to find the MMS settings online since this is an unlocked phone that is not supported by my well-known cell service provider. That was the most difficult obstacle. On the plus side, the on-screen qwerty keyboard is good and the capacitive touch screen is exactly like that on an iPod touch once you turn off the vibration-on-touch feature. It's pretty much impossible to dial this phone inadvertently since the screen locks and can't be unlocked without a deliberate swipe. The camera is so much better than the one I had on my flip phone that I really can't complain. It came with a 2 GB mini SD and uses a Nokia proprietary charger with the tiny pin. It is not heavy at all and doesn't protrude from my pocket like I thought it might. It has Nokia's proprietary ringtones and provisions for adding additional ones. The music player is intuitive and the radio works with the headphones that come with the phone. It looks like the standby battery life is two or three days, a little shorter than what I had on my Nokia flip phone but perfectly acceptable.
