I am 67 years old.  My experience with Tracfone is absolutely the worst I haver ever had with a so called "service" provider.  I have returned the cellphones and canceled my airtime plan.  I am still out almost $30, not to mention the hours I spent with their inept support phone staff - and the grief.I tried to order 3 cellphones online, but didn't make the last click because the promised free shipping did not show.  So I called.  A woman named Sofia in Belize (you will visit various 3rd world countries dealing with the support staff) took my order and told me that even 'though the free shipping didn't show in the invoice, I would get the discount.Sure enough the next day I saw the full amount taken out of my bank account - no free shipping.So I called.  I was told that I could not be refunded cash.  I would have to get credit for airtime.When the phones arrived, it took hours to get one of them activated.  Then after one day, I lost service.  It took me another hour with 2 different support staff to discover that when the phones were shipped, the sim cards had been switched.  So I had to switch them back.  After one day, I lost service again.  I was told the SIM card was defective; I would have to wait 3-5 days for a replacement.Meanwhile I tried to activate the 2nd phone.  I was told again the SIM card was defective.  I had to wait for a replacment.I believe I spent 10 hours altogether with the support staff.  Every time I called I had to spell out my name, address, etc.  - and tell the whole story all over again.Finally when I decided to send back the phones and end my relationship with dysfunctional Tracfone, I was told I had to pay for the return shipping; and they do not refund for airtime (I had joined their "value plan").  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND FORGET YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT TRACFONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
