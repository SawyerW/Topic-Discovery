This product is not really ready for release: the phone shuts off without warning. I've had the device for two weeks, and it has shut down ten or more times. The software appears to still be in the beta stage. This is intolerable for a business phone. Moreover, the device was shipped with an installed memory card that contained a number of applications and 4 of the 6 installed themes. What manufacturer installs themes and applications on the memory card? This is just careless and sloppy. Additionally, the battery is so tightly placed that one can't remove it with a fingernail. One has to tap it hard upon the palm the get it out. Things like this just show that this is not yet a properly developed business phone.UPDATE: May 15, 2012:Shortly after the review given above, I shoved this phone into a drawer and moved on. Periodically, however, I would remove it, update the software that Nokia continued to provide, find that the phone was still unstable, then put it back into the drawer. About six month ago I took it out and found that there was another update: amazing, since this phone came out around mid 2009. After that update, the phone finally became stable, and I started to use it. A few days ago, another update came (Version 091.033.c00.01). My God, Nokia is still updating after almost three years. I now use the phone as one of my daily devices (the other is the inimitable N9). The E52 is fantastic. Granted, it is not for avid video watching: the screen is small. However, it is fast, has free navigation with text-to-speech voice navigation, voip support, Skype from Nokia Store, Gravity, et al. I notice that it is now only available as a used device. Too bad. It took Nokia more than two years to finally get it right - perhaps that is why they have struggled of late, yet if you need a solid, small, light-weight business phone, get this device!
