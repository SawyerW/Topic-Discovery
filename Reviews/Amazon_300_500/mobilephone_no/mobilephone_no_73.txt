The keys are made up of very thin plastic and crack if hit wrong; went to the AT&T; store to find the store model also has cracked keys.The keys not only break easily with minor usage but are very crammed and you will find yourself punching in more numbers then desiredThe screen also isn't very well protected and very exposed which will most likely lead to future damageThe whole body and frame is made of plastic and feels cheap and flimsyMemory card has to be a special one for sony phones only and are alot more pricey than the storage disk for competitor phonesNo flash on cameraBottom LineIf you aren't a perfectionist, texter, or cellphone gamer and are looking for a cheap phone with incredible technology and mp3 playback and don't mind if the phone is cracked up this is the phone for you. If you are one of the previously mentioned look to the new lg shine cu720 slider phone offering almost all of the same functions in a stainless steel body and keys. It may be more expensive but it is worth it. It was not in sony's best interest to produce such a top of the line phone from a technological stand point and then skimp on the materials, they should of charged a little more to make a more durable, less delicate phone.
