I have to add my two-cents worth to the other glowing reviews for this phone.  I just received it yesterday and I am very happy with it.  Very solid and expensive looking with a great (AMOLED I think) display.  I am particularly impressed that the steel back cover is so rigid - yet the phone isn't too heavy.  Call quality is good and it was a cinch to import the contacts from my Nokia E71.  The screen is (finally!) glass - I had an N97-Mini for a couple of months and I did not care for the resistive-touch and plastic screen.  To me, it is a little small for comfortable e-mail reading - and I would say that it is too small for surfing the internet.  I have to say, though, that it's Symbian OS is a little bit of a pain to navigate - perfect example is checking remaining space on your micro-SD card - who would think that you would find that under Applications / Office / File Manager?  But I can live with Symbian's annoyances to in order to get a great little phone with a beautiful display - for half the price of a plastic device from one of the other makers.*********************** Added on June 21, 2011 **************************I've had this phone for another week+ and I just want to reiterate what a great little device it is!!  Battery life is great and it recharges quickly.  I've carried it on many evening walks and it shows zero wear and tear - thanks to it's metal construction and glass display.  It's my primary phone for calls between Germany and the US and I've had zero dropped calls or other call-related problems.  And, much to my surpise, once I downloaded the new Ovi Store - I found there are quite a few good free games on Ovi - Angry Birds Seasons, Rio, Monopoly, car racing, you name it - I was really pleasantly surprised!!  This continues to be a compact and very well-built smartphone - I highly recommend it.*********************** Added on November 6, 2011 ************************The Nokia C6-01 continues to be a superb phone.  Still runs like a top and looks like new - despite another four+ months of carrying around and using. Another advantage I really like is it supports both AT&T; and T-Mobile 3G bands in the States - and works here in Germany with Telekom.  Last but not least - I like it so much that I've ordered a second one for my wife to use. Keep in mind though - this phone isn't for you if you want a large screen to surf the internet or check FB.  It's a great phone with super battery life and a very clear screen.
