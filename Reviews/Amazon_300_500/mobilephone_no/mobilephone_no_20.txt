So far, I'm very happy with the phone.  But I'm writing this review to warn everyone of AT&T Wireless' horrible number porting service.  I've had my phone since December 6th and am still waiting to get my number ported!  Even though they haven't done the port in over the month, AT&T Wireless actually had the audacity to already send me a bill!  So, not only can I not receive phone calls on my new phone yet (I have to carry around the old one with my still-active T-Mobile service), but I'm also being billed by both vendors!  I cannot believe that AT&T is already billing me fully on half a service!To give you an idea of my AT&T wireless nightmare: I've tried to call their PAG (Portability Administration Group) at least 20 times in the past month.  Most of the time, I can't even get through and give up after 2 hours on hold.  But on the 5-6 occasions that I have gotten through and explained my situation, I've always been assured that the problem would be rectified soon.  Well, that has yet to be the case.  As I speak, I'm on hold yet again - this time, I'm going to insist on talking to a supervisor (but I don't have much hope that this will make any difference :-(  So, I'm stuck in this hell hole.When I called customer service to find out whether I could cancel my service - they told me that I would probably be charged an early cancellation fee since the service WAS activated (despite the fact that I can't receive phone calls on AT&T WS) and that I would have to write a dispute letter when I do get charged.In summary: AT&T Wireless may be ok for totally new activations without number porting, but they've got to have the most inept number portability group among all the major carriers (for comparison, a friend had his number ported from Cingular to T-Mobile within a couple days!)
