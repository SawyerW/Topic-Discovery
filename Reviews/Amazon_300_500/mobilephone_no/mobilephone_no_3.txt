Well first of all let me say when I first got the thing..i couldn't put it down...for three days straight..this phone is freakin awesome...most of the time...yes i have had the prob with the earpiece..the thing just doesnt direct sound very well is all..you realize you're off and adjust a bit and you're fine..i dont know what ppl are talking about when they say poor picture quality...what do you expect from a camera that's smaller than a dime..the thing is really quite amazing..and 640x480 really isn't something to scoff at..it'll take some great photos...where this phone has really failed me is reception and overall service..let me just say sprint is a pos...if at all possible..stay away from them...it's very unfortunate that such an awesome phone must be tied to such a horrible service...dropped calls all over the place..and that free and clear digital buisness? it just means that rather than hearing static, you'll just hear the phone cut out periodically..i don't know if their network is weak here in So. Cal or what but i can have to walk about 20 ft away from my house to get a signal. and the data transfer? FORGET ABOUT IT...I've never been so frustrated with my text mesaging in my life...the thing will lead you in circles and not get a single thing done..Personally I plan to switch to ATT mMODE will do the same things better than PCS vision ever could. The ring tones are awesome, but a bit of a ripoff at 1.50 a piece...the ringer itself i did have a problem with: when set to high, the polyphonic tones will crackle and come out sounding not all that great. Also one last note...the more things that are packed into a phone, the higher the chance that they will break...I used to have my trusty old-school nokia and i could dropkick the thing, dunk it, and it wouldn't phase it in the slightest..I left the 8100 in my pocket when i fell asleep and when i woke up, the screen was dead...when the screens did work though they were incredible..when i flipped open my phone for the first time the display took my breath away. The sub-lcd is pretty trick also; the photo color id is one of the coolest things the phone does...overall here's what i thought of the phone:Pro's:Chocked full of features,nifty camera takes nice picsvery vivid color displays, some of the best available.Con's:Horrible service and supportQuestionable qualityVerdict: An overall great phone that just happens to be paired with a not-so-great service. If you don't absolutly need the clamshell, go with the Nokia 3650; you'll get a better service with ATT and it'll do everything the 8100 will and more...
