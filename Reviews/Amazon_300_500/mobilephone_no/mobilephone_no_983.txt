Okay. For starters, I  ordered this phone 10/20/13 and received it on Halloween 10/31/13. Whoo hoo!!! It took only 10 days included weekends to come from China To NY so that's a Plus. When i received it, it came with everything it said it would (2 batteries, flip case/screen protector, Rubber skin case, 1 back covers for the back of actual phone, Charger  - with usb and plug port separate and of course the phone). **Key Note must put in SimCard to turn it on or else a little green Andriod will be displayed with his body lookin like he is missing something and a red caution sign will appear**This phone Can WORk WITH ONE SIM CARD so don't believe the hype about the phone has to have 2 sims to work because thats what i did and it works. (I Only have One ATT Sim card) In addition, Apps are easy to install,  Back Camera Works very fine, Front Camera is poor quality looks very dull even when Bright lighting and can not be adjusted  by the settings like the Back  Camera. Otherwise this would be my ONLY pet peave.As for the actual screen size, It is alil bigger than specified. The screen is a 5.5 inch screen rather than a 5.3 inch which does kinda make a difference if you had a desired case that would fit a samsung galaxy note 3; This phone would not fit because it would be slightly too big. Otherwise, this phone's response to commands are even Faster than the blink of an eye. Its probably faster than any phone with a Brand name.Overal, l I love this phone despite the Front camera's dullness which i'm kind of sad about.BUY BUY BUY!!! I would say. Unless your a Front camera person then I would advise you to maybe look for a better one.
