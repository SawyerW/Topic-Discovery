This phone was my first foray into the android arena... I am not a heavy phone user and my needs are very simple.  for the most part I like this phone and it meets my immediate needs.Profile... Fits in my front shirt pocket or pants pocket quite comfortably. easy to pop the back off to access the battery or insert memory card.Keyboard...  I can type a message on the virtual keyboard without fat fingering the other keys. (medium sized hands)email... easy to set up and sync with many different types of accounts.  I had issues with my godaddy account, but a free application in the android marketplace solved that problem.Web... I don't do much web surfing on the phone other than to look up addresses and phone numbers.  This phone is OK for that.Blue-tooth... music streaming works flawlessly in my car but the sound quality varies.  I am not sure if it is because of the quality of the music file or issues with the bluetooth hardware in the phone; but it does come in at cd quality for the most part.  Voice quality is decent based on what people on the receiving end tell me, but when calls come in, they are frequently interrupted with static and garbled popping noise (it's not my speakers).Music Player... I use spotify and the application works perfectly; the built in music player also works great for playing music as well.performance.... This phone is average when it comes to performance.  It is prone to lag and will randomly stall.  It doesn't happen often, but then again I am not a heavy phone user.  Battery life is just ok... do not expect it to last longer than a day if you have wifi / gps turned on.Overall assessment.  Decent phone for the $$$ that I will probably keep for awhile provided nothing happens to it.
