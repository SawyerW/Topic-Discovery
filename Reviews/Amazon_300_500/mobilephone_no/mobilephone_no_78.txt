I got this phone yesterday and I returned it today.  I did my homework before going to the store and I had narrowed my decision to 2 phones (an LG and a different model Nokia).  However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the "sophisticated" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having. Based on my experience thus far, and the reviews I saw online, I took it back today and got the phone I originally was going to get. I hear Nokia is a generally a good brand, but unfortunately I am a bit scarred after this experience.
