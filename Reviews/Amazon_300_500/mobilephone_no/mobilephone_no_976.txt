Pro's - Great Display, Visually appealing. Sound Quality is good. Desktop response is good and fluid, comes with Two Batteries and Two Back Covers, one with a Flap Front Cover Attachment. Really nice. The device looks great in Hand. Looks like the Galaxy Note II(Knockoff) But Very Nicely Done. Great response from the Soft Keys next to the Physical Home Button on the Device. Camera Front/Back Take Nice Pics however not high quality. But pics would hold up as nice or decent.Con's - My Biggest issue was the Device l noted this in the description "3G/4G - 850/2100 bands. Fully compatible with at&t;, straight Talk & Net10 at 2G/3G/4G. Compatible with T-Mobile & Simple Mobile at 2G. For Straight Talk, Trac fone, Simple Mobile or Net 10 will requires a manual APN setup."However its not 4G Compatible on TMobile Network, took a few days to configure as the Software kept crashing and stating the option was not available try again later. Took an additional Day to configure Texting to Send. You have to lock the screen if you are making a call and holding the phone to your head as the touch screen interferes with the functionality of the call, often dropping the speaker so you can't hear. The Battery Takes a considerable amount of time to charge, and of course drains moderately fast with normal daily use.I also found the Home/Menu Button is non responsive at times. Having to receive more then a few pushes. The Cameras need Ample Light to be used. Does not work well at all in Low Light even with a light shining directly on you. The light has to be Ambient or Room Lit, So no Web Chatting in Bed.Phone Cover gets in the way of Car Phone Holder, I just leave it open so I can see the screen.All in All. A very good device for the money spent. I will do some research on the 4.1.1 software issues and Rooting as the device is not rooted. Hopefully that will correct some of the quirkiness.
