Purchased the 701 not long ago and it's wonderful! Very stylish and elegant and it's easy to use . Belle is great for people who r not accustomed to Symbian , and it's every bit the equal of Android or the Iphone ! Plus it's very powerful ; great connectivity ( works on 3g anywhere in the world , plus wifi bluetoith 3.0 , etc ) , effective file manager , office apps , superb photo and video  editors , u get the idea ! Even the EDOF gen 2 8 mp camera is good , though not as good as autofocus . Be that as it may , the Nokia 701 is a powerful and easy to use smartphone and I highly reccomend it !!Update 3-22-2012The 701 was great until something went wrong wrong during a factory reset , due to a bad app ... This is no reflection on Nokia though ! Smartphones r computers and these things happen occasionally . I still stand by what I said earlier .I`d purchase another but I`m waiting on the 808 PureView!!!! :))) edit 3-27-2012Actually , changed my mind , will get another 701 AND the 808 PureView when it comes out !One thing I need to add here is that , the way Nokia USA explained it to me is that if u buy a non USA phone , such as the 700 or 701 , from a USA retailer , they will honour the 1 year warranty . The catch is , if it`s non repairable , since Nokia doesn`t sell symbian smartphones in the USA anymore , they will send u one of the original S3 units , which is a steep downgrade ( r u listening  Nokia ? ).. nothing I can`t handle ! I`m trading the C6-01 they sent me for another 701 !
