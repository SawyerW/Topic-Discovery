I got this phone for my dad since he has large fingers and could not manage the small buttons on most phones, as well as he wanted to use more than one SIM (same service provider) at once.After 6+ months of use here are our findings:Pros:1. Has all the major functions of a Samsung phone: great camera with flash, easy setup for email client, loud ringing volume.2. Large screen with large numbers for dialing.3. Came unlocked as advertised with no scratches, nicks or dents- was brand new in the plastic with all accessories and manual.Cons:1. It is Dual SIM Standby NOT Dual SIM Active- we found this out the hard way when customers started complaining about not getting us, not even voice mail. The settings function by forwarding the calls of the inactive SIM to the active SIM. This may incur carrier charges for some persons. The alternative to this is to deactivate the call forwarding by going to the settings and deactivating "Dual SIM always on" and selecting one SIM card to act as the primary SIM while the other acts as the data SIM. This is a waste if you are using two different carriers to minimize on off-network calls (as in our case).2. The processor is EXTREMELY slow. It freezes when you try to hang up from calls or even when searching your contact list. Don't expect it to save you when those 2 seconds count.3. The phone automatically designates the SIM not in use as on standby. If this is not remedied, it will send calls to voicemail or will not give the caller a response.These are what we have noticed thus far. I gave it three stars (and not two) because it still functions somewhat with the two SIM cards even though it's not the way we would have liked it. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
