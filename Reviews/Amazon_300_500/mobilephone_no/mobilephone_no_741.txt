First things first: I didn't buy this exact model of the phone, rather I bought the Virgin Mobile version of this sold in RadioShack.The phone itself is pretty darn good.  I love the form factor which is refreshing in today's world where cells are almost the size of tablets.  The phone is about the size of my wallet which is pretty good.  The weight isn't too bad, but there is something uncomfortable with the phone that I can't put my finger on (pun intended).  Typing on this (using Swype) for longer than 5 minutes gives me some sort a wrist ache, but it just might be my unfamiliarity the phone.Touch screen is responsive, and perhaps slightly oversensitive. There are times a slight brush of my finger is interpreted as a click.  The screen colors are pretty good, but of course for it's form factor fairly small.  Be prepared to do a lot of scrolling on this device.Apps-wise, all apps seem to run properly on my device.  Occasionally Android Market crashes when browsing, I can't pinpoint the exact reason why but it's a software bug.  There's a crapload of crud apps installed on the phone by Virgin Mobile and HTC that you can't remove (unless rooted).  This is definitely  a con.The battery is quite good, contrary to what others have mentioned.  In sleep, with data off and wifi on, battery discharge is about 1% per hour.  With intermittent heavy use, it'll last 2 days easily, with light use probably 4 days.I'm quite pleased with the product.  I give it 4/5 stars.  If the software were better (e.g. without the crapware) I'd have give it 5/5.That being said, I've only had the phone for a week now, my opinions might change after a few weeks, if so I'll update this post.  Futhermore, Moto Triumph might be a better phone for VM customer as the processor is one generation newer (this one's processor is more than 2 generations old at the time of this posting).
