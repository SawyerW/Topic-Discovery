First off, if money is hurting you, then look for another phone. But if you can afford to shell out $700, then the SGS2 unlocked is perhaps the only phone that can justify it.**Camera---best i've seen on a smartphone (barely beating iphone 4)...**Screen---vibrant colors on the samoled+ w/o the pixelated effects on the regular samoled. the 4.25 isn't too big or too small for my taste. although i must add that it looks bigger in real life than it does in the video reviews.**Form factor---Very slim, incredibly lightweight, takes a little getting used to bc the size-thickness ratio. almost feels like holding some type of card...really wish they would have used a smooth battery cover instead of textured.**Build quality---despite the fact the its form and plastics make it seem cheap, it actually feels pretty solid. the batter cover is made of some type of material that makes it very flexible w/o snapping.**Dual core cpu---smooth. but what can I say for 1.2Ghz dual core? other than that, you wouldn't really notice much else difference from a 1Ghz single core...for now anyways.**Media---Codecs that let you play DivX, Xvid, among others is great. Havent really tested games on here, so cant comment on that. DLNA is cool, but I miss the HDMI out.**Battery---I've heard horror stories about the 1650mAh battery life, but I honestly havent seen any worse performance compared to other HTC/Samsung/Moto android smartphones. YMMV**Software---GB 2.3.3 on there with touchwiz 4. TW4 is really starting to grow on me, but I wish it had more and better widgets like an rss news feed, or a friends feed that blends twitter and fb together. Although TW4 widgets look really pretty, some stuff like the keyboard needs more refinement. idk why the call log would display sms sent/received...weird stuff like that are found here and there on the UI...also the app tray SUCKS.**Storage---got the 16gb. VERY HAPPY that it has 16gb internal with a micro sd slot for more. i threw in an old 16gb in there for a total of 32gb. allows it to be a media powerhouse.**Speaker---very loud, yet crisp. HUGE step up from my nexus s 4G.All in all, i'm satisfied with the purchase. not VERY satisfied, but satisfied...however considering the price i paid, that says a lot. this phone is definitely the best android phone out there right now, and if they touch up TW4, it will be the king of the hill until the next generation of sgs launches...4 stars only bc of the price and UI isn't complete...sorry for the lengthy review ;-)
