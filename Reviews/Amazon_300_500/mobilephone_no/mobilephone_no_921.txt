This thing is a total powerhouse. With specs that make average range laptops look obselete, you're essentially carrying around a mini computer. The new Ice Cream Sandwich UI coming out with this makes it even more sweeter, adding more user customization and making this phone more about YOU.The S-Voice is still pretty buggy, but considering its still brand new we can speculate that Samsung will be further improving this aspect to be on par with Apple's Siri.Google Maps actually ended up being DROPPED by Apple, for reasons I've yet to research. However as far as I know, Apple will take YEARS to make their mapping system as good as Google's. Bad decision in my opinion for Apple, which makes me lean towards the new Android phones even more.I also think this Gorilla Glass 2 hype is rather over-exaggerating itself in the community. This stuff is pretty scratch resistant to the point you wouldn't need a screen protector, but like with any glass it CAN be cracked, especially on the S III unfortunately. Dropping this thing on it's side in any way will most likely send a multitude of cracks from the impact point to the middle of the screen. Being dropped on the face or back won't do very much though. I'd recommend getting some kind of silicone case for it, NOT hard plastic (that stuff does nothing when it comes to impacts). Otterbox already has designs for the Commuter version for the S III, which features a silicone base with a hard plastic outside, which is more than enough protection.At any rate if you're looking for something with a stable Android OS (with MORE battery life than other Androids) and a lot of power, go for this. The price is definitely worth it, and as with almost all Android phones its got the expandable memory by buying a cheap MicroSD card and a replaceable battery.
