I love the size and that it can it do what I need (at least it could for the first 3 months--call, text, email, occasional facebook, and it gets great signal) for a reasonable price. However, I'm very disappointed in its quality. I have only had the phone for about 4 months, and it's functionality has become extremely frustrating.1.) The TEXT MESSAGING application is often quite slow and is CONTINUALLY FREEZING and calling for a "force close", which cannot be reopened until the phone is restarted. Just yesterday morning, over the course of three hours, I had to restart my phone at least 4 times because the texting app and/or the phone itself froze.2.) Two weeks ago it just stopped reading my SD CARD, saying that there was an error. I went out and bought a new SD card and two days later said the same thing. (Deleting all my photos in the process, by the way)3.) I hate that you CANNOT DELETE/UNINSTALL APPS on it. That is so stupid! Plus, it comes with several apps pre-installed, many of which I don't use or have no clue what they are; I would just like to delete them and clear my phone from stuff I don't use. But I can't. (I admit, I'm not the tech-savviest person in the world, but even my techy friends haven't been able to figure it out.) So, don't download apps you're not sure you want to keep forever. :)4.) The CAMERA kind of sucks. The quality is poor and the color is way off.5.) At least a few times a week I notice it RANDOMLY RESTARTING itself without me even touching it.I don't ask too much of a phone, and my phones can never complain of being overworked. I look for fairly simple functionality, and I absolutely loved this phone at first--it could do everything I needed and more and for a price I could afford. However, less than 4 months is simply INEXCUSABLE for a phone's functionality to drop so quickly. I'm very disappointed with it and would not buy this phone again unless it could be proven that I don't have shitcake phone but rather a technological curse.
