i am on tmobile and had a dash for about 2 and a half years before the e63.  i did not want to go on contract for 2 more years but wanted to keep my relatively low priced voice and data plan.  i strongly considered the bb 8900, but i think a d pad is more reliable than a trackball. as for the 3g dash or other wm phone, i am tired of waiting for windows mobile to improve.  i do not care about 3g since i need a phone primarily for business usage and want battery endurance for mostly pda and call functions.i have had the e63 for several weeks and am very happy with this phone. compared to the dash, the e63 runs faster, nicer screen, better reception for both voice and data.since my internet provider does not work with the nokia messaging service, i set up a gmail account for the nokia service to forward my pop email accounts.bluetooth connectivity works well.for me, multimedia functions are lagniape and work fine.  youtube (latest update), preloaded internet radio and mp3 look and sound surprisingly well with my headphones or an audio cable to my car's speakers.  mundu provides additional internet radio. i also recommend google maps, opera mini, skyfire, and neoreader (someday the us will use this more).modem/tethering gets 3x faster throughput than the dash, better than dsl.reception/bars/sound quality on both ends are much better than the dash.  tmobile does not have the best coverage, and black hole areas are still black holes--my job takes me to many rural areas.  however, the e63 has better reception overall than the dash--the black holes are a little smaller.volume could be a little louder but is adequate.  speakerphone is a little weak, but i do not really use this function.it did take me a while to learn the menus; but after a few weeks, i navigate pretty quickly.  after a learning curve, i am much happier with the e63 than the dash.
