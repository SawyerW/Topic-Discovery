I bought this phone for my husband in January and another one for myself in March.  That shows how much I like this phone.  Beyond everyone's ravings, here are some points from my personal experience with the phone:1. battery life is not as long as claimed in the product info.  My husband's phone lasts about 2.5 to 3 days with one full charge.  He uses it for  voice calls only with about 30 minutes daily talk time.  I typically get more functions of my phone with usually 10-20 short phone calls, a dozen text messages, 10-30 minutes podcast and checking emails with wifi 3 to 5 times a day.  My phone's battery indicator gets down to the last 2 bars by the end of day.  So I have been charging it daily.2. Good language support but less ideal than iPhone.  I bought the North American version so the phone comes with English, French and Spanish.  I was able to install Asian fonts on both my phones without much hassle.  My iPhone came with the option to change languages out of box.Notwithstanding the above, I truly appreciate the beauty and functionality of the phone - otherwise I wouldn't have bought two!Update 6/13/09: we have been living in China and Europe for the past several months and use the E71s with local service providers (the beauty of an unlocked phone!).  The phone performance seems to deteriorate:  the phone would turn off by itself - sometimes in the middle of a call about at least once a week.  Occasionally, I can hear the other side fine but the other side can't hear me.  Not sure whether this is a network compatibility issue.  I have been trolling websites to find cures - some suggest doing a complete software upgrade.  I am seriously considering it even though I may have to spend more time to configure it the way I like.
