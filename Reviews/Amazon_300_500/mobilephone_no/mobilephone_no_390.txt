PROS:* More key features to explore than time. Example: Does some scientific calculator functions like conversions, Trig,  has games etc* Difficult to use so probably can't drive and text. This is a good thing* Bluetooth works quite well so hands free calling in a car is really nice with a headset or car's call center* Phone is OK for texting and telephone use if one learns the keyboard functions/buttons and is careful when entering data not to hit wrong key* Like the programmable auto key lock feature to prevent pocket dialing* Battery life seems real good* Raised rating a bit because with experience and patience, using the phone customized for your menuchoices, is pretty good.CONS:* Over 100 page manual requires a geek to get thru. So many menus, so little time.* Duplicate, identical functions on various keys, easy to get on the internet by mistake.* Internet is sooooo slow, don't plan on using it. Probably the reason for triple minutes. Took about two minutes to get to Google.* Can't read the display of web pages, too small of a display. Zoom then needs key selector as a mouse, quite clumsy.* Extra buttons on slide out keyboard to learn. Hitting the wrong one either can delete text or put you on the internet.* No touch screen capability to ease use. Knew that going in.* Camera images seem about as good as old tv sets, not crisp images. Needs good lighting.* T400G came with ATT service. For my years of Tracfone use T-Mobile has been excellent so got new SIM card from Tracfone with T-Mobile network. Tracfone easy to work with.* Because I loaded a year card will use the time on this phone before considering discarding.* Within a day ordered an LG800 for the wife to get a simpler keyboard/touchscreen. Good choice for a simpler interface. Even so Internet of Tracfone is terribly slow.
