Like the others here, I've found AT&T to be somewhat bothersome.  True, they have gotten better after the Cingular thing in terms of customer service, but I'm wary still.  Despite their add campaign saying that the service is better, I still don't get any signal in my office.As for the phone, it's pretty cool.  The display is pretty hard to see during the daylight, that can't be denied.  I'm ok with that though.  What I don't like is how, especially with the special ring tones, the phone will receive a call, light up, and then wait 5 seconds before it makes any noise or vibration.  It's not a big deal if you're looking at your phone, but if it's in your pocket, it's already been ringing for 1 or 2 rings on the other person's side before you even know you've got a call.  Also, it has flat out crashed on me a handful of times in the last 6 months of ownership.  When I say crash, think of when computers crash - it won't do anything until I take the battery out to turn it off, but it back and then turn it back on.  I've also had intermittent problems with buttons not working unless I press them at just the right angle and things like that.Last week though, the thing went completely dead.  I couldn't turn it on, it didn't light up when it was on its charger, nothing worked.  After a few days, it started working again.  Maybe I have a loose connection somewhere, I don't know.  AT&T sent a replacement overnight to me for a twenty five dollar processing fee - although they overnighted it to the wrong address (due to a really bad customer service person on the phone) and I got it 6 days later.Anyway, the Bluetooth is cool, it talks to my computer and transfers contacts and calendar items and pictures and all sorts of stuff.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd probably get this phone again, but I'd think really long and hard about AT&T.
