Ok they call it a phone, but it is a pocket computer, really. I mostly use web browse, email, skype, and work photos on the screen, listen to the radio, play music and watch a little bit of video and so on. The size makes all this so easy, I think the size is perfect for a pocket-computer that also has a phone in it. To be honest, phone conversations are probably 2% of the use on my little marvel ;-)The iPhone is just to small for me and the iPad is way to big. IPad mini (copied the Galaxy Tab) doesn't fit in your pocket but this Note II sure does fit ok  in mine, without a problem. I do have big pockets, yes, ok.And since I like to read longer articles, the iphone just didn't cut it beyond a paragraph. This screen size is just perfect for on the go reading. It gives you about half the reading surface of a kindle. Reading a book I'd recommend the Samsung 800, Kindle or a mini iPad, both perfect reading sizes. But for shorter reading periods such as an 8-15 page article, this will do great on the go.Pros: Great screen size for a pocket computer. Makes everything so much easier than on the iPhone.Cons: Teflon-like body. I did drop it and break the screen because it slipped out of my hands as I was carrying several things. Its not teflon but that's how I think of it. Be careful. The screen is fragile.Camera is ok, but not great. the iPhone camera is a better quality. But I always carry around a small real camera anyway. You know, in my other pocket.This phone is on the big side for my runs. I think the iPhone is a bit large for that as well, but easier to hold.There are a lot of things you can push and I had to get used to not pressing something erroneously. But a minor quibble.And yes I am over forty years of age. Size matters, as they say in Texas.In short, can't speak for everyone but I like it a lot!
