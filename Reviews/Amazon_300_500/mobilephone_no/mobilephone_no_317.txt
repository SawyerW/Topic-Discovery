I own N82 - phone I purchased at Amazon as well and have been very happy with. I purchased N8 before Thanksgiving at $429 to be able to access T-Mobile 3G and get better GPS and camera, as well as larger screen and touch interface.I like N8, but I wish I waited with the switch until the firmware upgrade is available.The phone has some issues that are mostly software, not hardware related based on my exchanges with Nokia and reading various forum postings.The most annoying one is this phone's refusal to stop searching for WiFi when requested manually. I've never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it. I'll use my N82 as a backup with other SIM cards when travelling. Again, I wish I waited till they resolve various bugs. I always liked Nokia and it is so dissappointing to see that they cannot get their act together. In Nokia Support forums Nokia reps are missing. This would have been great opportunity for the company to address some of the above mentioned issues. The fact that they are silent speaks volumes to their customer service committment.
