First of all I was surprised that people will do a review to a device they never used. I personally waited until I received it from Nikon USA about a week ago, used it for a while, then I thought about writing the review.I have a Blackberry Curve 8300 and I own an iPod touch (3d Gen), I never owned a Nokia phone before, and I feel very comfortable and amazed by many of the features on the Nokia N8. The hardware of this device is exceptional, in my opinion. The camera, HDMI, USB connectivity are all very nice features. The screen resolution, although not as high as an iPhone but felt that it is more than enough for me. I edited images and watched videos on this device with no problems at all, the quality was excellent. This device comes with an internal 16Gb memory + a micro SD card slot (up to 32 Gb additional memory), more than $200 cheaper than the iPhone.The software and operating system though have some room for improvement. Although operating the phone was simple and mostly straight forward, but some features could be better, such as the calendar (operational but can be improved in terms of its look and ease of use) and selecting/copying/pasting text (a feature that I still don't know how to do on the N8 but was simple and easy on the iPod).I looked for the following options when I thought about buying a new phone:1- Price: the price shouldn't be inflated2- Calendar Sync with MS Outlook: essential for my work and everyday use3- Good music player: I have a bunch of lectures and songs that I rely mainly on my phone in my car while traveling (I currently use an audio tape with cord) - The N8 has the FM transmitter feature which is very useful too (I was able to play a small movie for my kids on the phone and let them hold the phone in the back seat with no cables .. they considered it cool!)4- WiFi connectivity: I'm not a big fan of the data plans!5- Nice contact manager: Nice one on the N8 - the Ovi Suite Synced my contacts and my calendar easily and in a very simple way.There are a bunch of other features that I still did not explore on the phone (GPS, HDMI, Voice commands ...etc), but those I presented were the most important ones and the N8 did a great job to address all of my needs.In summary, I believe that Nokia is in the right track with touch screen interface, the OS is operating finely and have very nice features too, shortcuts, widgets, customizable home screens (3) all of those are working in a slick and smooth manner.The phone signal is working well, the call quality is excellent, people have been commending the quality of voice when I call them too.In one sentence: Excellent job Nokia.
