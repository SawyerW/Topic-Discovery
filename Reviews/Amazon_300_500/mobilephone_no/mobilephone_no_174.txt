I upgraded from an 8125 smart phone. Had Windows mobile 5. This phone has 6.5. Found features removed from the OS, like alarm snooze and reminder snooze. There doesn't seem to be a way to control how long you want something to snooze. It's always 5 min. A few other minor features removed.For having a 500 MGH processor, it is unexpectedly slow. Not aggravating though.I don't talk on it much and I have to charge it about every 4 days. 5 to 6 days on the 8125.It doesn't take standard USB cable. Why did they change this? I guess so you have to buy their special cable. UNNECESSARY! Expect to pay for more hardware.I like the help feature. The manual is built in, and searchable.The voice recognition/command feature is AWESOME. No more recording voice dial. The phone can dial anyone in contacts by saying their name. Programs can be activated by voice. Just say "Open Excel". The phone retrieves all of my Excel files, so I can choose which one I want to open. Say "When's my next apt." The phone speaks back to you when your next apt. is! NICE!Can connect to multiple blue tooth devices. Nice feature.WiFi burns a lot of battery power. WiFi internet is slow. Phone "Microsoft IE" is heavy on the OS, processor and memory. Poor performance. Web pages see the phone as if it's a regular computer.Love the quick access of programs. Program tab is VERY customizable.Touch keyboard is great. Accepts "fat fingers" well. I love how slim the phone is and has the slide out keyboard. Slide out is missing some important symbol keys.This is another pocket PC. A laptop in your pocket. SO FUNCTIONAL. Not a perfect phone, but overall I think it's great. Very comparable to the Iphone. You can replace the battery on this phone. When the battery dies on an Iphone, you have to throw away the phone.
