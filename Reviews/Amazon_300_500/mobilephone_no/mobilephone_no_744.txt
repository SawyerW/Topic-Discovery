I really, really like this phone. It's my first android phone, and it got me used to all of the stuff about Android phones. I'll probably buy another phone to replace this soon, but this is one of those phones I'll always hold dear to my heart.The screen is small, so I use the MessagEase keyboard with this phone, because that has really big keys and I can type a lot faster than with a tiny qwerty keyboard. I think I'm faster at typing now on this phone than my old phone with predictive text, and I was pretty fast before.I really like the directional button in the middle bottom. I'm really not ready to go 100% to a touch screen, plus the directional button makes using applications like Kindle for Android a lot easier to secretly use during boring meetings than if I had to swipe the screen every time I wanted to turn a page.It slowed down a lot for me as soon as I put a bunch of applications and other stuff on it, so I had to be pretty vigilant about cleaning off the stuff I didn't use from this phone. There's only 256 MB of memory total for the phone to use, and not everything can be moved to the SD card. I actually cleared all of the apps that I had on the SD card that I didn't use, too, and that made my phone run a little faster. So basically, if you buy this phone for your grandma, you should clean it up for her every six months or so.If I ever buy a friend a phone, it's going to be this one.Pros:-Looks cool-Small, lightweight-Doesn't have a qwerty keyboard (I don't like the extra weight/space of those keyboards)-Has useful buttons at the bottom-Really good as a Kindle reader-The best value for an starter Android phone that there is-GPS works great, wi-fi works great-Good sound, good video playbackCons:-3D applications don't ever work-256 MB total memory, that includes "RAM" and "Hard drive space," so it slows down a bunch faster than the phones that have separate memory-Slows down the phone if you display gadgets or live wallpaper or have a bunch of applications-The compass doesn't work very well-You can't get Google Goggles on this, probably because the camera is only 3 mega-pixelsSpecifications:*Same phone as the Huawei IDEOS 8150, this is made by Huawei also*The battery lasts me about 24 hours*256 MB of RAM, which includes hard drive space*SD card expandable to 32GB, mine is just 8GB though
