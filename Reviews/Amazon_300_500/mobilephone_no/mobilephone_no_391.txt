As i began to write this review, i remembered the rather grouchy critic; Anton Ego, from the pixar film "Ratatoulle". And a find myself looking at this phone and saying, "Is it really worth it?". This phone all though is a fairly good phone, is at the least, a hassle. When i recieved this phone i looked forward to getting this thing in action. For the first few weeks, it served me pretty well, until i attempted to add an 800 minutes card, with double minutes for life. After attempting multiple times to put it on my phone, via my phone, and my pc, i called customer service. WEll! with my triple minutes for life bonus, i should have recieved a grand total of 2400 minutes. However, i did NOT recieve 2400 minutes, but only 1200. Yes i got half of what was supposed to recieved. So with that said and done, it managed to disable itself, turn on and off, and even waste 200 minutes when a failed to hang up my phone before the person on the other phone did. beware of that; what happens is, if you don't press the end call button after finishing your call, it will keep deducting minutes, until you remove the battery and place it back in. And also, it some how managed to make it act as if a had no service. thats right! no calls no texts, recieving or sending. But wait there's more; all of the default ringtones stink, so if you try to get a downloaded one, it take a heck of a long time to get your computor to even talk to the phone. And, after a painstakingly long time you finally have your ringtone. Well guess what, this phone has got the cruddiest speakers ever! i tried getting a violin solo ringtone on my phone, and once i got it, the violin wasn't even recognizable. So, all in all, i'm pretty much not impressed with this phone. it is not recommended that you buy it.
