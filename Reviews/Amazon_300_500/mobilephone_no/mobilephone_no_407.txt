Honestly... my wife is the Anti-Tech.Laptops slow down when she comes to use them. Flatbed scanners lose track of where they were on the page. Printer servers seem to lose their jobs somewhere in vaporspace. Seriously, her idea of high tech is a digital children's thermometer...A couple years ago, the kids and I helped her migrate from the realm of flip phones to the smart phone world, and the Samsung Illusion is the phone that the kids picked out for her as a birthday gift. It was the right choice for the job -- not too complex, not too many bells & whistles, just the right size for her somewhat petite hands, and easy to navigate. Of course, she jumped head first into texting with family and friends.It took her a few months to put away her paper address book and start to use the phone's Contacts functionality. Took even longer for her to get comfortable using the Illusion to check and send email. Now she's progressed to taking and sharing pictures, reading and sending work files and other pdfs, and using Google Navigator.Yes, she is finally on her way in the smart phone world. Now if she would only get comfortable remembering to take her phone with her wherever she goes, and stop putting it back into her purse (... and then taking it back out again, over & over) each and every time she sends and receives individual texts.One thing that we did notice is that the charge on the original battery lasted, on average, a little over one day. That battery died a few weeks ago, after about two years, and the Samsung OEM replacement purchased on Amazon (Li-Ion Polymer OEM Replacement Battery (1500mAh) for Samsung Illusion (EB484659YZ)) has been fantastic. We think the charge on this one lasts even longer than the initial one did.If you are looking for a good starter smart phone that is reasonably priced and easy to use, we highly recommend that you consider the Samsung Illusion based on our experience with it.
