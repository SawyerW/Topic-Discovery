Great product came all intact when i purchased the phone.It was missing the microsd card but it was not too much of a problem since i got a cheap 16 GB on amazon for 8 bucks.The phone worked fine when it came in the mail with no scratches or broken features.  The down side was that your internet capabilities are not functional when you get the phone due to what type of plan you get.The organizer is real nice and simple to use.  You can easily keep track of all your tasks that you need to do for the day and manage what tasks need to be done on the day.The keyboard is good although i felt that the keyboard buttons felt stiff when you first start to use them.  However with enough use you can "break them in" and the buttons will start to feel natural.  It was real easy to type in what I want in my messages and i did not have a problem typing in long messages and tasks.  The way the phone organizes your text messages is good and it was simple to keep of who was messaging you.Importing you contacts to the phone was easy too.  If you got all your contacts stored on your SIM card the phone easily imported them to the phone's address book.  I would suggest you put the most important contacts in your SIM card just in case you lose data on your sidekick.I got the product brand new so I did not have any problems with the phone when it came in the mail.  I can not say what it is like to get a used one but buying the device brand new was a good experience.The only downside was the slight lag experienced when you play mp3s and do tasks on your phone.  The device would hiccup every now and then but not too much to become disruptive as you are doing your tasks.Overall i thought the phone is great if you are just starting out in the smart phone phase.  I would recommend this product to anyone and for the price they charge you it is fair.
