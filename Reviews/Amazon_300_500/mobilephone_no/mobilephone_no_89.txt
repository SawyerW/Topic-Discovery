This is a great phone if you are looking for ruggedness.  I had been using my wife's old Droid 2 until my contract was up.  I dropped it one night, battery flew out, and the phone, of course, fell in a puddle.  Thing was junk after that, apparently I knocked the antenna loose, so it functioned but wouldn't get any signal.  My dad had the 3G version and is pretty rough on it, he has had no problems whatsoever.  So I purchased another Droid 2 on Ebay to get me through until this phone FINALLY came out.  I think I got it a day or two after it was released.  I like  to wait a few months before I review anything.  This phone has been fantastic.  It has locked up once or twice, usually when I hadn't rebooted it in a while and had done several app updates.  I think that is a problem you'll have with about any smartphone.  It does not have the greatest specs, but for the normal web browser and occaisional game player, it works just fine for me.  I have dropped it numerous times, usually in a parking lot onto concrete/asphalt, with out any problems resulting from the drops.  Pretty good battery life, but I am not a heavy user.  There is an extended battery for it, $50 from Verizon.  I know you can get an otterbox for other phones, but it just makes it bigger and more bulky than most phones are already.  You won't need any such case for this phone while recieving the same level of protection.  Camera is pretty good, I was fairly impressed actually.  (Hint:  This goes for any phone's camera, if you scratch the lens and your pictures are coming out blurry or hazy, get some DVD/CD repair and use that, worked miracles on the camera lens on my phone). All in all, I have no complaints about this phone and would recommend it to anyone who is hard on there phones.
