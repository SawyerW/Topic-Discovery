So the phone is NOT the best on Verizon.  The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.  Plus the RAZR MAXX HD is pretty cool.But as far as a phone goes there's nothing wrong with buying this at all. It's fast, the screen is gorgeous, and everything is responsive.What did Verizon leave out?  Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2 but that's every single Verizon Droid anyway...it also doesn't have a few things that other carriers get...but again..that's Verizon...reviewing all of those things separately is pointless since you'd have to give those negatives for a lot of Verizon phones....What Verizon DOES do is offer insane 4G speeds and great reception.As far as this device goes you can find it this week for $50 at most places which makes it an instant win over the competition, plus it's got removable storage, something the DNA and Nexus don't have...and a removable giant battery (something the MAXX HD doesn't have).The Note 2 is more powerful and a little cooler, but it might be too big for people.My vote: DNA=1st, Note 2=2nd, GS3=3rd, MAXX HD=4th....overall though, im an android nerd and this thing rocks.As for the Apple people....if it was $200 for both I'd ask what equipment you have in your home...if you say all Apple products then go with the iPhone...but this device is bigger, has an actual HD screen, and you can really make it your own with customizing. Really, for what you get for the price, Android offers more options.  Especially this week when places like Sam's Club are having these for 69 cents and Apple refuses to discount anything.  For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff. (including itunes)...use the money you save on all the sweet lightning deals here.The GS3 on any carrier gets 5/5 and on Verizon with the speed and reception it stays that way (although other carriers offer more features)
