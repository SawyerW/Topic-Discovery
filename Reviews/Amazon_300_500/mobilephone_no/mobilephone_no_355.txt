i love the phone overall.  great camera, very fast connecting GPS (as compared to the Nokia 5800 and other nokia phones)  great internet.  very cool apps, most are free.the cons:the operating system is VERY UNSTABLE.  it crashes/freezes very often. even in the menus, it will freeze, or refuse to open new apps.  it also hangs while opening some apps, or the touch screen buttons stop working.  for the life of me, i can not transfer the music onto this phone.  it should be as simple as finding the music on the memory card (that was in my nokia 5800)  but it can not find that music.  last night, i put the music onto the phone  directly, and after scanning for 8 hours, it found 10 sounds.the battery life is horrible.  the phone is trying to do to much, and it drains the battery.  for example, it is constantly trying to connect to the internet (or scans for it),  it is constantly turning on the GPS feature to tell you your location, and current temp in the city (or area of the city) you are in.i would say the battery life is about 6 hours, even on power saving mode, it is only about 2 days.games are unstable, they often freeze.the speakers that are built inside the phone sound horrible.  compare the sound quality to the Nokia 5800, and these speakers sound like headphone speakers that are turned up way to loud.  the 5800 had more then 1 speaker, and sounded great.also, please note that this is just not my phone.  many people are complaining about this on Nokia's official forums, and we are waiting for a more stable update to come out to fix the operating system.  all phones with this operating systems are reporting similar problems (c6, n8, and e7, 97)once they fix that, it will be the best phone on the market.  when it works well, it is a great phone, but i am upset i paid so much for an unstable phone.
