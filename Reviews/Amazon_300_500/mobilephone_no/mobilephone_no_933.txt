This is the worst phone in the history of worst phones! I had to work for like 6 months to earn a new phone and i chose this one! I was very excited until i realized how bad of a phone it was! here is a pros and cons list for the phone...Pros-Has a video camera and camera that works decently-it has an option to make a favorites list to quickly call/text someone-It has an option to make a shortcuts list to quickly do something example (Calculator, new note, new text message, new contact, ect...)-With headphones in the music plays pretty well-Internet connection is "fast" (depending on your idea of fast)Cons-slow-unresponsive-HORRIBLE touch screen-speakers are horrible when not using headphones-Ringtones aren't great-alarm sometimes fails to go off (This was a big problem when my brother was late to an important event!)Also: I received the phone and first 2-3 times a week it would freeze so that the only way i could "unfreeze" the phone would be to take the battery out and then put it back in. This concerned me because i could need it quickly for something, but it would freeze and i wouldn't be able to use it! So the Verizon store recommended that i call customer service and see what they had to say. So i called and they took me through at least an hour worth of button pressing and resetting and all that jazz, one week later it freezes again!! So i call again and they send me a new phone! This was exciting because i was sure that it would work and i would be much happier when this one does not freeze on me! Well it doesn't freeze (which is wonderful) but the vibration can totally broken! I checked every single setting and nothing will make the vibration work again! That was very upsetting because have your phone on vibrate is great when you are in a library or a place that requires you not to have sounds going off! So my point is, do not waist your money! even if they are like $0.97 with a 2 year service agreement, don't! It is more effort then its worth!
