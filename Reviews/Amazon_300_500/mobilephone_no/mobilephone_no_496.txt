I would take this phone over an iPhone ANY DAY. I know a lot about technology which is why I know that apple is not the way to go. I literally have been using this phone for a week and cannot think of a single downside. I have never felt this way about an electronic before. This phone is light, it has a perfect size screen, is insanely fast, packed with tons of awesome features, very customization, excellent battery life, great screen, loud sound, and comes with really nice Samsung white noise cancelling ear buds with inline mic and remote. Literally, if someone offered me a full refund of this phone to get a free iPhone 5 I would decline without hesitation. This is clearly the best phone out there, possibly the best to ever be released. Not a single con that I can think of. Recommend to anyone from business professional to a kid who wants to game. (No lag for any game I played by the way). Note: unlike apple where you need to jailbreak a device (now illegal) to get personalization, this phone gives you full access to all folders and data in the phone. Therefore, using a single app, you can put music downloaded from the internet right into the music player app. On my iPod, I need two different music apps (1 the stock one for music on my computer, 2 A downloader for internet music). Overall, you can tell Samsung wants to make personlization easy, unlike apple who makes it impossible.A note on android in general compared to apple: many apps that cost money on the apple app store are free on the play store. If you use the amazon app store, you are frequently offered deals (download a certain app get a free song). Just as well, apple headphones are mediocre and with some devices the headphones don't come with an inline mic. I was thrilled with the headphones which came with my galaxy, they were stylish, noise cancelling and had a mic and remote. This was the best experience I have ever had with any product. :)-J
