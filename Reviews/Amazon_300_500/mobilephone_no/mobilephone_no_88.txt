The phone I upgraded from: Droid X2The phone I traded this in for after the camera just stopped working: Droid RazrMIf you do some research about this phone you will find mixed reviews across the internet from the forums, the verizon website, and now Amazon! Also the product website is, pretty intense... I wasn't impressed. If you aren't terribly picky and you like this phone's style try it out, that's what I did. I wasn't thrilled with the fact it was an older version of android OS and the Casio stuff that comes with is more kitschy than it is useful. After having it for three days I was going to keep it for the durability and it wasn't a terrible phone, but then the camera just stopped working. No drops, no roots, just normal use it went kaput. So after doing more research it seemed like the people who really liked the phone had reprogramed it, since I'm not into that sort of thing I decided to exchange the Commando 4G for the Razr M.I wouldn't say its a bad phone, but I was very unfamiliar with the way it was set up because of the extra G'z apps. The calls sounded good, and there are front facing speakers so the external audio is real good. The screen is on the smaller side and there are numerous people who have cracked their screens already. The people who appeared to really get the most out of this phone are the ones who could re-program(rooting) it, and I'm not interested in that. I think as of today three months after the debut of this device that has a MSRP of $450. Verizon is giving this phone away right now, think about that. Realistically I would recommend a more popular phone or a brand of device you preferred with the most rugged case available most are water resistant(and a dry bag if waterproof is a must) instead of the G'zone.Bottom line: Wanted to like it, but was a little wary when the camera on this "rugged" phone was a lemon. So I returned it, did what I recommend and I'm pleased so far.
