May 5, 2009 Update: I have lived with the E71 for about 3 months now. It's a good phone, but I like the iPhone better. So today I went out and bought an iPhone 3G. The graphics on the E71 just can't compare. Plus the iPhone has so many great applications that Nokia just does not have. My call quality issue arose from a problem with at&t;, that they are working on at my office. It seems better now. The 3G iPhone is quite a bit better than the 2G version I had.Original Review: I owned a 2G Iphone for about a year, and was getting frustrated by the Iphones bugginess and poor phone quality. So I decided to go phone hunting and settled on the E71. These 2 phones are very different. The Iphone has great graphics and nice applications, but is a pretty basic device. The E71 is a more powerful device, with less graphics ability, but is a better phone. And that was my primary need, #1 a good phone, and #2 a PDA. The Nokia excels at both.I like the VOIP options of the E71. The music player is good too, and can use up to an 8GB micro SD card for music storage.Setting up my Gmail and exchange server accounts was fast and easy.The E71 battery lasts at least twice as long as my 2G Iphone.The call quality is the best of any phone I have owned. I am very happy with the switch. I even switched my SIM card back to my Iphone last week to see how I felt about the Iphone. I switched back to the E71 at lunch. I missed the E71, and I don't like the touchscreen keypad of the Iphone.The E71 is not an Iphone and is not really comparable. The E71 is more like a turbocharged  Treo or Blackberry. The Iphone has better graphics, and if you need graphics, the Iphones the better choice. But the E71 is more stable and does not require rebooting, which my Iphone did.I also like the physical size and feel of the E71. It's lighter and thinner than the Iphone. It also seems very well built.The GPS works great and is a lifesaver. You can also use google maps.
