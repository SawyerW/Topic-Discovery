Well I just got mine today. Build quality is excellent, slider is solid, feels great in hand. Buttons are great, glass and metal/plastic case is top notch. OLED screen is also a winner, love the always on power saver clock. Overall, much improved over the N85. Phone feels snappy especially the camera, nokia messaging works well. Call quality is excellent. Pictures leave a bit to be desired, however I am used to this on early Nokia firmware. Shutter button is much improved over the horrible one on the N85. The flash is surprisingly good. The gallery and also photo viewer are still painfully slow to load the thumbnails, they stay blurry far to long, I don't understand this as my N95 had no problems here. FM transmitter is not as good as the N85, but still a nice feature.  Cell and GPS reception are excellent, compass I am sure will prove useful eventually. Overall hardware wise the phone is near perfect!  As I predicted this phone is the ultimate interpretation of the dual slider N series design. The firmware is surprisingly good for an early one. I think this phone will get a following with the N95 faithful and as a result will end up with an excellent firmware within the next year. I wish I never had to use the N85 for the short while that I did. If I had been going from the N95 to the N86 I would be overjoyed. As it is going from the N95 to N85 then to N86, I just feel as though Nokia cheated me on the N85.I feel this is the true successor to the N95, I cant wait for the v30 or v31 firmware, when the software is perfect.If you are looking for a powerful feature packed smart phone with an excellent camera, like typing without looking, one handed and don't mind that its not a flashy touch phone. The N86 is for you. Not to mention, you are free to multitask, don't have to pay for an overpriced data plan and it is a pocket camera/iPod replacement.
