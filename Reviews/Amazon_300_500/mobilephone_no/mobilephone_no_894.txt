I bought Galaxy Note about 10 days ago from amazon and as far as the phone is concerned I would say there is nothing better than it. I had to give up my iPhone 4s to get this one and I am very happy. It does not feel bulky or heavy. I am a female only 5.4" and it does not feel weird or too big even when I am talking on it. No need for a Bluetooth headset. One thing I must say is that the call quality is EXCELLENT. The voice input is just amazing (siri was a joke) this thing really functions the way I wanted it to. I mean for example, I am not a fan of touchscreen keyboard and I find it very challenging to type with it so I just use the voice input which is very convenient and accurate even though I speak English as a third language lol but it never is a problem with the Note it always recognizes what I want to say. Very smooth and feels good. One thing however is that the battery life is not that good if you use the internet too much but that is the same with all smartphones so cannot blame Gnote.When I purchased it from amazon it listed the Note having a US warranty but after waiting for 10 days and confirming it I am sure that this phone does not have any warranty in USA which is the only thing worrying me about this phone because after spending nearly $700 on a phone you expect some kind of protection. I might just go for a third party insurance or something but that is the only drawback of owning this phone that I have to worry about it a lot such as what if I drop it? What if someone steals it because this phone stands out from all. It is too unique and HOT!!! Other than that, I cannot find anything wrong with this phone.
