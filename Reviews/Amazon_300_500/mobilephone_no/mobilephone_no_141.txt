I have bought many things off of Amazon but this is my first review.I have researched the cell phone reviews on CNET and other sites to come up with the perfect cell phone.  I am always disappointed because all the phones are reviewed as is they must be the best of everything, camera, MP3 player, organizer, toy, etc.  I just wanted a phone that is good for calling and receiving calls.  That's it.Oh I also wanted Bluetooth so I could call handsfree when driving.  And have good vmail, an alarm clock, a place to do business, and to keep track of friends.Yes it has all the other features including spreadsheeting and word processing but I will never really know how good these are because I will take pictures with my digital camera instead, and I will listen to music on my ipod, and I will type my memos using my PC.But as a phone this is it.Yes it has small keys but have you tried a Blackberry?  I have gotten used to the keys by using my fingernails, and I must say I have gotten pretty good.  However I do not use this to type long text messages.  Rather I call people to talk.  Although I use the Bluetooth earphone, the speaker phone is loud enough so I probably don't need the Bluetooth.It has excellent brightness and color so I can see what I am dialing even in bright sunlight, it has great sound, it has excellect tools for managing contact lists and one touch dialing, and it can be configured to have the most important features as one touch.  The phone comes configured as if you are going to spend all the time surfing the net, trade on EBAY or take pictures.  I changed all that to suit me.  If you cannot experiment to get the configuration right or you must have everything simple then this phone may not be for you.For me, I have configured it so this is just right.
