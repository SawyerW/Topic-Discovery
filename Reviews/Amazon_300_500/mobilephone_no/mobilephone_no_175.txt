So, I purchased this phone because I needed a physical Qwerty keyboard but still a huge screen to watch videos with. I also needed a phone that took a sim card. This phone came up as what I could purchase and the price was great, $140, and it looked nice and sleek. So, I'm going to go down the line of what I thought of certain aspects:Pros1. Text messages- It's similar to the i-phone in which it does the bubble text messages and you can see the whole conversation which is nice.2. You can copy and paste what you write, which comes in handy.3. You can check your gmail on the go, which is nice.4. Calendar is nice. Its synchornized with your gmail calendar. You can also save expired dates.5. I love the apps you can get but I wish they had scrabble.6. Camera and video recording is nice.7. Youtube is nice but could be faster but it could just be youtube.8. Found a free music download app which is good.9. Phone calls are crystal clear.Cons1. Android 1.6- The only thing I don't like is that it's not a Android 2.1. I imagine it would run faster if it was and I'm not sure if I can upgrade from 1.6.2. Internet- It could be because of the carrier I'm with but the internet is not so fast. The facebook app is not as quick as I would like it. My previous phone was not an android phone and it's facebook was faster.3. GPS- My gps is stuck on whether I want an upgrade and doesn't give me the option of finding where I am. This could probably easily be solved but I havent found out yet.4. Google maps just shows your home location and doesn't change the map when you are away from your saved address unlike the i-phone in which it picks up where you are instantly.5. Battery could be better. If you don't use the phone all day it will die even though it's fully charged. It doesn't help much when you turn off the wi-fi and gps. Might as well should turn it off.Overall, I enjoy the phone and it works for what I need.
