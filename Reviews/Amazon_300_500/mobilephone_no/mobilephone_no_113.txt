have owned this phone three weeks. consider myself fairly technologically astute, a quick study, willing to invest the time to play and learn. the phone itself is physically pleasing, visually and ergonomically, but the menus and OS are some of the most convoluted and user unfriendly i've encountered in any gadget. tie-ins with nokia account and ovi files are hopeless. by the time you create user names and passwords, get their emails which direct you somewhere else-then figure out the dif between the pc suite and ovi suite, only to be told 'before doing this, download the latest software update for your device', with no link or indication of how to do that..then get a text to your device which leads nowhere...download tons of programs to the 'puter then sync it up with the device...almost always hitting an impenetrable snag... it is a all hopeless and disconnected mishmash...i've had at least six emails from nokia/ovi in my inbox for weeks, proceed to their links describing all the ways i can sync up my phone and 'puter and downloads i can use and in spite of great effort have nothing but wasted time and frustration to show for it...everything's a wind-up and dead end...have never seen so much offered (multiple map systems, messaging and email aps all overlapping and confusing...with charges accruing for every little cul de sac and dead end maneuver you investigate...whole point of this phone for me was the no contract ability to tap into internet on free wifi...but this has been a complete failure everywhere except my own home...it's located and identified in other places but a box always comes up asking for pre-shared WEP or WAN codes before proceeding...sorting things out in the phone's menus and options is so convoluted and anti-intuitive that in spite of hours of experimentation the past two weeks i've almost nothing to show for it...on the plus side i have purchased the otter cover (nice) and cable and memory card, put a little music on it, the intranet and internet radio are nice...call quality is middling...and to wrap up the manual is a hundred and twenty pages of almost unlimited things you can do with this marvelous device...ninety nine and a half percent of which the average (or above) person will never figure out...you will watch the iphone commercials and drool at the beauty and simplicity missing on this device...but hey whatdaya want for a buck twenty...?
