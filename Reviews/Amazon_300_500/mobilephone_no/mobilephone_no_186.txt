I have had the grey n8 since it came out almost two years ago. I bought my wife the silver one and i also recently bought the blue one. One was made in China, one in Mexico, and one in Finland. There all great!!! Awesome powerful phone that gets things done. Yes, i have an ipad that i PLAY on, but when real work needs to get done the n8 can handle the chore. This phone currently boasts the best camera on a phone by far even though its almost two years old. I love this phone and i will love the successor of this phone as well; the Nokia 808.Why this phone is great.I get to use my grandfathered att unlimited data for 10 bucks a month and i can tether with it for free.Free Nokia maps with voice guidance.Use of multiple internet browsers.Bluetooth that actually works. I,e you can transfer pictures, movies, and music to other devices free.Best camera phone on the market by far.Xenon flash to freeze night time shots.HDMI out to display all your phones content. Play videos, show pictures, browse the web right on your hdtv. My toddler loved to watch me play angry birds on the big screen. Of coarse i did it from the comfort of my coach using a Bluetooth Mouse.USB on the go. I can hook up a flash drive or an external hard drive to my n8. This has been extremely useful when there always isnt a computer available.The fact that you can add up to 32GB to the phone via the micro sd slot is nice.Sturdy and strong phone. I washed my first grey n8 in a large front load washing machine for a full cycle before i found it. I immediately got on amazon and over nighted the blue n8. After taking the soaking wet phone out of the washer and put it in a bag of white rice for a couple days to my amazement it charged up and turned on and worked perfectly!!!! I kept it as my spare still though.So if you want a toy go for a cheap droid or the Iphone. If you want a power house of a phone that is still lots of fun that could replace most peoples stand alone cameras then go for the Nokia.
