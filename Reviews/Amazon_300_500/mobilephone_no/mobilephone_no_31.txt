I have had this phone for about six months now and overall i have been pleased with its functionality. However, I must agree with many of the other reviewers concerning the ring tone issue and the lagging menus. Out of all the ringers they could not put one basic ringer that could be assigned thus I keep my phone on silent mode which is sometimes an annoyance when I am unable to notice the vibration. Another downside is that the ringers itself are not that loud this could be related to the phones size since it is does not hold a large speaker. The menus are another problem for when you turn on the phone sometimes it takes up to two mintues for the phonebook or the SMS service to initiate. My biggest issue is with the t-mobile service itself. In my house my service does not work at all but once i step outside i get service. t-mobile may have great service plans in terms of minutes, extras, and prices but their service is not as good as its cracked up to be. Also they fail to send me my bill in the mail and continue to send my text messages on my phone reminding me to pay my bill. I would liek to see what i am being billed for infine print because i dont want to pay any extra charges without knowing about them.I have addressed this issue but it continues to go on. Again this phone is good but it has is flaws, so if your looking for style but something simple you should have a look but if your looking for more features other than a color screen you may want to look at the motorola V300 on t-mobile. Also ask around about t-mobile in your area. Friends and families opinions may help with your overall decision of this carrier. Look at nextel or verizon if your looking for consistent service and customer help as I have heard. I would recomend t-mobile to people who talk a great deal or for teens looking for stylish and less expensive phones and service.
