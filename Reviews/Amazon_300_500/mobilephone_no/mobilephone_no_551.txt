I bought this phone as a replacement for my 80-yo Mother's lost phone.  We weren't eligible for any upgrade at this time, so buying it here at Amazon was MUCH cheaper than if we had purchased directly from Verizon  (that's the first GREAT selling point).I wasn't sure if she would like it as much as the one she had, (she doesn't like complicated stuff; just wanted a basic phone for calls and texts) so I told her I would trade with her if she didn't like this one, since I have the exact same model phone that she had/lost.  I was secretly kind of hoping she would say she liked her old one better, but, alas, she absolutely LOVES this phone!  She likes the slim feel, and the way it opens, simple to figure out, and says the keyboard is much easier for her to use - maybe a little more space between the keys and/or slightly larger (?)  She is very pleased - and even more so because red is her favorite color.The one drawback is that it does not come with a manual (there is a note that says they're trying to be "green" and save resources), but instead has a little mini-CD (she said her computer won't read it), and when she went to the website that the seller included in the package, she was not able to find a manual for her model.  I think I'll be able to find one at the manufacturer's website, but they SHOULD have included a manual, rather than expecting people to hunt one down and either read it on the computer or have to print it out - that's ridiculous, a definite negative, and the only reason it got 4 stars in stead of 5.  A manual is just plain essential and I really can't believe they were too cheap to include one.Phone arrived quickly, in perfect condition, with all manufacturer wrappings and stuff, in brand-new condition (as described)
