This cell phone is terrible.  I have had it a year now and I continue to hate it, and am finally about to get another one. The ONLY two good things about it are that it is tiny and it holds its charge for a long time.Otherwise:1.  The options for text messaging or adding addresses lock in Caps only--really annoying--cannot do lower case letters so YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE CONSTANLY YELLING OVER AIM OR TEXT MESSAGING.2.  Falls and instantly scratches--the chrome looks terrible the very first time you drop it.3.  the hinges and lights have broken off.  honestly, folks, i have only dropped it a half dozen times, i'm not clumsy and have never thrown it, and it's dinged and dented all over.4.  You can never hear the beep to tell you another caller is trying to get through.5.  The multi-toned ring tones are IMPOSSIBLE to hear if you are in ANY place where there is noise (store, airport, etc) because there is not just one particular tone to get your attention.6.  Individual keys on keypad are too smooth and close together so it is hard to feel your way to press certain ones.7.  People are always telling me they cannot hear me clearly, this is not about reception but the speaker quality of the outgoing speaker piece.8.  This thing PALES in comparison to its predecessor the S105 which I loved.9.  In order to delete messages telling you you have a voice mail message you have to press 6 buttons to get to delete--way too much effort for something done so regularly.There are other things which I cannot remember at the moment, but to sum it up--the visually attractive qualities are ruined in the first week the first time you drop it; the sound quality is poor; you cannot hear your call waiting beep; and your text messages are ALL CAPS--with so many options out there, save yourself the annoyance!!!!!!  Don't commit and get trapped waiting a year to get a new (free) phone!!!!
