Nokia for me always represented Built like a tank quality levels. This product general built is also very good quality, better than the crappies blackberries, huawei and motorolla, it does is. Camera quality it's the best of the best, very very clear pictures, but no so good in rooms with poor ligth. Adding memory you will have lot of space to record pics and videos. Some cons are the battery, it doesnt long more than 1 day, it's annoying having to charge it almost every day, it seems consuming too much power and doesnt like or know how to save it, software and functions get choppy when battery is dying. Software is too complex and confusing, i really hate this part, even considering switch to a less "advanced" phone with a simple software like Nokia E72 wich i owned, Applications and functions depend on internet speed, mine is very bad and slow so i can't take advantage of this, except to watch my Email's accounts, sending sms it's easy for the dictionary and size of the virtual keyboard, but responsiveness of screen vary acording to power stock, which is always dying whenever i need the phone, lol. Graphical power is good, games play as old NES and Music Videos look really really amazing, terrific colours, sound it's loud but mediocre. Web browsing is fast for me as much as i use the wifi.As corollary, regardin to battery life i think buying a brand new battery should fix the issue, and about connectivity well, i cant blame the cellular since my Telecomunications provider is the real guitly for its bad and unestable service. The software it is too complex and you gotta be patience to understand it. I give 4 starts since i just like it but dont love it.Would i recommend it? Yes i would, indeed everything from Nokia worth buying.
