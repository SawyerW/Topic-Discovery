I have to confess that this is the first PDA cell phone that I've purchased even though I work in IT for a living.  I've resisted the crackberry for as long as I possibly could.  But no more...I did try out the Treo 680 and found it to be dated.  I remember using the Palm OS back in the late 90's and the Treo is still using it.  The Treo graphics weren't as sharp or crisp either.So I ended up with the Blackjack.  And I have to say that I'm really enjoying it so far.  The battery life was an issue or so I've read but I've found a way around it.  Just turn off the Bluetooth and you're fine.  Bluetooth eats the battery.  And while I work, I just keep the phone charged via the USB cable.  I have not had a battery issue since.That being said, the navigation controls are a little bit cramped.  I do find myself hitting the wrong button at times.  The OS is a little bit slow at times.  That's life.  Nothing is perfect and nor is this phone.  But it's pretty darn close.  I like the OS a lot.  I found out how to drag and drop files onto my phone.  I've got a 2GB micro SD card in here and listen to music at the gym with my phone.  I love being able to tweat pieces of the start menu just by using Windows and the USB cable to browse out to the phone.That being said, I'm very happy.  I've ditched my PDA and I walk around with my contacts 24/7.  Sending email from the road is a snap and I'm in touch more often than not.  I'd recommend this phone over the Treo in a heartbeat.  Can speak to the Blackberry but I will say the color on this phone is sharper than the Blackberry Pearl and 8730.  I also can't say whether this phone is better than the Cingular 8525.  It just looked too big compared to the sleek Blackberry.
