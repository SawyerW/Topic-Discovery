I switched from the LG 500 model to this phone, and while I'm having a hard time adjusting to the features, and I find some to be problematic, the triple minutes alone will make up for the low cost of the phone very quickly.  I haven't inadvertently called 911 so far (it has been a month.)  It does sometimes try to go online or access other files while the keyboard is locked.  It connects to my dsl, and that wasn't too difficult, but when I try to access the web, I get an error message that the web page is too big for the screen, so that hasn't worked out.  But, I don't use my phone for anything but calling and texting, so it doesn't really bother me.  Still, I wish I could go online when out and about to find directions to a location, or the nearest restaurant or whatever.  I bet there's a setting I could change if I knew how.  (It does not come with a manual, btw.)  I did hope I would be able to receive phone calls via dsl because I don't get reception at home, but that probably just reveals how not-tech-savvy I am.  The most irritating thing about the phone, for me, is that there's no quick way to get to my contacts.  I have to go to menu, then contacts, and then find the person I want to call.  My old phone had a shortcut that was very convenient.  Also, the little "mousepad" is very hard to use.  I always over scroll, then over scroll back again, often clicking on the wrong things before I finally get it set in the exact right spot when I select.  (You can also use the volume control to scroll, but mine jumps around when I use it.)  So, those are all of the little annoyances, but for someone who just needs a basic phone, this works great and the price is right.
