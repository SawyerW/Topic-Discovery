I haven't used it much yet, but I have gone through so much already I'd like to comment. Out of the box I was awed! I had never dealt with an android before. But I could have saved myself some headaches if I had read reviews first.I didn't want to spend much because I didnt have a contract with T mobile so I had to pay for it myself and I am not a power user or frequent user. So I chose a cheap phone.Well it seemed to work for he first few days then the battery started wearing out within 24 hours I wasn't on the internet and hardly talked on the phone. After 4 days of hoping it was a temporary problem with the battery I decided to return it. I would finds apps running that I knew I wasn't using, I see now that just hitting the back button alone isn't enough even if you don't connect to the web. I find that also tapping the phone off button helps, at least I am not going back and finding apps running which is probably a major reason why the battery is wearing out so quickly. I returned the phone for a replacement after a gruelling experience with T Mobile customer service.Their customer service is iffy. I suspect that they returned the same phone to me because it had all the same apps on the home page, a brand new phone comes with no favorites set on it alreday and certainly not the exact ones I had on it. Returning the phone to T-Mobile may only make sense if you buy an entirely different phone. I have never had problems with amazon.com they may act more honestly in this sitaution. Now that I have figured out how to save the battery that's good but still I am hardly using the phone, I can only imagine how fast it will run out when I go on the internet you will need a back up charger on this one!For the price I still think it's a great buy, I read that androids are generally power guzzlers anyway!Would I buy it again, probably, I'll see how it goes when my data plan kicks in and I get on the internet.
