The Nokia 6700 Slide is to me pretty much the perfect phone, and I've had a lot of phones. First, the size, it's a joy to hold and the construction is rock solid, the whole phone is made out of metal aside the very top and bottom which is high end grade plastic. Literally this phone is tough, yet at a reasonable weight too, not too heavy but not too light either. The sliding mechanism is so nice, takes little effort at all to slide open and close, and has a nice spring action to it, by far the best IMO. The buttons are easy to press, and the keypad has a  good feel to it. Overall I'm impressed with the build quality, sturdy, not wobbling or creaking whatsoever. Now I'm used to Sony Ericsson interfaces, so crossing over to Nokia took a minute for me to navigate thru( this is a smart phone ), and once I finished that going thru the menus was never easier. I like the stand-by screen too how you can add your favorite contacts, shortcuts in a row( I'm used to pressing up,down,left and right on the D-pad ), Calender and Photo sharing. The 5mp is pretty good, no complaints there, as well as the video performance. As a phone though call quality is quite excellent, from earpiece and speaker, and the other end hears me just fine with a hitch. Reception is good, being able to get a signal in most places. Overall I'm happy with this phone, quite the keeper. There may be some things this phone lacks compared to the rest of the competition, and that is Wi-Fi and a 3.5mm input jack. Wi-fi I can kinda deal without, but the 3.5mm jack is what really got me, I mean it does come with a 2.5mm input but the 3.5mm just makes it so much easier to put whatever headphones you desire in the phone. Oh well. Well If your looking for a really good slider and don't need wi-fi and a 3.5mm jack, this phone literally has it all, and to me it's closest competitor is the Sony Ericsson w995 IMO, good phone as I have tried it too, but I like the Nokia a lot better.
