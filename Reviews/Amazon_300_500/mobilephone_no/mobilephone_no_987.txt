I have had a Windows Phone 7/7.5 (WP7/7.5), an HTC Trophy, for nearly two years and I have been very happy with it.  I would have stayed with it but I needed to upgrade from 3G to 4G.  This necessitated the move to WP8.  Enter the Odyssey.The transition was easy.  The only problem I had was when I realized the phone did not come with a SIM card; it turns out that SIM cards are available from Verizon, both locally and by mail, and from Samsung, for free.I am not into texting, Skype, Facebook, and social media in general, so I can't comment on those, but this package works great on all of the things I've tried.The cellular data link, wifi, and internet sharing features work flawlessly.It is an almost effortless transition from WP7.5 to WP8 and I easily found all the apps that I wanted; I had many apps on the old phone that I rarely used so I did not even look for them in WP8.  (My computers are Windows 7 and I have not tried Windows 8).The battery is strong.I have not selected a microSDXC card yet since there is no information on recommended minimum speed rating or UHS-1 capability available for the phone; I have contacted Samsung by telephone and online chat and their representatives are not familiar with their own phones or memory cards.  I would dock them half a star for poor customer service on an otherwise great product.  I have thrown a 32gb Class 10 card, that I already had, into the phone and it works fine; I want to get a good 64gb card that the phone can take advantage of.I am really, really happy with this phone!JimUpdate August 6, 2013I shopped around and got a good deal on a 64gb, Class 10, UHS-1, microSDXC card and it is, of course, working fine.Jim
