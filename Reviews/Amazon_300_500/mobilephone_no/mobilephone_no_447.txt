I ordered this phone here on Amazon and soon after activating it and transferring my phone number and minutes, I had a weird "black screen of death" as I like to call it.  It was a black screen with orange letters going on about an error code.  I could not get the phone to respond to me at all, then eventually, it would reboot itself and all was fine.  After this kept happening I got fed up and contacted Tracfone and they kindly replaced the phone for me.  My replacement arrived quickly and I sent back the defective phone.My replacement phone works great.  I love how slim it feels.  I like the keys and find it much easier to text with than the LG800G I had before. THe LG800G was dying and no longer covered by Tracfone so I needed a new phone.WiFi works great.  I have not had any major problems with it. You just need to activate the wifi and connect to a wireless network, otherwise you use your minutes to connect instead.  I was able to transfer files via bluetooth easily to and from my old phone, from my boyfriend's phone and from my MacBook.Pros:  - Light, slim, nice qwerty keys, great for phone calls and texting, bluetooth works great, camera is nice, wifi works great. It is pretty sturdy. I have dropped it a couple times and it held up well. Triple minutes for life!Cons:  - Sometimes, when I dial a phone number, the numbers change order randomly.  I have to scroll through to put them back in the order I need.  Odd glitch that only happens with certain number combinations. Very odd.  - When the phone is locked, 911 is dialed if 000 is hit and then OK.  This setting cannot be changed.  I always keep my phone locked in my purse or pocket and have had my phone put calls into 911 at least 3 times from my purse.  I have had to call them back and apologize and am lucky they didn't get angry for the false calls.******************Update as of 2/20/13*******************I had way too many pocket or purse dials to the emergency line so I contacted Tracfone.  First, they didn't understand what I was saying and had me reset factory settings on the phone.  Then they said I needed to call them back when I had a 2nd line to go through troubleshooting steps.  I called them back to be told, oh this is a feature of the phone and it can't be turned off.  Isn't that what I tried to tell them in the first place? Ugh.  They said there was nothing they could do so I told them, it looks like I need to buy a new phone.  I am bummed because I really like a lot about this phone but I just can't deal with the quirk that frankly, can get me in a lot of trouble if I don't stop purse-dialing 911.
