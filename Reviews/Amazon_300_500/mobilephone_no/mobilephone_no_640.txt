Based on all the reviews I had seen of this phone, I am really under whelmed by the actual product. I have used a Motorola Q9h and really wanted something  that could connect to WiFi.  While the E71 does that, it does not offer much more.  It has a few nice features, but there are many things that make you wonder what Nokia was thinking.Pro:Build quality is greatEasy set up, auto wizards did everythingBrowser is greatCall quality and signal is good (better than some LG phones but no better than my Q9h)Menu system is very good (much better than Windows mobile which hides so much).Lots of option for pic takingPC Suite is a nice free app for syncing -integrates well with OutloolGPS with Google maps is very quick to pick up signalNice to have a phone w/o all the garbage they put on the ones you get from the network operators.Syncs Outlook notesCons:Sending and deleting emails should be easier, they make it a 2 step process.  I do a lot of email and this is a major disappointment.When using IMAP for mail, no way to move emails to other folders.Categories for contacts does not carry over from OutlookNo ability to filter contacts, you must use groups.  Unable to set a default groupDoes not play quicktime or windows media video filesPic quality is just ok, color are really off unless the light is greatSignal strength meter is almost impossible to readLimited ability to customize home page, no ability to add shortcuts to non original apps (lots of plug ins for Windows mobile allowed much more flexibility)Enabling call forwarding is a very involved processAlarms are not well done.  You can not save an alarm turned off.All in all I like the phone but am not sure there is much of an improvement over the Motorola Q9h.  Generally better menu system, but email is a weak point on the E71.  If you are a light email user and are looking for a good looking phone, the E71 is a good choice.  If you are a heavy email user, go with either a Blackberry or Windows Mobile phone such as the Motorola q9h
