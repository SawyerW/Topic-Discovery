This phone works fantastic.  For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.  It lasts all day for me after one week of use.  In fact, one night I forgot to plug it in to recharge and there was still battery the next morning - 20%.I too was not liking the power switch on the right until I got a case, so holding the case I no longer press and hold the volume button, turning the volume all the way down.I too was not liking the power connector at the bottom, but have gotten used to it.  I always thought that if there was a dock for my phone it should set upright, so the power connector should be at the bottom.  I found that the dock for this phone does sit upright - something I will order soon.The one glitch I discovered was with the bluetooth phone connection to my car - a 2007 Toyota Camry.  When I want to listen to music on my phone, I connect the audio plug to the car stereo aux plug.  With the phone synced to the car via bluetooth, when the phone rings, I hear the ring through the car speaker assigned by the car bluetooth for the phone.  When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.  If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.  A call to Samsung tech support revealed that the bluetooth phone audio will not work when the audio plug is accessed for the aux stereo.  I explained that my prior phone an HTC Incredible (version 1) worked perfectly.  I do not believe that samsung has implemented the bluetooth standard correctly.  The standard bluetooth is able to determine if the connection is for phone only or phone and audio.  I know that this phone does have version 4.0 bluetooth.
