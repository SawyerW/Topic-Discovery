The most disappointing:  Evidently a user is supposed to be able to completely manage this phone by using "Samsung PC Studio" (I tried several versions), which includes, backups, contacts, settings and so forth.  The truth is, that cannot happen because the phone's operating system will not connect to a PC either by USB or Bluetooth.  I am a computer engineer and tried several different things in both Windows XP and Win-7.  "PC Studio" resolutely refused to acknowledge the phone was connected.  But I was able to connect to the 32G micro-SD card via USB as though it was connected to a card reader.  That saves having to removed it from the phone and connect directly to a card reader.  But without "PC Studio", I would have to enter 100 contacts and other data, ONE. LETTER. AT. A. TIME.  That isn't going to happen!  I was also hoping to add my own alarm tones as opposed to spending minutes to get some from Tracfone.  Without PC Studio, that function doesn't work either.The second most disappointing:  I was hoping to replace my Apple iPOD functions with the mp3 reader in the phone.  But the functions of the phone's mp3 player are so limited and controls so intractable that, after about a week's experimenting, I decided that really was not a good option.  iPOD is much better.The third thing disappointing:  Right after buying the phone for $30 and spending another $30 for a 32G microSD card which won't get much use (see above), the phone was selling for $21.  Bad timing I guess.On the positive side:  The 390 does have triple minutes,  the alarms are handy and work well,  the calendar is pretty good, and the calculator is minimal but okay.  And it's nice to be able to connect to GSM 2g & 3g.Conclusion:  I bought this particular phone mainly because my view of Samsung quality in products was A++.  Now I have revised that to maybe B+.  I'm puzzled that anyone would rate this little toy 5-stars.  I must be missing something.  C'est la vie.Pekelo-Pete
