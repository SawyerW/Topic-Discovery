I had this phone for over 6 months now and below is my opinion about it.1. PriceSamsung achieved top position in mobile world due to best hardware at aggressive pricing but HTC ONE-X is quad core too clocked at 1.5 GHz and available at lesser price.2. ResolutionResolution of 720 x 1280 Pixels is very promising and produces a realistic display quality with high contrast and sharp looking images.3. ScreenAccording to a consumer survey 4 inch screens are most appropriate for single hand use whereas screens like 5.3 of Note and 4.8 of S3 have reduced the mobility comfort in mobiles. People end up using both hands to operate such large screens. Not to mention the increased risk of screen cracking due to inevitable rough usage. Otherwise AMOLED screen quality is phenomenal.4. BatteryBattery (2100 mAH) is quite impressive and works beyond expectations on heavy duty of such large screen and quad core processor.5. Build QualityPeople might like rounded corners and plastic finish but personally I feel the cheap looking plastic design is toy like and doesn't gives a premium look. Its a matter of individual taste.6. CameraCamera is 8mp same as that of Galaxy S2 with improved interface and color sharpness. courtesy- Android v4 ICS. Front camera is also provided.7. GraphicsGraphics have not been improved, same old Mali-400MP as that of Galaxy S2. But Quad core makes its own contributions.8. Other FeaturesHowever Samsung has always amazed its customers by setting new benchmarks in mobile world. Android Ice-cream sandwich is icing on the cake. S view and S stay though new features but are little unreal in the fast world where we cant wait and press for long, speak to mike, wait for system response and then affirm. Phew ! A bit lengthy process, I would rather touch the app icon.9. Final words and take home message.I dont think this phone is a wise buy.
