Edit: 12/4/2013 -- There is a way to turn off predictive text when you create a message, under options.  You want multitap.  The space bar, however, appears to be defective on these, triggering the period key, too.Edit: 11/30/2012 -- Darn.  This phone has been repeatedly calling international emergency numbers (000, 112, etc) while in my pocket.  Apparently these cell phones are designed to allow all universal emergency numbers to be dialed by the keypad even when they are locked.  Only if they are completely shut off (tedius to do), the battery out, or the keypad covered in some way (a flip phone) will that not happen when in a pocket.  Last night it did this repeatedly and the sheriff's office called to make sure everything was o.k.  It looks like another law enforcement person also called later in the evening to confirm everything was fine.  I won't be using this phone again until I can get a slip-on hard case to prevent that.  I need to knock off more stars for this reason until it can be resolved.  It's too bad there isn't a slide-down cover or something on it.Original Review:  Wifi that does work, though with limited use on such a small screen.  Good connectivity with a computer.  Good sound, though for music playback it only supports MP3.  WAV, AIFF, FLAC, and OGG support would be nice.  Full keypad.  Micro SD card has its own little slot instead of being behind the battery.  Uses the same adapters as the LG 800G.  Menu is a little clunky and the center cursor control is a overly sensitive, but there are some shortcuts on the keypad I think I just need to get used to.  I have a minor issue where it seems the space key adds periods when I'm texting, but I'm not sure if that's a physical defect, intentional in the software, or a glitch.  It only happens when texting.  Otherwise I'm very happy with this phone.  If things change, I'll edit this.  This is the best Tracfone I've had.
