Quick takeaway: The phone for people with things to do, not for single-tasking, pinky dragging poseurs.I got this phone to be able to check email and surf the web while connected to wi-fi, not my carrier's data plans... The way it works is you open the "Web" application and at that point specify your wi-fi connection name and password; you need to also specify that you're always asked before connecting; to disable applications from connecting to your carrier for data you need to specify the option "When needed" for "Packet data connection" in Settings / Connection / Packet Data... My carrier is sneaky enough to offer certain services which (a) connect to them for data automatically, (b) have a cost themselves besides the data sent and received and (c) are a pain to stop... You can imagine just how much brand loyalty that inspires... With all these settings in place it seems you can always only connect to available wifi hotspots... But I'll be 100% sure when I get my monthly bill...About the phone here's a list of pros:- Very reasonable price- Actual, for real, physical keyboard, which is comfortable to use even for people with large hands; good keyboard shortcuts to get to where you want fast; copy paste to your heart's content- Multitasking: Leave an app running while you do other things- Much better reception than my previous phone (SonyEricsson W880); no more mad dashes to the nearest window, yay!- Can surf the web; gmail app, google maps, Opera, fring (instant messaging from your phone: addictive!), Skype- Obviously bigger and heavier than my very slim W880, but not overly bulky- Easy to learn how to use it if coming from another brand- Battery seems decent, although of course wi-fi and bluetooth use will drain it more quikly- Easy to read screen- Sober looking dark blue; nice feel and ergonomics- Responds quickly, only a couple of instances have thrown it off- Can view and edit word, excel, powerpoint documents- Can connect headphones without an adapter- Found a way to listen to streaming music (see flash problem below), which I find amazingCons and mehs:- Nokia mail seems to want to connect to carrier no matter what I do, so it won't get used- No data cable is included... Doesn't cost much- OS X application seems very limited; need to get the iSync profile or whatever it's called first; Windows program (Ovi something) seems much more complete- Easy to lose plug where headphones connect- Would love to have a way to know for certain that I'm not downloading data from carrier- Some sites ask for flash update- Sound isn't as good as on a SonyEricsson, no where near the great levels of a Sony Walkman: loud hiss on high quality MP3s ripped from CDs...Conclusion: honestly? Biggest bang for the buck.
