I have been a Tracfone user since TF was analog.  Went through the digital transition with various Motorola Tracfones.  Replaced my last phone with this.  What a difference!  Fires up and finds the signal quickly.  Seems to have a stronger signal then my old phones ever did.  I use this as a phone (yes its a phone but seems like apps etc are turning it into something other then a phone.) and I am now doing a few texts.  I like the fact I can do a voice text and not have to do all the typing.  I seldom had my prior phones on due to short lived batteries, not so with this one.  Like my wife's LG500 these phones can stay one for a long time.  With the gel cover and protective screen cover, I throw this in my pocket (the screen locks so no surprise calling out!)  I like the bigger screen.  Its one I can see without my glasses.  I was due to buy some time for my old Tracfone (I had double minutes on that one.) and the cost for a year and double minutes was the same as getting this new phone with triple minutes!  It was a no brainer!!!  I called Tracfone directly and asked if they could equal this deal.  They said they could but it would cost me more!?  They couldn't (wouldn't) get close to this.  I also lucked out and this seller had an additional $10 off!  Great features on a great phone.  Not a smart phone but darn close.  I transferred my old phone number and minutes and activated this phone on the internet.  Had a bit of a glitch when I went to check on my minutes.  All of the minutes did not transfer.  Called TF (patience is a virtue!) and in a short time they got me all of the minutes and added a few bonus minutes for the inconvenience. Great phone, great seller, great Tracfone!
