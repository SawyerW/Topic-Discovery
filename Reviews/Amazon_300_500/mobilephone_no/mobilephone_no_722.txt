I've just bought this phone over the past weekend at BB for $15 and bought $25 airtime.Service:So far, I have to say I am quite happy with it.  I previously had T-Mobile prepaid but had to switch because I had no service in my house.  After switching to AT&T;, I can actually make calls/texts in my house.  The service is quite cheap as well, I am on the Simple Rate plan.  It costs $.10/min to talk which gets deducted from your prepaid balance.  Standard texting costs $.25 per text, but I bought 200 messages for $4.99 that lasts for 30 days (Comes to $.02/text).Cell Phone:The phone was super cheap and yet it is quiet sturdy.  There is no exterior screen, making it that much more stable/energy efficient.  It is quite possibly the simplest phone you can buy new on the market.  It does not have the capacitive touchscreen that you will find on an iPhone, it does not have an HD screen, nor does it let you scroll through the internet like you would on your computer.  Instead, this phone lets you make calls and send/receive text messages.  Crazy right?  It is not made to be the shiny object that attracts the nearby fishes and sheep, it is simply a mobile phone for communicating.  My only quip is that is has no volume control buttons on the side, not a huge issue, just something I would have liked.  I also use the phone as my alarm to wake up.Final Word:I estimate that it will cost me about $10-15 a month for their service a month.  I usually text a lot more than I make calls, but I spend no more than 100-150 minutes a month which equals $10-15.  Now that I have the $4.99 texting package, I will probably reduce my minutes, making it go down to 50-10 minutes.  The phone serves is purpose, I am very satisfied with it.  I'd give it 5 stars if it had a volume control button the side, it doesn't so I'll live without it but it is not perfect.  It meets all my criteria of needs, nothing else to say.
