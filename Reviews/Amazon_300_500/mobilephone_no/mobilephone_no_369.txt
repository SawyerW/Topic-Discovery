I spent a lot of time looking at the different WP7 phones out there before taking the jump, and I'm really happy that I chose this one. The phone has a solid, sleek build about it that makes it stand out from the other wp7 phones -- in particular the other phone that had caught my attention was the Samsung Focus, but it had a cheap, plasticky feel that made me lean towards the Optimus 7. I think the 3.8" screen is just the right size and it feels very good in the hand. The screen is NOT AMOLED, but on putting this phone side-by-side with the Focus I actually preferred the colours on the Optimus 7, with the one downside being that the black on the Focus was darker.I was very impressed by the WP7 UI which is very sleek and very user-friendly, and is a step above the iOS and Android at least in terms of look and feel. There are some downsides: it's somewhat difficult to search the marketplace for specific apps directly on the phone (I prefer to do that on the Zune on the PC; the NoDo update later this month is supposed to fix this), and there are fewer apps out there than for the other two platforms. An omission was that from the settings panel the phone's MAC address wasn't listed and I had to do a web search to uncover a hidden engineering panel from which this could be retrieved (so that I could put the phone on my university wifi).Also LG gives users 60-days of free app downloads from the LG store and they do have some good apps, so that was definitely a bonus. The camera itself was solid but there's not particularly many settings and it's a bit grainy indoors.This LG phone was very nice for me and I recommend it to others. I found the review at endgadget particularly good:[...]
