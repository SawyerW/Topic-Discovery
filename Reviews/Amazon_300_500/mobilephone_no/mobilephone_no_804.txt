After a deep research on the internet about new phones, i decided to change mi Great Nokia 5800 for an android based phone.  Galaxy Ace was the best Cost-Benefit choice.  Big challenge for me to change my Symbian system, because use to be really stable and well done.  Comparing the experience with symbian and nokia phones as a reference, the change to Android is awesome.  You can feel the difference due to the best hardware set up... 800Mhz processor and 277MB RAM memory.  Both, SO and processor make a huge difference.Looks great, big screen (quick response, sensitive), Light, fast... really fast, with the android market ant thousands of apps, many of them free.Only one big issue:  battery life.  I have been trying to configure it to get the best battery performance, but until now... no more than One day using randomly the wifi to be synchronized and using the web.  For me, is not a big deal because i use to work close to my office, so i have the opportunity to recharge it during the day easily, but for those people working without an energy outlet close, and forced to use data connection all the time,  this phone will be a problem.  .  That is why i am not giving the 5 stars; but could be a nightmare for another kind of phone users. That problem is suppouse to be improved with the new Gingerbread firmware, which i am waiting for (samsung announce it few days ago).If you get this phone, charge the battery for the first time at leas 12 hours.  Does not matter if the phone announce the full charge, that issue makes a huge difference with the battery life.  For some reason, even with the full charge activated on the screen, the battery will continue receiving charge and increasing the usage of the battery.I am impressed about how easy is the synchronization with google software:  calendar, gmail, docs, etc and also with facebook and tweeter accounts to get information of your contacts.Very nice and powerful phone.
