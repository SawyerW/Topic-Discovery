Yes, this is my first smartphone. For the past three years I've had an LG Chocolate 3. It was a great phone as far as flip phones went. It has a pretty good music player too; but the battery turned to shit in this past year, so I finally decided to make the leap to a smart phone. Anyway, I went to BB looking for the Galaxy Nexus, but they were all out so I ended up with the GS3.From the perspective of someone who has never had a smartphone, I found this to be very user friendly. I may have never had owned a smartphone before but I was still  aware of Ice Cream sandwich and the newest version, Jellybean (which was why I wanted the Nexus). I love the design of the phone. It's very light, sleek, it is a fingerprint magnet(but they wipe away very easily). The back cover isn't as bad as people say, it's not that flimsy. The screen is AMAZING. A lot of people complain about the default brightness. True it is a little dim, but you can always just turn it up yourself. People also complain about the bloatware too. I don't think it's too intrusive. I just created a folder and put all that crap in it and named the folder BS just to save space for more aps.The camera is great. I'm just glad to have a phone that can record 1080p. Hell, I'd be satisfied with 720p. The pictures look great. The highest resolution is 3264x2448.Samsung's Siri knockoff isn't the best but it's pretty neat for what it is. Battery life is pretty good. I am addicted to the swipe texting.. It's so easy and fun. All and all this is an amazing phone; at least from my perspective, from never owning one before. 5 stars!
