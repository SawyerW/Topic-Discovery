Let me first say that I'm not a business professional, I'm a college student. Email and internet usuage is not a big issue for me. I mainly liked the blackjack because of the full qwerty keyboard for texting. I originally had a nokia 6010 (eeck) and then a motorola RAZR. While the razr was good for its day, it recently became unresponsive.I have "tested" many phones. The Nokia E62, was a great phone, but too bulky for me. I will say that I love the blackberry Curve and the Pearl, just a bit pricey for a college student. :) The AT&T; 8525 is also a great device, I love the touch screen and the sliding keyboard. For cost benefit the blackjack was the way to go for me.I will admit that Windows Mobile 5 has a bit of a learning curve, and the inculded manual is not much help, so just like any other new phone, I just started messing around on it and most of it came to me in about a week. The camera is a bit choppy but it still has good quality. The use of third party programs and be done on the blackjack. All I have now is the Bible, but it works flawlessly. If you are a big texter (like me) you will love how fast you whip up those messages.I can't comment on email and internet usage because I don't use those features. I live in an EDGE area so trying to comment on a 3G phone wouldn't be relevent. Overall a good product that some will either hate it or love it. I for one, love it. So give that 30 day chance and if you don't like it, just send it back.***UPDATE*** 07/09/2007As far as battery life goes, I am using the included extended battery. I charged it on Friday night and on Tuesday I needed to charge it. With the vibrant screen and the full keyboard, I think thats great battery life. I have yet to use it with the standard battery.
