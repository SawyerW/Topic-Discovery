so this is my 1st smartphone. I must say that for a cheap little device it's pretty useful and well worth the price.Yes the OS seems clunky and the processor is slow, kinda like you took Windows ME running on a Pentium II and shrank it down to the size of a feature phone. But for ~$50 what's the problem? I bought a dell with Win ME in 1999 for over $2,000 (w/o monitor)- that was a true crime. Still, it's like Palm took a 3G wifi modem and mp3 player and they had a love child, then taught it how to make phone calls, take memos, and do some other stuff in its free timePros: easy to learn and use, lot of functionality, wifi hotspot, and accessories are currently at clearance prices. keyboard is small but tactile material makes it surprisingly easy to type even with large fingers. good for 1-handed typing. acts as USB drive when plugged in, no BS sync program neededCons: slow, tiny keyboard(but see above), can freeze up easily, web OS 1.4.5 is quirky, webOS 2.0 not supported on this phone. NO MICRO SD SLOT!!!so why buy this phone? let's crunch some numbers:- if you use a mobile hotspot or tethering: 1. you can buy a 3G hotspot for $50 from Verizon and pay $60 per MONTH in data fees, or 2. buy another phone and pay $20/mo for 2GB/month hotspot(on top of data plan), OR 3. buy this phone and pay ZERO for I believe 5GB/mo mobile hotspot. This was a special deal Palm made with Verizon to get this thing off the shelves; essentially if you buy for $50 it pays for itself within 3 months, and a 3G hotspot modem costs $50 anyway. I hope this benefit remains for the life of the phone, but I have no clue- you can get a simple subscription from PagePlus, so for $10 per 4 months ($30/yr) you can use this phone for emergencies or a good, cheap travel phone that you won't really mind losing, breaking, or getting stolen. Only a moron would steal this phone anyway. I don't know if the hotspot feature is available unless you get the data plan from PagePlus, anyone know about this? PagePlus with $30/mo data plan not bad- buy phone for $50, extra batteries $4ea, I found the touchstone back for $3, touchstone dock is ~$15. you get a 8GB mp3 player, phone, free 3G mobile hotspot, 'nuff said.
