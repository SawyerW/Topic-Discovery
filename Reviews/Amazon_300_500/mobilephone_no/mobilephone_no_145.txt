I live in the UK and have recently - last few months - purchased two separate pink v3's.  To start with i loved it - gorgeous exterior and the large colour screen was gr8.  Also compared to my last motorola the photo quality was good.  All the extra features didn't bother me since i don't use them, all i needed it for was calling and txting - so it would be good if i could get my phone to stay turned on!!Yes - I'd barely had the phone two weeks and the phone started to turn itself off!  Not only this but the screen would every so often show a blank white screen.  Furthermore, when making a call every time i bent over the signal would die.Now you may think that ok she's just got a defective phone but as i mentioned earlier this is my second phone.  Loving the look and convinced it was just that one, i purchased another one from the only store in the uk that sells them.  And again, not two weeks into to having the phone the SAME problems have occured!  You can't tell me that its just a one chance defective phone now - not when the same problems have happened!Plus having recently been into a phone store to ask about repairs i found out that there have been some MAJOR software problems with the v3's!  I am now stuck with a phone i can't use and one i can't replace since i'm down under for 6 months!  Also stuck with dilema of which phone i should get now - i just love the colour and look!So to sum up, by all means buy the phone if all you care about is the colour and look!  Buy it if you want a phone that turns itself off and then wouldn't turn back on again unless you fiddle with the battery!  And finally buy the f**king phone if all you're going to do is look at how pretty it is!Note - the two stars are purely for the look and colour!
