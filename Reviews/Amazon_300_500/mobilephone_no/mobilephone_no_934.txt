Let me start by saying that this phone started out as the best samsung galaxy phone that i've ever had. Then i start having wifi connection issues with my phone which just so happens to be a week after my 30 day return window. So now, while i'm writing this review i'm on the phone with amazon trying to see what my options are on getting a phone that i spent 700 dollars on exchanged for one that is actually worth the 700 dollars i spent. After i started doing research to try and find a fix to my issue i found that there are many people that have are having these issues among other ones also. Now i'm not saying that all the galaxy S3's have these issues but it's kind of hit or miss. i was very weary on buying a phone outside of my local att store primarily due to warranty issues like i'm having now. My advice is make sure you get an extended warranty with your phone and make sure the people that have these extended warranties have many good reviews saying that they honor those warranties. Because nobody wants to be told like i just was that because it's been almost 2 months since i bought my phone that if i send it back that i might only get a partial refund that was faulty in the first place. I hope that amazon tries to help me without making me go without a phone.UPDATE: I was told by amazon that they would (One Time Only) offer me a full refund which is pretty awesome but i have to first call samsung and see if they can help me with this issue. If not i have to get a reference number in order to be able to return my phone for a refund.Thanks amazon for you help but i hope that samsung has a fix for my issue.
