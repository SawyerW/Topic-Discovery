I'm a little tech geek and I'm always out there looking for the underdogs. I heard about this E71, and after reading countless reviews, I purchased it. I used it for several months before I gave it away.The reason why I chose this phone was because I was looking for a blackberry alternative, something much more inexpensive, and this was my choice.The messaging, separate inboxes and outboxes get quite annoying because I find myself being unable to recall the last thing said/sent in a message. I have to scroll to and from each folder trying to figure it out, and going back again to understand the context from which I was speaking. The camera and video recording is quite good. However, the phone itself can be quite laggy, even with an 8 gig memory card inside. Music playing/searching can be quite awkward because you don't have an option to search for it, you have to scroll through and that can be time consuming. There are little modifications you can make to the homescreen or menu options, which can be a tad boring. The 'apps' or the market system they have for the phone is quite subpar. The quality of the images of the apps are not the best, but there are apps (to my surprise). The connection to wifi and such can be such a troublesome task, it took me a while to figure out and configure.  The featured free GPS didn't work for me, I don't know why. I could map myself, but that was it. The design of the phone is exceptional, I thought it was a beautiful piece. And given my small hands, I felt that it fit comfortably and was easy to use.  The keyboard can get some getting used to.  The programs that came with the phone can be found in almost any standard phone. I feel that this phone wasn't 'smart' enough for me. I feel that if you're looking for a decent phone that looks great, this is it. But if you're looking for a phone packed with much more, you're better off getting an android or something (which I did).
