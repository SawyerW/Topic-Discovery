My husband and I used to have Boost Mobile for the Push-to-talk feature, pay as you go. That network was discontinued as of Midnight June 30.We are now trying out two Verizon Samsung Gusto 2 phones on the 1.99 a day, pay as you go plan for unlimited voice and text. We don't text, so we don't care about that. These phones have some smartphone features, but we don't care about those either. All we want is a way to communicate with each other, when one is traveling to work and an emergency occurs.We got these phones at Family Dollar for $20.00 each. Sometimes you can catch them on sale, either for $15.00, or $20.00 and you get a Family Dollar store coupon for $10.00.We have had them since July 1, and so far I have added $15.00 to each phone (the minimum amount) and so far we are pleased. There are many plans you can sign up for, but we have the $1.99 plan. That is a daily charge of $1.99 per day for unlimited calls and text. However, if you do not use your phone, either dial out or answer an incoming call, you are not charged that day. Any extras like photos (it is a camera phone) are $.25 per picture, and webbing, email, etc, cost extra.Verizon's website is easy to use also, and you can track your daily usage. It is much easier than we ever found with Boost.The phones themselves seem sturdy and feel good to the hand. Also for those of us age 60 or better, it is easy to read the screen and keypad without glasses in many cases. Sound in the earpiece is good, whereas with other phones, it has been hard to hear the other end of the conversation--or have them hear you.I didn't plan on writing a review here, but I guess I just did. I am just passing on our observations for now. We may decide later on that this may not be a good fit for us, but for now, we like them.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is now almost a year since we purchased our phones.  We are still pleased with the phones.
