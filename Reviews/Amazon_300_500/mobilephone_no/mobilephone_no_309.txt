The N8 is a great product! And on top of that a great deal, why might you ask? Because of Nokia's commitment on updating Symbian just like other mobile OSes (like Android, iOS.. etc)..It has a great camera! I'm using my current Nokia N8 (Orange one) for filming a couple of things (doing an online show)..This will be my second N8..The disadvantages are with some of the things in the software, like not remembering the camera settings, the slow browser, no multitouch keyboard, no portrait qwerty and some smaller issues.But again this is why it's great.. The N8 is going to have all that (including a brand new browser!) By Q1 of 2011! So very soon.. along with many other things that will make this device even better!!!  On top of that.. Nokia said that by H1 of 2011 it will have the brand new Qt UI.. so that's great too.. I personally dont care about the eye-candy stuff that other OSes has.. The current Symbian UI is simple and gets the job done.The thing that I really do miss from the S60v3 phones is the "Home Media" application... Which can play music/videos and even view photos from other devices on the network.. I wish they would bring that back..Overall, I'm satisfied with the device as is.. and I'm very excited on those updates that are coming soon to the N8.. :)Oh the OVi Maps.. locks on reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy fast compared to my older Nokia phones and is very accurate, I use it a lot! Great application.. (I downloaded the Ovi maps beta from Nokia Betalabs as that version on there is MUCHHH better than the one that comes stock with the N8, mainly because of the pinch-to-zoom seemlessly..I definately recommend this phone to anyone who loves to have a great camera on a phone and wants to get things done right out from the box. :)
