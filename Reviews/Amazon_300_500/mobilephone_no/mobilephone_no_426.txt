use poot too root then u can use apps to uninstall certain system apps that are on there takeing up internal memory that u dont need or a app 2 sd pro to move apps too the phones sd card even swapper to partion the sdcard to have apps automatically installed on the sdcard instead of phones internal memory and with a plan of 35.00 a month for unlimited text and data yes only 300 voice mins but for now while google voice is free u could always use a app like grooveip that uses googlevoice which gives u a second phone line with unlimited calls & text to the usa and canada like magicjack only with texting ability over ur wifi or 3g connection u can have unlimited calls give ur friends and family diffrent numbers based on who calls ya the most so basically a rootable phone for 39 new at bestbuy unlimited data and once ur rooted u could even use barnical in the app store to use ur unlimited data connection as wifi hotspot for ur laptop on the go , so if u know how to work with it and play with it very affordable good phone , yes the battery life does suck but for a android phone its the cheapest best ive seen for the price and ive yet to try a diffrent battery with this phone to see if it gives it a lil more juice then the one it comes with -- but just food for thought on u guys that say this phone sucks , i know i paid 100 for it too when it first came out and yes it did suck then specially since brand new at bestbuy u can get it for 39 bucks , just food for thought ----
