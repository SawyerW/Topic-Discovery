My beloved Nokia 6301 crapped out on me, after almost a year, so I was forced to use this 2330 model, which was acquired at the same time as the 6301, but was not being used.And for such a small phone, it sure is a big piece of crap.I had unknowingly purchased a "refurbished" 6301 model. It was not made clear on the TMobile website what a "refurbished" phone is--if you don't know, a "refurbished" phone is a USED phone. If I had known that, I would have bought a NEW 6301.The sound is terrible. The person I'm talking to sounds like they're using a tin can with a piece of string attached, and I'm told that they have trouble hearing me on their end, no matter what kind of phone they're on.The screen is so inferior, compared to the large, bright, clear screen on the 6301--I have to hold the phone at an angle to see what's on the screen, and it is very dark; any picture you might have on the wallpaper is pixellated.Speaking of wallpaper--I can set a slide show, like on my 6301, but there isn't a feature to have a screensaver once the screen goes dark--VERY disappointing.The memory's not that great, either; and if I could delete the pictures and sounds and message templates that came with the phone, I'd have more memory for my own pictures and sounds (it's MY phone, is it not?)... unfortunately, this seems to be a feature on TMobile phones that the person who purchases the phone has no say in.I hate this phone so much!! If I could find another 6301 ANYWHERE, I'd buy it in a second, no matter what the cost--it was the best phone I've ever had. The 2330 is a piece of junk I wouldn't give to a 10-year old.
