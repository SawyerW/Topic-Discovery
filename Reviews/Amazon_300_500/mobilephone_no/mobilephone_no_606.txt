Pros:- Simple Phone, not a lot of bells and whistles.- Good battery life.- Sound quality good, although, occasionally, you do hear your own echo faintly.- Comes with speaker phone which is an important feature for me.- Customizable top two keys. I've set it to alarm clock, so my most useful feature is right on the home screen.- Predictive text typing is good. Remembers the non-dictionary words you used in the past and uses them, so a self-learning vocabulary.- Lightweight and Slim, so it fits nicely in the pocket.- Displays day and date along with the current time on the home screen (if configured). A useful feature.- Customizable Navigation Key assignments. You can assign whatever function you like to use when you press one of the navigation keys from the home screen.- Sending SMS text messages to multiple recipients with a single message.Cons:- Impossible to see the display in the outdoors during the day. (BIG flop)- 4-way navigation keys are cumbersome. Top and down is okay but for going left or right, the keys are buried between other keys and very hard to press, you almost have to resort to using the nail on your thumb to press it. Also the center navigation key is noisy and makes this cheap plastic clicking sound when you press it. It is the most frequently used key, so you have to settle for some noisy key operation. (During a meeting you can't text your friends to tell them how bored you are, because it will be too noisy, for example.)- Although this phone has the feature of Multimedia Messaging (MMS), if you buy it unlocked, this feature will not work with AT&T; service. Everything else works e.g. SMS, Call Waiting, Call Conferencing, switching between calls etc.- There is a mini USB port on this phone, between the charger and the headphone jacks, but this USB port is for maintenance personnel, and cannot be used to sync data between your phone and your PC.
