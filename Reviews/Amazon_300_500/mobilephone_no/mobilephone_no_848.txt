When I checked the TracFone website it states this item as only DMFL, so I was a bit hesitated, but after the seller assured me it's Triple minutes, I decided to order it.Now after all the activation process, IT IS TRIPLE MINUTES! (the last patch TMFL for this phone ). The first day I used the phone, the screen kept constantly shutting off by itself, to the point when I called a number that required "press x", the dial pad shut off before I could press any key. I thought may be the feature "Master Reset" and "Master Clear" to reset the program would help, but these features required to enter the Security Code! Heck, I just got the phone, and didn't enter anything yet, what security code?Finally from the seller's reply told me how to unlock the default security code, then changed my own afterward. Now the phone works like a dream! Excepted the keypad is really a pain in the... (reason for 4 stars instead od 5), to type if you want to use the 2nd or 3rd letter from the key, it constantly just go back to the first, it's really frustrated!  I just got this phone 2 days ago, so hopefully I'll be happy with it. But I already like the value of the package and the seller is very responsive.Also the web browsing feature is no SmartPhone, so don't bother to compare! We got what we paid for... To me this is a great dealWith this package I got 425 days of service instead of 365 days with 1520mn just by adding a promo code, plus I transferred my remaining 645 mn and 90 days of service, so my airtime now has 2165mn until 2013. I called the Miami # instead of the CS # on their website, and got someone answered right away, never been asked or mentioned any seller or where I brought it.
