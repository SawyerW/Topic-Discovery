At the time of this review, Virgin Mobile only offers four phones that works for their Paylo service, and the Samsung M575 is the best of those offered.However, be aware - With this phone you have both the good and the bad.The Good:1) Contacts are easy to set up.2) It can be set up to accept navigation voice commands. I.E. Go to messages.3) It takes good pictures and decent video.4. The sound is loud enough for people (like myself) with limited hearing loss to clearly hear the person calling you.5) Good sound quality - no static, etc.6) The phone has a few features - Internet, Alarm, calculator, a couple of built in games, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.7) You can block phone numbers from calling or texting you.The Bad:1) You cannot assign a name to an Alarm. IE. Quiting Time, Wake UP call, etc.2) There is no stop watch - as mentioned above.3) You are required to get all ringtones, apps, etc. from the Virgin Mobile Store.4) Most Ringtones/Ringback tones cost $2.50 a piece - with adds up quickly.5) There are extremely few apps available at Virgin's Mobile store.6) Virgin Mobile will charge your data plan if you visit their store from your phone, or download a purchase.7) There are no built-in photo editing features.8) I've read other reviews that complaint that the phone can easily be damaged if you drop it.9) The keys on the pull out keyboard are very small - thus texting with it is quite difficult.10) While you can receive photos via bluetooth from Windows 7 - You will not be able to send photos via bluetooth to an Windows 7 64 bit operating system. According to Samsung support - this phone is not compatible with 64 bit operating systems.11) I also have not been able to send photos via bluetooth to my android 2.3 tablet.At the moment, this is the best phone available for Virgin Mobile's Paylo service. However, compared to other prepaid phones I've owned, it definitely could use some major improving.
