True Story:Last year I went on 'Superman: The Ride' at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey.  There are big signs posted everywhere warning riders not to have any loose objects (money, wallets, phones) in their pockets.  I thought I was smarter, and I put my phone into the back pocket of my clothing.  I assumed that once I was seated on the ride my posterior would naturally protect the phone from taking a leap and it'd be safe.I boarded the ride, secure in the knowledge that my phone was snug as a bug in a rug.  The chairs moved so that instead of sitting upright I was "soaring" like Superman, with my arms outstretched in front of me.  What a trip!I got off the ride and reached for my phone...which wasn't there. I guess when the seats shifted positions my tush  no longer provided a barrier to the phone from taking a flying leap - which it did - as it obeyed the laws of gravity.I went to the Lost and Found and filled out a claim form, assuming that the phone was lost.Three days later I got a call from the Security desk that they found my phone and I could come and claim it.Elated, I made the trip to the park and got on line behind three other people with similar stories.  Each of them were presented their phones, in various states of disrepair.  Cracked displays, broken batteries - the phones were a mess.  Not expecting much, I produced my ID and waited for the phone.I looked at it in disbelief, turning it over and over in my hands.My phone was PERFECT, with nary a crack or dent in sight.  It was in 100% working condition, without ANY discernible damage, either interior or exterior.Much like the duracell, nothing outlasts this phone!
