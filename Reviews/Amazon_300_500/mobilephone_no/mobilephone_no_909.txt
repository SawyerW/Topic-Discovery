I bought this phone to replace my old Razr that was still working fine. I wanted something that i could text faster on and would have more memory for pics and music. I always liked the looks of the Blackberry but didnt want to spend a small fortune on a phone that doesnt get used alot. I saw an ad in the newspaper from Target Stores. They had this phone on sale for 40 bucks. I had never heard of Pantech and was not sure what i would be getting my self into. I bought the phone and set it up for Go Phone. I have had the phone for about 6 months and so far it works fine. I am still trying to get used to it since i used my Razr for many years. Things i dont like: The screen shuts off too soon. It doesnt have a conventional 1/8" plug for headphones. You need an adapter. Voicemail wont give you a name or number so as to know who called. You have to call it to find out who called and get charged. No option to delete voicemails that you dont want to check. Text messages get grouped together which can cause you to miss one. When i tun on the phone it tells me i have new messages. But they are old messages that i have already looked at. The camera works fine. The speaker works fine. The keyboard is easy to use for its size. It has a nice checkered rubber back. The sim card and battery are easy to get to. It has an expandable memory slot. The battery has a decent life. I have dropped it twice without a sign of dropping it. You are lucky if you can get everything you want in one package. Its a mixed bag. We will see if it lasts as long as my original Razr that still works.
