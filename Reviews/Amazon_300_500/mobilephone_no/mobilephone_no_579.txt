I LOVE THIS PHONE! I did own the new galaxy S from verizon and i thought that I was getting a great deal but I was so wrong. This phone has EVERYTHING that any other smartphone has, it is very fast, like 2 seconds after clicking a youtube video it is already playing the video with no lag, and I only have 1 bar of service at my house cuz I live next to the river! when I leave my house I get full service though so it's not an issue with the phone just where i live. with verizon I couldnt get service in my house so this phone is so amazing. it has the full android market and can download any app from it. it comes with swype on the keyboard <3 comes with all the live wallpapers that most smartphones come with and even comes with several very nice regular wallpapers. the camera is a 3.2 mp which isnt as good as the ones on the new smart phones because most of them are 5.0 mp but it still takes amazing photos unless you are in the dark then it sucks because it doesnt have a flash. but other than that, the no flash is the only negative thing about this phone. everything else is great. the 3.5 in touch screen is extremely fast and very responsive with no lag. AND the best part about all of this is I only pay $50 a month for unlimited text, talk, web, data, etc. with verizon I was paying over $100. I could not have asked for a better phone and I am sooo glad that I bought it.  BUT before you buy this off amazon call net10 and make sure this model of phone id available for the area you live in because when I tried to activate mine it asks you to enter your zip code and mine wasnt covered in my hometown so I had to keep entering in different zip codes and finally I entered one of a city close by and it worked but be careful doing that because you might not get good service. But I have great service and this phone is great!
