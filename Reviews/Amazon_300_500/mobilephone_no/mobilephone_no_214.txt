I had wanted to make the move to a smartphone for almost a year. I wanted it to be a Nokia, but my carrier did not have them. So I waited till the price was right and purchased mine from Amazon. Nokia.com refers you to Amazon to make the purchase. I did not not want to jump on the iphone bandwagon. I wanted a phone I could use with my existing carriers plan without signing up for another contract. I have the unlimited $10 internet plan, the slow plan for non??? smart phones. It does everything I want to do. I get to connect by wifi for faster speeds. The camera is awesome. The GPS and maps are great. It does everything all the good reviews said it would do and I have not seen the problems others complain about. I have had it for a month now without any major problems. Like most computers, it requires an occasional restart, once or twice a week if I have been multitasking a lot. The apps are not as numerous as iphone, not something I needed. It comes with QuickOffice and will read Word, and Excel files. It is a basic version so I upgraded to the Pro version for $9.99, and it was well worth it. It will also open PDF files. Being able to use a 32g microSDHC card for the camera is wonderful. I know some reviewers said it is an iphone killer, well, it is no iphone, but I did not want an iphone, my wife has one and if that is what you want then buy it, but if you are looking for a nice sturdy phone, with a nice camera, free offline maps and basic internet to facebook, email, txt surf the web etc, then buy this.  If you want to hop on the phone carrier service you can still do that as well. They will always take your money. If you buy it from Amazon, you can now use your American Express and Discover points toward your purchases, so save up some points and let them help reduce the price. Got mine half off, because I just could not wait any longer. I am a long time Nokia phone user, all I have ever had.
