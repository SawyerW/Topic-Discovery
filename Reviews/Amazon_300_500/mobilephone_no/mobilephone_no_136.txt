In the past month I've used 4 different phones from Cingular.  (RAZR, SLVR, LGCU500, and the 6682)  At first glance I didn't want this phone, it was big and a little bulky so I went with the other phones because they were smaller and more sleek.  To stay on topic the 6682 was my forth phone within my 30 day trial plan.  The rep kept trying to get me to use this phone all along.  Every complaint I had with the others, this phone could handle.  Looking back I'm very happy that I had made the switch...First let me address some concerns that others have posted.  You can put this phone in airplane mode, it is Mac compatible, you don't have to go through 500 menus to get to the text messaging  (The 4 Way and the 2 navagation buttons can be customized to ANY program), and if you don't like to use Nokia's headphones, then you can use your own with a dongle converter.Reception - is top notch.  I can hear people on the headset driving with the windows down.Bluetooth - Devices connect just fine, and I can connect to the internet with my laptop by using a bluetooth dongle.Apps - It's a Symbian OS phone - has tons of apps to customize your phone any way you want.Camera - a 1.3MP and the camera is rich with optionsMP3 Player - Comes with Realplayer and you can listen to MP3s while working on other programs.Overall - Sure I would have liked this to be a little slimmer, but for what this phone can do it makes up for the size.  Besides I see RAZRs all over the place being used now, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a phone that will stick out.  My friend just got one, only because its a "Flip-Phone".  I'm glad I didn't choose this book by its cover.
