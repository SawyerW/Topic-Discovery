I find alot of the these "cloned" phone reviews quite laughable to be honest. Check my other reviews.. I am a real live boy.. Not a seller.Going to keep this short and sweet! After reading almost ALL of the reviews on clone phones here I picked this one (at first).The people making "poor" comments, in my opinion should not be buying cloned phones. These phones should be purchased by people with a ABOVE AVERAGE working knowledge of computers, cell products, and the supplying companies. News flash - EVERYTHING IS MADE AND SHIPPING FROM CHINA - Including what you bought from ATT store! If you need to be walked, hand held, and more to get your 200$ savings bragging rights - maybe the ATT store IS THE ONLY place you should shop.. and yes you WILL PAY MORE! Remember folks: Its a business, not a hobby.As for the products:Number Bought:2Service used on: Straight TalkCapacity: H+ G service - Picture attached - approx 4 mbs Down / .5 Up - If you do not know what H+ is, its 4G before they branded it 4G - Google it.Quality: 1 perfect and very happy - definitely not as fast as a GALAXY NOTE 2, but then again MOST wont use it to that level anyhow. And if you want to know if it will play WOW or some other mindless game - NOT as good as your computer will so use that!! Its a phone, and a work tool, which your not going to use as because you probably do not work because you live to play video games!One of the phones did come with a small "crack" in the lower part of screen - sent it back because i didnt want to chance it. It was working fine though.Feel free to ask questions - I will answer them if I can, when I can. WARNING: if you asked a question that deserves a brunt answer - you are going to get just THAT!! In full!Bottom line: She's a big girl - but she moves fast and I love it!!
