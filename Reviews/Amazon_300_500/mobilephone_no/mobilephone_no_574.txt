I am uniquely qualified to review this product, as I have3 owned THREE of them.  The first one was purchased based on the claim that the phone is "rugged".  It fell from my lap onto the floor 24 inches below, shattering the screen.  It wasn't thrown, it wasn't stepped on- it fell.  I purchased a new one, along with an otterbox case.  This one lasted 24 hours before the micro USP port simply lost connection.  It broke off internally, or was possibly never connected to begin with.  I returned it, recieved a new one, and this third one lasted all of 3 months before one day it simply froze and the screen turned blue.  That was it.  No rough use at all, no pushing this feeble device to it's limits by excessive internet use, overloading the memory, no overcharging, no downloading of potentially harmful files.  I had taken gentle care of it in light of my experience from my first phone of this model.  I hadn't expected much based on the price, just the ability to play music and check the news and weather, and the claim that it was rugged.  I've owned a good number of phones, and take responsiblity if I've broken them myself, as has been the case- but this phone is just plain garbage.  Expect 2-3 months of use, if you are careful.  When it does break, you can have it repaired by paying $100USD for a new mother board (yes, seriously!), or send it to Motorola, which will take longer than the time you had with the phone before it killed itself.  Motorola themselves warn you that it will be a two-to-three month turnaround if you decide that this phone was so great that you want it fixed.  But you won't.  Simply put- not worth the hassle.
