I just got this phone a few days ago so how it is going to work out is subject to question.  I will post an update after I've had it awhile.  But here goes with what I've got on it so far.The phone is smaller than I expected which actually works out for me as my "normal" purse is actually a wristlet which is about the size of your standard small camera case.  The phone fits in the cell phone pouch which will save me from having to come up with something else to carry it in as the usual belt clip phone case is not an option for me.  I will repeat what other reviewers have said and say that you HAVE to buy a screen protector.  I scratched mine the first day and I have no idea as to how it happened.  I sent the seller, shopcelldeals, an email thru Amazon regarding the 1200 min./1 yr service and received a quick reply which answered my question.  An additional note on this, Tracfone currently has a promo code [89901 if memory serves] for the "1 yr service/400 minutes" pin number/"card" you get with the phone.  End result is 1400 MINUTES instead of the 1200 you would normally get.The biggest hassle I've had so far is getting the minutes and service from my old Tracfone transfered onto the new one.  It started with my trying to activate the new phone online.  That didn't work out.  So I tried it thru a call made on my old phone that got killed halfway thru the activation process by their puter shutting my old phone down.  With the LG still not active, I had to track down a pay phone in order to finish getting it done.  That took quite awhile as they were apparently having serious trouble hearig me while I had no trouble hearing them.  Phone still not active, I ended up going inside the store [Walmart - I work for them] and getting to use one of the store phones to finish the job.  Finally!!As the saying goes, More Later!!
