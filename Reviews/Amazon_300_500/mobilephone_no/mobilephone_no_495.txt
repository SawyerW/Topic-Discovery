I chose to use the phone for a few months before writing this review to prevent the initial excitement from biasing this honest review. I came from a Motorola Droid running CM 7.2.Pros:* Very light* Loud speaker* micro SD storage* Removable battery - not so important at home / work but a great boon out of town / on vacation. I was in Paris last summer and I was glad that my Droid let me to switch the batteries ($2 each nowadays) and keep shooting photos* Excellent cameras - both front and back* More than sufficient processing power - I always leave it on Power saver mode* Vibrant screen* Lovely 720p resolution - HD videos look great* 4G LTE is unbelievably fast* Easy to root and unlock bootloader + very strong Cyanogenmod, Ubuntu, support.Cons:* VERY bad cellular and wifi radios - My office is in the basement of a building and while iPhones are able to retain 3-4 bars, I get 1 bar at most. Phone also keeps dropping wifi regularly. As a consequence, my battery drains from 100% to 40% in a 10 hour work day with minimal to no usage. I don't have this problem at home where I have decent reception for both cellular and wifi. I have read elsewhere that Samsung simply doesn't know how to make good CDMA radios and GSM versions of the phone don't share this problem.* Dim screen makes outdoors use a little painful* Ugly and slow OS skin, gimmicky Samsung apps including S voice, massive amount of bloatware, annoying Verizon customizations like persistent wifi notification* Too large - I have large hands and yet I feel that this is too much of a handful to use with a single hand. A 4.4" or 4.5" screen might be the largest one can comfortably useAlternatives:* iPhone 5* Motorola Razr HD MAXX* HTC Droid DNA
