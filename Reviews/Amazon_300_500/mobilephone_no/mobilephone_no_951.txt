I received this phone and quickly figured out how to install my sim card and get things going. The instructions were very clear even for someone who had never owned a smart phone. I am a Consumer Cellular customer and the phone worked great with their platform. The problem came when the phone would just not seem to hold power. After as little as 2 very short phone calls and a hand full of texts, it would run the battery down. I contacted the seller giving a detailed explanation of what I was experiencing and asking if this was normal for this type of phone or was it a battery issue. They sent back a very unbusinesslike response which simply stated, "If you like we can send you a new battery at no extra cost." No greeting, no closing, no answering of my question. I sent another email asking if that meant it was a battery issue since the question had not been answered. Again I received a similar response stating it was not typical and that was why they offered a new battery and it was being shipped.  Well, Ok. I figured no problem they just are a company who has no business communication skills. Since I've always been in the business world and would never, EVER allow one of my employees to respond to customer questions in such a manner. I let it slide and figured I'd wait to write a review until I received a new battery and everything was fine. A few days later I did receive a new battery, put it in the phone, charged it up and once you take it off the charger, the battery won't keep the phone on. I tried again, and it's the same problem. I chose not to deal with the seller again and went and bought a battery which works fine and I love my phone. The moral of this story is, buy the phone, but maybe choose a different seller.
