This Nokia 2330 (2330c-2b) can only work as the very basic of a phone, a candy-bar style phone. It only supports GSM dual bands (850/1900) that can only be used in USA and Canada while a lot other phones, even the very basic models, support GSM 4 bands (850/900/1800/1900) that can be used worldwide. Its camera is the one with the lowest resoultion you can find in the market nowaday. It uses poor VGA (480x640) quality in 0.3 mega pixel, and its video uses only six frames per second in 128x96 resolution. To make it even worse, the photos and videos it took are unfocused, full with noise and strange colors. It comes with a low 32M shared internal memory and it does not allow you to use an external memory card to expand. Due to the very small memory, the music player is basicly cannot be used. In addition, the junk files (the demo games), weblinks, some built-in wallpapers, tone rings, and themes are all system files which cannot be deleted, that only left with about 4M free memory. Even by using "Mobile Media Browser" software to delete those "system" games, themes, and some ringtones, that will gain some more free space, it still has only about 8M free memory. Hence, you can only use it as a phone, period. (However, it does come with a FM radio.) I feel that the 1.75 inch screen (with resolution of 128x160) should be a little up to allow more room for the very small keypad, which is hard to do text messaging. The phone did freeze couple times in my experience that is at least a basic phone should not happen in any case. I had to remove the battery to shut it down. The battery standby time is so-so that only lasting about five days with some occasional using. Even if all you need is a simple phone, why this one?
