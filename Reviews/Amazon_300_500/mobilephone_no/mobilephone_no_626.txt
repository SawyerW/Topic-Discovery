I purchased an unlocked, midnight blue version of the K1 KRAZR for $99 by renewing my T-Mobile contract for 2 years at my neighborhood cellphone store.  (Not many stores will sell you an unlocked phone, so this will not be an option for most people.)  Compared to the RAZR, I was surprised at first at how much heavier it feels in the hand and also how much thicker it looks.  It is actually just slightly thicker than the RAZR, but because it is so narrow (and heavy) it feels much thicker than it really is.Even though I miss the elegant styling of the RAZR, the KRAZR beats it hands down on features: a camera with half-decent resolution (finally - why did it take so long?), video camera, memory card slot, voice recognition, and MP3 capability.  The form factor, while not as pleasing to me as the RAZR, does fit nicely into the hand.  The voice recognition could come in handy for hands-free phone use when driving, and each time I have tried it, it has worked flawlessly.By the way, the memory card you need for this phone is a Micro SD card.  If you buy a SanDisk Transflash package, it will come with an adapter that allows you to read it in an regular SD card reader (which is standard on some cameras and desktop computers).  I bought a 256 Mb Transflash package on Amazon from Blue Proton for $9.48 including shipping.As for negatives, the Motorola software is still not up to par, and you will need to refer to the manual to figure out how to do some tasks that should be obvious.  My pet peeve is that the Recent Calls screen will only list a number once, so if you missed three calls from the same person, the phone will only show the last, most recent call.  Apparently the folks at Motorola don't care if someone has been trying to reach us urgently but didn't leave a vmail every time.  I also haven't figured out how to copy the phone book from the SIM card to the phone memory all at once, rather than one number at a time -- what is Motorola thinking?
