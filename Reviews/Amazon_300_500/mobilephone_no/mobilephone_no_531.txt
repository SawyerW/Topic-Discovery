I bought the Palm Pixi for Verizon after I was able to get a data plan. I took about a month to research all of the phones that would be available and how they were all rated. The palm looked like a nice back up choice for me, mainly because of the price and because of the average amount of reviews I was able to find on it.After getting tired of trying to find an Android device I decided to get the Pixi, it had just gone on sale when I purchased it.As soon as I got the phone I called Verizon to activate the device and start messing with it. I have been pleased with this phone since I received it. It was a perfect beginning choice as a smart phone user. The phone is small, but after a months use I was able to get used to the size. The screen is very sensitive to your touch. even with a screen protector on it. The mutli touch was a great little add on to the Pixi, it made games a little more interesting on it.Now of course, there are always a few cons with a phone. To least my major ones, the phone has an issue if you try to do way to much stuff at once. For instance, if you have a window open for a game, then one for facebook, and another for texting. Your going to get lag SOMEWHERE, that or your phone will not let you open any more cards. With that issue I have found that exiting at least one card, and then waiting a moment the phone will then be back to normal.The only other issue I have had was with the phones service. For me, I keep my phone on all day and all night. So, every once and awhile I will not be able to get any 3g network or any service, usually I notice it because I will not recieve emails for a little while. The only solution to fix this problem is to restart your phone.Other then the two small cons I have found for this phone. The Palm Pixi has been a great buy, being lower then 100 dollars and still being a smart phone. It was quick to learn and phone to learn. A great phone for any new smart phone user.
