I had problems with this phone in the beginning. The first phone was delivered dead on arrival and I returned it. I got soon a replacement phone which worked fine for one day and it started to have problems too; it died first after one day of use for 15 minutes, then it worked well for a while and died for one day; I could not turn the power on or off or do anything. I just had to wait until it randomly started to work again. The third replacement unit works well.I believe my review tells quite much same stories than everybody else; the 12 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss lenz and free GPS navigation are excellent! This is the reason why I pretty much chose my mobile; I like to carry good quality camera always with me. Free GPS is a very handy too as I am new in the country.The Symbian operating system feels slow and old fashioned compared to it's competitors iOS and Android. Also there's not so much applications available to N8 than to Symbian 3. However I haven't find this as a problem because I rarely play games etc. with my mobile phone. I prefer to use my computer for such activities.Web browsing is also slow and not so user friendly than e.g. in IPhone. I also had a problems with Nokia Ovi - Microsoft Outlook calendar sync; but I found a workaround; you have to install old version of PC Suite to get it working.In overall I am quite happy with this product. If you want the best mobile phone camera and free GPS navigation I think this is a very good choice for a mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone mainly for web surfing and playing games and using tons of different application, then some other phone might be better choice for you.
