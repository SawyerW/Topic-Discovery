Had an experience of using both iphone 4 and Nokia N8 phone; While iphone 4 is unbeatable interms of some of the features like the amazing "Retina" display etc., Nokia N8 stands out just because of the flexibility it offers; To simply put - it gives me much more freedom while using the phone - in terms of basic functions which a common (smart phone) user like me does..- Got a good song to hear - just DOWNLOAD it (instantly) to your phone - to play it whenever you want (even when no network - or without worrying about the Datacharges)- Copy files to & from the Nokia device - without the need to rely on the proprietory utilities - You do not even need a computer to transfer - it allows transfer to Pen-drives directly using the supplied cables- Carry the phone to anypart of the world - without the headache of unlocking or breaking the version etc.,- Gives me flexibility to have 48 GB memory with no extra cost..- To listen to music using the amazing headphones (that comes along with the device) is truly great - I feel like listening the songs from a theater.- MOST IMPORTANT - the 12 MP in-built camera - WOW! what an amazing feature - this device is awesome in the pictures..- the advantage of Nokia - interms of Sturdy nature, long battery time - are all there - unsung...On top of these - after using the symbian OS in the earlier smart phones like the Nokia E71 - I am getting a much surprising stunning experience while using the OS in Nokia N8 - Dowload speeds is really admirable;I am very happy with this device and more happy that I have returned the iphone 4 - within the 30 day return period
