Prior to purchasing the Tracfone, I was on Verizon and paying nearly $45 per month for 400 minutes.  I looked back 1 year and found that the most I ever used was 50 minutes for a month.  I decided to try the Tracfone and bought one with double minutes for life.  I switched my Verizon number to my new phone and have had it for over a year and I love it.  Just yesterday I bought the 1 year/400 minutes card, put the 15 digit numbers in on Tracfone's site and within seconds I got a text message saying the minutes were added to my phone.  Since I have the double minutes for life, it gave me 800 minutes and 365 days to use them.  All this was added to what I already had on the phone.  With Verizon, if you don't use your minutes, they're gone.  With Tracfone, unused minutes carry over to the next expiration date.  You can text and use the web, just like other phones too.We travel quite a bit and I have never lost service and it sounds as good as my Verizon phone did.So basically I have just as good phone service for $100 a year instead of $540 a year, just not as many minutes.  If you figure it out, it comes out to about 67 minutes per month and 8 cents per minute. Perfect for me!  It even calls internationally for no extra charge.  You can't use it to call FROM other countries, but you can use it to call from the US TO other countries.  If you are a power user, this it not for you, but for the occasional user, it works!  I did have to call customer service when I first got it to help me set it up, but they got it done in short order.
