I have enjoyed using my Sanyo a lot. I switched from T-mobile just for this phone, even though I was happy w/ their service and had complaints about Sprint in the past. I realy wanted  small camera phone so that I would have a camera w/ me at any time. However, the resolution SUCKS! It is fine for attaching a picture of someone to a phone book entry, but other than that, the pictures are not worth it. It has some other cool features, though. I can plan events into my calendar and decide how far in advance to send a reminder as well as the ringtone for that reminder. The quality of the ringtones I can download is awesome! I had "Baby Boy" by Beyonce on there for awhile and people thought it was the radio.Most of my complaints have to do with Sprint. They charge $15 per month extra to be able to send the pictures to anybody or send text messages. They do give a $5 credit per month for downloading games and ringtones, though. However, the internet service is insanely slow and doesn't work half the time. You have to log on to the internet to send text messages and then it takes forever to type them in b/c there autotext is crap. Sprint also put a spending limit on my phone and if it gets even near that, they shut it off until I make a payment, even though my payments are always on time and I have never exceeded the limit. The other day my phone was going to voicemail automatically and telling people I was busy for no reason. The customer service rep was supposed to send me to technical support and sent me to collections where the lady was rude to me and told me I had to pay the bill for last month even though it was not due until the end of the current month and I hadn't even received the bill for it. If I could get out of the contract, I would, but it's $150. Bottom line: UNLESS YOU ARE DYING TO HAVE THIS PHONE, USE ANOTHER CARRIER!!!
