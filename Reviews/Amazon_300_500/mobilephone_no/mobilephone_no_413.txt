The Galaxy Nexus is still a great option for a cheap but good off-contract phone.  It's certainly not a new phone, and isn't the fastest thing out there, but unless you're part of the small minority that plays extensive 3D games on your android device, this phone will have plenty of power to run your applications.  32 GB's of storage is more than enough to store media, no expandable storage, but again not many people will use more than 32 Gigs, especially considering Google has a great music streaming app.  The phone is thin, and has a slightly curved glass screen.  Functionality of the curve is not existent, but it is neat to look at.  The battery is only 1850 mAh,  which will drain faster than you can count to 10, so expect to buy an extended battery, or at least a spare.  Battery life is, and has always been, this phone's undoing.  The other complaint people have about this phone is the slow update cycle.  While other Nexus devices are running Android 4.3, this one is running Android 4.2.2.  Not missing out on much, but expect to be sideloading a custom rom if you NEED the newest firmware, VZW takes forever to approve updates.OVERALL, this phone is a great phone, and is the only way to get a Stock Android experience on Verizon.  It's missing Google Wallet (Easy to get working with some changes to the build.prop file), doesn't update as quickly as other Nexuses on other carriers, and has pretty bad battery life with the stock battery, but these are the things that caused Verizon to stop selling this phone in the first place, and in turn, are why this phone is so cheap.  I've always seemed this phone as a compromise.  You sacrifice some of the things that really make the Nexus brand special (Updates and freedom), to instead be on the "Nation's Most Reliable 4GLTE Network." It's not perfect, but it's the only phone I'll use. (Until the Moto X, of course.)
