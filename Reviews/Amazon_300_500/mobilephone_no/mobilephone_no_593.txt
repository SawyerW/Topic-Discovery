I have been having this for about 6 weeks now. I purshased this phone because I could not afford the samsung galaxy Note2, but it has almost the same features except the note app (of course!). But I could live without at the moment.I loved it the first days, large screen, nice picture quality (except the self-pictures where the resolution is weak). Later on I figured out that the sound quality was not as good as with my old HTC on the highway.Overall really easy to use. I hate texting on small keyboards but the swipe functionality has given me the love of writing (text, emails) on my smartphone more than on my laptop now (hope we will have soon that feature on laptop). Anyway I love the design, the smooth navigation.You will dislike the short battery life if you do nothing against it. In the beginning I had to charge my phone twice a day with minimal use of the phone, despite the power saving on. Then I figured out that once you disable the automatic update of apps, reduce the brightness of the screen to his minimal and few more features, you can save a lot of battery power. Just try what may work best for you. Today I spent about 2 hours on the phone and at the end of the day still have about 1/3 of the battery left.You may find your phone shutting down/rebooting of its own, even though you don't need to recharge battery. The power on button will not work. The only option may be to open it, remove the battery and then power on the phone. It can be very frustrating since you may not know that your phone is turned off. This happen to me few times and it seems like it goes together with the automatic update of apps, some apps requiring a reboot of the system. Now I have  cleared the cache and disable the automatic update of apps, and think that it works, but time will let me know if I was right...I would have given 5 stars, but for all the above frustrations  I went through, I give only 3 stars now..until my next review.
