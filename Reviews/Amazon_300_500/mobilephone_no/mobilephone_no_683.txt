Well, this is the best phone *I've* ever owned anyway.  It does it all, you can shoot video, still photos.. comes with great games and you can download more for free.  Lots of free applications of all sorts online.  I use it for email on the road, as well as keeping notes on the note application.  You can add a memory card to put MP3's or even movies on and play them on your phone.I previously had a Nokia E61 and loved it... until I dropped it in a bucket of motor oil and it went bye bye.  Then, in a mad panic, I went to my carrier and bought "the best phone you have now!".  They sold me a blackberry curve.. from the moment I bought it I thought it was crap.. totally locked down, hardly any free apps.. just a miserable experience.  I had to use that phone for nearly a year before I "accidentally" dropped that one in the toilet and had to buy a new one.Well, you better believe I went straight for the phone I had been dreaming of.. the E71.  I use it with Qik.com to shoot live videos straight from my phone to the web so I can be a mobile broadcaster.  I use it for my schedule, contacts.. and I sync everything to the web over the air for free with zyb.com.  Try that with a blackberry... you can do it but only if you pay money for a 3rd party program.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't make my breakfast in the morning.. also the 3.2 megapixel camera is awesome, but when other guys have nicer cameras, some as high as 8megapixels, you have to believe there's room for improvement.  The built in GPS kicks butt as well, but I had to download Google Maps to make it work right.  The included Nokia maps didn't seem to work right at first.  I got it to work later, but since google maps is free anyway, and Nokia Maps makes you pay after like 3 months of service I decided not to even get attached to it.But like I said, this thing is awesome and I highly recommend it to all my friends and family.
