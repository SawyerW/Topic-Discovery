I purchased this phone for my 70+ mother who needs a phone to talk, text, and receive pictures.  She has an old Motorola Razr where you need to press the "a" button three times in order to type "c" when texting.  Cumbersome and annoying to say the least, so she wanted a phone with an onscreen qwerty keyboard for ease of texting and a fairly large screen (easier to view pictures of grandchildren - old eyes).  She does not need to use the internet at all nor does she even know how.Since pickins are slim for my requirements I opted for this phone because it had the features I wanted without having to purchase a data plan.  Those rapists (AT&T;) now require you to purchase a data plan with every smartphone whether you plan on using the internet or not.  What a racket!!!Ok, so the phone arrived and it looks to be the answer to my mother's needs.  But lo and behold, the phone starts oddly losing its charge despite no use and being in sleep mode.  This piece of junk (HTC Freestyle) CONSTANTLY, CONSTANTLY, CONSTANTLY freezes and also got stuck on a Spanish screen once.  Even referring to this sorry excuse as a phone is just plain wrong.Bottom line - I read the reviews and knew they weren't favorable, however, I figured I'd roll the dice because this phone (if it actually worked) would be the perfect answer to my mother's needs.  So, thank you HTC for making our lives miserable for a few days with this nightmare you call the Freestyle.  And thank you greedy AT&T; for putting us in this boat by not allowing the purchase of a smartphone without a data plan.  Not everyone today needs/wants to surf the net.If anyone out there is considering purchasing this phone.....DON'T!!!  Instead, run as far away from it as you can!  If I could give it negative stars I would.
