August 2013 UPDATE: Had this thing for several months now (since Dec 2012) and I am sick of it. It seems to reboot from time to time which puts it off line for about four minutes. I was hoping to 'root' the thing but simple rooting techniques don't seem to work. It is also a terrible phone which is not user-friendly.As a mobile device it is not too bad but as a phone it is terrible. The phone is not very responsive in terms of trying to make a call-- I still do not know how to make a call without pressing way too many buttons and waiting far too long, and sometimes it does not want to hang up. Also, the volume buttons are never made and they are on the side of the phone so I am always turning off the ringer. Many times I have become vaguely aware of a slight buzzing when receiving a call-- having inadvertently turned off the ringer.The thing is frozen in time at Android 2.1 so most new apps either wont work or they make it crash more often. The camera works OK but it takes an awful long time to turn on. If you can get this phone somewhere for less than $50 it might make a good first smart phone but you'd be better off buying something else.Also be aware that now that Google, Motorola, and Android are one big happy family everthing you enter into this phone will be sync'd to Google with all that entails regarding privacy.By the way I did not have any problems with the vendor they were fine and shipped the thing as promised.----I got this thing up and running. I saw a couple of negative reviews but I am happy so far. The only glitch is that although the phone is unlocked, it still has all sorts of AT&T; apps on it which will no longer work (I am on another carrier).The biggest problem so far is that the phone has the Android Market app installed and I cannot upgrade it to Google Play, so I can't load any more apps on it. I am still trying to fix this but I think I will have to root the thing.
