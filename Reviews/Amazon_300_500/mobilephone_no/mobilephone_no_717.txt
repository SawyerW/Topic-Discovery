These are my initial impressions.  What a fantastic piece of portable electronics!  Having looked at the iPhone, Samsung's Mystic and Solstice, and Motorola Droid I can safely say that the this Samsung i8910HD 16GB blows them all away.What can I say.  This is the largest screen of the bunch.  And, WOW, is it spectacular!!!!  Can't wait to try a 720p movie.  Touch sensitivity was well adjusted right out of the box.  Good tactile sensationI'm still working through the apps included on the phone, so more on those at a later date.My ringtone is no longer a 5, 10, or 20 second tone or cut that repeats.  I loaded a few of my MP3 and MP4 files onto the SDHC memory card, that I also purchased, to test the audio playback.  Just for grins, I selected 1 of those files as a ringtone.  It plays the 1st 40-45 seconds of the piece when I receive a call.  I almost hate to answer until the last second.  Now, I have to figure out what to use for the alerm clock tone.Same goes for my wallpaper; photo files loaded onto the memory card.  Only bit of advice here is the files need to be somewhere less than 300Kb with the image well centered.  The phone warns you when the file is too large, though.  Files smaller than about 75Kb don't do the screen justice.Oh, yeah, and for those who would take note, my ringtone and wallpaper are both from a single theme, but from different sources.  I know that's a bit much, but imagine the looks when the ringtone sounds, and you see exactly which image appears on the screen.Texting is a breeze.  The adaptive spelling feature will take some time to adapt to me, but you can always turn it off.  The QWERTY keyboard in lanscape mode has large buttons that even those of us with fat-finger can use with ease.Once I got the call volume turned up from 1, speaker clarity is great during calls.  No dropped calls yet.Expensive? Right now, yes. 1st kid on the block, the city, the county, maybe the state with 1 is satisfaction enough.
