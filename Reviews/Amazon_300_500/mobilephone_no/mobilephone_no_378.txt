I bought this phone to replace my QWERTY slide-style Android phone. Having had some experience with Symbian in my N8 I felt confident enough with the OS to try it out as my messaging/email phone.-love the build quality. Solid, obviously well made.-the screen is very bright and very sharp, if a bit small.-battery life is superb. Just be aware some apps like CNN require a GPS lock; if one is in a massive building blocking signal then you will want to close the app to save battery.-gmail is a bit spotty on updating. Sometimes one has to refresh, unlike BB or Android.-the EDOF camera is actually very very good. One cannot do macro but it is fast to use; a streetshooters dream really. Especially for night shots where all phone autofocus stumbles.-the flash/light is stunningly good.-the browser is functional, not up to par with the latest from IOS or Android but useable enough that I removed Opera after 2 days.-Antenna/connectivity is excellent. Love the Pentaband-Voice quality is excellent, no dropped calls.As postscript my notes apply to Belle, I updated immediately and never got a chance to use the device on Anna.If you need a sold, reliable and lovely QWERTY phone and do not mind a learning curve it is really a lovely device.Edit; I recently had a chance to test the reception and battery life during an emergency trip to the Hospital. The little Nokia managed to get 1-2 bars of edge in areas where my Android phone got an 'x'. I was able to keep in touch with family and friends updating them by text and voice while doing research on the web. Not one dropped call. In the end after 12 hours or so of extremely heavy use I got home with 28% remaining on the battery. It had been off the charger 6 hours already before going to the Hospital!
