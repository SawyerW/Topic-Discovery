Wow, that is all I can say. I'm the kind of person that never writes reviews, but this is probably the worst phone I have ever had. I have had this phone for about a year and I am desperately trying to buy another phone. It has so many issues and problems I don't even know where to begin. The Menus are so complicated to maneuver through. The internet is the biggest piece of junk. YouTube, don't let me even begin. Every time I finish watching a video it just sends me to the menu! Why!? Also if the video is longer than 6 minutes it'll just freeze and say its buffering! The touch screen is a the worst thing ever.It doesn't Work! How about that. Every time I try to select something it won't read it. I have to press it so hard that I feel like my finger is going to go through the phone. I find my self using a pen or something with a tip to use it. This should of had a stylus of some sort. I also can't even use some of the features that it has like the social networking apps! I will give it one thing, this phone is resistant. I have thrown this phone so many times against the wall out of frustration and it holds up well. It might even give Nokia a run for its money. Overall this phone is great if you intend on using it as a paper weight. There are smart phones and then there are Dumb phones. If you looked up the definition of dumb phone on the dictionary, it would just show you the picture of this phone. Anyways save your money and Pass on this abomination of a phone. If 0 stars were possible I would give it that. Anyways, That is all.
