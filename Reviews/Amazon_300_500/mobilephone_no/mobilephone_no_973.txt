First off my package was shipped SMARTPOST of which I have heard Turrable, Turrable *Charles Barkley voice* things about. I ordered my phone on a Thursday afternoon using Free Shipping, 3 days later on Sunday night the package was shipped and arrived that Monday.I had the LG Marquee, bought this and gave the Marquee to my GF. I love this phone. The screen is big so I can enjoy web surfing, games, videos, pix and whatnot. Android 4.0 is definitely a great upgrade from Gingerbread (but gingerbread is still nice so if your budget calls for a phone with Android 2.3 you wouldn't be disappointed). I am in Atlanta so the 3G is excellent, when im on the go the Venice and Marquee both zoomed on 3G. I easily switched my phone over on the Boost Mobile website an was rockin in minutes. This phone definitey runs smoother with all my apps than my previous one & the Memo feature is great. I havent gotten a chance to really use the camera but so far so good, I love being able to just ay a word i.e. "Cheese!" and the phone takes a picture.As far as design I think it looks like an updated version of the very 1st iPhone. Had Apple kept gong wth the same color scheme I believe one generation of the iPhone would definitely look similar the LG Venice. The phone is very slippery so I would suggest finding a good case to keep the phone in when on the go. I like the home button and that you can use it to wake up the phone instead of havng to find the power button hidden in the top.WHY 4 Stars instead of 5:Front camera is VGA and that is very, very limited in quality. Some websites can be laggy sometimes, I thought it was the screen on my phone not being sensative enough but it always runs well on apps just lags a bit on certain big sites. Another thing I hate is that this phone probably will not be getting an Android update and I would rather not Root it.Hope this helps with you decision.
