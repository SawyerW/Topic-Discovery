For the past 4 months that I have owned this phone, it has delivered on all of the features I required for which the phone was purchased. The primary feature was that it was unlocked and compatible with GSM to use internationally and small (i.e. less than 4" display).  Swapping a GSM chip in another country worked 100% of the time and within seconds. The call quality is as good as any phone ever used. The bluetooth 3.0 pairs perfectly with all devices used (headset and MacBook). Music via Built-in FM radio,  Radio streaming (via Nokia Internet Radio application) and MP3 player are simple and provide multiple listening options. WiFi connects easily. The touch screen interface is easy and intuitive, perhaps even more so with the Anna OS upgrade. GPS works great and free (once you understand the connection settings to use per the Nokia support website). Casual photos and videos are simple to use and the quality is fine for sharing. The built-in flashlight using the dual-flash is really bright and very useful and there when you need it at the push of a button.Other observations:Resistant to shock: This phone took a 3 foot fall on a hard tile floor while receiving a call and kept on ringing until I answered the call. There wasn't even a scratch or a dent and the phone keeps on working.Size: Small, yet comfortable to hold and keep in your pocket.Screen experience: Viewing is clear and crisp in all lighting conditions. Easy to enter in a few words which is the most I require since a computer will suffice for longer data entry.The battery power is great and even better when you turn off certain options when not being used.Bottom line: The Nokia C6-01 delivered as expected and was a good value for me regarding the combination of reliability, features and usability.
