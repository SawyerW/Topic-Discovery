What the SK3 should have BEEN & MORE!!!!!This is a great DEVICE and really throws you in the social scene of TRENDY teens and early folks in there 20's. This device SCREAMS mainstream. The SK LX is everything the SK3 should have been and more. The SK3 had a washed out screen and ironically the SK2s screen and colors just POPPED while the SK3 was total dullsville. The SK3 couldn't even send picture messages and at one point i think mine started to not even accept picture messages. You get everything that was on the previous SKs accept this time the screen has been improved by 100% and its also a larger screen. You also get to send picture message but no camcorder or video message on this device. Which was a bit shocking, considering every standard cell phone has this feature i was a bit shocked that this one didn't have that. Perhaps maybe the SK4 will have it. You also get to record voice message that only last 20 seconds but you can send em to a friend for laughs. There is still no 3G service so your surfing the web at EDGE speeds and i live in NY and i haven't seen a slower browser then this one. There are certain times where its actually quite fast but i couldn't imagine trying to surf the web if i lived in Texas by the horses. Anyways this is a great buy and I love keyboard and as much I try to stay away from the SK I always find myself coming back to the device. Hopefully the next installment will fix all the flaws as the SK LX is just a cosmetic upgrade over the SK3. Real great device but for the price I would of liked to see a bit more new features added in.
