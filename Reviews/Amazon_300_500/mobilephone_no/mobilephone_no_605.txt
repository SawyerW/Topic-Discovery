I got this phone as a christmas gift, and, aside from the battery issue my first one had, this is an absolutely terrific and easy to use phone.  the keypad is the best i have seen on any phone, and the size of the screen is perfect.  I had my previous phone, a samsung x4217 or whatever it was, for well over 4 years, and i had just about had it with that phone, so pretty much anything was an upgrade.  All i wanted from my new phone was a screen on the outside to show the time, and a camera that i could quickly pull out and snap a quick pic of something, and this has both.  this phone also has a video camera, which is a great extra feature.  the outside screen doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles, it just shows the time and whatever symbols you have at the top of the interior screen.  this phone has great sound quality, and the speaker phone works like a champ.  the ringer is nice and loud, and being able to use the bluetooth to send sound files to my phone, instead of downloading tones from cingular for an arm and a leg, is another great bonus.  We also signed up for the multimedia package, which nets you unlimited internet and Cingular Video access.  Cingular Video is great for espn mobile and cnn quickies, along with funny shorts from shows like letterman, family guy, and the brak show.at the end of the day this is just a phone, and it does everything that a phone should do, ie. not drop calls and it has great sound quality.  it doesn't do any particular added bonus that great, but it does all of them well, and that's how it should be.  if you are looking for an inexpensive phone with a lot of well-rounded features, this is by far the one to get.
