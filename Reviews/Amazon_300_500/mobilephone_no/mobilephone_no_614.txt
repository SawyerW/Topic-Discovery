I have had my Blackjack for 5 months.  So far it is my favorite phone.  My two previous phones were the Cingular 2125 and the Treo 650.I am glad to be back to a full keyboard -- I missed that a lot on the 2125, since I do more data input than actually talking on the phone.  It gets much better reception and the speaker is louder than on the Treo.  I plan to keep this one until they come out with one that has a better camera, a standard headphone jack, and gps.  Waterproof would be nice. :)Pros:  While the keyboard is cramped, I am able to use it effectively, especially with text prediction.  The signal is better than most PDA-style phones I have used.  With the extended battery it is not so thin, but the battery lasts me all day, even with bluetooth always on, listening to music while walking/driving, some text messaging, checking email every 15 minutes, and lots of calendar and task list input.  I only talk on the phone about 60 minutes each month, but it is the only phone for our household (no land lines), and I have not had a problem.Cons:  While better than the 2125 camera, I don't know why they didn't put one that can capture more megapixels -- the technology exists.  I would also like GPS in this phone -- similar smartphones have it.  It is almost impossible to read the screen in daylight -- have to search for dark shade to use it outdoors.  My biggest issue is that there is no standard 2.5 headphone jack.  I cannot use earbuds, the adaptors seem to be hit or miss on getting one that works well, and BT stereo headphones are really heavy.  For a phone marketed as part music-player, this seems downright silly!But, I love my phone!
