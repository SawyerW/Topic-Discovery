Highly aggrevating to do the proper research, know what I want and need, but to be lied to through blatant error or technical disinformation and market fluff from Amazon and/or vendor about the phone I would order and receive. I don't buy at eBay, and now I can proudly add Amazon to the list of places I won't buy from. at least BestBuy tries to get the technical descriptions of electronics correct for the consumer. I will drive to a store for electronics next time.UnlockedCellPhoneKings promised an Unlocked Motorola MB502 Charm, Bronze color, compatible with TMobile 3G data.  What I received was a LOCKED MB502, in a deep sapphire blue color, which would not work on TMobile 3G databand.  The phone would not work with an ATT nor a TMobile simcard, because it was still LOCKED to AmericaMovil cell carrier from somewhere in LatinAmerica. The blue color was fine, but the phone was un-useable.Particularly aggrevating was the fact that the cache had a previous user's personal data in the memory. Odd, this phone is being sold as new in box, UNLOCKED, and stated to work on TMobile.  Why would it have a MotoBlur account already set up?  I did a complete wipe of the cache and still no go. I have received an RMA to return this totally wrong phone.It is ironic that the reviews here show a lot of disappointment for a large portion of the people buying this phone. For different reasons. Some folk want to use this on ATT 3G. Some do not like the TMobile ROM it should have. Funny, but I had checked the descriptions, and looked forward to a stated TMobile compatibility.  If this phone had actually been UNLOCKED, I could have overlooked everything else.  But the personal data in the phone cache of this "NEW" phone was a real pisser. There is quite a bit of documented, fraudalent advertised claims here, using re-imported and grey market phones, foisted on buyers via the US mail.  Hmmm.I credit AMAZON primarily, for getting this wrong technically, and for allowing UNLOCKEDCELLPHONEKINGS to list it wrong, technically. I am out my time, cost of return insured shipping, and until I get my money back, I am out the cost of this dud phone purchase from Amazon / UnlockedCellPhoneKings.
