I have been using this phone for several days now and I must say that its very light and sleek.  Looking at the front, you will first you notice the motorola emblem, which lights up like a disco light when you assign musical ringtones to it.  I would have preferred a status light instead.  The front LCD display can be perfectly seen and isnt too small or too large.  When you open the phone, you notice how much more sleeker it is than nextels last flagship phone, the i95.  It weighs a mere few ounces and feels great to carry around.  The 65k lcd display delivers crisp color and is very bright.  I wish it was bigger though.  The keypad is backlighted with a sensor and a very nice blue hue which is pleasant to view at night.  The button arrangement is good, no problems here.  The back of the phone has the speaker on it.  People find it annoying that the speaker is located in the back but I understand why Motorola did it.  Now I can finally hear my phone ring when it's on my clip!  On the side of the phone you have the usual PTT buttons which are black and a black antenna.  The phone can hold upto 600 contacts, which is more than enough for anyone.  One touch PTT is a new feature which can help anyone.  IT has an arsenal of java apps and many more that are available for purchase.  The phones interface is quite easy and straight forward.  I have yet to have any wrong buttons pressed, which is a good thing.  The phone also has many color profiles which will fit any mood.  What interested me the most was the GPS system on the phone, which will tell you where you are in the world, a very cool feature.All in all, this phone is wonderful and worth every penny.  Nextel has done it again.  I would recommend this phone to anyone 16 and up.  Thanks for reading!
