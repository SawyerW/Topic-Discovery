I recieved my Nokia E6 four months ago and this is by far the best phone i ever purchased.Pros:-Battery life: like no other smartphone i've used before, i use this phone for emailing, facebooking, browsing the internet, listening to music, texting, calling, video recording, voice recording etc and the battery lasts up to 12 hours under heavy usage, on lighter days where i just text and listen music it lasts for about 2 days-Voice clarity: persons no longer complain about not hearing me properly now with this Active Noise Cancelling mic on this phone, it really works wonders for phone calls-Form Factor: the size and shape of the phone is a plus for anyone seeking a phone that's not too big nor too small, perfect for my big hands and it really intimidates the bb users i know :)-Camera: takes great pictures, no complains, (close up pictures won't be of great quality) and records video is true HD quality-Keyboard: close to perfection, i scarcely make mistakes even with my 'huge' fingers plus i type very fast on this-Home Screens: keeps me away from the menu since i can have everything i need by just switching home screens-Calender & Notes: keeps me very organized and prevents me from forgetting things i usually would since i have my to-do list constantly reminding me.-Videos: this rich display allows me to see videos in extremely good quality and the phone supports more video formats than phones i've used before so this saves me having to convert certain videos-WIFI: stays connected, very good range, and download speeds up to 200+ kbps-USB on the go: a definite plus, no need to plug your flash drive into the pc then transfer files to the phone-Text Messaging: the 'conversations' feature really organizes your messages and helps you keep up with previous text messages-Opera Mobile: a must have on this phone, should come as the default browserCons:-Charging: whenever trying to use the phone while it's charging (using the charger) it stops then starts back 'several' times: this is an indication that the charging port is slack (i just put the phone flat and use it to prevent this problem)-Fingerprints: i'm using the phone without a screen protector and it leaves traces of all fingerprints (i have some screen protectors on the way, that should fix the problem)-E-mail: 'sometimes' there is a lag in retrieving mails but this varies, when you're using a data plan to using wifi, wifi has faster and better retrieval timesAll in all, i highly recommend Nokia on any given day and to anyone looking for the best selection of phones out there. Same thing applies to the Nokia E6: Buy It!
