Do not even consider purchasing this phone.As a Nokia fan and owner of a N95-3 (a great device), everything about this phone looked & sounded great.  It has all the same featues packed into a sleeker, more attractive body, with a higher end screen and equivalent battery life, for a lower price.  Sounds perfect, in theory.But... spend some time reading comments around Amazon and other review sites, and you'll notice a common theme: horrible build quality.  It seems Nokia has cut so many corners on component quality to drive the price of the N85 down that you stand little chance to get one that will work properly for a decent length of time.I've personally been through 2; the first worked well for 1 week and then the in-ear speaker quit working, so I couldn't hear anybody on the other end. An inexplicable component failure I've never seen in other handsets regardless of brand.  The second unit appeared to be okay for the first couple days, and then on any call that lasted more than 10 minutes, would start to randomly cut in and out, mysteriously dropping words & entire sentences, and sometimes dropping the call altogether.  Thought it was the network the first couple times, but as a regular occurrence 2-3 times a day (with full bars) realized it was definitely the phone.Read other reviews and you'll see a multitude of other quality issues, including dust under the screen, creaking buttons, hardware freeze-ups, etc.You may think to yourself, "good phone at a good price, I'll take my chances and hope I get one that works", but no, DON'T do it.  I am pleading with you, don't even try it, because the phone will fail - under warranty if you're lucky - or possibly 8 months down the road, and you'll be out $300 and feeling stupid.  Get an N95 instead, or an N97 if you have the cash.
