Bought this from Amazon.com for $389 US.It's well worth the money.Here are some of the pros:_- Extremely good camera.Photos and videos are better than any other phone even some digital cameras.- The phone is well-built & comfortable in the hand. The aluminium casing not only looks good but is very hard 2 scratch.I prefer the cold smooth feel as opposed to warm plastic of others.- The touchscreen is very good...only maybe some HTC phones have better responsiveness but I haven't been annoyed by it even once.The phone came with a plastic screen covering which I left on & doesn't even hinder the functionality and adds more protection to the super scratch resistant Gorilla Glass...so it will b scratch free for a long time.- The display is superb.Samsungs do look better but only when you look at them side-by-side can you tell the slight advantage they have in resolution and screen size.Cons:_- This is my biggest gripe.The others are more like peeves.The loudspeaker is not as good as my N96(which had 2) and is placed on the back on the camera lens part so when you lay the phone down and it rings you may not hear it.However I simply just stand the phone upright since it's design allows for this and is a neat way 2 show off the phone :)- The battery life isn't as good as other Nokias like the N96 but that's 2 b expected since it is more powerful.- The internal memory should have been 32gb but 16gb should b enough for most.I have >4000 tracks on mine so I'll have 2 put in a 16gb or > card soon.Debatable points:_- I've used Nokia for years (fanboy?) so I'm accustomed 2 their UI & OS so I personally don't find them unintuitive or boring but others may.The N8 OS is much better than the N96.- The number of apps available is limited but I don't play games on my phone so this too doesn't bother me.The preloaded features are > enough for me eg.FM transmitter,Office,etcIn closing I am happy I bought it and hopefully I'l be able 2 get at least 2 years of good service from it.
