There are some great things about this phone.  The GPS is super, though prohibitively expensive in the data mode.  Still good where wi-fi is available, and adequate on it's own.  Overall a great addition.  The camera is wonderful, better than it has any right to be.  And the phone is OK.On the other hand it is difficult (so far impossible) to configure into a simple, useful form.  For instance, can't get a browser key onto the home page either intuitively or trying to find and follow directions.  The apps store is either unavailable or the apps don't download, just get an "Error" message.  A ridiculous state of affairs for Nokia, but that's how it is.  Can't download the few apps I've managed to get into the computer into the phone.  The instructions and help are useful but have an interesting problem. Directions don't necessarily translate into what is on the phone.Overall I'm debating whether to keep it, don't know if I want to go to the trouble of sending it back but neither do I want it.  It's OK, but for the money there has to be better out there.I didn't return it and I wish I had.  This has to be the worst purchase I've made since I bought a Magellan GPS.It usually doesn't ring.  I know if someone called by the voice mail indicator.  It is very difficult to use.  Phoning a person on my contact list takes 6 finger taps.  To navigate awkward, not intuitive, and not reliable.  The camera is excellent, absolutely superb, but try taking two in a row.  You have to navigate away from the camera to save the first, then navigate back.  And on and on.  The apps don't work, you can't find them anyway.I'll never purchase a Nokia again, or any OS they use no matter the brand.
