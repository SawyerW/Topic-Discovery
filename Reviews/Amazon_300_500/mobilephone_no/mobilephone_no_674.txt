This phone meets all of my needs and expectations and then some.  The things I love about it most:- Battery life.  I get 8 days on a charge, even when using 3G, Wifi, texting and calling regularly.  I don't use Bluetooth or the GPS too much, so those might affect your battery life.  Still, the battery on this thing is really impressive.- Keyboard.  I have large hands, and my first day with this phone, I definitely had my share of typos.  That ended pretty quickly though and now I'm a typing machine.- Screen.  It took me weeks to realize that I hadn't removed the little plastic film on the screen as I'd been using the phone the whole time.  It even looked great through that plastic, and now it looks even nicer without it.- microSDHC support.  I put an 8 GB card in there I picked up for another $20 or so and I can't imagine lacking for storage now.Despite my 5 star rating (because for me it's a 5 star device), it does have a shortcoming or two.  They don't detract from my enjoyment of the device, but I think the more information you have, the better informed a purchase you can make:- The camera is just not good.  I have yet to take a good looking picture with it.  The colors always seem off to me and there are noticeable artifacts.- Software selection.  I'm in the US, but I think the S60 operating system is much more popular in Europe, and it shows in the software catalog available for this phone online.  Many of the apps you'll find are Euro-centric (for example, soccer score tracking or European news sites).  I found a variety of apps that provide all I need from the device, but if you're the kind that likes having lots of choice, you may be let down.  That said, this phone does run J2ME applications and it also includes the Nokia web runtime that lets you run web widgets (Google for Nokia WRT to find out what that's all about).All in all, I think people looking for a powerful phone with a full QWERTY keyboard would get a lot of use out of the E71.
