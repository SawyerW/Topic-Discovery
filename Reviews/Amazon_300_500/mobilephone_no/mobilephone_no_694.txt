If you're used to Palm or Blackberry business devices, you will likely not enjoy this phone.  It certainly looks the part - its hardware and aesthetics are very pleasing; it's slim and compact; the QWERTY keyboard feels good and works with even the chunkiest of fingers, my sausages not withstanding.  The battery life is also very good.Unfortunately the good news ends there.  The software is dreadful.  Firstly you can't load your contacts from other systems because the PC software provided has no import capabilities at all - except you can import `Thumbnails'.  Way too many menu navigations are required to do the common tasks such as looking up a number and dialing it.  Depending on where you start from, it can take six menu choices to get the phone dialing, the last one being an annoying extra option to make a voice or video call.  Setup items are difficult to find.  You can't easily switch to Vibrate for example; you have to go through a pile of menus to find the setting.  I'm in and out of meetings all day; I need a button on the phone to allow me to turn to vibrate on the fly.  Messaging does not thread - so every message is treated as a separate event, therefore you can't see the response from the other person when composing your answers.  Some of the shortcut menu choices on the screen are the same as the buttons - rather a wasted opportunity to bring other common features into easy play.  The rest are wasted on one time deals that should be buried in a menu somewhere; for example, Setup Email, Setup Internet Tel. Calendar Entries (Calendar Entries from where exactly - not outlook - you can't sync).  I've had this phone less than two weeks and am already looking for something to replace it.  I will likely go back to Palm.  Sorry Nokia, but whoever designed this software doesn't understand the needs of the business smart phone user.
