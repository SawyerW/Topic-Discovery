I have owned this for about 4 months and this is what I've found.Let me go a little in depth into the good and bads:Lets start with the good...1. Cool phone.  When you use it people notice because it is such an original design.  (main reason I like it)2. Awesome keypad.  It is perfect for a texter and the button size is great for someone that can't see all that well.3. Battery life. Lasts about two days of heavy(ish) use.  I have gotten 3 days out of it.Now let me go into the bad...1. Not exactly user friendly.  Slow to navigate and a little unwieldly.2.  Back cover doesn't want to stay on.  No matter how hard you try it won't stay on.  I can just pull it out of my pocket and the back will slide off.3.  Some weird HUGE glitch in there OS.  For some reason when the phone is on for more than 2 days without turning it off, it will basically become inoperable.  The camera won't work and you won't be able to call people.  You won't be able to push certain buttons or respond to texts.  If you try to shut it down to try to get it working again, it won't work.  You have to remove the back and pull out the battery.  THEN it takes about 5 minutes to start up to operable speeds. (has a weird glitch where it won't work smoothly for the first couple of minutes.)This is the SECOND phone to have this issue that I have owned.  I sent the first one back and the second came with the same issues.I wouldn't want someone like my daughter to be in a jam of some kind and then all of a sudden to wait five minutes to remove the battery and wait for it to restart.What if she needed to call 911?I would never recommend this product to anyone.  Cool phone but way too many drawbacks.
