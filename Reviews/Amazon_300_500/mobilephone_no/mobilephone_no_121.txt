It seems that some reviewers would rather discuss the Pro's and Con's of TracFone and there customer service as apposed to this card, which is what the review should be about. So let me review this card first and touch on the rest later.Previous to using this card I was using  prepaidonline.com  for my Tracfone minutes. They are about the same price as Tracfone but unlike Tracfone the service was excellent. All my transactions where over the phone to a US operator. My minutes where added to my phone while I was talking to them " Nice and easy with no problems ". I saw this card on Amazon for 30% off the list price and $30 less than I was paying, so I bought it. True it only has 400 min. on it but I have double minutes on my phone so that adds up to 800 total. With prepaidonline.com I was getting the 800 min plus 200 bonus minutes but my phone is rarely used for long conversations, so 800 min. is plenty in fact I have 900 min leftover on my phone now. All I was concerned with was the time left, and this card gave me another year. The Amazon seller was Veronica Tablet and they sent it overnight even though I was expecting Prime 2 day delivery. It was packaged properly and super easy to use. I just put the pin # from the card in on my phone to add minutes and within a minute the time and minutes where added to my phone. I noticed the price fluctuates on this card depending on the seller, I have seen it go from 69 to 99 dollars.  Best to keep watching it untill the price is right.As for Tracfone I have had it for nearly 5 years and love it. I have not had any problems PERIOD. I have traveled extensively on the East Coast with no dead areas or connection problems. Reviewers mention Tracfone customer service is lousy, well I have never used them. I have used prepaidonline.com from the beginning, that could explain why I have not had any problems.
