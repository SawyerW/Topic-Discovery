I am working on a project and I needed an Android phone that I could take apart in pieces.I bought this phone because it was cheap, and lets be honest, it looks like is worth less than the price.Anyways, I got a prepaid plan with T-mobile just to get it going and in my way home I started playing with it and I was kind of impressed with its functionality. It was fast (no lag) and it had all the functionality of any android phone. By the time I got home, I had already played with the GPS, the back flick pad, online downloading (3G speed max) and the FM radio (YES, it has an FM radio with great quality [you need earphones, thou]). I was like holly poop, this phone is awesome! Not only that, I went to a friend house across the border in Mexico where there is no T-mobile signal. I connected my phone to his Wi-fi and there is an app in (already installed in the phone) that lets me use my T-mobile phone through the internet (I think this is a T-mobile exclusive app, but not sure)... I was like "DAMN! I can call and receive calls even with no signal." Another thing that I thought was going to be a problem is the screen size. It looks like the keyboard overwhelms the screen, but it actually helps a lot because it does not take screen size when you need to type. It is BIG plus right there.So now I feel like I'm going to cry a little when I break this phone apart... but I think I will get another one of these :)Highly recommended phone, it looks better in person than in the picture and is very functional and "CHEAP"Notes: Although I buy most of my online merchandise from Amazon, I did not purchase this phone here.My actual carrier is T-mobile, there are other reviews complaining that this phone has bugs when using with other carriers. If your carrier is not T-mobile, read the other reviews first.
