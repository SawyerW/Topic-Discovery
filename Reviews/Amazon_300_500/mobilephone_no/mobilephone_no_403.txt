Can this VERIZON phone be used with STRAIGHT TALK ! ....Most definitely YES ! ......I am using mine now and have been since Oct 18th 2013.... It does NOT matter if it used a sim card or not & it doesn't matter if the S T phone you use with S T uses a sim card... Mine used one but I didn't need to use a sim card after I had S T set this one up for me .... I bought mine used, ( Mint Cond ) called Straight Talk, gave some numbers under the battery and they got the code I needed @ the cost, to me, of $14.99 * * Very easy process* * ..... BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE.. It works better than my Nokia E5 and that is a nice phone also....Sure with it being used there were apps on there I didn't want... Yes, there are Verizon apps that don't want to be removed, however, this does not hurt the phones ability to be a terrific phone.... I love the camera, video, texting, internet, all of it ! .... I have absolutely no complaints with this phone at all....The best part about this phone is that I have a MUCH stronger signal with this Verizon phone using it with Straight Talk than I had using a Straight Talk phone.....This is a wonderful phone.... Oh my goodness I almost forgot... Some might find me a bit "nerdy" here but I really love the speaker use to type up a text to send...... I am still learning what this phone has to offer me and I love it ! !I do suggest that you use a stylus ( not the one with the pointed end but the soft squishy end ) AND use a static cover over the face ...  There is a help app that is marvelous in the menu and I also downloaded the manual onto my laptop.... But once I got used to using the help app on the phone I haven't used  the downloaded manual....Hope I helped ya's....
