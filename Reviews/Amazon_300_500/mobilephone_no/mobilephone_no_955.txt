Performance and battery life are good, and it performs as expected, with the exception of the glitch mentioned below.There was a 4gig micro sd card in mine, though I suspect that varies by the seller you get it from, since that isn't listed as a part of the deal.  I got it from shopcelldeals. Web browsing and memory intensive apps are a little bit slow, but for $50 it's perfect for occasional use. If you are going to be using apps or internet all the time, you should invest the extra money in something faster, but this is perfect for looking things up on the go. It can be tough to select links in small font when browsing, but that may be correctable by changing zoom or using a stylus. Try to write your apps to the  micro SD card to save processing space, and you really should have a micro SD card to make up for the minimal memory capacity. I was reluctant to leave my physical qwerty keyboard, but the swipe to text keyboard is faster once you get used to it, but you do need to proofread for typos when it occasionally guesses wrong. Camera, voice recorder, microphone, and touchscreen perform well with no issues except the two glitches.Glitches: I've heard that it will freeze up or shut off when the memory capabilities are overloaded, though I haven't experienced that, and it is apparently fixed by using an SD card for the majority of the storage. However, the touchscreen has completely failed to respond on three or so times in the 6 weeks I've had it, so I was unable to select the power down option, and had to pull the battery. It restarted and worked fine. I am using a screen protector, but I don't think that made a difference in responsiveness.I'm using this case, and it was unaffected after falling ~5 feet onto hardwood floors, though the phone is inexpensive enough that a nice case may be unneccesary. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4R5EW2/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1
