It has just been days since I received the phone but it is starting to do wonders for me. I used to have a samsung smartphone before the nokia E6. I disliked the fact that phone these days don't have a physical keyboard. With the Nokia E6 I love the incorporation of the touch display together with a physical qwerty keyboard. The keys are very much responsive. The spacing between the keys are a little bit cramped in the Nokia E6 but they still are one of the very good keyboards out in the market. the display is impressive considering that it's not a big screen size but still gives a very good picture quality. About the pre-installed apps, they really come in handy specially with those E6 users who are into business/marketing. the Os is responsive to common tasks. I noticed that it sometimes lags when you download large files but after the installation, zoom!! zoom!! The built quality is superior. You won't be hearing rattles when you shake the phone. The speaker's quality is good. I was not able to hear any static noise or experience dropped calls when trying to call from the phone. Overall a very good quality phone considering the price below $500. I would not compare the phone to blackberry's new qwerty touch phone (bold 9900) since the E6 is only 380 bucks compared to blackberry which is around 800 bucks. I personally would buy the E6 and put the 400 dollar difference in my wallet.:)By the way, the ovimaps are a swell to use since you will be able to use it even without internet (offline). Another thing is that its pre-installed with joikuspot premium! With this app you will be able to share your phone network's data plan with your laptop and other devices, and fully connect it to the internet for free! no more buying air cards, extra data plans nor searching for wifi hotspots!!! give it a try. this phone works wonders!.
