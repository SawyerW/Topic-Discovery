Compared to my bulky Nokia 3650, this phone is a godsend.  It has all of the great features you could want in a phone: calender, contacts, camera, bluetooth enabled, polyphonic tones, etc.  Sure the Nokia has these things too, but it also has about 8-10 oz on the Sony as well.I get great reception 5 bars all the time where I'm at and high res screen looks fantastic indoors (see below).The Bluetooth worked perfectly on this little device.  No messing around with what type of "profile" does the phone support (handsfree vs. headset).  I had the Motorola BT handsfree working with the phone in under 5 minutes.Now for the not so good.As mentioned before, the battery in this thing is not good at all.  I also conditioned the battery and did an optimized charge.  I am lucky to get 2 days out of it which is kind of disappointing.  Another little picky thing I don't like is the battery icon.  When the battery is fully charged, you see a battery icon that is green, but only half green up and down (I've let it charge for 2 days and can only achieve the half full green icon).  When the power starts to deplete, you see an icon where the meter changes from left to right and then the color changes to yellow etc.  What kind of goofy icon shows a full battery with a half full green icon?  Just plain stupid if you ask me.Also, don't plan on looking at the screen in sunlight.  You can't read a thing on it.  I was having to use my hand to provide shade just to see what the heck I was doing.Overall, I would give this phone a 5 star rating based on what I had been using.  However, the faults I've listed above bring into the 4 star category for now.
