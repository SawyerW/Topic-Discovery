Bought phone to replace N97 which is giving me RAM memory problems. After long doubting wether to go with N8 or iPhone, finally choose for N8 although a little worried about the turning off issue.During set up phone turned off and impossible to turn on again, neither get it into battery charging mode. Very disappointed.Update 19.12.2010 -  Amazon sent me to Nokia and to come back to them if encountering any problems with Nokia. No response from Nokia! Maybe assistance on working days only, so maybe tomorrow?Found on internet additional hard reset besides maintaining power key for 8 seconds: Press menu - camera - volume down keys together. Than try again power key for 8 seconds until phone vibrates. Could get phone to turn on and charge battery. It died several more times, but could get it alive this way again. After several days it seems stable now.As a comment found on internet: it is like buying a new BMW/Mercedes having to ask road assistance to start it!!Update 24.12.2010 - After 4 days it died again being able to start it up again after waiting a few hours doing the same tricks again. Than once more it turned off. Decided to turn it in to go for another brand/model. Amazon customer service has been helpfull, Nokia Care by e-mail is useless, they don't answer.Update 05.01.2011 - Thumb up for Amazon customer service, professional and on time. Nokia Care responded after 9 days, allready returned the phone, sending a standard message that the phone needed a technician and repairs (!!)I answered the e-mail, but no reply. Shame Nokia with this very very poor respond to this global problem (see Nokia internet forums).Update 27.05.2011 - After 5 months Nokia responds to my email indicating that I have to go to another Internet site and send in again my claim!!! Incredible!! They realy don't have a customer service sence!!
