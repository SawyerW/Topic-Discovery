Ordered from hotglobal shop 8/5/13: I just got my phone in mail today & I immediately ran into problems straight out the box. Something is wrong with the calibration of this phone. Every time I touch something it does not respond at all or another app open up. I've reset to factory & re-calibrated it. I can't even use it because none of the apps open up when i press them. this is so frustrating.Update: 8/19/13 I ordered another one of these phones from a different seller (happy shopping, but fullfilled by amazon, i suggest you make sure it's fullfilled by amazon just in case things dont work out before your 30 day are up) and so far everything is working great like camera, speaker, hulu,netflix, candy crush saga, temple run 2 etc. i have not tested mms, sms, or 3g. Its running android 4.1.1 and the  model is gt i9300. I'll update if i start to have problems with this one I think the one I had before was rooted because that's what was in the about section of the phone & the screen was acting really crazy.update: 8/20/13 this phone has a section to connect to 3g but mines doesn't it only get edge. in which case i can get online (extremely slow) & send pic msg but i can't watch netflix or hulu which my 5 y/o loves. I've tried switching my sim card in the other slot but that didn't work either. im also shocked that i can put my at&t; sim card in either slot & get service. if anyone knows what i can do to get 3g please let me know or i'll have no choice but to return this beautiful phone. thanksupdate 8/21/13: I've decided to return my phone because I can't get the 3g to work on the straight talk AT&T; network & the 3g service is why I ordered my phone in the first place. I love everything about the phone it does everything that other android phone does. It seems to be a good quality phone & if you are one who doesn't need 3g service then i recommend this phone for you.
