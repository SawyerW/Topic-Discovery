Have used the phone for a little more than a week now. I have owned *MANY* phones, across iphone, blackberry, nexus, samsung galaxy S, ...* Form/Design: neat compact/slim design. By far one of the thinnest phones I have owned. It easily fits into your pocket. The housing has "plastic" back. Having had it in a pocket with keys, ... for a week there are no scratches on the unit. Great design.* Screen - the new screen has excellent contrast and great resolution. Really one of the best screens out there.* OS: uses the latest anroid 2.3.3 very responsive and great performance.* Comms: The phone has about the same signal quality as an iPhone 4. It is not better and not worse. In areas with poor signal it uses a lot of power to stay connected and it will make the unit heat up. Also battery power will drain quickly. That is quicker than an iPhone or a Blackberry. Known problem for Andorid phone. If you live in an area with great coverage not a problem, if you live in an area with average or poor coverage it will imply poor battery performance.* GPS: The GPS performance is OK for navigation (love the google navigator), but it does drain the battery quicker and the GPS performance in terms of accuracy is more noisy than the iPhone.* The camera generates very crisp pictures at 8MP. Quick impressive. The flash is not ideal (ok it is a cell phone and not a camera replacement). For non flash situations you get vibrant pictures of high quality.* Battery performance -- on average the battery lasts a day. Better than the older Galaxy X and on par with the best android phones.Overall a nice phone. If they could generate better battery life it would be close to perfect.
