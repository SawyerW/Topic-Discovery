Just got my order of the Tracfone LG800G in great time (2 days) from this vendor...was expecting a "extra minutes booklet" that seems to be part ofevery tracfone purchase in the past...this one didn't have that booklet...so I would assume that if you purchase this don't expect the extra minutes bookletto be included with a "Triple minutes phone" package...This package does say "Unlimited triple minutes"I'm replacing a Tracfone Motorola W376g with this phone...the W376g was a great phone& I uprgraded to it over 4 years ago when it first came out...been with tracfone since 2003...because I could get a local number for my area...Looking forward otherwise to this new LG800G...it's charging now so I haven't activated it...I'll see if...when I switch my number over to the new phone...if tracfone will send me the"extra minutes booklet" anyway...it only promotes minute purchase's...won't hurt to ask...The phone I recieved today has a manufacture date of 3/12/2012...just so you know what stock you are getting...***I'll also recieved an extra year of service with mine when activating the phone and transfering my present tracfone#to my new LG800g...*** I'm a teckie and so far haven't found a "easy way" with any TRACFONE to transfer the Address book from one phone to another.*** You can load songs...MP3's to this phone...***YOU can asign a song if it is small enough (800 KB or smaller) as a ringtone for a particular person in your address book...the wife and I love that feature***the memory card size max is 4 gigabytes...bought 2 here on amazon for $8 plus shipping...***the memory card fits under the battery...and is accessable to store music or pictures or games on it either of FOUR ways;(1) by the USB port on the phone; (2) via BlueTooth(3) by way of data purchase directly from tracfone or; (4)by removing the back of the phone & the battery and then taking the memory out and using a Mirco SD Memory Reader to transfer yourdata or music or pictures or video from the source...like a PC or Apple computer or...even a printer that has a Memory reader that the Micro SD card will fit in. More I won't mention.***My wife bought a PINK old style phone Reciever & mouth piece (like the old analog dial phones) at W-A-L-M-A-R-T... 4 ten dollars as a joke...it plugs right into the headset port of the LG800g...all she does is reach into her big purse...and pull out this big PINK reciever and talk. She walked out the door talking on her LG800g with this on her shoulder this am.it has a loudness adjust on it and a answer button...very light...may be good for SENIORs (giving my wife a hard time here) who want an easy way to answer the cell phone.
