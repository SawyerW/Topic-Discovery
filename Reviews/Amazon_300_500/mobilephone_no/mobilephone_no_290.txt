I have never written an online review before but I felt it is warranted in this case as this is one conflicted phone and also my first unlocked phone.  I needed a phone to travel outside of the states; I am a happy Verizon iPhone user in the US.  I did have a Droid Pro which Verizon unlocked for me but it will not work in the states or anywhere CDMA is available except on Verizon...( it cannot run gsm if CDMA is available).  I decided to get something different and always liked Nokia products back in the early phone days.The n-8 is built very well IMO, solid, great materials and a great size-fits very comfortably in my hand.  The screen is just ok but sometimes difficult to read.  Speed is just ok...nowhere near that of the iPhone. Call quality is good and like others have said, the camera is amazing.  All in all I like the phone alot and want to like it even more because it is so interesting- it definitely requires a learning curve versus the Apple and Android phones as its OS is not as intuitive but once mastered, it's fine.  One annoying problem is that I can not get my music from my Mac onto this phone as the required plug-in does not work with the latest Apple software-hopefully an oversight Nokia will fix promptly.  In addition, the app store, OVI, is limited-not even a NY Times app.I know Nokia has had many problems of late but I feel that product wise they are pretty close to the leaders..perhaps they should continue to focus on Symbian before "giving it up to Windows" in the upcoming models.I was about to return the phone but it's quirkiness and my need for a true unlocked/world phone is making me consider keeping it.
