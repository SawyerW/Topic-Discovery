A little under a month ago I bought this phone and Promptly decided I hated it. Then after being away from it awhile, or, learning how to overcome what I consider some shortcomings of the phone, have decided to give it another try. This time with much better results. The first reviewer on here said You'd have to be nuts to not like this phone. She's pretty much on target. First off, the Triple minutes for life option, Buy one minute, get two free. Can't beat that. I am looking to NOT have a monthly bill and being able to roll my minutes over month to month is a good thing. If I were a very heavy texter or talker, then that would probably be different, but I am not so this plan works for me. This phone has a Wifi feature that allows you to go online anywhere WiFi is available and not burn through your minutes. I have used it, it works, It works well!  The battery life is much better than I expected it to be too. The battery has longevity. I like having a phone with the keyboard on the front. I would have settled for the LG500G however, that was double minutes for Life and Not triple minutes. Apparently there was a LG500 or 501C offered at one time on a home shopping show somewhere. I wish I would have known back then, but it's present day so foward I go. The keys on the Keyboard take a little getting used to, thus the 4 star rating. If you do not hit the space bar just right, you will get a period at the end of every word. It just takes some getting used to.The phone is also very light and does not take up a lot of space. I now reccomend this phone If it has those features which I mentioned that matter to you. I just wish now that they would come out with a hard rubber case for it. Someone told me that the Samsung Freeform III case will fit this. I ordered one elsewhere and it did not fit the phone, close, but no where close enough, just a tad bigger and the phone would have fit into it.
