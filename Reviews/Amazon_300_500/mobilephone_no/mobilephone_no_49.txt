I was reading the revies regarding this phone and the service with nextel 1st off any cell phone service you go to is going to have problems. I had voicestream then they changed to tmobile and went down hill. My bills starting going up even though my usage was the same. I've had cingular and there service was ok but that was so long ago that I dont really remember exactly my problems with them. I had sprint and I have to say I myself, had the worst experience with them. Just about everyone I know had sprint at the time I did and they had horrible service. I could understand the systems having bad days and the service being poor at times BUT IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN THE CUSTOMER CARE REPS ARE RUDE AS HELL!!!!I read a review in here about someone saying they transferred there number from Nextel to Cingular and was charged ETF of 200.00. (I am writing a review because I read this review by this person) Genius, if you still had service with nextel and under contract with Nextel and you port over your number to another service provider YOU ARE CANCELLING YOUR SERVICE WITH NEXTEL! HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT? OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU EARLY TERMINATION FEES. ALL CELL PHONE COMPANIES HAVE EARLY TERMINATION FEES IF YOU ARE STILL IN A CONTRACT. You should have done your homework before making that change and trying to get over on nextel.Nextels service for the most part is ok. They have their problems like others and some areas are worse than others. I know this for a fact because I used to work for Nextel and had to take calls from people with poor service. That was a long time ago. I got nextel way after I stopped working for them because I just could not deal with sprint anymore. The worst service reported was on the East Coast and especially Florida after the hurricanes.
