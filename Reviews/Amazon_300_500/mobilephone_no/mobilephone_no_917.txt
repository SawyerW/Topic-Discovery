I'm an Android advocate and was a happy user of the Samsung Infuse.  I was excited about upgrading to the S3.  The reviews convinced me to make the switch.  I've had the phone for about a week and although I think it has some wonderful features, there are just too many glitches.  Here are the two main issues I've encountered:1.  It seems impossible to connect the phone to a PC or a Mac.  I tried to connect the phone to several PCs, and I always received an error message about the computer being unable to install a driver.  This seems to be a widespread issue: googling this problem turns up many complaints in various forums.  I also tried to connect the phone via the Samsung Kies program that comes in a Mac version, and that also failed.  This is a pretty basic thing that you want to do with your phone.  It's unacceptable that it doesn't work.  I spent quite a few hours on the phone with Samsung tech support.  I discovered that if I revert the phone back to factory default, it can connect to my PC.  But once I've used it and installed a very few apps, connectivity is lost.2.  Less of an issue, I think it's resolved.  However, shortly after getting the phone, it was unable to connect to the internet.  I tried all solutions to the problem, but couldn't resolve it.  Then, mysteriously, several hours later connectivity resumed.I'm always nervous about being an early adopter, and I think in this case those who rush out to get this phone are going to suffer inconvenience as these bugs are resolved.PS I finally returned the phone, and this one is able to connect to my PC and my Mac.  I was careful to connect the phone and install the drivers right out of the box, before setting up any accounts or downloading any apps.  It's also a different sim card.  Who knows if it was a hardware issue or something involving the configuration of my phone.
