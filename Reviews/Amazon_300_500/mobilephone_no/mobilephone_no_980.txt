Received phone over-night (worth 4 bucks with Prime!)My Samsung Galaxy 2 (T-Mobile / tmobile Walmart Plan) - unfortunately SMASHED and I needed a new phone fast.This phone -- Noticeably  larger than the galaxy 2- Pretty lightweight- Came with 2 batteries (2800 mah capacity - nice)  - They seem to charge quick too.- Came with 2 back covers (one of them has an integrated flip-open/shut front-screen protector)- Charging cord & USB Plug- Headphones (that are also used for the built-in FM turner! Cool)How easy was it to setup?1) Removed the SD Card and SIM from my Galaxy2) Placed in the new Note II3) Turned the phone on  - It immediately recognized the TMobile SIM Card and SDCard4) It prompted me to ask what SIM CARD to use for calls, text, etc. (I only have one - but uniquely this phone is setup to allow for 2 SIM cards, allowing you to choose which performs what actions)5) After this, I went into the menu, and the Google application, entered my info - synced up my contacts, etc..And I was good to go - there was nothing hairy about the process!! And un-trained Monkey could do it, pretty sure..+ I noticed this phone immediately responding quickly - as fast or faster then the Galaxy 2.+ The 8MP camera has really really great resolution+ Has the panoramic ability (press the shutter button, slowly turn phone = panoramic photo)+ DID NOT HAVE BLOATED SOFTWARE LIST+ Scrolling through menus, opening / closing apps, VERY fast+ I use the IM+ application to connect to a chat platform at my work-place, worked wonderfully (DATA CONNECTION)++ Came with a pre-installed screen protector! WAY cool!Overall I honestly cannot tell you a single negative thing about this phone yet, except maybe the resolution of the front-facing camera, which to me is so minor I wouldn't knock it - it's GOOD ENOUGH.I'll do more tests as I'm driving to different cities for connection quality, and I'll add more details in a week.I would jump on recommending the phone - it's a LOT OF PHONE for such a nice price!
