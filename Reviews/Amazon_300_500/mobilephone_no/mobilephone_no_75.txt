This is my second W580i and my third and last Sony phone I will ever own.Pros-Awesome design. It really looks smooth and sophisticated. I really dislike flip phones so this was a big selling point for me.-The battery lasts forever for its size.-Has a decent camera (albeit no flash)-Comes with lots of accessories like headphones, USB cable etc. I hate when you have to go buy all the extra stuff so it was nice that it is included. The memory card is not included, however.Cons-HORRIBLE reception. I've never had such a problem with reception in any phone. Ever. It doesn't work inside pretty much any building. It doesn't work at school. It doesn't work at the mall. It will even drop calls if I walk under a pedestrian bridge. My service is the same as with my old phone which worked flawlessly. I even sent the phone back and got a new one and spent an hour on the phone with ATT trying to figure out the problem to no avail. The phone simply has a terrible antenna. Unacceptable.-The card reader uses xD which is annoying as they cost twice as much as normal SD cards.-If you bump the phone or drop it a short distance the memory card will get dislodged and you will need to take the card out and reinsert it to get it to recognize. Sometimes that doesn't even work and randomly hitting the phone gets it to work again.-Keypad is flimsy. The numbers have all worn off after only 2 months of very light use. They feel like they are going to break off at any moment. It's also very easy to press the wrong key when texting or even dialing. Texting is almost useless which is sad since it is AIM equipped.-People complain that even when I have good reception (which is rare) they can barely hear me. I usually make a conscious effort to speak louder than usual to help this.I will be discarding this phone in the dumpster soon and buying a different brand.
