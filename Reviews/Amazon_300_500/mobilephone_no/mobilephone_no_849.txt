This is my third TracFone, and I love it, and the quality. I have two TFs now - one for home, one for personal stuff at work and play. I previously had an old flip phone, but I retired that one, recently replaced it with my other (newer) TF.I need a basic cellphone with a very few 'smartphone' features like email. I don't do a lot of calls, but I do get some texts. The LG800 phone is more friendly to me than my BlackBerry, which I gave away.I had a BlackBerry on Verizon and no one here in Keene NH gets decent phone service 'all around town' -- service is spotty and there are good areas, but my house was in a dark zone. I rarely could receive cell calls at home, and often lost calls I made, which could only be done from my kitchen.The LG800 plus the 1200 minutes deal worked great for me. I have only used about 300 minutes worth of time in about two months.If you need a lot of customer service and hand-holding and a nice storefront, or must have an iPhone, stay with AT&T; or Verizon. Trac-Fone's weak spot is their lack of accessible customer service. However, there is a large online community where you can get help and advice. To me, I'm good with TF.If your usage is low, TracFone is a good way to go. At some point, high-usage of per-minute time will exceed the cost benefit. I'm nowhere near that.I am saving a LOT of money, compared to Verizon. It'd be the same for any 'contract' cell carrier. And if I did have a high-usage month with my TF, I can always buy a minutes card and reload it, easily. But for me, the time deal, one year of access and other TracFone benefits works GREAT for me.I bought my LG800 through Amazon and got the great deal... Thanks Amazon!
