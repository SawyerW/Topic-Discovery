When my wife and I first got the phones on a promotional deal that sprint was offering I was very impressed.  The phone looked good, was very easy to use and had a wide variety of functions.  Due to all this I was willing to overlook the fact that sometimes it was a little hard to hear people you were talking to and that the battery got really hot when you were talking.Everything was going great for about the first year, then my wife calls me at work telling me that her phone was acting funny.  She tells me that its like her phone is automaticaly unplugging itself at the rate of about a billion times a second.  I thought that was wierd so we went down to Sprint.  They told us it was a common problem and that all we had to do was buy a flat charger.  In my quiet subtle manor (yeah right) i persuaded the guy behind the desk trade us the charger that didn't work for one that would.  He agreed.  That solved all the problems for a while until mine started doing the same thing.  Since I didn't think the guy at the Sprint store would be pleased to see me again my wife and I have just been sharing a charger.  After the case on my wifes phone cracked after a fall onto linolium from about three feet she finally had enough and went and bought a new phone.  I'm hanging in there with mine just to see how far I can milk life out of it.  So far the End and Back button have stopped working, it wont charge (even though it will tell you its full after only being on he charger for a second) the antenna wont extend anymore, it usually sends text messages three or four times in a row, to the joy of anyone receiving a text from me, the camera has stopped working, and the paint is coming off in many places.Ive had the phone 14 months.
