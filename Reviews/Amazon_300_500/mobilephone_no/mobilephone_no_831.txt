I am an advanced user and have been using this phone since past 3 months. This phone has an amazing huge s-amoled display which blows away all other phone displays I have seen till date. I have owned Blackberry,Nokia,iphone,etc but this phone is the best of all. I purchased this unlocked phone and rooted it immediately and installed custom Zeus rom (Gingerbread). It removed all the AT&T; bloatware and it can bump up its cpu speed from 1ghz to 1.6ghz with auto speed on demand setting as some graphic intensive games require higher processing power.Phone is incredibly slim so you need to buy a good case to protect it plus a scratch screen guard. Battery drains out quickly as the screen is a monster power consumer and phone heats up very very fast with GPS and screen turned on for longer periods. The sound quality is superb, display is super good and its on par with iphone its slim body.For advanced users like me, Iphone is really a piece of junk as I have customized each and every aspect of the phone which android allows and in my opinion, its far more advanced OS than anything in the mkt with tons of freeware available for downloads unlike paid apps from iphone. I am considering buying a second phone for my dad. At this price of under 350$, its a steal and it matches uptp 650$ dual core phones in the mkt with customized roms which can bump up the speed dramatically. It also has a state of the art GPU and phone is extremely fast inspite of loading it with so many apps. You can setup a wi-fi hub with your phone data connection too. Samsung is the worlds largest manufacturer of s-amoleds and other manufacturers have to buy from them to use it in their devices.
