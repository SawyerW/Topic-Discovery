I have used this phone since early 2012. It works well as a basic phone and is a good deal for people who use the phone sparingly, but anyone buying this should know that it pocket dials 911 far too easily, with the keypad locked, before putting it in their pocket. As a result, I hope to switch to a Tracfone that doesn't have number keys on the outside. It would probably be fine if you keep it in the provided case, but that was bulky enough to get in the way for me.Coverage is almost nonexistent where I live, but most of the time I can text and reliably hold a conversation without the call getting dropped with this phone. For incoming text messages, this provides a short preview of the message's beginning without the sender's number. The minutes are deducted when opening the message, so you're not forced to pay for others' advertisements.I'd understand if the phone responded to the exact sequence 911 pressed within maybe 30 seconds when the keypad is locked, but it is highly unlikely that that's the sequence entered every time that I lift a large object. I keep the keypad locked at all times, and I have verified that it was still locked multiple times after getting off the phone with the emergency dispatcher. As a result, I have to be very careful when lifting boxes or doing other things that put pressure on that pocket.Making the 911 safety feature this overactive makes me worried that the safety feature has turned into a risk-increasing feature for me or others, since it uses the emergency dispatcher's time when others have real emergencies, and it may work against the cell phone owner in a real emergency if the system marks numbers that make frequent false calls as numbers to ignore.
