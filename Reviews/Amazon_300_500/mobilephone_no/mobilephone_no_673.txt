I just LOVE it! I'm not going to write a super extensive review as other people has.Let me tell you I spent around 3 weeks checking out other devices and I saw this one as a very strong option.Nokia doesn't have the reputation a blackberry has when it comes to smartphones, so I read all the reviews that you may find out there about this phone and it's true what they say: it's so easy to fall in love with this phone in so little time. My brother saw mine and he bought himself another within a week.As for the hardware, I can't ask for more. Solid device! and the metal finish makes it look very professional and has impressed several of my friends so far. It doesn't look cheap at all.It can do pretty much anything you usually need. GPS is great. Web browsing with Opera Mini is great. Google Maps works amazing. Sports Tracker lets you go out for a run and track time, speed, altitude, route, etc.For texting of course, this is a great device. I rarely miss type something.The only reason I'm giving this phone 4/5 stars is because its vibration is not that strong. You can barely tell it's vibrating. If you depend on vibration only (no sound) then this may not be the phone for you. The ringtone volume may be set to ascending as a workaround, which I like actually.Yes, it works as phone too. Voice is loud and clear, just as you may expect from a Nokia!I don't think you'll regret buying this device. Amazing!If you're not in the whole touchscreen stuff and you need a phone that is not that "sensitive" or prone to be broken, then this is phone for you.ps.After reading a couple of reviews, go with E71 instead of E71x.
