Nov 5, 2011 5:46 AM (in response to dogfish)Re: Configuration error Samsung B2100I have the same Samsung B2100 phone with the same issue.  I receive a "configuration error" when trying to send or receive MMS messages.  SMS works fine, phone works fine.  Fields in the MMS profile are the same listed above in Dogfish's post:Home URL:Bearer:  choices are GRPS only, GRPS Frist, GSM First and GSM OnlyProxy: choices are ON or OFFAddress: current 0.0.0.0Port: 8080 is listed as defaultDNS1: current 0.0.0.0DNS2: current 0.0.0.0post by bikebrainiac:3. Nov 30, 2011 11:12 AM (in response to bikebrainiac)Helpful AnswerRe: Configuration error Samsung B2100Got it figured out.  No thanks to Tmobile either in the States or Europe.  This phone is supported in Europe so not sure what the big deal was.  Cust service refused to help me as it was an "unsupported phone."  Turns out all that I needed was the IP address, which should be universal.So to piggy back onto PILAR's advice, I addred the IP address to the address field as follows:216.155.165.50I am now good to go with sending and receiving MMS messages.Thanks!end of discussion.i just followed instructions for MMS SETTINGS including the last post (bikebrainiac) that says ADDED IP ADDRESS 216.155.165.50 to the address fieldand it worked!.pros:waterproof - tested by leaving in 1 foot of water for about 15 minutes.drop proof - dropped accidentally and still works.has fm radio. not yet tested.takes videos/photos.ordered from open group wireless via amazon and came with u.s. adapter for charging.cons:battery life seems short. full charge down to half at 4-5 days.manual is in russian. had to get english manual from samsung website.hard to find info how to set phone to send/receive picture messages.nice durable basic phone.
