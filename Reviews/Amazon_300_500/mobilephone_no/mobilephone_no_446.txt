I like this phone I really do. But Houston we have a problem. I can't put it in my pocket with the natural movements of walking sitting, etc. calling the police. I had the police come to my door once, considering this is a prepaid phone that interesting at best. i live with a conspiracy theorist, who just may be right! You know that show "person of interest?" It starts with "You are being watched..." Well darn of they are not right. This is a prepaid cell phone yet they called me back and knew my name and address and sent a car. I loaded 200 minutes on the phone so I can't exactly sent it back. If there is some way to lock the 911 calling out i would love to know it. This is serious business. I know people call 911 for stupid things, The time, a flat tire, etc. I don't want to be one of them. I even tried turning off the phone and it still managed to turn itself on. I am ordering a case in hopes I can figure a way to put it inside so the buttons do not get touched. We came off Att due to poor signal and the excessive cost. My kids picked out different phones and have had no problem. I got the card so i could put photos of the family on, (as Long as they are small, as you need to re-size all you photos you want on the phone. That is a major task. The phone card is designed to hold 4 gig of data. i have no interest in music, as I have nerve damage in my hearing so photos are it. I found a setting on my camera for size for e-mail and Facebook so that should work for the phone. I realize i am gradually going deaf so I am leaning sign. That will be my world eventually. Thing seriously before buying this phone.
