I've had my Nokia E71 for a year now. I loved it at first because my previous phone was crap, but soon learned that this one is an even bigger piece of crap! :)Pros:* The keyboard is easy to learn.* I almost always have service (though that might be my network and not the phone).* I could get on Skype (but no webcam) with it, which was a plus when my spouse was in Afghanistan and I couldn't be by the laptop 24/7.* GPS Navigation works and has gotten me to my destination probably 85% of the time.* The camera has a flash.* I can use it to connect my laptop to the internet with the USB cable when the power goes out.Cons:* Menus are hard to learn (I've had this phone for a year and still don't know where to find some things).* The webcam on it doesn't work with Skype, and nobody else uses the few programs it does work with.* Every time I try to download an app or a theme or anything, it restarts.* Internet browsing is very slow.* The email app that comes on the phone doesn't work properly and I've had to uninstall it so it would stop showing up on my homescreen.* It saves up all of my texts and delivers all of them hours after I was supposed to receive them (and it keeps the time that I was SUPPOSED to receive them!).* GPS is designed to tell you to take the nearest freeway exit, even if you enable freeways (so it takes you the long way).* The people I talk on the phone with hear a lot of background noise.* Unless the lighting is bright and perfect, your pictures are gonna come out looking like you took them with a toaster. Even with the flash.* This "smart phone" doesn't have good apps or very entertaining games.* Pictures don't auto-rotate (which isn't a huge deal - it's just annoying).* Its newest thing is dropping calls.I've tried contacting Nokia about these problems and they were pretty much useless. They later told me to send my phone in, but since I have no house phone, I couldn't.I just wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. Especially with that expensive price on it..! I wouldn't even pay $30 for this phone. I have no idea how it got so many good reviews. Please don't waste your money...
