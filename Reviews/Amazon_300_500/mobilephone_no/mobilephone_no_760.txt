I rarely write reviews, especially for products that majority of people know they are good products.  Nokia, though losing marketshare slowly, is still a big player and with many tricks up its sleeve.  The fact that they design a phone for the end users not the networks, is what keeps it a good phone in terms of customization and controls (privacy, tracking, sharing location, etc).The phone is very slick in terms of being a business phone, a bit bulky..but even with forced feedback touch screen, I still have a hard time using the touch screen to type..even on my wife's iPhone..and the iPad...I guess our ability to sense touch compared to sound is better..so I prefer forced feedback (tiny vibration to let you know you are touching the screen as you type).  So bulky...but that's the beauty..it has a QWERTY keyboard with Ctrl+V+X+C functions (copying and pasting stuff for documents, emails, etc).People complaining about the Ovi app store not having enough apps compared to App Store or Droid Market? Well...all of them offer crap apps anyway..so you won't be disappointed.  If you like crappy free apps, or to pay a premium for "better ones -aka no ads" then buy a an iPhone, or Android phone.If you like functionality, business use and ability to still have some fun with your phone...buy this phone.  Great camera (no auto focus....but if you need details up close...buy a real camera).  8MP, HDMI out,  720p video recorder, micro USB to  connect memory stick, office suite (full)....plays all kinds of audio/video formats, it has full version flash (unlike iPhone..who push people to develop apps to display ads..not through flash on sites).The phone itself has many built in security software and other software to keep you buys before buying any apps (tracking, security, locking, etc)Overall...if you remember the communicator (great business phone), this is definitely 100% improvement. And get the Otterbox case for it...you don't want to scratch it:)  Apple and droid have great marketing skills and presentation...but Nokia steals the show....their Symbian OS will be replaced by Windows mobile soon..I am not looking forward to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to login to the phone, but it's not a bad mobile OS.
