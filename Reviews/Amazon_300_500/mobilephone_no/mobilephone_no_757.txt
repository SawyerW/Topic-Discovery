this is my first cell phone that i bought myself. over the few months that i've had it, i wud say its a solid phone to buy given its price. the phone build is a sturdy one piece construction so its sure to take the blows and still work. reception is equal to that of other virgin mobile phones. User interface is very similar to other Kyocera phones which is very easy to understand. i only have 3 complaints:1. the keyboard is very small and stiff. given the phone's over all size and layout, i can forgive the keyboard size but the buttons are too stiff. when i tried the model in stores, idk what they did but the buttons were much more easy to press. this one will take some getting used to with the stiff annoying buttons2. the phone doesn't automatically split long text messages into 2 messages. so on other phones, when u've exceeded the character limit per text, the phone automatically lets u keep typing and just sends 2 txt at one time. on this phone, once u've reached the limit, ur done. it won't allow u to type any further. u have to send the message, go back to the inbox and press reply and continue. this can get very annoying.3. the speed at which the phone operates is kind of lagging. given its price, this is acceptable but going thru all the menus to send long txts gets annoying when u have to wait a bit in between each one.i got this phone for the full price of $60. a week later, the LG rumor 2 was on sale for $50. i got buyer's remorse :(if you can get the LG rumor 2 for around the same prices as this one, get that one, its everything that this phone is plus it doesnt have the 3 inconveniences as listed above that comes with the loft.other than that, its a definate buy for any easy going user who wants a decent phone that works without getting a contract or breaking the bank for the blackberry
