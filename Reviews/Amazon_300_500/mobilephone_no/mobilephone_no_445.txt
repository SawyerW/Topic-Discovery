I was getting a little tired of having such a low-feature phone.  While I rarely used it for more than texting or calling my family or very close friends/colleagues, I realized the benefit of having features like 3G access or a full keyboard when I was travelling or at a store wishing I could check reviews on a product.I did my homework, and decided I liked either this phone or the LG 840g for their wi-fi capabilities.  I've had the 390g for 2 months now, so I feel like I can share a pretty solid pro-con list for those looking to buy.Pros:- The keyboard is great.  Some review complain about issues with pocket dialing, etc.  I have had none.  I just hold down the "lock" key, stick it in my pocket, and go about my day with no worries.- The wifi is pretty easy to use.  I'll admit, I haven't used it a lot, but when I have, it's been pretty easy.  I don't love the browser, but I know I could download a diff't one if I really want to.- The look/menu is very user-friendly.  Easy to make calls, navigate the menu, take pics, and find whatever I need to on the phone.Cons:- The battery.  I work in an office with ZERO reception.  Even Verizon users have spotty reception.  My battery was dying after mild use form me and NO use at work... in about 36 hours!  I've started putting in in Airplane mode at work, which does give me a solid 5-ish days of battery... but I shouldn't have to do that, you know?- The sensitivity of the scroll button is a little hard to get used to.  It's more of a personal preference issue.  I'll adjust my volume then press the scroll button and it's so sensitive that it re-adjusts the volume.  Not going to be a big deal to some...Overall, I kind of miss my t301g.  I think this phone is really close to being great, it's just not quite what I want it to be.
