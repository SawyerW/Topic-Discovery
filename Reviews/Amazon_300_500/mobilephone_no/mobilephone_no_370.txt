I bought 2 of these a year and a half ago when my employer launched a program reimbursing us for Windows 7 phones (if I had a choice, I would definitely go with Android, but what the hell..) and this was the cheapest WP7 phone available then. The 2 phones have changed 4 hands in the last one and a half years, so I am speaking for all the users.I would give it 3 stars - cutting one for the poor quality screen that broke on a single drop and one for crappy Windows 7 software.* Overall - great phone for the price, screen is quite smooth and responsive, the hardware is reasonably sturdy and looks impressive unlike some cheap phones out there with tacky plastic. The camera is quite decent. A friend tells me the Windows 7 app store is very comprehensive, so he doesn't miss anything with this phone.* Software - Windows 7 for phones has a ton of issues. You can't delete contacts in groups/bulk, so if you sync your device often, you end up with a terribly bloated contacts book and the only way to delete contacts is ONE BY ONE. Several other such small but annoying software issues- though over the last year, the updates sent out by Microsoft have made it slightly better to use. Don't even get me started about the stupid idea of needing Zune installed on every PC that you need to sync the phone with. :(* TMobile issues- as another user pointed out, multimedia messages don't work with TMobile on this. The folks at the local store I went to didn't seem to recognize this model at all.* Works with regular simcards - these phones were used for the large part in India/USA and they work well with all SIM cards in India.* Screen - The screen on one of the phones smashed after a friend dropped it once. The touchscreen was still functional, so my friend continued to use it with the cracked screen.
