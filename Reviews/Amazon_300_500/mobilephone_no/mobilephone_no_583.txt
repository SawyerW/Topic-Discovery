This is your standard no-frills $30ish flip-phone -- the type everyone had about ten years ago.  If all you care about is making a call once in a while, it should suit you just fine since it nails the core strengths: the keys are nice, big, solid, and rubberized, and voice quality is quite clear.  With Bluetooth, a 2 megapixel camera, and room for a 32MB SD memory card, the specs ain't bad at all, and it has expected functions like an MP3 player, FM radio, and voice & video recorders.  There's also a "browser" that's probably best left unused, plus one nice feature all phones should have: the ability to turn itself off/on at preset times.Motorola got some of the details wrong though.  The menu layouts can be counterintuitive, with some functions/adjustments buried in areas you wouldn't expect, which can call for weird sequences of button pressing (even the calculator is screwy, with the decimal key being way up at the top of the pad).  I also can't believe this phone doesn't let you customize the 4-way shortcut keys on the directional pad -- this has been standard on every phone for years, and you'd think it'd be super easy to add.  Also, the charging port is proprietary instead of MicroUSB, so you'll have to buy a cable if you ever want to transfer data.So it's still a good enough phone, but the funny thing is that Motorola already topped it with a model they released back in 2009 called the EM326G -- a slider phone that can do almost everything this one can do while sharing few of the flaws (i.e. it has MicroUSB and programmable shortcuts, plus it looks cooler).  It isn't sold in stores anymore but it's still readily available both here and on eBay, so I say try that one before this.
