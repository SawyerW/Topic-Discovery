Have been using a Tracfone for 10 years and have been happy with the pricing, considering I hardly ever use it. I just need one for emergencies while traveling.  Coverage can be spotty in small towns.  It had been a pain to add minutes to maintain my account.  Every 90 days I had to call them, wait on hold, go through a bunch of serial numbers, etc., so I got this new Samsung Tracfone bonus pack the other day.  Now I can add minutes straight from the phone each time - much easier.After opening the box and plugging in the phone, I followed the directions to activate.  I called the number listed and was on hold for about 5 minutes.  They walked me through the process of inputting a few codes on my old phone to de-activate it, then they transferred the minutes to my new phone.  I followed their instructions and the new phone worked right away!  Another plus - it was coming up on my 90 days to add minutes, but when I activated my new phone, they extended it another 60 days.  So buying this new phone actually saved me buying $20 of new minutes this time!Only one problem - the car adapter that was included in the box did not fit the phone.  For some reason, they had put a Nokia adapter in the box with a Samsung phone!  I called Tracfone and the guy said I'd have to take it back to where I bought it.  I insisted that this ought to be covered by the Tracfone warranty but he wouldn't budge so I asked for supervisor.  After about 10 minutes a supervisor came on and took care of it.  They are mailing me a new car adapter, so I have to give them kudos for finally making it right.
