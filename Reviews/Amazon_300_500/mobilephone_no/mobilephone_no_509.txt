Pro:  light and thin, sharp screen, dual sims, replaceable battery, cheap.Cons:  so-so battery life, it doesn't like good headphones!the other reviewers pretty much cover all pros and cons of this phone, so I am not going to go over them.  I want to point out one thing that bothers me a lot about this phone.  Overall I like this phone except that this phone doesn't like good headphones!  I read about it in another review but went ahead to purchase it anyway.  i thought that reviewer might have a defective one, or his head phone was defective, or he put it in incorrectly.  but i guess he was right.  when i put in my klipsch headphones it sounds like crap.  when i put in my sony headphones it sounds like crap.  even with a standard headset from a verizon phone sounds like crap.  It only sounds normal when you plug in a very low quality headphones such as the one provided by blu.  I don't know how to describe how bad it sounds, but trust me, you don't want to put it in your ears.  i found a workaround by using a bluetooth-to- 3.5mm adapter, which turn a wire headphones into wireless through bluetooth.  then the headphones work perfectly well.  but this work around is becoming a pain because you have to connect to bluetooth everytime you listen to music, and it sips more battery on the phone (the bluetooth adapter requires battery too).  i eventually turned to my company's iphone for mujsic listening, but i really hate transferring music using that freaking itunes.  will be looking for another android phone for my music listening, probably a Sammy, and keep this one as a back up.  if you are going to use this phone as your primary music device, look somewhere else.  if you are not going to listen to music on your phone, this is a great smart phone to get.
