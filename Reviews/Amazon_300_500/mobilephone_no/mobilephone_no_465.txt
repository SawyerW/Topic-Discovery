I gave this phone a 4 start instead of a 5 for only one reason ... it does pocket dial. Other than that, it is an awesome little machine that has a lot of great features. I am able to create my own personal ring tones (any .mp3 file that is about 10 seconds long), which is a feature I really like.I got the SanDisk 32GB micro SD card and it works perfectly. I also got the data cable so I was able to transfer all my contacts to my PC in case I ever need to reset the phone I won't have to enter all the contacts in again (software for this phone is available via Samsung.com). I can also pair the phone with my PC via bluetooth and upload photos, music and video directly to the phone.The Music Player works great and I loaded hundreds of songs on the micro SD card via my PC. The phone's library categorizes tracks by album, artist, genre, etc., and you can make your own playlists.The phone itself is nice and clear. I've had great reception so far and have been using the phone for about 3 weeks now. The QWERTY keyboard makes sending txt messages and emails a snap.I set up the wifi to use the phone at home without additional minute charges. Wifi works great! I downloaded the facebook app and Opera mini and use both daily. You can also watch Youtube videos on the phone. I do recommend reading all the reviews here as you will pick up a lot of tips on how to properly use this nice little machine.I highly recommend this to anyone that's looking for an inexpensive way to own a multi-media phone without a monthly bill. The prepaid plan via Tracfone works great for my needs.
