I've had this phone for almost a year now.  Previous to that, I had the same Nokia phone (with Cingular) for 3 years.  No dropped calls problems, no call failed problems, nothing.  Occasionally, after making a phonecall, my bars would drop down to 1 or 0, and it would take 15 seconds or so to get my signal again.  Cingular suggested that I upgrade our phone.  So, we did.  In fact, we added an additional line to our monthly plan.  So we have 2 of these Motorola V400s.After using 2 of these for almost a year, I can tell you this.PROS:- Flashy looks- Decent camera- Nice display colors- Battery life is goodCONS:- Whenever the phone is in my bag or my pocket, the side buttons get pressed, which means my phone makes loud beeps.  The settings also get changed, which means my phone can be on silent and I have to reset it.- Extended dialing.  When I dial up my voicemail and enter my 4 digit code, each number that is pressed on the cell beeps for several seconds.  This is VERY annoying.- CONSTANT dropped calls.  Most calls are dropped after 12 minutes.  The person I'm talking to can hear me for about 10 seconds, but I cannot hear them.  Then, the call is dropped.- Call Failed - this happens ALL the time.  Frustrating when you need to contact someone and you cannot place a call.- Phone never rings - this is a common occurence.  My phone will be sitting on my desk and it never rings.  Suddenly it beeps - I have a voicemail... yet I never got a call.For the same price, there are plenty of other phone choices out there.  I am exchanging this with Cingular ASAP, since we haven't quite had it a year.  I hope my new phone is better.-
