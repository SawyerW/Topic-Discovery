The most important features for me were long battery life and customization. I really didnt place an emphasis on a camera-phone when purchasing.Pros:1. Customization - Can have distinctive ring tone and image for each person that calls you.2. Tranfer Files - I transfer images and midi files via the infrared port on my laptop all of the time. Just change the setting of the phone to "infrared" and place near the laptop, and the laptop identifies the phone immediately. No need for cables or to pay for Internet browsing capabilities on the phone. Just browse the Internet, download files to your laptop, and then transfer them over to the phone.3. Battery Life - The battery life on this phone is outstanding! When you aren't using the phone, it goes into standby mode that puts a minimal drain on the battery.4. Volume - Flexibility with volume control. You can make it relatively loud or quiet.Cons:1. Pictures - Resolution of the pictures is not that great. The Samsungs and LG phones have better built-in cameras.2. Exterior - The exterior of the phone is susceptible to scratches and nicks. It is difficult to keep the phone looking like new.3. Screen Visibility - When out in daylight, it is very difficult to see the contents on the screen.4. Keys are a bit on the small side.5. Midi files - my only wish for this phone is that it played mp3's instead of midi files.Please note: If you do get this phone, do not forget to enable the "key lock" feature. This is because when you place the phone in your pocket, it can make calls to other people on your phone list without you knowing of it.Also, I deleted most of the standard ring tones and pictures so that I can make space for the tones and pictures that I like.
