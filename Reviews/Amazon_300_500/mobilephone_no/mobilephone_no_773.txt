Its OK but not its not an iPhone.  I looked at the reviews and the features and the price and figured I would save myself $430.  Made sense at the time.  For the record I received an iTouch two years ago.  I hated anyting to do with the "i" company at the time.  Within 3 hours I had the device aced.  I could not believe the quality and the ease of operation.  Totally idiot proof. IMHO.Well I am now into my third week of head scratching with my Nokia.  Yes its smaller which I liked, it has good sound quality, it works with Skype sometimes (but sucks battery power), I was able to get the email configured eventually, it does run Flash, the camera is great, The keyboard system is not unlike any cell phone so its a pain.  No querty available.  It constantly tries to hook to the cell internet and will not use my wi-fi for many of its functions even when totally connected?  Lets just say its a neat little cell phone with some great features but do I wish I had bit the bullet and spent the extra $$$? YEP I sure do. Think real hard as the OS is not widely supported with apps either.Oct 7th. Update - OK - after calling Plantronics I was able to pair my headset and that actually works perfect.  I am not ready to give itanother star as yet but it is pretty good value.  Would have preferred android OS as the Symbian appears to be a bit of an orphan.July 2012 UPDATE.  Said to hell with it and picked up and iPhone.  Returned it to the store one week later.  Now that I am used to this little gem I found the iClunker heavy and chunky.  Yes it was smoother and did work very nicely but the price difference is way out of line. Now that I have really played with both side by side I am happy with my Nokia.  Hope this helps someone.
