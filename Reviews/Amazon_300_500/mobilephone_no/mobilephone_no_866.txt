As with any purchase of this type, it will take time to totally get accustom to all of its idiosyncrasies. I like the slide out QWERTY keyboard for doing messaging and any text entering. It has a weird set of ring tones (IMHO) but I am able to use the ringtones off my memory card which came from my old AT&T; cell phone.If nothing else, so far this phone doesn't seem to be too smart or smarter than myself. It seems to have better reception than my older Pantech Breeze III which makes the use more to my liking. The speaker seems like it could be a bit better and it seems to crackle more than I am used to. Maybe it will get better as I play around with the volumn.One thing I did find irritating was the Shortcuts/navigation button. Evertime I pulled the phone of of the belt case it was as though I had pushed the upper navigation button. I was able to get around that by setting the button to "None" and now it is fine. I don't as a normal practice used the navigation buttons for shortcut purposes any, never did and don't ever expect doing that. ;-)This phone comes from the AT&T; affiliate Telus. It works just fine with the AT&T; network. The one thing I like is this AT&T; cell phone doesn't go to the browser mode when you hit the OK button in dormant mode. No more using up minutes when accidentally hitting the OK button.For those who want more options, there are plenty of them. Games, music, Internet browsing, etc. For me, this is just a little more than a basic cell phone. Oh yes, it works just fine with my Microsoft SYNC on my Ford Fusion and my Ford Focus. It is approved by Ford to be compatible with their MS SYNC. That was one major consideration in buying this phone.
