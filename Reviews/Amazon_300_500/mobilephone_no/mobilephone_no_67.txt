I have to tell you all that I am so impressed by this phone, it amazes me!  I am not easily amazed or overcome to write a review on anything.  But seeing this here is awesome and I just got off the little bugger (in a very good bugger way :)  The sanyo Silver SCP-8200 is one sturdy and reliable phone.  I am rough with the phone, I have dropped the phone at least 3 times already and I have been a klutz like that forever and since I have owned the phone almost 6 months now.  Not ONE SCRATCH, NOT ONE DROPPED CALL, NOTHING BUT GREATNESS FROM THIS EXCELLENT 100% PERFECT PHONE!  tHE SANYO PCS-8200, ALSO HAS AND DOES EVERYTHING FROM VOICE DIALING/2 way text messaging/ quick keys etc.... and a speakerphone and walkie talkie (READY LINK/R-LINK) THIS PHONE IS THE BGEST ON THE MARKET TODAY, I EVEN BOUGHT MY WIFE ONE AND SHE IS SO PLEASED WITH IT, SHE TAKES PICTURES OF EVERYONE IN HER PHONE BOOK AND ADDS A PICTURE TO THEIR NAMES SO WHEN THE PHONE RINGS IT SHOWS THEIR PICTURE ON ONE OF THE 2 SCREENS AND THEIR IS A CLOCK BUILT IN TO THE CAMERA PHONE EASILY VISIBLE AND DATE TOO ON MAIN AND SUB LCD SCREENS. SO I DO NOT LIKE THE SPECS ON THE PAGE THAT TOOK ME HERE.  THAT COULD MAKE SOMEONE PICK UP THIS NOKIA I HAD AND RETURNED BEFORE THIS PHONE.  HORRIBLE!  PLUS I DO LIKE MY KYOCERA FLIP PHONE ALSO, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH UP TO THIS ALL INCLUDED PCS VISION PICTURE PHONE/SANYO SPC-8200 SILVER (SPRINT AND QWEST) BOTH ARE MERGING BY THE WAY.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS PHONE TODAY, YOU WILL HAVE A 15 DAY OR SO TRIAL PERIOD, SO I KNOW BY THEN YOU WILL HAVE PLAYED WITH EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE PHONE, TAKE PICTURES AND GREAT QUALITY TOO; BETTER THAN MY GATEWAY DIGITAL CAMERA.  THIS IS THEE ONLY PHONE TO BUY AND THE ONLY PHONE YOU WILL NEED FOR A LONG TIME.  RECOMMENDED HIGHLY THE  HIGHEST RANKING AND NOT EVEN A 2ND THOUGHT ON IT,  THE CALLS ARE SO CLEAR AND ALSO HAS A VOICE LEVELING FEATURE ON IT, CRYSTAL CLEAR CALLS AND NO DROPS.  I LOVE THIS PHONE!GOSH, I HOPE JUST ONE PERSON READS THIS AND GOES AND BUYS THIS PHONE, I KNOW HE OR SHE WILL BE AS X-STATIC AS I AM.  GOOD LUCK WITH A GREAT PHONE :O)ENJOY AS I HAVE AND WILL FOR MANY MANY MORE MONTHS EVEN YEARS AHEAD OF ME, TO COME.***A MUST OWN PHONE - HANDS DOWN TOTALLY AWESOME AND EVERY FEATURE THERE IS IN A PHONE LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE IS ON THIS MODEL; SOOOO.....  WHATCHA WAITING FOR GO GET THIS PHONE "NOW"!"*****" 5 OUT OF 5 sTARS THE HIGHEST RANKING!!  THIS PHONE IS THE BEST~
