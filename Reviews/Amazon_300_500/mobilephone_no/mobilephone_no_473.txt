If you are looking for a good solid basic phone with good extra features, then this is the phone for you.  Texting is good with the qwerty board and the tracking pad is easy to use.  The calls are nice and clear.  I love getting my e-mails on the phone which it does very quickly.  Now, it doesn't have a lot of memory so be prepared to buy a card for that which I did because I wanted to download music to my phone.  I love the music player on this phone.  I'm always listening to it when I can.  I also bought a aux cable to connect my phone to my car stereo to listen to all my songs. When you are listening to music and a call comes through, it temporarily pauses music until call is taken care of so you don't miss calls.  The music sounds great!  I also downloaded the app Pandora which I listen to at home a lot.  I love the calendar/date planner.  You can set it to give you reminders before appointments.  This phone is only 3g but it is faster than you would think it would be.  I have no problems bringing up info on the internet. It comes with Google, Yahoo, Bing, Wikipedia, Dictionary.com already ready to use for searches which I use all the time!  Now, this phone is not for the hardcore folk who live to play games, watch videos, and download apps all day.  The small screen size is good for those light users of internet which is me..:)  It has TeleNav GPS Navigator on it which I love.  I've used a few times already and it easy to use and has pointed me to the right direction each time.  For those business oriented people or students, it has spreadsheet, presentation, document software. I tried the word doc and I was pleased with it.  I've been impressed with this phone.  It's not all high end like the others but it does get the job done for basic needs. Also, it has a great battery life and you can turn the battery saving mode on to save battery life.  I definitely recommend buying it and giving it a try.. ;)
