LG Rumor2The LG Rumor2 looks like a rather advanced candy bar phone, with a slide out QWERTY keyboard, but in reality it is built very similar to the older LG flip phones from around 2005-2006. There's nothing advanced about it. Navigating the menu is a pain in the butt, and "surfing the web" is ridiculous especially in 2010. BlackBerry offers the advantage of having a trackball or trackpad, which by itself is rendered obsolete with advanced touch screen interfaces like the iPhone, Droid, etc... The Rumor2 is ancient by comparison. Most web pages do not load properly or look even remotely similar to a normal web page. There is no GPS feature with Google Maps, so you have no idea where you are, even though there is supposed to be a GPS receiver built-in.Email is also cumbersome, because Gmail somehow does not automatically sync. The address book is limited to 600 contacts and navigating that is also a chore itself. I purchased the Rumor2 and the Beyond Talk plan for my dad who didn't want a really advanced phone. I use a Motorola Droid2 which is infinitely more intuitive to use. I'd recommend looking at the Rumor Touch, but even that has issues with YouTube and it is nothing more than a slightly updated Rumor2.Charging the battery requires popping open a cap to reveal the micro USB port. Since it was designed for teenagers, I don't see how this was a good idea. That cap will be lost sooner or later. More "grown up" phones like the Droid, Droid2, DroidX don't have protective caps for the micro-USB port. One could argue the cap protects the port from teenage shenanigans, but I don't buy it.Pros: Simple design, works well since it hasn't really changed much since 2005-2006Cons: Not a smartphone, more like a cellphone that has data capability not unlike flip phones from 5-6 years ago, cumbersome interface, not my first choice of phone.Overall: 3/5 stars
