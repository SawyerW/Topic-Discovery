After loosing the phone (samsung 807) which came with my cingular contract, I was on hunt for a cheap, nice phone with not many internet features. Because the guy who stole my phone made huge bill using internet.After searching for a while I fixed on w200i. And after using it for a week, I am very much satisfied. The good points are1) Walkman player on the phone is very good. Sound quality is very good with the included earbuds. Also the included 128MB memory stick is sufficient for ~20 songs which is nice, but I want to upgrade it to 2GB stick.2) FM radio is good3) Voice dialing. I like the implementation of voice dialing on this phone better compared to samsung D807.On D807, there is no user control on how a contact is to be pronounced. Based on stored conact's name, the phone assumes a pronounciation. Since names are not standard english words, this always leads to wrong assumptions.Also being from India, my accent is different from American accent. And for me,it never worked on D807 satisfactorily.On w200i, you can record a sound and associate it with a contact. Whenever you pronounce the sound, the associated contact is called. This way I can use the correct sound for the name and also I can use nicknames. This is much better and for me more natural.4) Sound volume is good & clear. Unlike D807, I don't have to press the phone to my ears.5) Light weight and looks cool6) Limited internet features. This phone comes with no net browsing facility and limited data features. This way I don't end up with extra bill for using internet, after inadvertently pressing some button (many phones I saw have the important buttons associated with internet). This is good for those like me, who don't have/want data plans.Average w.r.t.1) Battery life2) camera qualityBad1) The hands free cable implementation is a mess. It can be designed better I feel. The clip should be above the heavy handsfree button. Also for me, the left earbud cable is a bit short
