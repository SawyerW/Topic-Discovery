While the features look great on paper, the usability of this phone is awful.The good:Easy to put together.Charger works great.Inserted my existing sim card and we're up and running, no problems.Makes phone calls when you dial.The bad:Usability usability usability.Menus are SLOW. Click an option and it seems like it didn't work.  But if you click again, oops you went too far...Waaaaaay too many useless apps pre installed and they can't be removed.  If you don't have a data plan, 80% of the features on this phone are inaccessible.  All the apps seem to be from AT&T.;The PPT button.  Way too easy to press, then you have to wait for it to tell you there's no data service (if no dataplan).The volume button is way too low, you have to hold your phone halfway too low to use it with your thumb.Would be great if they moved the PPT button and slid the volume up.You can't hold the phone in your right hand while charging.  The cable sticks out the side making it very difficult to hold.My phone seems to have a problem with turning off randomly for no apparent reason.  I don't know if its just mine or a common issue.  It appears to be truly random.  Lately it seems to not even want to turn back on, or it turns on and vibrates but immediately turns back off (It's fully charged).You have to hold the power on button far too long just to turn it on.The menus are just too annoying to use.  Menu, My Stuff, Tools, just to get to common basic applications like the alarm or calculator.So sloooooooow switching menus!Sim card holder is a bit wonky but not too difficult to get used to if you don't use it often.I've always liked nokia phones but this one is going back.
