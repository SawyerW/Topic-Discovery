There are many, and I mean MANY, negative reviews out about this phone. However, you have to know what you're buying. Does this droid run like the new iphone? No. However, is it a reasonably priced decent smart phone? Absolutely! Here are some of the reasons I love it:1. Easy to Use and customize  From the first moment I turned it on, I went through a sort of "tutorial" that allowed me to become familiar with the phone and calibrate it for my touch :). Also the very first day I started customizing it, with the easy of access Market widget programmed into the phone you can easily download apps to customize the look of your phone.2. Decent Battery Time  Does the battery last forever? No, but in this day and age what does? Realistically this battery is amazing, I use my phone as a mp3 player- which it has great sound quality and easy to use music functions like shuffle and repeat and create playlists and other good stuff- and I like to play solitare whilst listening to my music and I'll do this for hours before my battery even thinks about moving. After like 3 hours of that plus another 2 hours of messaging and talk time with background sync and apps running (which you don't have to have your setting work like this but I prefer it to just so I can stay current with all of my updates) the battery will be a little low. However if its just on and I'm no really doing anything then it will last like a little over a day without neeeding to be charged.ConsSometimes it can run a little slow especially when I have messages coming in at once and I'm listening to music at the same time.The phone gets hot- like burn your face if you're talking for more than an hour hot- as for why it does this I'm not sure... However, I find if I pull it away for about 30 seconds it cools down, maybe its just my face? Maybe it because I'm hot ;)... Other than that enjoy the phone especially because mine was brand spanking new for only 40 bux :D
