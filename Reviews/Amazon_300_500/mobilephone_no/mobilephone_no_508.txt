After growing tired of waiting for Google to get in another batch of their Nexus 4, I decided to look for other phones in a similar price range. Found the Vivo 4.3 and thought I'd give it a try. Here are the pros and cons of the phone is the default format. I know you can download themes, widgets, etc to change some of this stuff, but keep in mind I haven't done anything yet.Pros:- The screen is awesome. The color is great, the blacks are super dark, there are zero issues with viewing angles.- The phone is sturdy feeling despite feeling very light in the hand. I don't notice it in my pocket.- The speaker on the back is plenty loud. If you sit it flat on the back, it'll muffle the sound, but just lean it against something or hold it in your hand and you are good to go.- The phone boots up super fast and runs very smoothly. I haven't ran anything to intensive on the phone yet, but so far so good. AnTuTu benchmark scores it at 6467, if that matters to anyone. The performance for the money is more than fair with this phone.- Works with Straight TalkCons:- Screen resolution is tiny @ 480x728. Would like to see a few more pixels.- Speaking of screen space, the buttons are on the screen. This cuts off a little of the usable space on the screen. I would like to see dedicated keys below the screen because of the low resolution.- The power button is on the right side across from the volume keys. More often then not I'll hit them both when trying to shut the screen off. Pretty much every other phone I've used had the power button on the top right.- The home screen is on the far left of the 5 available screens. I would rather have the screen in the middle to cut back on scrolling since you can't scroll around to the left either.As mentioned earlier, the cons are very minimal for me. I can't really say how long the battery lasts because I keep a charger handy at both work and home. I've been very happy with the phone and would recommend it to anyone.
