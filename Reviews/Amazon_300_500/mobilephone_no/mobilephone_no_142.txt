I did a lot of research when selecting a new phone.  I really wanted to go from a seperate cell phone and PDA to a single device, but I didn't really want one of those clunky (to me anyway) Treo-type devices.So when it was time to renew our phone contract, I ended up getting two of these units, one for myself and one for my wife.  At first, I was quite pleased with the purchase.  It has many, many features and really did everything that I was looking for.Unfortunately, my wife and I both found the phones to be very unreliable.  They would frequently lock up, and often times when you would try to do something you'd get an "Out of Memory" error.  The only way I could alleviate this was by powering off the phone.  Sometimes it would lock up to the point that the only way to recover was to actually remove the battery.On at least a couple of occassions, I tried to call my wife, or she tried to call me, and the call went to the phone, but the phone did not ring/vibrate/or anything.  It got to the point where we got in the habit of "rebooting" our phones at the beginning of each day to try to minimize problems.My wife got fed up with hers, so I bought her an unlocked Razr.  She's much happier with it.  I planned on keeping mine, but one day it started throwing up the "out of memory" error and I could no longer use the phone.  Powering down, removing the battery, nothing mattered ... every time I'd power it on, within a few minutes, the phone would stop working and every attempted action would result in an "out of memory" error.I could chalk it up to a bum unit but we had similar problems with both phones.  If they ever get all the bugs worked it, it would probably be a nice phone.  Meanwhile, I went ahead and bought myself an unlocked Razr, too, and while it doesn't have as many features, it's much less frustrating for day-to-day use.
