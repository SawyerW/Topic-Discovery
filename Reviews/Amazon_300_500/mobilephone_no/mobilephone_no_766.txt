Let's begin with my major complaint: miniscule phone memory. You would think that with apps having such small sizes in the way of memory the internal phone memory would be enough. It's not. Not sure what the issue is, but every app installed leaves a "footprint'' on the internal memory even if moved to SD card. So the memory gets used up pretty quickly. Having said that,the phone is enough if you are good about app management. You will have to pick and choose what is really important for you to have on the phone,  and leave enough room on the phone to allow the apps to update (even if installed on the SD card). Having said that:This is a good "starter'' android phone, which I am positive you will want to upgrade as your mobility needs increase. I have had my LG Ally for 2 years now. Even with the tiny memory the phone was good enough.  The tiny memory caused headaches, but I dealt with it.Unfortunately, as of late, the phone has started to act up... I had never had any issue that you read about for the LG Ally. Now the phone shuts down, even after just being unplugged and having a full battery, while using an app  (for me it has been the Navigation app , maps , web browser, and other apps that require the phone to "think"). When I try to start it back up it doesn't recognize that the battery is fully charged and shuts down again. If I leave the phone shutdown for a while it will restart and show that the battery is charged.  So unfortunately the phone has become unreliable and I am replacing it. It has been a decent smart phone for 2 years. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but good enough.
