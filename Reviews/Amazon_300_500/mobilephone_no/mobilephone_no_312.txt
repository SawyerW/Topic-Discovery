previous owner of N73, N95 8Gb, N97mini, N900.Have the N8 now 3 months bought it on amazon, all I can say is this is the best Nokia made so far.First the good stuff:Housing is solid aluminum, no plastics !upgraded memory with 32 Gigs, works great.the multi tasking is smooth, the camera is absolutely amazing, pictures and video are breathtaking quality, no other cell can come even close to this quality, even digital cams have competition from this phone.The on board video editor is also a great feature, and allows you to patch audio tracks to ur clips. (movie maker in Windows7 for 1 reason puts all video imaging from N8 up side down in in mirror view. the HDMI port is very handy!, THANX Nokia !)Since January 2011 skype is available for the N8, to bad it doesn't allow video conferencing.Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with intense use, but use your car charger when navigating with maps.music player: good stuff !Maps works flawless with voice turn to turn, and good old times are back where home addresses stored in contacts can be deployed directly into maps !The not so good stuff:camera lenz is unprotected, so be very carefull !the internet hyperlinks you will create on 1 of ur desktops have no unique icons, so very hard to recognize and remember.OVI store still sucks, 70% of apps are useless, get real Nokia do something about this, clean up the rubbish...OVI suite for PC still sucks, useless piece of software ! works slower then any turtle on this planet, get rid of those IT guys behind it, it's an embarrassment compared to the phone quality.Additional comments now april 2011:Have been using this phone now in most parts of the world, the navigation keeps blowing my mind, the accuracy in asia, europe, carribean and US is breathtaking, and saved me from getting lost every day during my travels.Battery life stays superb after 6 months now of intens useOVI store and software just got improved , THANX Nokia team !OVI apps are still 90% worthless, but the good 10% improved dramatically.HD vdo stuns every one I show my video's to, it's amazing even on a 72" screen it still awes you.now i'm comfortable with the desktops, i can blindfolded operate the N8...email sometimes becomes sluggish after weeks, just reboot it once a month and ur fine, or dump emails older then 1 week.so far no software jams, nor hick ups.Conclusion after 6 months : it is indeed the best phone ever marketed by Nokia !wish-list to improve N8: none, N8's got it all, a brilliant device for only 400 $!!!!!
