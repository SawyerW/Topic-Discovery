I dont know and care about much complicated technical details, I will give you simple practical aspects about this phone, decision is yours, I have used Nokia phones since cell phones exists, I start with the black and white version, hee hee, my last one was Nokia N95. I used the N95 heavily for last 3 years, every second of my life it was in my hand, car, backpack, pocket, grocery cart, diaper bag, college bag, you name it, and wherever I go it went,  did not let me down once.Finally, I have upgraded to N8, its a jiff to order, arrived swiftly, simple packing, open up, put your Sim card, memory card from your old phone, push power button, READY to go.. Since I am used to Nokia Menu all around, was easy to upgrade.Connect and pair through Bluetooth and transferred my contacts, photos, memo, calendar entries, appointments, sms mesages, etc. all from my old Nokia in a minute every content and info from my old phone was loaded in my new Nokia N8.Internet works fine, T mobile works no problem, check my mail, update my profile,check your Skype, download Adobe files, finish and type my class work at Cal State page, save documents, reply other students forms, download maps, follow voice command like a GPS, free OVi maps, easy as breeze..Touch tone pure glass, very sensitive to touch with slight touche, fingertips works perfect, does not take order from any other hard object by accident hits etc. Stylus fans can use that though.Listen your messages,talk to type your sms, surf the Google while listening music, watch National Geographic, you name it,,, just easy as touch of button..I am not into much technical details, if you are a busy mom like me, with classes to catch and emails to reply constantly this is your phone. Sleek, very sleek, nice and thin, beautiful strong metal body, yet rugged when you cover it up with the silicone cover.Camera is awesome, Carl Zeiss 12 mgpx, cant go wrong with 12 megapixel,HDMI quality videos, its like carrying the best camcorder and camera with you, anywhere just click of a button awesome zoom, colors, tumbs up...This is all I can think of , DONT THINK TWICE, SMALL INVESTMENT, FREEDOM OF UNLOCKED PHONE, YOU ARE THE BOSS OF YOUR PHONE, its a wonder for international travelers too. Many things I didnt get to yet , will explore.If you want a practical, EASY TO USE, NOT-COMPLICATED and powerful touch phone with Quality and Reliability, THE BEST SMARTPHONE OUT THERE, THIS IS IT..YOU CANT GO WRONG with Nokia, I have witnessed that one more time.
