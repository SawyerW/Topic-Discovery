I owned a Nokia 6680 smartphone for several years and was never tempted to upgrade because this phone did everything I needed... Touchscreen phones are too delicate for my job (construction engineer) and I type much faster using a standard keypad anyway. I looked at an N95 but in my opinion it was too thick and I don't trust the slide mechanism (or flip mechanism for that matter). My friend bought an e71 and I borrowed it for a few minutes to make a call. I was so impressed by the slim sleek design that I purchased one the following day! I can find no fault with this phone! At first I thought the keypad was too small to type (being a fairly large guy 5' 8") but let me tell you that Nokia designed the keypad flawlessly! Within a few minutes I was happily texting away at blazing speed! It also comes unlocked so I can use it with my both carier SIM cards without any problems.I own several handheld gps units (Garmin etrex and Lowrance iFinder) and these cannot get a fix indoors. Within a few mins my e71 got a fix from an impressive 5 satellites. The screen resolution is amazing (tv quality). The entire phone is well built, sturdy and strong. Just looking at the back cover you can see that this phone is built to last. It has all the usual "requirements" for a smart phone: symbian os, email, web, camera, video, realplayer, mp3 player, quickoffice, etc. etc. Even though the camera is 3MP this is sufficient in my opinion.I am still discovering new features for example the e71 has text to voice capability - the phone can read out aloud text messages (very convenient when driving)! I am yet to find a flaw.To Nokia - excellent job 5 out of 5!
