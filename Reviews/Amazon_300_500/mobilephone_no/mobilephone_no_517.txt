I've had AT&T; GoPhone prepaid service for two year and it's been awesome. I had a basic Pantech phone that worked well but really wanted to try a smartphone. I've had the phone for 10 months and it's exceeded my expectations. This an Android 2.3 Gingerbread with responsive touchscreen and easy to set up. The 3.2 mp camera takes good pictures and decent video, as there are many options to customize your settings when taking a picture. You can add a 32 GB sd card for memory. I haven't used the MP3 player so I can't comment on that.I mainly text and use it for phone calls. The screen is 3.5 inches and keyboard is large enough for easy texting. I have small fingers but it may work for someone with big fingers as well. The Fusion 2 comes pre-loaded with many apps which can't be uninstalled. I don't care for that feature because it takes up space. Battery life is about 4-5 days without heavy use. I've gotten about 2 full days on a charge with heavy texting and using Wi-Fi. After 10 months it still holds a charge well and don't plan on replacing it anytime soon until it dies. The 800 Mhz dual processor is fast enough for downloading web pages and talking at the same time.The phone was intuitive to set up and I didn't use the manual. This was huge plus since I'm not technically savvy. My calls are clear and the Wi-Fi signal is strong when using the internet. Reception with the AT&T; GoPhone prepaid is better than my previous Verizon contract phone. I can get coverage in buildings and in areas where I previously traveled with Verizon that were nonexistent and spotty. GoPhone has many plan options for different budgets and it's simple to change plans as required.There are many Android apps available for this smartphone that make it very versatile to suit your needs. I've not used all the features on my phone but that's because I like to keep things simple.
