I had my N8 for about a week before T-Mobile had its "All Phones Are Free" Valentine's Day promotion.  I'd definitely grown to appreciate the N8 in this time, having upgraded from a strictly call-and-text phone, but I couldn't shake my curiosity for the open-source Android OS.  So on T-Mobile's sale day, I went and grabbed a Samsung Galaxy S II for "free" (still $400 over a 2 year contract) -- probably the most powerful phone you can currently buy, and with the flashy Android platform, it should have been instant love... but it only took one evening to realize the N8 already had everything I wanted, and actually does some stuff better.I'm not crazy about Google to begin with (privacy policy stuff) so I was disappointed to discover that with Android you're basically forced to use your Google account to access many of the applications, including the app market.  Besides that, it just felt like too much phone.  And contrary to popular belief, I didn't find the Android OS to be any easier to use than Nokia's Symbian OS, and in fact for the most part they look pretty similar.  Plus, Nokia is known to make beautiful hardware, and the N8 is a great example -- eye catching design, functional buttons, and the weighty feeling of a quality product.  I'm only slightly disappointed with the Ovi store, which doesn't boast as many apps as the other guys.  But as someone else said, it has the ones you need and not the ones you don't (but let me know if you find one for a dvorak keyboard...).Everything else I've played with so far has worked wonderfully, including maps (with GPS and a compass), music player, web browsing (use Opera Mobile), and the camera is better than any I've had before, digital or otherwise.  Bottom line is, Nokia is still the best in the business, and Symbian OS is plenty adequate for doing stuff on a phone.  Don't buy into the hype of Android phones (or the iPhone, for that matter) because you'll probably end up returning it after one day like I did.
