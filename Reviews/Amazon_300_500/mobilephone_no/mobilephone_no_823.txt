The LG VS750 does work with my AT&T; SIM card, with setting at either of 2 GSM modes.  I have no problem getting phone service, but I am having trouble with 1) retrieving my voice mail and 2) sending text messages, even though it detected and dialed the correct numbers, *86 and +1 (312)314-9800, respectively.  AT&T; customer service confirms the numbers, but can't help further since this is not their locked AT&T; phone. Can anyone out there help?Bought it because I plan to use it with a local SIM card in my upcoming travel to Thailand and Indonesia.  It's great for my simple needs since I am a light user on AT&T; Go Phone plan.  The good: Wifi works, therefore access to my hotmail and ocassional web browse of CNN.  The photo player and music player work, and can also sync/transfer these files from your PC to the phone's internal memory or micro SD. The camera is quite good, but I am a more serious photographer to stoop this low.  For similar reason, I don't care for the phone's GPS and subscription fee to find out if it works. And not interested in any data plan either to explore 3G and other services. Not using this to replace my laptop for heavy duty web browsing and e-mailing on Wifi.Yes, it meets and exceeds my needs less the 2 minor problems. Overall this is a bargain: price, style and nice LCD screen, etc.Update:  I've since learned through an AT&T; forum that AT&T; switches off the simple voice mail feature from your current plan and changes to visual voice mail because it's a smartphone. It's an extra cost feature of course. Other AT&T; users are experiencing the same problem too when switching to different smartphones.  The work-around to retrieving your voice mail is to dial your cell number using a land line phone, and when you hear your own greeting, press * (star) and the pin/password.  The text messaging is still hit and miss.
