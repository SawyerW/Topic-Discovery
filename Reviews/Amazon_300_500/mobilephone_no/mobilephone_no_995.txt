I've been using a Sony Ericsson W880i for a month now. I upgraded to a 4GB memory stick (works fine), I use a Sony Ericsson H970 bluetooth stereo headset and am on ATT network. Here is a quick summary of my experience with this product:Pros:1. Walkman - create playlists on the phone, good sound quality (better than my ipod for sure), good user interface, superb stereo bluetooth.2.Bluetooth - implementation is so good it blows away any other product I have owned. It is super fast to connect and works flawlessly with the integrated blutooth in my car and with my Sony stereo bluetooth (H970).3.Others - I get access to my office email, gmail with no problems. It automatically synchs wirelessly every 5 minutes, text and MMS also work great.4. Design and Build quality - fantastic! I got an W890i also and the W880i just looks and feel better. Trust me. The W890i was much cheaper looking and feeling. This is a fantactically designed and built product.5. Camera is decent for on the fly use. I would not use this as my primary digital camera, but it is totally OK for taking a quick picture or video and sending it via email or MMS.6. Very very stable OS, never crashes or locks upCons:1. Not suitable for writing long emails! However, I need my phone to mostly read, I write short one liners if needed.2. The keys are small, but I am completely used to it after a month.3. 3-G works only when I am in Europe, in US I can't use ATT 3-G.4. No wi-fi and np 3-G in US means browsing the web is pretty slow. I try and use the mobile versions of web sites. I also use the Opera Mini Browser which is a free download IF I need to browse the web.Overall, I think this is a really excellent product. Based on my experience with this phone I am more likely to buy a Sony Walkman phone again. Just remember that this phone is for people who want a phone with an MP3 player and lightweight email access and web browsing. If you're a heavy email or web user then this phone is not for you.
