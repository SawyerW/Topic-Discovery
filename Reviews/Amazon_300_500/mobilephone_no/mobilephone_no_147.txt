This phone is really awesome to look at, but just ok after that.  There are still a lot of glitches in it.  Some of the problems that I've had with it is it being very temperature tempermental and if it is left in a car to charge during the day while I run into a store or if I'm at home, it will not work for about 3 days.  Granted I live in AZ and it can get pretty hot in a locked vehicle.  I found that out the hard way.  There are times that the phone won't ring at all...and a call will go straight to voicemail (I could possibly blame that on Cingulair).  Also, there have been many times where I have plugged it in to charge, and the phone won't register that it's plugged in.  After 10 (overnight) hours of being plugged in to charge the phone will still register as dead battery.  There have also been times when the phone is not plugged in at all...but it will say 'charging battery' on the screen.  Those are not user errors!!!  I do really like the large color screen on the inside.  It does get dirty really easily though.  I am constantly cleaning both the screen and the numbers cause my makeup will rub onto it and it really holds onto fingerprints.  I live the camera feature.  Not the best quality of pictures, but still fun to have as an option.Also...I've dropped this phone several different times.  I really didn't expect it to work anymore after the first fall, especially after reading all the warnings about how fragile it is....but after taking the battery out and putting it back in, it worked just fine.  It's actually a little tougher than it looks.  It looks hot in pink, but I wouldn't buy it again!!
