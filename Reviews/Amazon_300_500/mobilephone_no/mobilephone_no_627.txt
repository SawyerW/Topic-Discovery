Matthew and Vik:At least at present in my state, when you order the phone as a GoPhone at the AT&T; site, they will tack on tax based on what they say is the full retail value of the phone, so that added $14 or so to make it a $23 phone. Yes, that's still better than buying it unlocked elsewhere, but should be kept in mind when comparing to other phones you are considering.  Go through the purchase process to screen where you enter credit card details and look at the price at the very bottom of the page to see what tax they will charge. Some people may not even notice that it gets added in there.Secondly, if you go with the refurbished version to save a few bucks, realize that you get a much shorter warranty period (90 days) on a phone that may have had technical issues once already rather than the full year warranty that applies to a new one.We bought the precursor to this model, the 2320, for our middle school student. However, I wanted one with Bluetooth to use as a back up for my own phone or to give to our other kid as needed, and it serves the purpose well. The 2320 was just $15 at retailers near us (with tax on the $15 only) and came with $15 worth of minutes to make it virtually free.  I made the mistake of putting my SIM card in it first before activating to see if it would work for me, and so the $15 credit was added to my normal plan account as extra minutes.  Unfortunately, I don't need them since I never use up my rollover supply, but so be it.We get pretty good reception on both these phones and when my kid calls, he sounds fine (San Fran Bay area).
