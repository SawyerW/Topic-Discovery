Make no mistake, this is a SMALL cell phone with a small touch screen.  However, for its size and the price of $99, it is very nice.I bought this unlocked GSM phone to use with a Jamaican SIM card.  I inserted the SIM card, powered it up and the phone started the MOTOBLUR registration procedure.  It is NOT necessary to register with MOTOBLUR to use this phone to browse the web or send email on a wireless network.  When the MOTOBLUR registration process starts, select "Skip for now".  Go into the Settings menu and turn on Wi-Fi, browse for your network and enter any security settings.  I know it works, I have done it.  I have also checked with my SIM card provider and I have NOT used any data.  Another way to confirm that no data has been used is to go into Settings, then Data Manager and you can see the amount of data that has been sent over the cellular network.  Because I was using my wireless network mine still says "0".Using my wireless network, I was able to set up my Google account and register the phone, download my contacts and download applications.Yes, the touch screen is small and crowded, but it has enough space to be useful.  Remember that the "home" screen can scrolled to the left and to the right to view icons for additional applications.The "flip out" keyboard is OK, but I find the virtual keyboard on the touch screen to be about as easy to use as the virtual keyboard on my iPhone 4S when the phone is in the vertical orientation.  (Yes, I did compare it to an iPhone.)  They are both cramped, but with some practice they are useable.The phone I received is running Android version 2.1.  Not the latest, but still useable.  I only paid $99 for it and for unlocked GSM cell phone running Android 2.1 of any physical size it is a bargain.  Just understand that you are buying a small phone.  I have only had the phone for two hours and we are already very good friends.
