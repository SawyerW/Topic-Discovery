I've had this phone for about a year now. I chose it b/c it was T-Mobile's smallest model and the sales person said that it has great reception. I do admit that the reception for this phone is very good. I've been in basements, elevators, and the middle of nowhere and still managed to find a bar or two. Now that doesn't mean you can find service everywhere. But I was impressed w/ how well it found reception. Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say about it. On the downside talk-time doesn't last as long as stated in the description. I have all the power-saving features activated according to the manual to extend batter life and yet I'm still squeezing barely 3 hours out of it. Maybe I just have a bum battery but w/ lith. ion being the lastest and greatest it is not performing very well. Texting can also be a pain w/ the predictive T9 function. At least to me it's more frustating trying to text when it keeps guessing what you want to type and isn't even close to the correct word. I don't select the function, but it's still a pain to work around. The screen is very bright and colorful but like most it is virtually impossible to see outside even at an angle and shaded. I've had two glitches so far, the first is that there are times when dialing it just cycles through w/ no ring tone, almost like it's searching for a signal, even when there is one. The only way I've found to fix it is to shut the phone off and turn it back on. The second is a recent one, as of a few days ago, I have not been able to send a text msg. I can receive them fine, but to reply or send one I contiunally get the "error" msg. Haven't found a way to solve it. B/c of this, I'm headed back to T-Mobile to look for a new phone. Although it lasted a year, that's still not long enough to be considered a quality phone.
