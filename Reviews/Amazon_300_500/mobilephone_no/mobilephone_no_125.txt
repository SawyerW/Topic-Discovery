I've been using Tracfone for six years now, and I am pleased with it in every way.  The voice quality has always been good, but with the new LG 500 I now use it is really outstanding.  I have normal senescent hearing loss, and I have problems with even our landline at home, but with my Tracfone the problem is almost always the phone of the other party.I live in Montana, and we don't have the internet feature available, but I doubt if I'd use it that much anyway.  The coverage area here, by the way, is as good or better than the regular carriers.  The one unusual Tracfone feature that I make regular use of is the international calling access number, which makes it the cost to make calls to our friends in Germany and Mexico as it does to call a neighbor. The problem in Mexico is that our friends are all rural folk with almost no landlines, and so the Tracfone international access doesn't work.  But you can get an access number in Mexico that people there can use to call you at local rates (which are unfortunately expensive, thanks to a near monopoly of Telcel, which is also owned by Tracfone's parent company America Movil). It works well and calls in my experience go right through.This year I've used about 1000 minutes of airtime, which I've now gotten--thanks to these discounted cards--for $75, about what most folks I know pay per month for cell service. I notice that in areas (not mine unfortunately) Tracfone now offers triple minute phones whereas mine is a mere double minute phone.I have used their customer service to resolve a few problems or get help and generally their people are pretty good.  They are all over the place: Canada, Belize, the Caribbean and sometimes you have to work through the varous Englishes.  I've also tried their Spanish-language CS just to see how it works.  I think they're all Mexicans (unsurprisingly) so the accents are not a problem (if you're used to Mexican Spanish, of course) but they generally are o.k. too.
