I love this phone.  Besides all the other good things people say about it what I've noticed is it has the best graphics of any of the Tracfones I've had so far (my last was a W376G) with a 170X220 pixel screen.  Durable, small, fast charging, and really really good battery life.  Great reception but it does use the GSM (ATT) towers not the CDMA (Verizon) towers.  If your friends with ATT phones can't get a good signal (like in small towns or way off the interstates) your reception probably won't be good either.  If you need CDMA/Verizon coverage for your area the LG 220C is a really nice phone good for texting and limited web browsing but it doesn't have a camera.  You can transfer wallpapers, small file size animated GIF files, and ringtones from your computer to the LG 420G using bluetooth but I haven't found any way to do it via hard wire data connection.  Texting on this phone is easy and cheap, only .3 units to send an SMS text and 1.5 units to send/receive an MMS (picture or sound file).  Receiving texts on the phone are free (unless they fixed the software glitch) but you'll have to follow the directions below:Tip for receiving free text messages - When you receive a text message on your Tracfone LG 420G do not open the phone, instead hit the down volume button.  The message will be visible on the external screen.  Continue pushing the down button until it has opened all the pending messages and the time/date reappears on the external screen.  Now you have opened all the pending messages, pulled them onto your phone, and it doesn't deduct the .3 units per message.  After the time/date reappears on the external screen you can open the phone, go to messages and open them from there.  Since they've already been pulled onto the phone and opened you won't get charged to reopen them.  My phone was purchased around July 2010 so if yours doesn't work like this, giving you free messages, it means they must have found the software glitch and fixed it.
