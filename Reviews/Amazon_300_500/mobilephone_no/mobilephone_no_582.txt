I returned this phone because I decided that Net10 was not what I wanted. Literally less than a minute of activating my phone with a new number, I received a spam call. Shortly after that I started receiving spam texts! I decided to not go with Net10 so I returned the phone. But it seemed like a pretty good phone for $30.I didn't use the phone for long, but it appeared to be good quality. The buttons are large and easy to access. It's very basic but would fit the needs of someone who just needs texts and voice calls. The camera is very basic as well.Overall, I decided not to go with net10 for a few reasons beyond the spam calls/texts with the number.1) Picture messages cost 2.5 minutes each, and I normally send a fair amount of picture messages of my daughter to keep in touch with grandparents so they can be a part of our daily lives even though they are in another state. My minutes would probably not last long.. I was going to try the 300 minutes for $30 dollars. Those 300 would go fast given how much I use the phone, and it would not end up being affordable for me.2) There's no way to see who sends a text to you, without opening the text message. It costs to open the message, so you could be paying for a spam text.I decided it wasn't for me and had myself added to a pre-existing family plan with my family so we could keep in touch better.Net10 isn't horrible I am sure, but it's not for me. It would be better for those who rarely use their phone, or just need a cheaper non-contract phone to use. Or someone who doesn't need picture messaging on a regular basis. I decided that I would be using my phone more heavily than I had originally anticipated, so a family plan was the best idea.If you need a basic phone and are okay with the plans that net10 offers, this motorola will probably work perfectly for you.
