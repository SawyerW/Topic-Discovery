I just got this phone as my new upgrade with Verizon. Phone is great I have all the snes/genesis/ps1 emulators working on it and it has been great and so much more fun than my last phone; droid x.  It's a world of difference to play these games on game pad vs touchscreen.  The weight is good, I compare it to how the sidekick 2 was.  I actually found the battery life to be actually pretty good. I been gaming on it all day and it last me to the end of the night. Granted I've been playing snes/nes games and not as high quality that came with the phone.The games that come with it are great quality, almost ps2 comparable. I really like the Bruce Lee game and The Aircraft game thats came with it. The camera is a 5.0 mp and its nice. It has a good amount of adjustments with the stock app. The phone  is working on android 2.3 and it runs great. Thought its 3g it runs really nice and it hasn't crashed on me once since I've got it which happend quite a bit with my droid x. No issues with web browsing. I'm actually fine that its not 4g since 4g has been buggy.The speaker on the phone is the best I've heard on a phone, i believe there are 4 speakers which make it sound great for gaming or playing music when you don't have headphones. Everything has been great so far until I plugged in my Beats By Dre Studio headphones.The sound out of the headphones was the worst I've ever heard!!  I thought it was a huge issue until I found in the box a cord you use if you are using non sony ericsson headphones. Attached it and wow that was it.  I do find it odd you have to bring that extra cord with you but a lot better than bringing an amp which what I was thinking of doing.Overall if you like to game, nes/genesis/neogeo/ps1/snes/ and close to ps2 graphic games then this is going to be wasting a lot of your time! Everything is great, camera is solid, smoother interface than my droid x, and a lot more fun with all my favorite past time games all in my hands.
