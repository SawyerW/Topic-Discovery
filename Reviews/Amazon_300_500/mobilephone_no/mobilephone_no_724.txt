These are $10 +$2 S&H; at Walmart's online store, $3 more in-store.The only way I found to import my contacts was by copying them onto my SIM card from an old phone.  No  software available from Samsung, no iSync support - even from third parties, nothing from Google or Yahoo.  (Please add a comment if you come across anything@)TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T;, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access.  They'll warn you that this will also disable MMS (Picture/sound/video messaging) but since you can't send such messages anyway, this is probably not a big deal.  **Now I don't have to worry about being charged every time I press the wrong button and it starts.**  I use my Verizon MiFi with my MacBook Pro, iPod or iPad for mobile 'net access.Service:I recommend the $2/day plan.  You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.)  It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out.  If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device.  Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone.Cell Phone:The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy.  It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system,  No time-sucking learning curve.Final Word:I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months.  Plus, you can buy $25 cards at a discount if you shop around. The phone serves my needs and I am very satisfied with it.  But, smartphones are getting cheaper and cheaper...
