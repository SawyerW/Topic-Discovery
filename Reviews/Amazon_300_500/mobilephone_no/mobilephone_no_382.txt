I bought this phone Used-like new from amazon warehouse deals. 1st one arrived defective and was Used, and not used-like new. I returned it and got my $ back. I gave it another try and bought another Used-like new and this time it really looked as barely used phone with all the original stickers.I have Samsung tab2 7.0 tabled and doing all my android apps and angry birds stuff on it, so I was not looking for the latest android phone. I was looking for qwerty and touch screen phone and having Nokia E71 and E73, this was a logical choice. I never had full touch screen phone and I do not like touch screens for typing. I do a lot of typos in my 7in tab already... so qwerty is a must!.There are detailed review of this phone here so I am not going to repeat all the phone feature reviews. Phone calls are ok, GPS is good here in NW, mp3 player is fine, battery life is 2-3 days (could be more), display is crisp and nice... But...I am reducing 1 star from the 5 due to calendar issue I am observing. I update the phone sw straight to Belle and I am testing it now. I am sync-ing my  calendar from work outlook with this E6 and they all sync fine and remind me, but if I want to see and open the details of an meeting, E6 will close the application, it did not freeze or crash, it just close the calendar application and you can still use the phone. the error does not say that I have not enough memory etc... the error message just say "Error: application closed". Callendar app is very important in the biz phones. I have no other issue with this phone, so I am going to re-install the Belle and see if the issue remains...I can certainly recommend this if you do not need all the fancy unnecessary apps.
