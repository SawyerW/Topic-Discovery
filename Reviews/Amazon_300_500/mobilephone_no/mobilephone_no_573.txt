I bought this phone as an upgrade to my Motorola Razr flip.  Well, I got the phone part to work fine with moving my sim card.  I got the wi-fi to work on my home, secured network.  But that was about it.  Where to begin - OK, I'm in the States.  Everything is celsius and metric.  I can't find a way to change to English/US.  Also, the temperature, (in celsius) on the main screen, has never changed.  It does not show current temperature.  Then, downloading apps. After a couple of downloads, like Netflix and IHeart, it said I was out of space.  It came with a 2 gig mini sd card.  I thought that all the bloatware was talking up the space so I got a 32 gig sd card.  Still the same problem.  It won't let me add apps that I want.  Then there is logging on to other wi-fi's.  I tried to log on to a restaurant, unsecured, wi-fi.  It did not connect automatically.  I had to go to settings and approve and indicate "connect" to that wi-fi.  After that, I still could not access e-mail, etc, even though it said I was connected.  I have a Samsung android tablet that I've mastered.  I bought this phone because it also has android operating system.  Thought it would be a piece of cake to set up and use.  So far, not so.  The book that came with the phone covers basics but is not a lot of help.  Also, this phone is clearly intended for European use.  The listed phone numbers to call for assistance are in the UK and other European countries.. I may be returning this phone since I can't get it to do what I expected.A week later: Well, I tried it for a week.  I talked to the seller today and we agreed that it should be returned.  "Bobby" at the seller was as helpful as he could be, but we couldn't resolve the problems.  He sent me a return form and it's now on its was back.  Main problem, I'm sure, was that it was intended for use in Europe.  Also, couldn't download new apps.
