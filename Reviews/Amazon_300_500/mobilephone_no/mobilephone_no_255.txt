I must admit that Nokia N8 is an "amazing piece of technology" but it's only great if you can get a working one. Unfortunately, it seems like Nokia was on a rush producing the phone and they had serious trouble with quality control . I ordered 3 Nokia N8s from Amazon and all are defectiveThe first one I ordered (made in China) last November consistantly froze and had issue with 3.5mm audio jack. It was sent back to AmazonThe second N8 (made in China, week 49/2010) arrived 2 weeks ago with lots of expectation. It did not charge at first and froze several times after booting up. The camera button did not lead me to camera mode no matter how hard I pushed it. But the worst part is the screen. It produced purple/red color instead of dark grey. You can simply check the analog clock by switching the lock key, then push home or power button. Mine had bottom fine but upper half of the clock all purple. Other black-white image tests or even Tron trailer can point out the discoloration of the screen. The phone came back to AmazonThe replacement N8 (also made in China, week 48/2010) came several days ago and also had bad screen. It's even worse that the home key is deffective as well. It did not lead me to the main menu. PR 1.1 did not solve any of these faults. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy that allows me to have refund for the deffective phones.Being a Nokia fanboy, I waited too long and was so eager for the phone to appear. But after 3 times, N8 disappointed me much. I would still buy a Nokia N8, but definitely not until Nokia can warrant that N8s are free of defects.So I suggest you check your N8 if you own one (google "N8 purple tint display issue") and good luck if you plan to purchase a N8 this time of the year.
