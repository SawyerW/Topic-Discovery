i want to give this phone 5 star, but i just can't. i've had this for about 6 months on metro detroit at&t; 3g network. it's got a lot of cool features that i use a lot: GPS and Wi-Fi. Which is great for searching the net on the go and knowing where you're at. I like having the MicroSD slot. Features I haven't used as much lately were the music player and internet radio. It's compact, does what I need it to do, convenient, and on and on... but there are some flaws I've come across unfortunately:- music player is choppy when playing an hour long dj mix. the song plays fine on the computer, mp3 cd, ipod, but not this phone. i downloaded a different music player, so we'll see if that works- internet radio seems to just shut off the phone. i haven't used this in a while, so maybe updates to the program have fixed itSignal Strength Problems- this phone drops 3G calls constantly. i've tried other phones on the 3G network in my house, near my house, and in the general metro detroit area without any problems.- i sent this phone in for warranty because the vibrate mechanism stopped working and the reception problems were getting bad. I got the phone back in like 4 days which was awesome, but second call i made, dropped call. All while showing FULL 3G signal strength. I did some research online and seems like a lot of people are having 3G signal problems with this model phone. I think it's because of the metal frame and the compact size.  This is a hassle because if I want a garaunteed non-dropped call, i need to change it to GSM only. and to use internet , i need to change it to 3G, then go back and change it to GSM.OverallIt's unfortunate that some $50 phones have better reception than this, but I still like this phone a lot. It has a lot of great features, sleek design, lots of potential, and a great company backing it. I would buy another Nokia, but I don't know about this model.  I hope other people that buy this have better call connections than i do!
