I bought this phone at best buy after having bad experiences with tracphone since my first phone i bought with them stopped working.The first tracphone was 100 bucks it was a lg touchscreen that was dropping calls the internet on it was bad just a terrible phone.Then i bought a second tracphone at target and could not even get it activated so it was returned.When calling tracphone they leave you on hold forever.So then i decided to go with virgin mobile their service was fine i did experience the phone cutting out at least once though but not as bad as tracphone.But recently i took my battery out of the phone and had trouble getting it to come back on.So i called virgin mobile and had them send me a replacement phone and they did but then i got my old phone working.Well i returned the new one they started texting me saying i need to send my old one back.So i let them know by txt why i didn't return my old one.Then this month last friday i got another txt saying they still hadn't got my phone so i called their customer service.They said i had to pay for the phone they sent me since they never got it or my service would be suspended till i pay for the phone.And thursday they cut my phone off i sent the new back thru fedx so how could it have got lost.I am not responsible for packages or mail pretty way to do your customers.Now after having this phone for a while the battery doesn't seem to stay charged as long.I refuse to pay for the phone i sent back since i don't have any proof that it got lost and if it did its not my fault so i'm done with virgin mobile.Now i'm going with boostmobile.
