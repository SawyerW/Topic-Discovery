Samsung has a lifelong customer as far as I am concerned. I was already a fan of South Korea but this phone really goes the extra mile. I'm not going to waste your time comparing this phone to an iphone ... for 2 reasons ... first and foremost, I've never owned an iphone LOL and 2nd this is a TRACFONE cell phone, not an android phone. My favorite thing about this phone has got to be the wonderful keyboard. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT, and I also love the wifi feature so I can check email and facebook without dinging my minutes when I'm at home, using my home wifi network. The best piece of advice I can give about this phone is something I read from another reviewer. First when you click to turn wifi on the icon will light up BLUE. BLUE means you are using tracfone mins for your wifi. After you turn wifi on then all available networks will pop up on your screen. So connect to your home network and your icon then changes to GREEN. GREEN means go baby :) When the wifi icon is green its FREE :)The other most valuable thing I can tell you is to make sure the email "receiving options" are set to "auto sync" off. If this setting is not set to OFF then every 1/2 hour your phone will check your email and ding your minutes if you are in the BLUE instead of green. Of course you can solve this issue by making sure you turn on/off the wifi whenever you leave the house :) To get to the auto sync ... hit menu, 6,5,2 then click to turn auto sync "off".This is a SPECTACULAR phone that has no business being a tracfone ... I love it :)
