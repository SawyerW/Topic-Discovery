Have had this about a month replacing a 4yr old LG600g. Call clarity is better than my lg600g (which was pretty good) Works better in weak signal areas than the LG600g (which was a good phone and worked in places my friends smart phones didn't)  I am very pleased with the lg800g, and triple min are great.  It seems to have longer talk time than the spec claims but that may be related to my usage pattern.  Down side is it goes through the airport type x-ray machine daily and that seems to lock it up? Power off and back on clears it.  Another negative is that the phone only seems to be able to use a 4GB sdhc memory (4 is the smallest I had), and will NOT talk to an 8, or 16gb card (I tried several and several brands no luck).  To me the biggest negative is no 24hr clock mode.  I bought this because triple minuets and the cost was less than the included minuets, a deal I could not say no to; I needed the minuets and got a free phone I liked. NOTE I don't text or cruse the web, I just need a phone to talk on, keep a contacts list and preform light calender functions.  I changed work locations and have no service at work at all zip code 37381. No one else has service on a GSM phone there ether so now I'll be looking for a new CDMA phone maybe a lg505c if its got a 24hr clock. I hate to swap though I'm getting used to the lg800g and mostly like it.  I got the Lg 505c and while it works at work I like the OS and menu system and especially the reject capabilities on the 800g MUCH better.  In areas where both phones work the 800g has superior call quality and the battery life (talk time and standby) is longer.
