I will not add too much about the other smartphone aspects of this phone that have been reviewed already. I bought this Nokia E6 as a backup to my work-issued iPhone 4s (I do lots of intra-state travel) and have been truly surprised that this Nokia E6 had such outstanding call signal and quality when I used it while riding in the CA-BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), in our office building's below-ground store room, in elevators, and even got 70% signal when I drove thru the San Simeon mountains last week. All throughout these test experiences, my iPhone 4s's (whenever I used it) signal went on and off and drifted out then came back, and the maxiumum signal it achieved was 20%. My girlfriend's Motorola Droid Razr Maxx during that mountain drive fared even worse at 10% signal.  As far as the construction on this phone, no complaints, and is as solid, rugged, and `handsome' as my old Nokia E71 (my old back-up phone) Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS Navigation, Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Gray). It's got metal mostly and Gorilla Glass. Battery life: I get about 4.5  days using it for calls (at least two hours daily), text messaging (around 20/day), and occasional wifi (about 30 minutes daily). My Nokia E6 is still using Symbian Anna since I am hesitant to update it to Symbian Belle with its reported issues but I may be forced to update it if rumors turn out true that the Nokia E6 will soon be allowed an update that will include Mobile Microsoft Office Apps (OneNote, Lync 2010 Mobile, PowerPoint Broadcast, and Document Connection)!  Knowing how strong-performing this phone is and that it continues to be improved thru updates makes me feel good about my Nokia E6 purchase.
