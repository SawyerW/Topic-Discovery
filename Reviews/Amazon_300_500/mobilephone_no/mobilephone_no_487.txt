The Samsung Galaxy III is definitely the best phone on the market right now for sprint(10/11/12. I read the poor reviews the phone has received and i'm not sure where they are coming from. I am seeing complaints on the Verizon network and issues about where the buttons are placed on the phone.....seriously? When I was ready to make a purchase for a new phone the available options were the Galaxy, One X, and Iphone, but the battery life, screen size, and 2GB of ram is what led me to this phone.I am coming from the Samsung Epic 4G which I disliked after 30 days so my first goal to achieve when receiving this phone was to find a reason to return the phone before the 30 day trial period. So I tried to get the phone to freeze, I simultaneously started updating and downloading my apps from my old phone, started opening apps, played YouTube video's, sending and receiving text messages, played with the camera, streamed movies from Netflix. I left all the apps open during this testing time and the phone did not freeze it just got really hot and lagged a little bit when sending the text messages but that was all. So i was satisfied.Over a month has passed and this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only compliant I had was the lag when pressing the main home button. Their was a second or so delay when pressing the button, so I found out if you take the S-voice shortcut off this button the delay disappears. Speaking of S-voice, I wasn't impressed, but i also don't use it.For those who own the phone or looking for more features of the functionality of the phone i would suggest visiting: Androidcentral.com - Click on forums - Scroll down until you find the Samsung Galaxy III forum - Click it - Then Click "Sticky: TouchWiz Nature UX: The definitive guide" This should be the fourth or fifth thread.The individual who wrote this review, did a really nice job.
