the 8520 phone actually works well on at&t;! no matter how much you learn the iphone keyboard, a blackberry full physical qwerty still wins, hands down. the spell checker and predictive type on bberry is better vs iphone and with the physical keyboard you misspell a lot less. since you can sync your itunes on here you only "miss" the iphone for its apps which really only work best on wifi. 8520 is lightweight, fairly thin, very light, has nicely spaced keys, and really cool media controls blended into the top of the device. nice use of rubber here on the device too lends some durability to glossy plastic finish. I jammed a 16G nand flash card into it too so i have music, movies etc with me. I bought the unlocked version since i use the 8520 when traveling to US from abroad .... without a full blackberry data package you lose out on things like email and blackberry messenger - but this is my 2nd/travel phone so i dont care too much - I use it when in the US with pay as you go on at&t; - i get what i want a phone that works, easy texting, wifi browsing and music/video. iPhone is my main phone abroad but it wont stay that way once renewal time comes. I could easily see 8520 being my main phone but if you want the mobile internet experience (3G) and slightly cooler packaging then go for the 9700, but you pay for it - a lot more. given cost differential I would easily buy 8520 over 8900 ...8520 just feels a tad cooler too vs 8900 still too corporate. yet both are pretty similarly equipped. if you had full blackberry data package with this as your main phone u r probably happy person. i am more than happy with this as 2nd/travel phone. Cool thing about this unlocked version is i can buy pay as you go sim card, slip it in and work no matter where i am. in past my edge (non3G) blackberries actually run things like google apps and internet fairly well. i am sure 9700 with full 3G is better but necessary??
