I've had my E71 for almost one year now.  I also have an iphone 3Gs and switch back and forth between the two.  I like them both.  The E71 has amazing battery life, my biggest complaint about the iphone.  The sound quality and reception are better on the E71.  The screen is bigger with higher resolution and it's easier to web browse on the iphone.The E71 wifi is more senstive than the iphone.  I can see and log in to weak hot spots that the iphone can't see. The Nokia Messaging provides html email but the email client is not as good as the iphone.  The iphone does load web pages faster, even on wifi.I've got apps on my E71 that you can't get on the iphone.  I've got a call recorder and blacklist, which I really like. Also, I've got Jokuspot which turns my E71 into a wifi hotspot.  This app is incredible!The iphone has threaded messages where the E71 does not.  It's nice to have, but not a big deal to me.As far as the cameras go, the iphone has a better camera, but lacks a flash.  The E71 flash is the best I've seen on any cell phone I've owned.  It's an auto flash that actually works!  It will adjust the brightness of the flash as needed.  I can take pictures in a dark room and it easily provides enought light to get a good image 10 to 15 feet away.  The E71 camera does cast a purple tint on pictures in low light situations, the main downside of it's camera.People complain about the small E71 screen, but it goes with the size of the phone.  One thing I really like about the E71 is it's small size.  It's about half the size of a Blackberry Bold.The E71 is made in Finland, and as others have said, is very well made.  I have no desire to upgrade to the China made E72.Overall, the E71 is an excellent phone and I highly recommend it.
