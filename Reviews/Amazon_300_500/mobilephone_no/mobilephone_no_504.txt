I just traded my Note 2 for an Iphone 5. I'm expecting the guy I traded with to bust down my door and reclaim his property, at any moment. The Note 2 was good for games and videos..... that was all. The S Pen was a gimmick, I used it for the first week, then it just became the thing that popped out when I dropped the phone , which was a constant occurrence (more later).Long story short, the dude at Best Buy convinced me to buy the Note 2 instead of the Iphone 5. The Note 2 operating system was awesome, if you have no life outside of your smart phone. All the people who claim that they need this gigantic phone for their job are stupid. The Iphone is just as good (if not better) than android at keeping one organized. When it boils down to it, the note 2 is good for video games and movies.I owned the Note 2 for about 4 months. I'm 6' 4" tall with XL hands. I dropped the Note 2 at least once a day. I found that lying in bed and looking at my phone was all but impossible with the Note 2. My hands also hurt on a continuous basis, due to the fact that I was always trying to hold this ridiculously large phone with one hand.Everyone told me that this phone was too big. Every time I pulled it out, I would get bombarded with comments about how I should carry that phone on my back. The fact that the Iphone looked so small in comparison was my justification. When looking at the Iphone, after holding the note, I was blown away by how tiny the Iphone really was. I quickly discovered that it takes about 2 minutes to adapt back to the Iphone size. A good movie is just as good on a 32" tv as it is on an 80".What I discovered through this experience is that Android fan boys are just as bad as the Apple ones, but the Android guys write way more reviews. Just look at Craigslist and you will see all the people trying to trade their Note 2 for an iPhone. I feel like I dodged a bullet.
