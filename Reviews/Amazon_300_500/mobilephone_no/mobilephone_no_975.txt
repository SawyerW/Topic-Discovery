I guess the problem for me is expecting this phone to be more than it is. My biggest complaint: battery life. I don't run WiFi and I ALWAYS close out programs I'm not using. (Task Manager is probably what I use more than anything else with this phone.) The battery life is absurdly bad, as in very few hours even when you're not using it and just have it on with no apps running.Next complaint is the speed and the clarity of calls. The phone is clunky in doing even the most simple things, including typing. The delayed response is as irritating as when you use slow internet when you're used to pages loading immediately. You can't run too many apps at once (which I wouldn't suggest anyway and don't on faster devices), and you can't run some others at all while in a call. YouTube has been pretty much useless for me, as I can search for vids but can't watch them (They just load forever). The calls are ALWAYS unclear and sometimes drop outright, but thats more a service issue for my area, I assume.This phone is great if you're new to smartphones, but not if you're used to higher quality ones. My pluses for this phone are the screen size and clarity and experiencing Android for the first time. Despite the phone's limitations, I do like the Android features, which makes me think I'd have a better experience with a better phone. Another plus is price. This phone was a good price and fulfilled an immediate need for an affordable smart phone (as my former one is a Japan-only iPhone and I don't jailbreak).So, if you want an affordable smart phone period and will mostly use it to call, the Venice may be for you, but I might suggest turning it off when not in use, as I've found the battery drains entirely too fast even while doing "nothing."
