This phone is very nice! Although some folks think that the 16GB memory is too small, it's plenty for storing tons of songs, and photos, and a good amount of Apps. If you like having every song in your bazillion song collection, then maybe this baby is not your phone. But for most people, 16GB is more then enough. My prior phone the iphone 3GS, and original Samsung Focus were both 16GB and I hardly ever was using all the memory.The recent update to Windows phone, aka "Mango" is an important and awesome upgrade making this phone, and OS a very real alternative to either Android or the iphone.To rate the 3 systems, I say Windows phone and the Apple iPhone are in a tie, both has their respective advantages..and Android is in a lagging 2nd, Sorry Blackberry you're now in distant 3rd... I gave up on you years ago.Regarding ,Android although a decent OS only grew so fast because the management at Microsoft were a little to slow to react to the iPhone. That has now changed.If you use a Windows machine, the Focus S has the potential to be so much better intergrated than that of an Apple Iphone to your Windows PC. It's a no brainer if you're a PC. It's super thin, light, the screen is even better than the original Focus (which is great). I wouldn't upgrade to the S if you're not due for a contract renewal upgrade because although the Focus S a improvement, the original Focus (now 1 year old), the original is still a good phone and very competive against many brand new phones on the market.I often get "wow, cool phone is that Android?" Sort of funny and annoying at the same time. I give the phone 4 stars because of no expandable memory for those who might want more. I would also like to see a Samsung phone that has some other materials used, such as metals, like the  iphone.
