First, the service:  I was happy with ATT wireless GSM while I worked at an office less than 1/4 mile from Interstate 66 (15 miles west of Washington, DC), and my route to work was ON the Capital Beltway (I-495), but now I am 3 miles from Interstate 95, 16 miles from the heart of DC, and my route is NOT on the Interstate, and I *NEVER* CAN USE THE PHONE (to|at|from) work!!!  I tried calling customer service repeatedly (6 times in one trip to work) and have never gotten through or stayed on long enough to get my point across.  DO NOT BUY SERVICE FROM AT&T.  THEY DON'T HAVE A NETWORK!!!  You can be "lucky" like I was for the first month, but I GUARANTEE you that you will eventually be thinking of throwing the phone out.  I was very happy with my old (non-GSM) ATT service--getting connections just about every time--but now I *NEVER* get a connection.  To top it off I recently tried to call my wife from the grocery store and found that I couldn't--even after walking out into the parking lot--and the grocer is 1/2 mile from the Capital Beltway.  They'll tell you that the hurricane damaged equipment, or that sunspots are interfering, and the customer service reps even say things like, "well the technology is new and it isn't perfect, and like all new technology it is going to have problems..."  (That's what they told my wife today.)Second, the Phone:  The T-616 is a very nice phone, with lots of features that are quite usable as long as you don't require a connection to a network.  (The only reason I carry the phone now is that I have over 300 numbers and addresses in it.)  The HUGE problem with the phone is that you can't read the screen in daylight.  That nixes all of those nice features and makes you wish for your old Nokia that just plain worked--all the time, day or night.  The battery life is NOWHERE near the marketing promises.  I can't even make calls and I am surprised how often I am charging it.
