I purchased this phone less than 30 days ago and starting having problems after a week.  For example when using the phone the mute button will turn on for no reason and the other person cannot hear you.  Then when making a call using contacts, the phone will routinely dial a different contact four or five contact away.  When dialing a number the phone will place the call before you have finished entering all of the numbers.  The hands free device I use will not connect to the phone for no reason.  I tried another headset and same problem.When using the settings, the phone opens the wrong item even though the opened item is no where near the button you touched.  Boost will not allow a return since they only offer a refund/exchange within 3 days.  LG tells me to contact Boost and Boost tells me to contact LG.LG will not replace the defective phone only repair the phone.  From what I have read from others who had problems with their phone, LG does not fix or repair the phone you purchased.  Instead LG will send you a different phone that has been "refurbished" and you will not have a phone for at least 7 days.  Now I have to pay an another  $65 for the insurance deductible for a phone that was defective when it left the factory.If you purchased this phone and have had problems like I have right after you bought the phone, post a review.  Another attorney in my office thinks I can file a civil suit against LG and ask for class action status if enough people come forward with problems with the phone right out of the boxDO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  There are several other phone that work much better some of the phone are more expensive (I which I would have paid $50.00 more and received a phone that actually works) and some are cheaper.
