Got phone quickly! Packaging very good. Watch for white 8.5 X 11 sheet of paper with Pin and instructions. Save green card with phone ser#. We called Tracfone to activate. After jumping thru icon hoops we got it activated for 10 min 90 days service. Was told to call 1-888-281-8444 to get 1 year service and 1200 min and triple for life. NO WORK! This # I think this is for HSN customers and it wanted a 9 digit order # (amazon's are much longer). Got stuck in automated phone hell there and no humans on line.... So.... went to tracfone.com and selected ADD AIRTIME and then selected ADD CARD ONLINE. I entered the Enter Airtime PIN from that white 8.5 X 11 sheet of paper and  entered TracFone Telephone Number (after charging a bit, turn phone on by holding down top right button, hit end key to get screen on, unlock with screen icon, select DICE icon, select prepaid, select My Phone Number, write # down)Saw "Have a Promo Code?" Nope, wish I did... Hit SUBMIT... Hey that was EASY...take that STAPLES! Hit END key on your new phone and start Yacking cause U got 1210 minutes and 425 service days! It remains to be seen about the triple minutes for life.. whose life? tracfone, amazon or the 3rd party with no phone # that actually sold it 2 U. OH , You also can activate the phone online at [...] select ACTIVATE PHONE, select ACTIVATE/REACTIVATE , Choose your option (Activate my TracFone with a new number or Reactivate my TracFone.) and there's a HELP ICON 2 Boot! No humans to give U the wrong # to automated phone hell.. Well done Tracfone/Amazon. Didn't have a chance yet to see how the ACTIVATED Fone works with all those minutes because I'was BZY 2 finger typing to U all.. Hope this tutorial helps a fellow Tracfoner!
