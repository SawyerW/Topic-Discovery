I bought this from Radioshack about 2 years ago as my first smartphone. I was super psyched about being able to use apps and mobile data and what not.The best feature overall is the physical QWERTY keyboard. If I had the option, this would be on all of my smartphones. However, there's an issue with the design in this keyboard. The track on the keyboard that extends and retracts from the screen is fairly thin (there are two) and can become damaged. What happens is it forms a behavior on how it feels like closing after a while and requires you to push one end of the phone before the other end, otherwise one track will trigger while the other is stuck.One serious con about this phone is that it is outdated. The processor on this generation of Droid cannot meet the expectations of the apps that are in the market today. I would frequently use my phone for nothing but texts and calls, and apps would run in the background without my knowledge and slow the phone to a halt and thus be infuriating. The only way to restart the phone would be to remove the battery which, in the end, would cause software damage and data corruption.Don't get me wrong, the look and feel of the phone is wonderful. If you're not looking to use this phone for many, many apps, then by all means please buy this phone. But whatever you do, do not put a case on the phone as the case will misalign the track on the phone and cause future anguish. For me, I dropped my phone once and it was never the same.TL;DR (too lazy, didn't read) - I gave this a 3/5 simply because of the phone track on the keyboard being easily misaligned and the processor being too old to handle current generation apps. I would recommend you research into this phone further if you don't believe me.
