Received the phone yesterday, and it seems as if these phones were not produced to be sold on the US market...at least not from this seller. NOT one piece of paperwork came in English, the phone itself was not set on English when turned on, no user manual included, and I never received my memory card (which the box clearly states should be included with my phone). So far not good!! I had to get a Spanish speaking person the change my language setting for me, just so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of returning it, waiting for my refund, than having to purchase from a different seller(a real big pain in the ass). The phone was purchased unlocked so I could use it in another country, so I won't know of any other issues until I get to that country and insert a sim card from there. So to be honest I don't know what to expect because so far my experience with this seller could have been a whole lot better. I did get in contact with the seller by email, since they don't have a contact number (quite fishy) and they sent me a link to an English user manual on-line, and I was told that they would send me a memory card. I'm waiting to see how long it will take to receive that...hopefully before I have to leave the country. What I do like though, is that the phone comes with 3 back covers in different colors, and 2 outlet adapters for international travel. If all goes well when I connect a service plan, I look forward to using this phone. It looks like it could be fun to use and the size is perfect for me. I will be updating this review!!
