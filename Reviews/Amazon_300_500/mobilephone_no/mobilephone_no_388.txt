I "upgraded" from a basic LG phone with a touch screen, thinking I just need one with a keyboard for easy typing/texting - I wasn't expecting such an awkward keyboard. -1 star.The other obvious thing is the software is idiotic. For example, with many functions it does not display the time while you're in another screen - what kind of stone age OS written by an ADD 5 year old is this? Another bit of software genius is while you can move the pictures you take to the SD card, you cannot set it to just save the files there in the first place. So yes, you get to go through the motion of moving the file yourself manually every time. The software probably deserves more than one star taken off but I'll just make it another point so that's -2.Finally, although I didn't get it for the internet, and I know it doesn't have 3G or anything, but for some reason it takes its sweet time even compared to other phones while accessing via the Edge network, so that's another star for -3, bringing it down to 2 stars.About the only good thing is the Tracfone version does give you triple minutes, but frankly if I knew how awkward this phone was I wouldn't have bought it, even at $15. (so no, DON'T SPEND $50 for a USED one)OH, I forgot - Samsung has to make their own damn proprietary connector for the power etc, for some reason UNIVERSAL serial bus is not good enough for them, AND they have to change it from previous models and can't stay consistent with one size. Because they don't even stay with one connector themselves I'm taking another damn star off. It's one star because it's still a phone and it works, that's about it.
