2/7/13 UPDATE: I have to change my rating. It has now earned a FIVE-STAR Rating.  The replacement phone &4GB card work fine. For music, I simply converted my music files to WMA format, and I found a free converter to do this.  After 6mo's, the new phone works perfectly! The 4GB card also holds other files, like video/pics. I can directly copy the files onto the 4GB card using the plastic converter to fit it into the SMMC in my PC or Laptop, or I can use the USB cord to transfer them. Also, I can use my Jabra Bluetooth that I've used with my previous phones. I mainly rely on my phone for calls, which I don't make a whole lot of, and I like music when I work-out at the gym.  It doesn't compare with a Smartphone, but getting Triple Min value whenever I need to buy them and being able to carry around some tunes/pics/videos suits me fine. I Really Like My Phone! :-)  Also, I have to give accolades to Tracfone for supporting the phone!===============================================LG 800G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)Bought my phone here for $89 WITH 400min (really 1200min after 3x factor).  Had the phone a few days now and can't play music because phone doesn't recognize the memory card that I also bought for it (can load MP3 music or pics to the card by cable or directly plugging card into PC, but the phone gives a Big FAIL RED-X after plugging it into phone/booting up). The 4GB card shows the files loaded onto the memory card when looking via the PC, but the phone doesn't recognize the card after it is plugged in. The card can't be read by the phone.  Anyway, called TracFone - they saw that I've been a loyal customer a few years and about 4-phones now, so THEY are exchanging/sending me a new LG800g.  WOW!- I bot the phone thru Amazon, NOT TracFone & THEY are sending me the new replacement phone!  Anyway, THIS DEAL is still hard to beat 'cuz you really get 1200min WITH the cell phone, (phone comes with card# for 400min which gives you 1200 Total Mins after you activate them) which loaded fine for me.  I just want to send a heads-up to all potential buyers that I DID have an issue with my purchase.
