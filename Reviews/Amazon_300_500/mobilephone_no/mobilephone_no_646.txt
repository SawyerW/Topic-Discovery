I'm a man who only requires 3 things out of my electronics: Battery life, size, and usability.It's why I paid extra for my laptop to have 7 hours of battery life instead of the average 3. It's why I like the Nintendo DS over the PSP. It's why I bought the Blackjack II. All three examples are products that have a great battery life, perfect idea size, and superb usability for my purposes.My Blackjack II has been through the wire and just doesn't look attractive anymore. Back cover falling off, screen brutalized, etc.I purchased this phone, the HTC Diamond, and the Palm Treo to see which one could replace it.Of the three, this phone is simply the easiest to use. The Symbian operating system is horribly easy and I promise my grandma could master it in a week. Applications run fluidly and efficiently. For the first time ever, Gmail and Opera Mini run smoothly without any problems for me.Battery life: Blows the other two away. I shot off many texts, browsed the web, tried the music player, and did some office work and only dropped ONE bar! THIS PHONE HAS AN ESTIMATED 10 HOURS OF TALK TIME. Think about that for a second...Size: It's thinner than my BJII. A plus is the phone itself. On the back is a metallic finish which is great for people like me who might get sweaty hands. It is a fingerprint magnet (I have the white version) but one wipe of the thumb ends that.I didn't go into huge details about this phone because it seems everyone else has. My only complaint is the 2.5MM port for the headphones. I wish it was a regular 3.5, but, go to radioshack and you can easily fix that. Plus, I wish the included usb cable actually CHARGED the phone. Other than that, it's perfect for the quasi-businessman such as myself who needs a business phone - not a toy.
