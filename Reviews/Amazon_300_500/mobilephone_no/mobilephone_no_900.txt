My smartphone journey began with the release of the original iPhone.  I then proceeded to upgrade to the latest and greatest iPhones, up until the 4S.  Once I learned that the 4S was not going to get any bigger, I started looking around at other devices.  I then decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy S II.  The screen size was a considerable upgrade to the iPhone, and I have used the Android OS on my Motorola Xoom tablet.  (I also have an iPad).I instantly fell in love with the Android OS on the phone.The options available on an Android phone far outnumber the options available on the iPhone.  You read where there are a gazillion apps available for the iPhone, and only several hundred thousand available for Android?  It simply doesn't matter.  There are only a handful of apps that are worth using anyway.  And what I used on iPhone, I could find in the Android Market.Not long after I bought my GSII, I learned about the Note.I had fallen in love AGAIN.After waiting for a few weeks to see what the early adopters were finding out about it,  I saw nothing but good everywhere I went to read up on it.  I then decided to take the plunge and pick it up.Boy, what a gem this thing is.  Yes, it's large.  But it's not so large that it is unusable.  It is large enough to be able to use as a primary internet device though.  And not have to strain my eyes to read content.The Galaxy Note is in my opinion, the best device available on the market right now.  It is a phone, and a tablet all rolled into one.You might have heard that some users have experienced issues with their data plans on AT&T.;  The issue has been resolved, thanks to other dedicated Note users contacting AT&T; and working it out.  Worry none.  Buy it.  You will NOT be disappointed.
