I lost my Droid Incredible and didn't want to fork out a lot of money to get a replacement, so I purchased the Palm Pixi Plus.When I first turned it on, I immediately noticed a broken pixel. For the most part it doesn't bother me. I only notice it if the background on the screen is black, against light colors it is not noticeable.Pro: When I activated the Pixi on my Verizon account I noticed that I got the Wifi Hotspot free (up to 5GB). I chatted w/a VZW rep prior to purchasing this phone and they told me I would not get the free Wifi Hotspot if I activatd the Palm Pixi Plus, but I think because of the unlimited data I have, it made the difference.Con: The keyboard keys are very small. My small girly fingers still have trouble sometimes when doing a lot of typing. You can install a virual keyboard but the screen on this phone is so small that the vitual keyboad takes up half the screen, and doesn't leave much room to see what you are typing out.The apps available through Palm are lame. I miss all the apps I was able to get from the Android Market :(The battery life is ok. If I use my phone to listen to a lot of music or if I use the Wifi Hotspot, I notice it drains the battery. I have to charge it by 5pm if I've been using it throught out the day. If I use it only for a few calls and a lot of messaging, then I can get by the whole day and only have to charge it at night before I go to bed.Overall this is an ok phone. For me, I would prefer something that runs on the Android system as I love to use so many apps and browse the web and text. But for someone who doesn't do much besides call & text and maybe some light web surfing then this phone will work great.
