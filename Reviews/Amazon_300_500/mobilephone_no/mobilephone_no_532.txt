I use this phone with the Page Plus prepaid company and am happy with the service and reception. Definitely a great deal. Cute little phone for 55 dollars! The keyboard is small yes but the way it's set up, I find it very easy to use and hardly ever fat finger a typo. It's pretty easy to navigate and while the screen is small, it looks nice and the only time I have an issue is with viewing websites. But I really only wanted it for texting and talking anyway which it does well. The processor makes it relatively sluggish and lock up at times but my main complaint is that when I get a notification (eg an incoming text or reminder that pops up on the screen), the person I'm talking to flickers and cuts out for a little while and MY GOD, I can hear myself and whatever noises are on my side through the earpiece. Wind and traffic easily drown out the caller where my older phones didn't have that problem. Basically hearing myself and bg noises in real-time echo. Luckily using a bluetooth headset fixes the noise leak problem since you're not using the pixi's phone hardware so I will deal for now. This is why I knock it down to 3 stars. Talking on my phone is the most important thing to me and it should work well without the need to buy a headset. This phone doesn't and I've found other people on google search who've had the same issue. Otherwise, I love the keyboard, I love the size and how it fits in my hand, love the look, love the price, love the OS, and the many customizations for the OS. I say go for it if you want a cute little semi-smart phone for texting and have a headset to use with it. It's cheap and great for the price!
