Update:  1/10/2012The Ace revived itself after a few hours and then worked normally for about a week, then it went stupid again (as in dead.)  Again it "woke up" after a few hours of downtime.  Maybe it was on a coffee break or something ;-) .  Back to the wireless store it went and we "super sized" the Ace into a Nexus S.  The Nexus S is *extremely* impressive - nice size, great screen, good user interface.  I think I've been playing with it more than dear wife.=============================================The Ace was my wife's first smartphone (I have an iPhone) and she wasn't crazy about having a phone that does more than make phone calls, so it took a little nudging to bring her into the light.  Unfortunately the light went dark ;-)While we bought the Ace from our local cell provider, I wanted to share our experience with the phone on Amazon since I rely on product reviews here to make buying decisions.I *extensively* researched the Ace on the Internet and it seems to be much more popular outside of the United States - there were relatively few reviews from North America.There are three primary and consistent complaints about the Ace:1) poor battery life2) lack of storage (memory)3) early deathBattery life needs to be managed.  Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, minimize playing games, etc.  Lack of storage can be mitigated to some extent by the use of a memory card.  Early death - it goes back to the store.Personally, I think if you buy this phone without a full warranty, you're completely nuts or don't value your money very much.On a positive note, the call quality of the Ace was quite good if maybe a touch on the loud side.  Phone ergonomics were good and whatever version of Android it was running (I forgot) was easy to navigate around.
