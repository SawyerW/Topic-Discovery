I have gone through many cell phones in the 10 years that I have used mobiles.  This is certainly one of my favorite phones I have ever had!! And I have had many phones that I have used and destroyed in some way or another. I got this phone in an emerald green and I enjoyed the color as much as the phone.  I never stored more than 30-50 songs on the phone, which was okay, because you can always add more on and take some off. Camera takes pictures.  I have never had internet feature, so I guess I don't know what I'm missing there, but it's not necessary at all = cell phones don't HAVE to have internet to be a good phone.I could be a tester for phone durability!  I have done all sorts of things to phones that either impaired their ability to function or killed them completely...sometimes I would be surprised what phones could live through.This phone I had for just under two years, and I dropped it all the time, sat on it in my back pocket and put in a small bookbag that it would be tossed around in sometimes.  This phone was fairly solid!  I loved the slider feature and the up, down, left, and right buttons during texting.  However, a cell phone can only handle so much abuse when it's not a "candybar" phone.The screen eventually went black, seemingly off.  Unable to make/take calls.  But it was a ghost phone!  It tried to live after it was gone by sounding the alarm that I had set every morning at 4:30am! The screen would show the alarm, snooze and sound again...But sadly the phone was no longer more than an alarm clock.  I would have purchased this phone again, but my company did not have it available and I didn't think to order online.  If I need a new phone again and this one is still available online somewhere I would get it!
