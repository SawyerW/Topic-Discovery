I am tired of the miserable selection of phones at the Verizon store.  I can't afford the data plan for our family...and besides, my work phone covers my smart-phone needs.  When I asked for non-smart phones, the salesman showed a selection of an Etch-A-Sketch, a kaleidoscope, and two green bean cans with twine between them.  None of the dumb phones at the store had video capability!  I feel like an idiot in the store and the salespeople really aren't interested in me once they know I'm a Luddite.I ordered this phone thinking, at that great price, if it works for only a year I am still ahead.  The camera and video work great for our uses, the buttons are easy to use, the reception is good...and we don't have to hock our pets to afford a data plan.I had my son try the first one, and he loves it.  We just ordered 2 more and may order another after that.  My guess is that for 3 phones, we spent no more at the store and we'll save more than $10/month, or $120/year, for each phone with full capability but without a data plan.Warning:  Verizon did automatically put the phone on a data plan.  I had called in advance to ensure the phone does NOT require that extra cost.  When I called to get the plan taken off, the Verizon call-center person was fairly quick to recognize their error and take it off data.  I was warned that it may take a few months to get them to quit putting it back on the data plan.  For the price, I am willing to arm-wrestle with Verizon until they get it right.The accessories that work for this phone were very inexpensive at Amazon.  I was very happy to get a couple of cases, several covers, and several chargers for a bit less than the cost of one phone.  We saved $100 just getting the accessories through Amazon.
