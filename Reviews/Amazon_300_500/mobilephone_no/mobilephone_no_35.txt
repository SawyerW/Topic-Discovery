I've been a Nextel customer for about a year, and the first thing I noticed about the new i730 is the size. It's thin! Much improved over my old phone. Looks good, and feels light. And improvements in size and weight haven't been made at the expense of features. The color display is jaw-dropping, very bright and clear. And I love the GPS. I know this has practical benefits, and I appreciate that, but right now I like this feature because it's cool and fun. Did I really need the GPS satellites to locate my position on Earth while I was at lunch today? No, but I did it anyway, and my lunch-mates were impressed.One of the features the Nextel sales guy pushed was the fact that this phone has the latest Java technology. I haven't fully explored, but look forward to checking it out on my next flight. There are all sorts of productivity helpers and games to check out. And, this phone has "airplane mode" like my Blackberry, which lets you turn off the wireless part, while still being able to play games or run other java tools -- perfect for killing time while in-flight. Also on my list to do when I have a minute is to assign unique rings to a few people in my phone book -- that way I don't have to look at the screen to know if it's someone I need to talk to or not.I've owned this phone for less than a month, and love it. I've been happy with Nextel, after having been with other carriers, none of them have the combination of service and features that Nextel offers. Nextel's walkie-talkie service is amazing -- fast, clear, and, again, very cool. Great service, and now a great phone -- I'm definitely a happy customer. 5 stars for this one.
