Have had phone several months and it works fine.  The buttons are very small of course and hard for me since I have large hands, but I have got used to it.  Better than the touch screens that don't respond half the time like my other TracFone was.I edited this review because I've had the phone several months now and experience the same inconvenience others noted about the fake 911 calls.  I even purchased a belt holster for the phone but it still dials 911 at will; very annoying.  Plus I also have the browser problem.  The phone will dial into the useless fake Internet browser and eat up minutes until you notice what's going on and end the connection which can cost you an hour or more of wasted minutes.Now I just leave the phone on my desk or in my car because I'm afraid to carry it anywhere.  What's the use of that?I edited the review AGAIN because I wanted to alert you to another problem.  The phone will also connect to the Internet Browser through your phone service and use up all your minutes.  When I transferred my minutes from my old Tracfone to this one, I had 2,200 minutes built up.  I probably use about 100 minutes a month, and after 9 months, the phone has eaten up 800 extra minutes just by calling 911 and/or connecting with the Internet Browser.  I am sure this is why the price has dropped from $38 down to $19 now.There is a comment here that I only saw today that says to dial in a couple of numbers and THEN allow the phone to lock & these problems will not happen.  So I will try that and see how it works.  Because otherwise, I am very disappointed in this phone.
