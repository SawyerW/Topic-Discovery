I just got this phone (Pixi Plus) and it is very nice but I don't think it is worth a 30 dollar a month data plan with Verizon. It is probably a good deal on Page Plus, which I may switch to. I bought this phone on the spur of the moment because I dropped and broke my old phone. I am thinking of keeping the Pixi for at least a few months, probably on Verizon, where I am currently off contract. I will then decide whether to buy a flashy new phone. On the other hand, I am still mulling over the idea of just switching to Page Plus. The bottom line is that if one is going to spring for a 30 dollar per month data plan with Verizon, at least for more than a few months, one should also shell out for a phone with all the latest bells and whistles and do the two year contract. But as a Page Plus phone, it is probably great. In the five days that I have had the phone so far, I have had minimal need to use the Verizon data features of the phone. The Pixi Plus is perfectly suitable using WiFi. Besides, many people are getting WiFi enabled tablets now, so what is the big deal about smart phones?Here is a follow up about two months later: The phone is ridiculous. I have tremendous problems dialing on the electronic keyboard which is way too sensitive. The call quality is not great. When I try to enter a phone number it is usually wrong and sometimes it dials or answers when I do not want it to. The screen for internet is too small to be of any good practical use. Once in a while I use it, but the screen is too small to be used comfortably.
