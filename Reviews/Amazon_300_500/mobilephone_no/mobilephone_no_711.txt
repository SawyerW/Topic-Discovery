Tempted by a 5 megapixel camera, a touch screen and google operational system, I thought: that's it! here I have an iphone without the life bonds imposed by this brand, a pretty good camera for a mobile, and google-like neatness for doing complex tasks in simple ways. However, I was disappointed in all fronts.The ergonomics of the device is overly poor - certainly well below iphone's. The main proof is its own manual of instructions which, with more than two hundred pages, is unfortunately needed for users to be able to use many basic commands that cannot be accessed intuitively. So the simplicity of use and intuitiveness that is such a great part of Google success sadly were not translated into this operational system (e.g.: I tried to switch to another gmail account in this device and for now I gave up, as I couldn't find how to do it)Another example is the physical keys (it has several ones), which need a considerable force to be pressed (resulting for instance that the mobile is not comfortable to operate with one hand only). But in contrast to the toughness of dealing with the mechanical buttons, the interaction with the touchscreen is hyper-sensitive to the finger touch, so you often end up activating commands you don't want to - like calling to phone numbers when in fact all you wanted was to navigate in the agenda, or opening applications (or even sending then to the trash bin) when all you wanted was to browse among the screen (actually that can happen even when the mobile is left alone in your pocket)Small details can be annoying too: the horizontal mode of the screen does not allow you to finish the task you started (so you cannot send the text you wrote without going back to the vertical mode). When you want to see your files, there is no the option of just plugging the mobile into the USB port of your computer. You have first to "mount" (process not intuitive - again you need to have read the manual) and after that, "unmount" the mobile.And finally, the camera is sincerely bad. Forget the idea of having it as a substitute for a digital camera (as I used to do with my old mobile Nokia N95) mainly when it comes to take pictures when flash is needed, as the camera has no flash.overall - and also taking into account the high price of the unlocked version- a bad deal.
