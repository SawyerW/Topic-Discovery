I've owned this phone for a few months now and I can definitely recommend this phone.Pros: - Performance (8/10): Very fast and stable system. Has never crashed, although the Opera Mobile app has crashed a few times.  - Super fast on Wireless LAN.  - Amazing battery life (Charge can easily last over 2 days with moderate talk + heavy browsing) - Looks (9/10) : Very stylish and 'expensive' looks. Unlike Blackberry's cheap plastic looks the metal covers really gives it a stylish and sturdy feel. It's thinner and lighter than most blackberries. - GPS (8/10): Very good GPS, works very well with Google Maps. The built in GPS application is handy for calculating trip distance/current speeds etc. Very handy indeed. Nokia Maps are not very easy to use though. - Camera (8/10): Good cellphone camera with easy controls. Decent flash for night photography. The lens could be a little bigger. - Apps : Easy to load Google, Youtube etc. But not many frivolous apps on Ovi store (which may be a good thing).  - Easy to view/modify Windows Documents/Presentatations/sheets.- Saves lots of money on T-mobile Network (you pay $9.99/monthly for unlimited Internet). Will pay for itself in an year when compared to using a Blackberry phone.Cons:- Does not run on 3G in T-mobile Network.- Screen and Display  - Why is the screen so tiny? Why? Nokia left out a big band the top and bottom which could have very well been excellent addition to the Display real-estate (which would be a huge benefit when browsing)  - Screen resolution not sufficient (Nokia did not fix this even in E72! Not buying any future upgrades until Nokia upgrades the screen)- Buttons are a bit cramped.- No 3.5" headphone Jack (fixed in E72)- Messaging not adequate. No threaded SMS.- Ovi store lacks useful apps.- Interface could be easier. Sometimes difficult to find the controls for setting the apps/clocks/display.
