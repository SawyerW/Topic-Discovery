I've had this phone for nearly a year now and here is how I see it has faired:1) Pocket dialing - aka - butt dialing.  This phone is prone to it if you carry it in your pocket.  I have mine in the front pocket and I've lost many minutes either to phone calls or having text messages getting re-sent.2) Screen is getting decently scratched - it still is readable, but I'm thinking if I continue to have this phone, in another 6 months it won't be.3) texting and just plain navigation - this isn't like the Ipad and tablets - it can use a stylis pen and still work.  I find at times the scrolling to be a pain the neck.  It works about 25% of the time for me, most of the time it goes the other way or to some other place that I don't want.  Numbers/letters are sometimes put in wrong due to the location it thinks I touch - and yes, I've re-calibrated it several times and still the same result.A few good things1) Triple minutes - yes, that is the best thing about this phone and the main reason I got it - plus the thickness is nice too.2) Battery life is pretty decent3) Volume - well, I think it might have been what I had it set to, but now seems better.4) Alarm clock - nice feature to set certain days to wake you up - although with the pocket dial my clock got disabled and changed the other morning and I didn't catch it - luckly I woke up about 15 minutes late.Would I buy this phone again - Nope, the first reasons above...Now I'm scared to pull the trigger on another phone that has a touch screen for fear of how it behaves with the touch.
