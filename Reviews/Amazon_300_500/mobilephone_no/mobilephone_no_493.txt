I've had this phone for a week so far, and I have a long way to go in learning all of its features.  So far, I've really only used the basic stuff.  But I do have some comments, so I wanted to do this while they were fresh.  I'll try to remember to come back and update.Generally, I love it.  For all the reasons you already know, I'm sure.  But I do have a notable frustration.  While all the things it *does* are great, the physical design of the phone is poor, and I can't believe it got through all the testing to make it to market like this.  First, it's hard to hold on to.  It's so light and slim and curvy, it wants to slip out of my hand.  So when I try to grip it, I find myself grabbing the lock/unlock button and the volume button at the same time.  They are directly across from each other, and at exactly the spot that one naturally picks up the phone.  Also, it's nearly impossible to squeeze the unlock button without also depressing the volume button on the other side and changing the setting.  Finally, while holding the phone to view the screen, I tend to put my thumb on the bottom edge of the phone, which is where the menu button is.  Argh.  I can't find a place to put my fingers on this phone that's not pushing a button and doing something I don't want to do!  It's a real aggravation.  I keep telling myself that I'll eventually adapt and find ways to contort my fingers so that I don't continually change various settings, but I'm not really convinced.  I'm now in the process of buying a case, in the hopes that the case will impede the button operation enough to keep me from doing things I don't intend to do.I hope I do find a way around this aggravation, or a way to just stop being so frustrated by it, because it really is a great phone.
