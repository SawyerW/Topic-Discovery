Bought this for my mom as a late christmas present. This is a good phone:The camera is awesome falsh works awesome! You can take pics in the pitch dark!The sound is nice...The qwerty board is a plus!The wifi is great it connects fast and from a fair distance.Because the camera is on the qwerty board which opens and close you can take self shots :-)The screen is a little to small for my likings to surf the web but its functional and I have no complaints with my young eyes but i think its a little too small for my mum.When I first wrote the review I said that there is no WAP I feel so silly kml. When I purchased the data package/ EDGE I didnt turn the phone off and back on like the carriers reccomend. I was soo excited to get the EDGE on for her I forgot about that step LOL. So i was thinking the phone does not work with the EDGE and only work with WiFI!!! How silly was I?! I felt bad and ordered me a Motorola Atrix for $180 and planned on giving my mom my Motorola DEFY!!! So in atcuality for my supidity I ended up paying $180 unecessarily!!! I was so angry yesterday when i found out kml. N e way look out for my review on the Atrix, I cant wait until it reach! I love these Motorola phones oh and what I noticed from my Defy and this Backflip to set up the MotoBlur I beleive you have to be in wifi connection. I figured out the setup on my own with my Defy but my mom wasnt able to figure hers out so she had to wait until i visited her the next day to get her sorted out.Google Market store is also good. I added a few cool games for my mom. Over all its a super good phone! especially for first timmers.
