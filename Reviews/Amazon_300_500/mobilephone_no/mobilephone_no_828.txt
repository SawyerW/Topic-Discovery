All I need is a phone that can call and text, but this phone even has trouble with that. If you're planning to have lengthy phone conversations, expect to deplete the battery pretty quickly. The battery meter never worked properly: when it's full, it shows 4/5 capacity, then after an hour of use it shows full capacity and then the meter quickly vanishes. The wall charger doesn't fit properly, so you have to be extra careful to make sure the phone is actually charging after you plug it in. It also does not use a standard wall charger, like the Gravity 2 does.The one advancement over the Gravity 2, in my book, is the Gravity 3's keyboard, which feels nice. However, make sure your text is ready before hitting SEND, because you can't cancel it. Just like the Gravity 2, it will say "Message Cancelled", but the recipient will still get it. Also, the Gravity 3 still splits long text messages, even though toasters nowadays are capable of text merging. Finally, when texting, make sure you don't accidentally scroll over the "Info" section, or else the phone will lock up for 10-15 seconds and then tell you to upgrade your plan. As a whole, the Gravity 3 is designed to make internet use more convenient, making normal use very annoying sometimes. However, if you have enough money to buy internet for your phone, you SURELY have the money to buy a phone that works properly.The phone loads everything slower than the Gravity 2 did. And that's saying something.I admit, I am being very picky, but for this price, I have the right to be. Five years ago, I bought a cell phone for $150 that had great battery life (2 or 3 times longer), loaded everything much faster, and didn't have any quirks or annoying glitches. You would think technology would be improving.
