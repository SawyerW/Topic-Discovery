I have been using an iPhone 4 with Att Wireless for the last 22 month. Nothing but trouble, from day one Att Wireless has been dropping 50% of my calls, or maybe even more. Imagine the constant worry and aggravation of so many dropped calls! Over the course of the contract I have attempted to have the issue resolved with both Apple and Att Wireless. Apple has replaced my device with a brand new one and Att's solution was to change my sim card. Neither solution worked; in fact the problem has gotten worst over time. My local Apple store where I purchased the phone refuses to replace it saying the problem lies with the service. Att refuses to accept the problem saying it's a hardware issue and sending me back to Apple. See I am a customer a human being stuck in a contract between this two conglomerates whose faulty product cost Americans billions of dollars per year.  Last two years I have had to leave my office and walk outside in order to talk on the Att Wireless phone. Sounds like I live in at the edge of the universe well, No! I live in Center City Philadelphia just 2 blocks from City Hall. If Att Wireless doesn't have good coverage here where does it cover? Att Wireless was charging $138 per month on the unlimited everything plan which over the 24 month contract is well over $3000. Transferred to Tmobile on a prepaid unlimited everything plan for just $60 per month. Now I am surfing at 4g instead of 3g, I speed tested the Tmobile phone at 4-5 Mbps which is much faster than speeds the Iphone 4 3g offers. Best of all I can now talk on the phone without having to walk outside my office and without the constant worry of dropped calls. Still thinking about Att wireless? Save yourself a lot of money and a lot of aggravation and stay away from the horrible service of Att Wireless.
