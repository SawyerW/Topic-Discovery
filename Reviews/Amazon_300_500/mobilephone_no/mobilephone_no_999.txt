This is the first truly tiny and iconic mp3 phone I have seen and used. Despite being alarmed at the size of the keys, I find it easy to use, and gratifyingly small.I'll attempt to be brief. For the previous 5 years ago, I have had touch screen 3G Motorola smart phones (A920, A925 and A1000), and before that, Nokias and a Palm Pilot.No longer needing full PDA functionality, I wanted something small (for a change) with strong battery life, which would provide very good music player functionally. I also wanted: speakerphone, good quality headset, plus a tri-band or quand-band for usability overseas. I already have a good digital camera, and didn't want to carry around a phone thicker than my wallet. That meant the Nokia N95 was out of the running, despite the lure of GPS.The good* Walkman can be controlled when keypad locked, but not accidentally.* Great battery life and ultra fast charging!* Menus are easy to navigate and comprehensive.* Clean crisp screen and versatile camera features* Doesn't crash (can you tell I've had a few Motorolas?)* Handles 3.5 mm headphones* The noise reducing in-ear headphones with great soundThe bad* Minimal amount of text it will hold in contacts, notes and calendar entries - its not quite a PDA in that way* Working out how play lists work was a hassle* Minimal instruction manuals in the boxSurprises* How much I use the Blog functionality - I take a photo, type up the text and upload it to my site - very convenient diarising or blogging when on the run* The ability to auto-stitch photos into a landscape shot* The music syncing software allows you to specific (ie downgrade) the bitrate of songs being transferred so as to save space* It copes with a 2GB M2 card  despite  saying it is only upgradeable to 1 GB* Its feel very solid.VerdictElegant, small and highly functional - I was surprised as how much easier and better phones can get in just every few years. Worth the change. The in ear noise cancelling headphones have brought my mobile listening experience to a new level.
