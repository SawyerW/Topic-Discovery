My brother and I bought this non tricked out looking cell phone with accessories (head set, home charger, car charger, a carrying case, plus double bonus minutes for the life of the phone (which meant that the 200 minutes we originally bought turned into 400 and if our dad didn't renew the minutes months down the road here [cannot remember the exact date now] then the phone would turn off permanently and you could not enter any more minutes... so please keep adding minutes to your phones!!!). We only paid $6.99 for this particular phone model. Other models increase in price as you get more high tech and add on more advancements like blackberry capabilities (they do have blackberries)... But this phone can also txt! For what we paid, our father was THRILLED! He has needed a new cell for quite some time and is loving every minute of this one.While this is great to be able to afford a phone this way, it really is the minutes that will drain your bank account in the end. We paid around $34.99 for 200 minutes for the first use of our dad's phone. Some of the minutes can cost upwards of hundres of dollars but then again you are talking about minutes that last up to a year! But with the way the economy is today and how stressing job hunting is as well, I doubt very many people are going to really want to shell out hundreds of dollars for that many minutes. But hey, ya never know! =)Anyhow, just wanted to let everyone out there know that these phones are a nifty gift for Father's Day too! They are affordable, functional, & if you can find a place to buy minutes cheap enough then you can definitely be set =) Hope my review helped a bit.
