In this age where Bluetooth, WiFi, touchscreen, mp3/video players, FM radio, GPS navigation, PDAs, memory expansion slots, voice recognition, web browsers, digital cameras, polyphonic ringtones, etc. are being incorporated into mobile phones, the LG 300 is a severely stripped-down phone that doesn't have ANY of the aforementioned features. It's just a bare-bones, no-frills phone that's reminiscent of the mobile phones in the 90's. Not surprisingly, then, the LG 300 is nothing to write home about.But I will say this -- the LG 300 is sleek and one of the most compact and lightweight mobile phones I've seen. The battery life on standby time is about 4 days. I can't speak to its battery life on talk time because I've never had a long enough phone conversation to determine it. It uses a lithium ion battery so there won't be a problem with "memory effect."If you need a basic cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, this compact phone is a good deal and Net10 is a good service to go with:Free Phone----------For starters, for 30 bucks you get this phone PLUS 300 minutes. Since Net10 sells add-on 300 minutes in airtime for 30 bucks, you're in effect getting this phone for free.Cheap Rates-----------At 10 cents per minute for local or long distance calls, the Net10 phone service is simply the best deal.

Most of the time, I have no problems with coverage in my area, although I do get dropped calls every now and then.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the best prepaid cell phone service bar none.
