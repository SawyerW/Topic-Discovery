I won't restate why so many people adore this phone -- it's very well-documented.I got rid of this phone and replaced with a BlackBerry 8900 and the difference is night and day.  The 8900 for my money is far superior.Do you like Facebook?  Pandora?  True push email that works without fuss? Threaded, conversational text messaging?  A great 3.2 MP camera with auto-focus that takes good pictures?  Well, if so, the Nokia e71 doesn't do any of those things.Facebook/Pandora, there's no app for Symbian.  Nokia's "Mail for Exchange" works well if crudely.  But want Gmail, Yahoo, or any other web-based or IMAP/POP mail to show up on the Nokia as it arrives? No can do.  Sure, there are 3rd party apps like Seven or Nokia's Email, but I found the battery to drain in short order when those things were running.  I also found those add-ons to make the OS unstable.  Had to reboot the phone 1-2X/week.I found the camera to take grainy, purple-hued pictures.Oh yeah, a 2.5 mm headphone jack just adds insult to injury.  So if you want to use your own headphones, you'll need an adapter to add bulk and noise.Further, I found that it lost 3G signal constantly in my home.  The antenna is located in the base of the handset, so if you hold the phone by the base, you will lose a few bars of reception.In other words, I didn't find the phone to even be that reliable for calls.  As you're on the phone, the crude OS fills your ears with beeps as you "lose packet connection" or the phone puts "packet connection on hold" or lose your radio signal all together.  I was often very frustrated by this expensive piece of hardware.Now it wasn't all bad.  It's unlocked, so you don't need to sign a contract.  It is built very solidly, with lots of steel and chrome.  It's very slim, so easily fits in your pocket.But initial pleasure with the phone turned to displeasure because of all of the aforementioned points.Couldn't want to get rid of it.  The 8900 is superior in almost every regard.
