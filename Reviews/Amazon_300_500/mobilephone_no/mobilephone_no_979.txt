I've been using a small Sony Xperia X8(android) for 2 years so I decided to give this Nokia a try.I've always been pro-Windows so I decided to buy this phone because it was now cheap, even though it was released like 2 years ago.I bought it Unblocked on April 2014, from ABCellPROS:-  Overall quality is very good.  Nokia never lets me down.-  Wireless tethering(Internet sharing) thats good!!-  I can choose to navigate pages as a desktop browser and not as a mobile browser which has some restrictions by some sites.-  It has mini versions of Word and Excel included.-  The main icons screen is very easy to use and to manage.-  Video playback is smooth and looks good.-  The file structure of the SD card is very simple, not like Androids which is filled with dozens of folders.CONS:-  The battery life is bad, but since mine is a used one I can not say if the new ones are better.-  Not so good MP3 player.  Too confusing.  I just needed a simple player.-  Bad MP3s codecs, could not play some of my 320Kbps songs, like my Sony Xperia X8 did easily.  However an app called Pocket File Manager did play these songs well, I did not expect that from a file management app.-  The flashlight is not full white, it has like some kind of warmth in it, so some photos might look warm(yellowish).-  One of the three main buttons is dedicated entirely to Bing search.  I don't like Bing, so for me it is a big waste of a button that could have been useful for any other function.-  Very grainy photos in low light when flash is not used.-  On the internet browser, part of the screen (like 15% I guess) is wasted displaying the URL the whole time.-  No "forward" button or feature on the internet browser.FINAL THOUGHTS:Even though the phone has almost everything I need, it always leaves me the feeling that I'm isolated( or imcomtible) from the Android population.  The grass is greener....Unless Microsoft make some huge improvements on these phones in the near future, I think that I'll eventually go back to Android sooner or later.
