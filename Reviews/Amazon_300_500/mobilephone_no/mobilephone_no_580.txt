I've had the LG Optimus Q for about two years now, and I must say that at the time when I had bought it, it was a fantastic phone.  Why was it a fantastic phone?  Because it met all of the needs I needed it to do.Let me explain.I got my phone because I wanted to do one thing.  Communicate.  I didn't get it to browse the internet, tumblr, or just in general any of those things.  I got it so I could communicate with friends who did not have cell phones.  This meant using apps like Android Messenger ((which ended up being an MSN messenger for Android)), Skype, and Steam.  These were what I used to communicate with friends.Of course after about a year+ I realized that I had wanted a bit more out of my phone.  I know it sounds kind of silly because why would I need my phone for anything other than communicating?  Well browsing the web was honestly unacceptable.  Tumblr worked kind of okay, but that's about it.  Nothing to write home about.  Around a year and a half is when my phone started to break down and I was kind of sick of it.  Constantly crashing and things not working anymore, just in general wasn't really that good.  I was not pleased around the end of its life.All and all I'd have to say that if you want to use this for just communication purposes, this phone may be the right one for you, in the beginning.  I'd have to say it's a great intro for those who might be new to smartphones but aren't sure they want to do much.  Don't get this phone for playing games or running apps though.  While it may run a few, this device was not optimized to be doing so.
