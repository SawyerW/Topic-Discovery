I bought this phone last December 2012. In the beginning, it worked great and I really loved the phone. I agree about most of positive reviews about this phone *when it is working*.However, after five months of use, the phone suddenly became dead. Specifically, the phone never turned on or got charged. I also tried to do factory reset, but it didn't respond.I wasted hours of research on the internet, and my best informed guess is that it is related to "Sudden Death Syndrome". (Search google if you are interested.)I contacted Samsung USA and they refused to repair the phone since it's international (they suggested contacting UK service). Then I contacted Samsung repair service in UK, and it took a long iteration of emails (taking a month) due to their dysfunctional website/email system. Afterwards, I finally received the response (attached below) from them that the phone cannot be repaired in EU since the warranty is in Arab Emirates. What???.....I would not have bought this phone by spending >$600 if I knew that the warranty is based on UAE. The seller was simply dishonest since they never specified these things for product information. It's extremely painful to go through all these customer service, and I wasted way more than $600 worth of time (if calculated based on my business hours).At this point, I almost gave up. I will never buy any phone from this seller, nor any unlocked *international* phone from an unreliable vendor.-----Response from Samsung repair service in UK:"We have checked your devices warranty against the serial number you provided us; we're unfortunately unable to have your device in for repair due to the warranty being outside the EU warranty. The warranty of your device is the United Arab Emirates.If you would like to discuss this further please contact Samsung customer services on 0330 726 7864 then option 6.If you need anything else, please let us know and we'll be happy to help.Thanks for contacting the Samsung repair centre."
