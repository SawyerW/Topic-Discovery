Got this phone (now for a few months now). It came unlock as advertised. There is no Querty keyboard as it said in the instructions but has a 3.5mm audio jack in the top. It is unlock and I'm using on a different network than TMobile. It says TMobile at the top and myTouch 3G when starts. The frequencies supported by the phone makes it work ONLY on EDGE as for other carrier different than TMobile (I have never put in a TMobile sim). So if you plan to use this as a 3G phone for other than TMobile search elsewhere. With time I came to realize there are a few different versions of this phone. The one I got (TMobile myTouch 3G) is only EDGE on the carrier that I'm using (every carrier that is not TMobile or support its 3G frecuencies). The 3G is ONLY ON TMobile. Other than the phone being slow on Edge it has been good to me. Signal/Battery is acceptable not great but I can live with that (will depend on usage). Just recently I installed a custom firmware and it is running good (still on Froyo).As of performance, this is an old hardware phone so no angry birds for you. You may download it but there is no way to use it, it is just too slow. I use this phone as my everyday phone as well as for development.About the package/shipping:All Perfect! IN time, Perfectly clean and No physical problems whatsoever. Just plugged in the battery + my Sim card and work from day one. It came with android 1.6 or 2.1 but the same day I opened it and in minutes auto downloaded the update to Froyo flawless.So overall if you do not want a high end phone and are ok to use ALWAYS EDGE it is recommended. If you want to use 3G on other network than TMobile or want a high end phone look elsewhere.I gave 3 Stars for the EDGE and is may be my bad just to research on the web beforehand. Got confuse with the TMobile 3G thing.
