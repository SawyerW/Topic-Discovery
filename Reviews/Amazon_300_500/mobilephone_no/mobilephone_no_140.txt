I got the phone for almost a month now. It should be between 4 and 5 stars. I had a bulky Nokia 3650. It is a very good phone but it is too big and the dial pad is not easy to be used. I tried Sony T610 and Razr. I think the Nokia 6682 is the one I like the most (now I have a backup battery).Somebody said they wish they could turn off the phone to listen to mp3 files on the plane. Actually, you can do that. If you pick the "Offline" profile, it will turn off the phone. Somebody complaint the quality of picture they took at night. I got the same problem. However, I got much better picture after I changed the setting to night mode. It has self timer too (not very useful to me though)Pro:1. Much cheaper than Treo but it is smaller than most PDA phones.2. Good signal and battery life.3. The whole package includes many goodies: the phone, a separate charger, memory card (loaded with softwares), CD-ROM with softwares, USB cable, headphones.4. There are many free and trail softwares. I can read WORD, EXECL, Powerpoint (not so good), and PDF files. Some games are better than I expected. I didn't know the phone can watch TV (there's a MobiTV application) !5. The phone/PC sychn-up software is good.6. I still like bluebooth.7. Photo editing and video editing are nice.8. The camera cover is nice.9. The phone is understatement - good - won't attact too much attention.10. I can set up many short keys.Con (minor things to me):1. Not as thin as the Razr.2. The camera cover can be opened easily (I like to put the phone in my pany pocket). If you have the phone locked, you can still activate the camera by opening the cover.3. I wish the headphone is in better quality (it's ok) or I can use other headphones.4. I wish other carriers have this phone.5. I guess I can only buy additional memory card from Nokia or the carrier.6. The PC suite could be better.With the rebate, it is a steal.
