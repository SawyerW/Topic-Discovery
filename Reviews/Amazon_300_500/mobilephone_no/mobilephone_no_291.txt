After updating to Symbian Belle, I have to say, this is the nicest smartphone I have ever seen.It is now 2014, and I still am using mine after 4 years, and I bought one for my dad.I have no desire to "upgrade" to anything that is currently on the market. I see the prices for them new are going down to $160, which seems like a pretty good deal for one now, even if there is no more "support" for it from Nokia.It has features that most other smartphones *still* do not have, such as a micro-SD card slot, FM transmitter, 12mp camera, and HDMI output.Because of the AMOLED screen, it can show you the TIME when the thing goes into stand-by, so it's also a clock.The battery life is pretty good. Standby lasts 4 days if you don't use it much.The camera is by far the best camera you will find in a phone.They re-added the timed profiles feature which I found missing in earlier revisions of the Symbian^3The media player is greatly improved after upgrading to Belle. You can create playlists with it.The built-in FM transmitter means you can play music anywhere that there is a radio.That means your car doesn't need bluetooth or even a AUX IN jack, and you can hook up lots of boomboxes to throw an outdoor party with it.I don't see this feature in very many newer smartphones. I guess it is assumed all cars have bluetooth in them and you wouldn't need it for any other reason.The Location/Maps application works great. Sometimes it takes a while to get a fix if you don't have a data plan, but it does work without a data plan!! You can download all the maps offline and search offline.It is a little slower than the modern phones of today, and for web browsing or e-mail the screen is too small, but I don't want a big tablet in my pocket all the time!It's a camera you can keep with you and leave ON and in standby without sapping too much juice.And it does HD video too. Not to mention its HDMI output which may be handy if you have some video or presentation you want to give.Oh, and did I mention it's a pretty good phone too?I wish Nokia still made phones like these.You can't install any android or ios apps, but there are still tons of good apps for it.My biggest gripe is this: I wish the battery was removable. I was able to do it after watching a youtube video but it shouldn't be built-in like that.
