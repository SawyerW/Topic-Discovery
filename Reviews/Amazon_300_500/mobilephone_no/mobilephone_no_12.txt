I have no problem with the phone - actually I have been using the same phone (quite happy except for the less-than stellar battery and the easily-smudged body) before I lost it and had to replace it by ordering on Amazon, the beginning of my woes. I badly needed a replacement since I give out my number at work. I passed on the free-shipping and ordered 2-day expedited shipping - on day 3 I get an e-mail informing me that the items are delayed and will ship after two days. I am making other arrangements and lo behold the phone arrives - well, cannot complaint too much there :) As per instructions, I turn on the phone and wait for 45 minutes for the phone to be automatically activated (per instruction leaflet). After a frustating 2-hour wait nothing happens and I call AT&T. After taking down my entire life history I am told that the "systems are down" - a common support-insider-statement for 'moron it is our coffee break'. I am asked to call after 2 hours, which I do; the biography dictation again; this time I am politely told that since I bought it at amazon I need to call them. Ok, I call amazon. After the mandatory questions on order number, mother's maiden name, father's height - "Oh, you want to activate a cell-phone. Well, our cell-phone dept closes at *4PM PST* - please call back tomorrow". Tomorrow dawns, I call amazon - same questions, no answers - this time it is "Oh, the AT&T systems are backed up. You could leave the phone on for a while (and between the lines "hope for the best") or I could submit your information and have the system activate your phone in 24 to 72 hours." I chose the latter - I'm still waiting ...
