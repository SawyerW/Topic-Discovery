Well, I selected this phone after buying my wife a 910i last Christmas and seeing how good it was, decided to drag myself in to the 21st century :)I wanted something a little smaller (previously had a T39m) and this unit is great, and suits my work profile as I cannot visit Customer sites with a Camera phone - this phone does NOT have one, and that's just what I need.Bought from Amazon and it DOES come with a QWERTY keyboard - so ignore the reviewer above who, unfortunately got a QWERTZ layout - (begs the question why not return it?).Anyway, I'm more than happy with it - it's a phone, organizer,web browser and email tool, all in one. Bluetooth and IR are extras I've not used yet - may get a headset sometime though.I use T-Mobile service, and for the $5.99 extra for T-Zones Web, you get access to email, and the FULL internet. Ok it's not blazing fast access like DSL or something... but good for quick web access when out and about. It has the Opera browser built in, and works very well.As it's tri-band (with one band being 900Mhz) I think it's limited to GSM services from T-Mobile, Cingular - now AT&T; -, Maybe Verizon?, and some of the Canadian carriers. Check your service carrier for compatibility, some use 850Mhz in the US.The touchscreen is easy to use. and the keys (whilst small) work really well. In fact I use these more than the stylus, though for web browsing you really use a combination of them both.The display is bright an crisp and really bright indoors (which you can control), though outside in bright sunlight the display tends to "washout" a little.One little "issue" to date, is that the updated synchronisation software from Sony Ericsson (v1.2.15) seems to blow away my laptop on occasion when removing the phone from an external CDS-60 cradle... That's the only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.
