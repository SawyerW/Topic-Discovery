I've been using the LG800G that I bought from this seller for the last 5 months. I've only had one problem with it and that was when my voicemail wasn't registering button presses. No problem, I just had to do a reset by powering down, removing the battery & sim card for a minute then putting it back together. It only happened once so it was no big deal.The shipping was lightning fast and the phone itself is great. Since it has an open face sometimes it will call people automatically or go into browser mode if you're not carefull. For example, if you shove it in a tight pocket your movements may start pushing buttons so I suggest you get a case if you're on the move a lot.The cover flies off easily if you drop it so I recommend buying a skin cover to fix that issue. I've dropped it tons of times (without any protection) and it still works fine so durability is excellent.The seller included a piece of paper with clear instructions on how to install the 1200 minutes (it's actually 400 minutes but with triple minutes the total you get is 1200.) Also, I spent about 2 minutes online and found a code for 250 bonus minutes.In regards to Tracfone service, I've been with them for years and am very happy. Nice, clear reception and they buy minutes in bulk from the large companies such as Verizon so it's not a generic program you're getting here. I also bought a 1500 minute card from tracfone's website and found a code for 50 free minutes. So in the end I got a total of 6000 minutes for $285 which equates to 4.7 cents per minute. Not bad considering there's no contract, no taxes, no pushy salesmen and no lines waiting for service!
