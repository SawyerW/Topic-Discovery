I used Nokia when they made the brick phones. I updated to all kinds of phones, and I still missed the quality of the Nokia, but I was too embarrased to carry around such an ugly brick of phone. This phone does everything! I have a hard time keeping track of events, when to take my vitamins, when exams are due, birthdays, everything. With other phones I had, there was the option to use the calendar and alarm settings, but none like this. Now, I don't have an excuse. I used to be stuck by the monitor all day waiting for that email, myspace message, Google Chat, AIM, messenger, facebook photo tag, listening to Last.fm, and now, I can literally take all of that with me. And the best part is, it does not eat up the battery and I can go anywhere! I can scrobble music on here with my SD card, and I have a GPS and it tells me where the closest dry cleaner is and what not in walking distance that I never knew of before! It also has this really cool application called SportsTracker, and it tracks not just the miles, but your pace. It is a great tool for athletes. I can see how many calories I am burning on my bike rides, and I can see how far I go when I walk to places. It made me get a little competitive with myself and I try to beat my own record. I love Nokia, and I have seen and tested all kinds of smartphones, and I know this phone will be with me forever!! Plus the video is amazing. I don't need to carry my ipod, camera, cell phone, gps with me. I have it all in ONE phone!!!Me + Nokia = Common Sense
