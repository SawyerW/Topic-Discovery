I'm a recent customer of Tracfone and I've been quite impressed so far.  I bought a couple of LG420G phones from them directly from their website, activated them online and added the Family Value Plan and Buy Now plan to buy additional airtime from the phone. They also came with double minutes and the accessory kit for about $20 for each phone.  As the Family Value Plan renews automatically on a monthly basis they add the minutes and automatically double them for the life of the phone.I also ported over two phone numbers from a major carrier.  I did this via the Tracfone website and it all went quite smoothly.  Both numbers were ported and both my phones were active in about 24 hours.The only problem I've had is voice mail did not work.  I created an online ticket via their website. They responded online and then called my landline to help set the phones up for voice mail. For some reason when the accounts were created/ported a voice mail account was not created.The person that called me today was very pleasant, easy to understand and very professional.I've been amazed. I've read some negative reviews about Tracfone various places, but I have been quite impressed.I do not use that many minutes a month anymore.  My contract phone which worked very well was costing me about $90/month for two phones on the family plan and one phone with a built-in navigator.  Now, I pay about $17/mo for two phones via Tracfone.  I'll use a separate GPS unit for navigation.I also like the LG420G.  I've had no problems with it to date.  All I wanted was a cost effective phone carrier and a phone that worked well.  I wasn't looking for a fancy phone, just something that worked well and did its job as a phone.In summary, I'm pleased and surprised, and I was also quite impressed with the service rep. that contacted me today to get my voice mail working.  And I'm paying a fraction of the cost I used to for two phones.
