This is a great little phone! I think it is more so for women than men because of its size so it is perfect for me. You may need to look at videos on YouTube to figure out how to use it if you are new to the Palm interface but once you figure it out it is easy to use and very convenient. This phone is NOT for power users -- stick with Blackberry or something like a Droid X or iPhone for this. This phone is not as fast and is great if you just need a great looking, easy to operate smartphone for light to intermediate use. This is mainly because of the processing speed. And I would strongly suggest that you get the charging docking station and the Touchstone back cover (to use with the charging station) because the wall charger compartment on the phone is made kind of funny and the plug comes out easily if you're like me and charge your phone up but still try to use it! Oh, the sound is GREAT -- I played a YT video on it and it sounded better than my husband's laptop speakers! And having owned an iPhone before, it easily tops their sound quality as well. All in all, great phone for a super cheap price -- all the booklets were included EXCEPT the manual (which you can find on the web anyway). You can use this phone with Page Plus Wireless too so my bill is only like $39.99 (or you can choose the $55 plan) and I still have the quality service that I would have with Verizon -- hooray for me --and hooray for you, too -- if go and buy this phone and use Page Plus -- double the savings!!!!UPDATE: 12.12.2012I have since purchased a new phone because I had android app withdrawal! Also, the back covers start coming apart pretty easily which means you would have to keep replacing them -- kind of annoying.  Again, this is a very BASIC phone -- only Palm apps can be downloaded and those are very limited.
