I wanted to update my review here I will say here is what I believe about the phone, I have heard those who have AT&T; and Sprint don't have many problems.  This phone suffers from some pretty basic design flaws and a few software that really don't make it all that great of a phone.  Basically the long story short after a couple months many people experience the phone shutting itself of randomly this is due to a design flaw with dust getting into the battery easily.  However this is the tip of the ice berg even if you every few days air out the battery and case you still get another problem that can make your phone shut off.  If you shut the case hard when going from the keyboard to the standard phone you can shut it off.  I could maybe let that part go but still the shutting off is kind of annoying.  Lastly you will probably experience the phone phones software either not working at all you having to constantly retry it.  All and all I wouldn't really recommend this phone in fact I would suggest the one below it the kyocera I believe.  Sorry LG but, the rumors are true even with the Rumor 2.Virgin Mobile service:  I also wanted to add if you are considering virgin mobile service, the unlimited data has ran out this month in the first 10 days.  Reason it's not unlimited what probably happened was when using google maps and scrolling over a map and sending 100's of KB each press hit my limit early.  Virgin Mobile should just be up front with people about their service, I have had the phone for 3 months now and already considering switching providers.  Unlimited is unlimited, and even when it says reasonable use using  an application that came with the phone seems pretty reasonable to me.
