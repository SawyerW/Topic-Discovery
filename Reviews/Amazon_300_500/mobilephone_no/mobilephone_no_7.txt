IMPORTANT: This phone is marketed as a world phone. It is NOT a world phone. (The European version - T610 - is a world phone.) The T616 is for the North American market. The GSM standard in The States isn't yet as far reaching so there is now an 850mhz frequency to supplement the 1900mhz. The T616 is equipped with this "filler" frequency as well as the standard N. American 1900mhz. The third band (1800) is used in Europe and other places as well. So, this is a tri-band phone, but it is not a world phone. True world phones us 900mhz instead of 850. 900mhz is used in Australia and New Zealand. If this important to you, DO NOT purchase a T616. World phones need 900/1800/1900. Keep in mind, most salespersons aren't aware of this.That "said," the T616 has a clean, elegant design. It's very well equipped with lots of functional features. Fits anywhere. Holds a decent amount of photos, even more if you delete excess ring tones and games. Picture quality is as good as camera phone photos are. It has both bluetooth, infrared and USB connection. The phone also allows callers to conference call with up to five other parties... and even click one aside for a private while the others chat. Great feature if you need it.The screen is hard to see in the outdoor sun light.A speakerphone would be nice, but for the price and size, it's a VERY well equipped phone. As it is not a flip phone, it can be answered with one hand and the body integrity is solid.Aside from the world phone lie, this is the best of the seven mobile phones I've had over the years. Because it has the additional N. American frequency, it probably gets better GSM coverage than other tri-band GSMs with only the 1900.
