This phone has been my daily driver for past 6 months or so. I know it's an old phone and today's smartphones pack 1080p displays and what not. But I really feel that this phone delivers exactly what is required from a pocket device for a casual user. Anything more than this is kinda overkill. Perfectly fine for some emails, web browsing, social networking, casual games, taking pictures etc.Pros: Gorgeous display (though not as bright and vibrant as the Galaxy S2), Fast processor, Smooth experience, Sleek and light, Decent battery life, Simplified Samsung touchwiz UI, great cameraCons: Glossy plastic body feels cheap, build quality could've been better (say a Droid Razr Maxx HD), Samsung's feature overkill which's sometimes just gimmicky than really usefulFollowing are some additional impressions about software only:I would say that I like this phone because I like Android, and Samsung is doing one of the better implementations of it on better hardware. Still in order to differentiate its products from other Android device makers; Samsung is skinning it's products with Touchwiz UI. This is a bloat, and though in some cases makes usage easier, in most cases it causes stutters and lags. With the beefed up hardware power, it gets smoother than older devices. But still not as smooth as say an iPhone or Nexus. I had come to expect this from almost all Android devices, until I installed pure vanilla android with a custom ROM. It's so buttery smooth and gives so much better and enjoyable experience to the user. I highly recommend using CyanogenMod 10.1 or Supernexus ROMs. Any high end Android device would be so much better with pure vanilla Android.But all in all, it's a great phone. And with newer phones carrying a lot of unnecessary specs n power, this is most suited for daily usage. And with recent price drops, it comes almost free with a contract. So a great value for money. I would recommend it without a doubt.
