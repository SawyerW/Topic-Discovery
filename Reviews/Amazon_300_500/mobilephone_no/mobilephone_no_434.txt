This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability.  The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone.  It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P  This phone is basically an update of the C-3.  It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing.  This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone.  If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed.  If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed.  Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing.  I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that.  It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them.  I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice.  Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small.  I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to.  If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.
