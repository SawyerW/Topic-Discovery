Well its not a amazing phone by todays standards but if you were in my position of having a 3 or 4 years old blackberry of course its a great phone but put against the phone I really want the note 2 but gets a little above the job done for me. I for one does not like contract phones and plus I won't use all my phones features to the max but I do like having them in case I would need to use themThe display for me just isn't that great from what I see on my galaxy note 10.1(tablet) or ipod 4th gen plus when Im on youtube I can only go in HQ instead of HD but the video quality on YT I would say above 480p but not 720p (my eyes werent tortured but I and everyone would still prefer a HD screen). The picture quality I found to be good too as so the video playback. I also enjoy having the option to put widgets (the YT widget lets you scroll through recent upload from my subscriptions w/o opening the app) and play music or streaming from soundcloud while Im on other applications. It is also nice to have a wifi hotspot feature on the phone (additional $15 on your bill) so when I need to use my note 10.1 or ipod it will have internet access. The phone still hasn't replaced my ipod because androids can place certain music files such as WAV, aiff, M4a, and others that I download from soundcloud but I doesn't make much difference if your streaming but I would still like to put those files on my phone or tablet. The phone also came with a mobile ID app which allows you to have different profiles (like android 4.3 but it has 4.0.4 then theres rooting) The total storage space of the phone w/o sd will be about 11 or 12 gigs but of course theres always adding an micro sd for more media storage. I played GTA 3 on here and it runs smooth no lagging or any problems.My dislikes that I have with this phone is no HD streaming on YT, sometimes it becomes a hot brick in my pocket, no HD display that thought it had and its on 4.0.4 (it might be Virgin mobiles issue and not phone but still would like to see 4.1.2 like on my note 10.1 or a more updated OS).The things I like are the mobile hotspot, good screen size, editing where apps can go on the home screen, widgets, voice talk, mobile id even though Im the only user on my phone
