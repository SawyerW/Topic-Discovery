First of all, the HTC EVO 4G is an awesome phone. I bounced between my Blackberry and an Android for a long time, didn't care for either, until I got this. Now, if I forget it at home, it's as though I've left an appendage somewhere!But what I really want to say is this company is one I would most DEFFINATELY recommend. Their customer service is through the roof.I bought this phone with the understanding I would get a memory card (after all...it was there on the ad) when my phone came ( in a timely manor mind you) it was missing the memory card. I called to ask if maybe they had forgotten it. I was informed that there wasn't supposed to be one listed on the ad, but since I was told otherwise they went ahead and sent me one.After a bit I started playing with the camera, and noticed it didn't take as good of pictures as I was told it did. I researched the problem, and found that the internal camera wasn't working properly. I contacted my carrier ( Sprint) and after fighting with them to get insurance on the phone, I found out it was going to cost me $100 out of pocket to have them look at it, and possibly replace it. So on a whim, I wrote to Wireless Circle and asked if there was something I could do, and seeing as how I bought a refurbished phone, I was doubtful. They said to send it right in, and they would replace it ( it was past my 30 days...by 2 days and they did it no problem) I shipped them back my phone, sans charger and battery, and a few days later, I am the proud owner, of a fully functional HTC EVO 4G! I would recommend this company to anyone who's looking to buy a non-contract phone or accessory. I haven't had customer service like this in ages, I have to tell you, it was refreshing.
