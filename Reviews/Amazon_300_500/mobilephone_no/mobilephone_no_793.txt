Update May 28, 2012:Updated the operating system to Belle today and surprise, surprise, all my old text and emails that contained Chinese are now no longer displayed as sruares.  All in readable Chinese!!!  I am updating the rating to 5 stars now.  Had been a great phone and now appears to be better, more responsive with Belle.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Works great as a phone, solid construction, have no problem what so ever.  Even used it as a teether modem for my computer (using the provided Nokia software) with great ease.  Screen is a little small for me for any extended web browsing or emailing.  Upgraded to the new Anna operating system, over the air, with no hiccup.  However, I bought this phone to use on my vacation to Taiwan, HK and China in the fall.  It is then that I discovered that Nokia phones intended for North America (or Europe) does not include Chinese (or any Asian) language support.  Solution proposed on various websites indicated a trip to a Nokia Care Center is required to add the missing language support.  So while on a trip to Shanghai this December, I brought the phone to a Nokia Care Center.  They said it will cost 120 CNY, which would not be bad around $20 and would take an hour.  After it went to the technician, I was then informed that my software is a newer version than they have in China (they are running Anna also!) and they only install newer and does not go backward! So no Chinese language support, only display little squares. It would get 4 stars if it includes Chinese or Asian language support out of the box, like Iphone, Android, Windows or Blackbery, almost all of the other major operating systems.  If you intend to use this phone in a foreign country make sure it includes your language.
