Phone arrived with test firmware and an unusable micro USB cable.  Vendor replaced the cable and I flashed the phone.  This is far beyond what an ordinary user would want to do.  It should come with regular firmware installed, and I presume most units shipped do.  Took some doing to figure out how to get and use the web doctor and stuff in order to flash.After getting WebOS (Linux) installed, then came the chores of getting it activated.  First I tried to swap it in to a regular Verizon prepaid account.  No cigar:  They require something more expensive than the $1.99 daily plan that I use.  Failing that, I proceeded to swap it in to Page Plus.  That worked just fine.  Finally after getting all that done and following instructions (make emergency call, erase 911, put in activation code) we got to setup a Palm profile.  Also installed preware and somehow got Gowalla on it.Good points:This is like a little iPhone, with 1/4 the screen on a real one.Wifi works wellAirplane mode keeps it off cell network but on wifiNice mail tool, tested with gmail and hotmailReasonably usable browserUsable music playerGowalla works (translate: working GPS)Hundreds of apps including streaming radioPossibly the most open Linux on a phoneBad points:No luck getting Opera mobile or mini on itHaving to zoom in/out for web pages is painfulMicro USB jack is a painTakes too much data if you let itFinger actions have a learning curve -- read the manual!Since I refuse to pay Verizon's price for data, using the phone on Page Plus is definitely the way to go, but taking it out and letting gowalla run is going to cost you.  Unless/until they have better data pricing on regular prepaid, this thing is just staying at home on wifi.  It has to be the slickest phone/toy I have seen for under 60 bucks.
