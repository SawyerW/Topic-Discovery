I have mixed feeling while writing this review for Nokia N85. This phone is good but as most of have said despite being equipped with 5 MP Carl Zeiss optics camera it can't replace stand alone camera such as Canon powershot series ones.The call quality is overall good. Never had any listening problem like I had with my iPhone. Screen is sufficient in size, overall good for even casual browsing experience. Phone gets slow when many applications are opened, this shows either the downside of multi-tasking or inability of Symbian OS, 8 GB memory could have been used as partial memory for swapping stuff but I guess it is not (not sure though).There wasn't any native support for Avi Video files for which I installed Divx mobile codecs but I can certainly see video is not rendered properly and hangs after some time. Point I want to make is despite Symbian allows developers to make applications, they are not tested properly enough on all handsets.Built quality is ok, I think the body is unstretchable under normal use, better to use some shield on screen to prevent scratches. Sometimes I can feel slider being pushed backwards heavily and not in a balanced manner.GPS I tried using but failed to use since it doesn't go beyond initial earth rotating screen so can't write about it now.[Update-: It works for me now with Att Media Net plan]Music player is fine and good enough for casual listening.[update] it has FM radio, Internet radio[very good], FM transmitter which can play music through your car stereo using FM frequency[/update]Now coming to software portion, I like updating my every gadget to latest firmware number but I am not able to do so in this case, because Nokia Software Update fail to launch under Windows Vista environment and it doesn't support Mac env..[Update-: It automatically updates from the phone, no need to connect to PC, didn't knew before]Gaming is horrible since I have iphone background, partially the reason is most Nokia N series/ Ngage handsets don't have dedicated GPU chip( exception is N95) so Nokia decided to make non GPU dependent games. iPhone has PowerVR gpu.[Update]Email both POP and Imap can easily be configured, internet can be accessed on Laptop using 3rd Party software called Jaikuspot which makes it WLAN hotspot, so surf whereever you like bus, train, airport, restaurants where 3G is available. Fring is another free cool app which has all IMs and social networking tools such as Facebook, twitter. 3rd party GPS app can be installed such as Garmin XT mobile which works awesome.[/update]I would have given it a 3 star but considering limitation of today's cellphone capabilities I am giving it 4 stars, also due to the fact there are so many 3rd party applications available for free, it is worth neglecting some shortcoming from this phone.[Update-: Should have given 5 stars but 4 stars are ok]
