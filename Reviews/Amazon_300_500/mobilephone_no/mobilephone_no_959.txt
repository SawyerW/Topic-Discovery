The phone is good, don't think your ordering some kind of plastic imitation, it's a well built phone and operates well. I knew going into this purchase that the original S3 cases would not fit, I ordered a TPU case anyway and, you guessed it, it doesn't fit. However, it's very close. Anyway, the phone performs well. I suggest moving any app that can be moved to the SD card instead of sucking up the phones available memory as it will slow it down.Things to know:1. This phone CAN be rooted, search the web, I'm about to root mine. You can gain extra memory by doing this.2. This phone has volume and power buttons on the right (original S3 has them on separate sides).3. The headphone plug is on the opposite side compared to the original S3.4. The speaker on the back (lower corner) is also on the opposite side compared to the original S3.5. The 8MP camera performs well, it's decent enough for me to snap pics of my kids and upload to social media and store.6. The front camera is useless.7. If you plan on using network DATA (3G) and your in the U.S., plan on using this phone with AT&T.; The phone supports 850Mhz for 3G and not 1700Mhz (T-Mobile's frequency). If you do use T-Mobile you'll only get EDGE (2G) data speeds.8. If you have AT&T; SIM in this phone it DOES get HSPA9. I activated mine on Straight Talk, they ported my SUSPENDED number from Verizon in 5 minutes (kudos for that ST!). If you use Straight Talk be sure to order the AT&T; compatible SIM card. If the SIM does not show on their web site get it from WalMart online, like I did.10. If you find a case that fits comment on this review and let me know, I can't live without a case. :)All in all, this phone is a great alternative to paying for a S3 or really any other smart phone out. At the price it's unbeatable and it does just about everything you'd expect a 2013 Android phone to do. Oh yea, it IS running Jelly Bean, unlike what some other reviewer said.AnTuTu Score: 6771
