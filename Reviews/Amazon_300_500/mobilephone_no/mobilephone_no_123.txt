I placed the order, and received it 4 days later via USPS Priority Mail (would have been perfectly happy for lower shipping fee to take a couple of more days for standard US Mail as it would have only taken a day or two more). It was not an actual card such as you might purchase via a retail outlet, but just a printed piece of paper with a PIN code.It is interesting that their web site shows a shipping charge of $0 for "standard handling to the continental USA" but this "card" isnn't available via that route as far as I can find. That was slightly annoying to me, though I can't put my finger on why I feel that way.I tried to enter the code via my phone, but the code kept giving an "error code 7" message. I went to the tracfone web site, and the code worked fine. The cost via this method worked out to about a 15& discount over the price on the tracfone web site.. $15 bucks is $15 bucks. Since I already have "double minutes" it registered as 800 minutes.. They now offer "triple minutes" too.. Tracfone gets credit for trying to be a "value-positioned product"I had no reason to  contact the seller so I can't speak to their customer service.I rank it a satisfactory experience, even though there was some slight variance over what I expected.It is worth mentioning that if you buy through TracFone, you normally get 250 bonus minutes for purchasing this same 400+365 deal.. (I'm not sure this is ALWAYS offered, but I've never looked that it was NOT offered). Since it costs $5 for "shipping" on this card, it means $90 for 400 (double-able) or $99 for 400 (double-able)+ 250 "bonus" minutes.. cheaper online by the minute, but it's your choice. I will say that buying direct from TracFone they add a bunch of "fees" on to increase it nearly $10 which you don't have with this item.[edit 8/2013] I note this is up $5, so after shipping it is only "fees" cheaper.. so it's less of a "deal" Watch the prices and act accordingly :/ This last round I just bought from Tracfone
