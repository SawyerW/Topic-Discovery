I got a hold of this phone about a month ago and have to say that I am pleased overall.  It is my 4th Sprint phone, and is my second favorite- a big boost over the old Sanyo 4500, but not quite the great reception of the Samsung 8500 (1st generaion Sprint phone).  I have found that the reception is the problem of Sprint's network, and not the phone itself, so I cannot throw any fault at Sanyo.Beyond the reception, the phone is stacked with features.  The camera is a nice one, and I like to take pictures of places I am at and share them with people not with me before I erase them.  The quality is not of a digital camera, but for someone just using them for kicks like I do, its alright.  The zoom on the camera is a little tricky, but another nice touch, as is the flash and the frames you can put around the pics.Another great feature is the speaker phone- it is way clearer than landline speakerphones that I have used, and is a great alternative to a clumsy headset.Also, the screens are tight, with brilliant color and clear resolution.  Still, what happened to some free screen savers and games.  Even the games on here are trials - you get interrupted in the middle with a clever reminder that the game must be purchased using Sprint online.  I am surprised sometimes that you dont have to pay a fee to just open the phone sometimes.Another problem with the phone is the lack of accessories, partly due to its newness- I blew 30 beans on a Sprint leather case, but it can't hold a torch to the Bodyglove Ion or Cellsuit cases.  Still with time this I am sure will be fixed.I got the phone with a lot of rebates and think the cost/benefit is phenomenal.  Still, I dont know about the 280 price tag.  Overall, though, this is a great phone, as far as Sprint phones go, that is.
