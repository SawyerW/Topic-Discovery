I have had 2 of these phones within in a 2 month period and I just went to the sprint store so that they can order me another.  The phone is cute but it doesn't hold a charge and even with good frequency it manages to still cut my calls.  The speakerphone option SUCKS! you can't hear anything and it always sounds like theres a fuzzy echo in the back ground and it's also like that when I'm using the handset.  They should have left it without a camera it would at least been 1 less thing for people who own this phone to complain about. Other phones have the option of zooming in, the kind of flash that the phone has and the sounds it makes when you take the picture, Well no none of that and on top of that the pictures are terrible in good lighting or not in good lighting, The color always looks weird.  Also you can't assign ringers to everyone that is in your phone book it's one ringtone for everything and everyone.  I love the phone cause it's cute but I can't stand the phone because it doesn't do none of the things that all my other phones use to do. It has a radio but there's a special kind of headset that you use and that's all good and well but it's pointless when you can't enjoy what you bought it for in the first place.Also the web option is extremely slow and when you log off the internet you have to shut your phone off and turn it back on so that you can make a phone call cause other wise you won't be able to until like a 5 minute or so wait, Why? I don't know. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!!!!
