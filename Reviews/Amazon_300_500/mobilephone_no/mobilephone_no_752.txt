I bought this product to replace my lost BB Curve 8900. I was hoping that since the Storm 9530 is newer technology, that it would be a better product. Wrong.PROS:  None that I can think of. Maybe the sleek appearance, that's it.CONS:  * The touch screen is very quirky, switches from speaker to handset at will.  * Touch screen keyboard - the keys too tiny to allow accurate typing. Very annoying. Frequently used keys such as "&", "@" and "comma" are buried in two or three layers. You have to keep switching back and forth.  * Texting is very frustrating - annoyingly suggests words, and changes into letters you did not type. Even when I turned off dictionary and auto-type feature, it would not work.  * Even when I reset to factory settings and re-installed software, it would not erase previous owner's phone number. The carrier could not fix problem.  * Most annoying, calls go straight into voice mail even phone is turned on and sitting in front of me.  * If a call comes in when you're already on another call, you have a constant beep in your ear continuing long after that second call had ended. The constant beep forces you to abandon your original call.  * Vibrate feature too low  - it's almost silent, and you may miss a call with the phone right in front of you.  * Numerous other quirks too many to name.Simply avoid this phone. If you must buy it, make sure it is returnable within at least 30 days.There's not much good I can say about this phone, other than that it boots up slightly faster than my Curve 8900. I'm putting it up for sale; I'll be returning to the older Curve 8900, or I may ditch Blackberry altogether and go for Android phone.
