One of my main problems with this phone is the charger.  The one that came with the phone makes a high pitched whine.  I figured I had four or five of these chargers with the same end so I tried them... NONE worked... I did some internet research and found some info that indicated that if the wall or car charger is not 5V and 700mA it will not work.  Well, a 700mA charger is about as easy to find as a hen's tooth.  After three hours searching different stores I found a car charger at a local box store but still cannot find a wall charger that is 700mA.  It will charge from my computer though.If you open a message with a pic attached it will cost you 4 or 5 minutes plus 1 minute.I cannot manage files on this phone from my mac by connecting the phone.  Mac does not "see" it at all, so, I have to take out the memory card and put it in the mac in order to add or delete files.I thought I might be able to send text messages for free as long as I used Wi-Fi...Not so much.  It is such a hassle to turn on wi-fi then sign in to google voice, then you cant really use your contacts list to send the text message.. too many steps to fool with to send a free text message.Still wondering if I should return it or not.  Some things about the phone are better than the one I had, but, the learning/hassle curve for this phone has been very large.  I would not recommend this phone to a friend.Opera is a much better browser than the one that comes on the phone.I have had trouble finding "apps" that will work.  Of the two apps I already had one gives a java error "no memory available".
