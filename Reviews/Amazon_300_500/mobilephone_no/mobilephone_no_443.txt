The Samsung SGH-S390G Tracphone is a great choice for someone looking for a cell phone to use for talk & text and does not have to have the phone stuck to there face 7-days a week 24 hrs a day.  It is not a smartphone!  If that is your need, you should look for something else.  I switched from a shared plan with one of the major carriers that required extra fees for text and data, whether you use it or not.  This phone comes with triple minutes for as long as you own it. What ever minutes you purchase for it triple when you add them. I added a 50 minute value plan that automatically adds the minutes to the phone monthly. That gives me 150 minutes a month for $9.99.  The unused minutes carryover to the next month.  Many other minute combinations are available to customize to your personal needs.  The phone uses the minutes you purchase for Talk/Text and Data.  NO EXTRA FEES FOR TEXT & DATA.Cons:  1)Qwerty keys are small and a bit close together, but are much better than the virtual keyboard I had with my previous phone. 2)It took nine days to arrive:  This was slower than other Amazon purchases I have made. 3)Had Activation issues that required calls to TracPhone support.  The phone had to be activated manually, purchased minutes would not download to the phone, and voice mail would not connect.  Tech support quality was sporadic. Tech support Connection times varied from seven minutes to one and a half hours. Support appears to be outsourced.  Heavily accented English sometimes hard to understand.  Out of the four calls I had to make I would rate three techs good and one poor.  TracPhones #1 priority appears to be sales and service is definitely it's second priority. The phone is now working great! It meets my needs perfectly.  Coverage is good, this phone is a great value!  Use the WiFi to connect to save your minutes if you download music or ring tones!  I recommend this product.
