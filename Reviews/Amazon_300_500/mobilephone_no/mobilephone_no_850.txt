Purchased on Amazon from shopcelldeals.  Quick shipping.  Ordered on Thursday, arrived on Monday.Set up went without a hitch.  I was worried at first, because it actually took about an hour before the setup was complete and I could actually use the phone.  Guess Tracfone was on their lunch break or something! :)  After activation I purchased a 60 minute card from tracfone website to see if the 3x minutes actually worked.  It did!  Sweet!  $115.00 otd for a phone with over 1400 minutes and over a year of service.  And the price has come down since I bought mine from ShopCellDeals, so it's an even better deal for you now at only $105 otd!I bought this phone as an alternate to my wife's and my regular cell phones so we wouldn't have to give our personal numbers to businesses and things like that.  I couldn't be happier with the phone and the whole purchasing process.  Thanks Amazon and shopcelldeals!The phone itself is nothing fancy, but I don't really need it to be, so it suits me fine.As a previous poster said, be sure to not hit the 'browser' button.  There is no kind of warning screen to let you know that you are about to be charged if you proceed further after hitting the button.  I did this by mistake and was charged a half minute.  Do yourself a favor and move the 'browser' button off of the home screen.And very importantly, for those of you who may not know, you can get bonus minutes when you add airtime to your Tracfone.  Be sure to check out PrePrepaid dot com for a comprehensive list of bonus codes for free minutes.  That 60 minute card that I mentioned earlier actually yielded 240 minutes.If you are reading reviews prior to purchasing this phone, don't worry too much about the reviewers who were having problems setting their phones up.  If you just follow the directions which are included by the seller, you should not have any issues.  I followed the seller's instructions, and did not have any problems that other posters were complaining about.
