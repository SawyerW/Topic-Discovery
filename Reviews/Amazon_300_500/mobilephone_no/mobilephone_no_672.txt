My wife and I both got new unlocked Nokia's a few weeks ago. I love this phone. It replaces a Motorola Razor V3 and my Palm T3. This phone is beautiful and metal! The screen is very easy to read even out in daylight ( I always had trouble with my Motorola in the sun). There are a few functions I have not yet been able to get working yet (primarily Internet phone) but everything is easy to set up. I found an app from StyleTap that allows me to use most of the apps I had on my Palm T3. This alllows me to use many of those apps on my phone, especially the data bases I have set up, and many neat games. Of course I can't use a stylus, but that has not been too much of a problem. My T3 needs mechanical repair and won't let me make stylus input anyway. One thing I really like about the Nokia is the ability to multitask, something the iPhone can't do. The phone works perfectly. Calls are clear and I have no contract remaining with AT&T; so I was able to modify my current plan to include unlimited calls, messages, media messages and data for just $30 a month a $15 increase from the plan I was using for the Razor which allowed limited calling and data. If I had bought an iPhone under AT&T; plan, I would have paid about the same for a locked iPhone, but a data only plan of $30 is required by AT&T; for that phone. I get perfect 3G connections and I am also able to connect to my home network and other WiFi networks with a few clicks of the keypad. The keypad is small, but full QUERTY. I hated texting on the Razor but really like it on the Nokia. I have figured out how to get my big hands to work the tiny keys. The camera is easy to use and takes better pictures than my Razor did. This phone even has an FM radio! So in summary, this phone is fully customizable, has clear voice and is a great geeky smart phone.
