Bought this phone from sprint when it first came out. I loved the new windows format then mango came out making things better. but I don't think this phone can handle the operating system. Some programs offered by windows does not run correctly or even at all on the phone, others you are told that the device cannot support them. There is one speaker in the top back of the phone next to the camera which sucks because the volume is always low and if you sit your phone down on it's back it will muffle the ring even on the loudest. Also there isn't much support for the phone. it's hard to find a charger that works being that you have to only use HTC chargers the sleep button on the top is either too sensitive and turns your phone off or too stiff and it's hard to push. also turning the phone to it's landscape view doesn't always work. But the worst part for me is that sprint has a tech support in their store and if you have insurance they will fix your phone for free. problem is since this is their first windows phone even their top experts couldn't fix my phone. they called customer service from the store and they couldn't help. no one knew how to back up my contacts or what was wrong with the charging problem. Sprint opted to buy me a new phone instead of fixing mine and I was told if i had any further problems to contact Microsoft. The phone has potential and with the keyboard, 720 camcorder, Nice camera, the phone is acceptable. But it could have been better and with better support sprint just stopped supporting this phone because it's not popular. I can't find cases chargers or anything for this phone.
