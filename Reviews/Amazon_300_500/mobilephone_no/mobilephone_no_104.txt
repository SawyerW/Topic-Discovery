I chose Nokia because I loved all the previous models I had owned (for the last 4 years, 6030). But I also wanted to get fee-free navigation and only Nokia offers downloadable maps. On the paper it seemed to have clear advantage over Google Maps, but for practical usability Nokia Maps are light-years behind Google's. Setting way-points is cumbersome, saving the directions list is not possible (at least i have not found it in 2 months) so once you view the directions and want to return to the map the route disappears, the location names (cities, road numbers etc) show up only at close zoom making visual navigation like one would do with a paper map rather cumbersome, searching for addresses and businesses usually does not find anything. In all, I have not been able to use the Nokia Maps in any practical navigation situation. It only works when you have plenty of time and can sit on a sofa and patiently jump through the hoops that Nokia has decided to lay on your path. Google Maps, on the other hand has been very intuitive, it shows more information at lower zoom levels and allows switching between text directions and map view without losing either.For all the other features and capabilities - like e-mail, calendar and contact sync, downloadable applications (Skype!), office capabilities (although not quite smooth yet) and all the other extras - I think E63 is more than worth its cost. It's a solid performer. But the maps, which was one of the main deciding points for me, it's a big flop.Another thing that disappoints me is that the sound quality for phone calls is poor. My 6030 was definitely a lower-end phone but its voice quality was much better than the E63's. Radio and music playback are fine, so I guess it has to do with cell signal processing. There may be all the bars for signal strength, but the sound is nearly always a bit crackly.
