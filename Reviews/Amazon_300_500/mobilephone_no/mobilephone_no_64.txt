I owned this phone for 4 months. It was a great phone. It does not look durable but I put this phone through a lot and it held up great. I have dropped the phone, it has been thrown, split apart...and it just keeps on working. It's a little expensive, but let's face almost all the phones are. This is a great phone. I will say however, the reason why I only owned this phone for 4 months was because it accidentally got put through the washing machine. This phone is so durable that even after that, it still shows all its color and takes pictures, it unfortunately is irrepairable, but I'm still hoping it comes back to me because I really liked the features and I thought the contact list was very accessable. I would definately reccommend this phone, especially to someone who is tough on their phones like I am because this one will definately hold up. I would reccomend getting a case for it though, only to preserve it superficially and keep it looking good but it will definately last a long time. The camera on the phone is good quality. It comes with lots of different ringers so you are not forced to pay to download others. The phone just has really good features, a lot of them unnecessary, but gratuitous. I have owned many cell phones and this is by far my favorite. Its a great size too. Light and takes up small space so it fits great in a purse or a pocket. My favorite feature, one of the more gratuitous ones I was talking about, is that it comes with a "buddy". Its a little cartoon bear that does dancing ans stuff across the screen of your phone.All-in-all, most durable and reliable and accessible for the money, unless you plan on running it through the spin cycle-it is not waterproof.
