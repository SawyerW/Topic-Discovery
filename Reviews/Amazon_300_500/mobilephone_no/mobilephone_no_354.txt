I really wanted to keep this phone, but it's disappointed me time after time so now I'm going for an Android. I upgraded from a Nokia N82, so I am pretty familiar with the symbian platform. But even compare symbian^3 with iOS and Android, it falls very very short on the usability standard. Below is a list of my rants:1. My face hangs up the call very often, the proximity sensor is installed on the right side of phone, so it is even easier to hang up the phone with your face if you hold the phone in your left hand.2. The camera is 12mp, but image-stabilization is very poor. I swear my 3 years old n82 takes overall better picture than n8.3. I can type pretty fast with t9 on the alphanumeric keyboard, but its text prediction just sucks. When I type in "was", it comes out as "Zar" and other strange word choices. The phone also has a tendency to prioritize capitalized words in the middle of the sentence, such as "And" instead of "and", "Good" instead of "good", and etc. The landscape QWERTY keyboard works well if you turn on autocorrect.4. The built in web browser is pretty bad, so most people opt for Opera mobile instead. But native applications still automatically open the native browser.5. Ovi Map is hard to use, the check in option can rarely locate the store or restaurant I'm in.6. NOkia has ditched Symbian for Microsoft, so don't really expect there to be much upgrade in the future.7. Lack of app developers for symbian.8. The phone hangs and freezes too often. There have been several times that the touch screen becomes unresponsive when I tried to answer an incoming call.Overall, it is entirely the software that is to blame. The hardware is very good. It would be the ultimate phone if it runs Android instead of Symbian.
