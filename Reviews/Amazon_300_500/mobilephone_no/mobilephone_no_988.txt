Hasslefreecell delivered on this one. It was the version ordered - unlocked i8190L as opposed to i8190 which is the version that will work without a hitch in my section of the world (Jamaica). It was unlocked and brand new as indicated and does not appear to be refurbished. The seller's terms are reasonable and they delivered as advertised. I would go with them again and would recommend them if you are interested in this product.It uses regular sized sim card so you don't have to get yours cut or go out and get a mini one. Frankly unless you have small hands it may not feel very manly. The touchscreen keyboard buttons are small even for a woman's hands, even when you use it landscape. But it you are not flashy and like to keep things simple then this will work for you because it fits well in the pocket. Using the touchscreen keyboard takes some getting used to coming from a qwerty keypad smartphone and some creativity in tapping so as to click the digits you intend.Please read the little instruction booklet that comes with it. You will learn more than you think - like how to answer a call. You can't answer a call by just tapping the green call button. Daisy S. post is very helpful as it relates to bloat ware that you can disable to save on battery usage and also in overall review of the product. If you have prepaid phone service (for buyers in countries like Jamaica) ensure to disable data roaming and data usage when you are not utilizing it otherwise it will eat up your credit. This is easily done - just Google how to do it. Use Wi-Fi instead when you can.It takes good pictures and does good videos.All in all it is a good phone to enter the android platform as a user - there is still much to learn about its features but so far so good; a satisfactory buy.
