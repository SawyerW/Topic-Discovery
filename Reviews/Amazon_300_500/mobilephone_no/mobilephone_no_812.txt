I never could have imagined a product like this just a few years ago.  Before buying this smartphone, I made a list of what I wanted when I would make my next smartphone purchase.  I had a Sony Xperia X1, which I didn't like moments after I purchased it mainly because the Internet was pathetically slow, the camera was bad, etc.  This Samsung phone is not perfect, but it's as close to perfection as I could hope it to be.  In fact, I can't imagine a phone in the future that could significantly improve on it; although, I know that will happen.  The Internet is lightning fast--faster than any computer I've used and I have the latest desktop and notebook computers.  Streaming video never needs to rebuffer.  It's always 100% at the beginning.  The camera is amazing--probably not as good as stand-alone digital 8 megapixel cameras or 1080p HD camcorders, but almost.  I've popped recorded HD video onto a 46" HD screen and it looks great.  I don't have a lot of games on it yet, but those I have work flawlessly.  Those using the built-in gyroscope respond perfectly.  FM radio works great as well.  That's a big plus for me.  No 3G or wi-fi is necessary to listen to its FM radio.  It has voice commands.  After programming the voice commands, they work perfectly.  Sound quality from any source is excellent.  It's a very thin and light phone, but in no way does it feel vulnerable to breakage even if one would sit on it.  There's no sensation to carrying it in one's pocket.  The battery does need to be recharged every day with what I would consider to be normal use--that's with fairly heavy use of the Internet.  Of course, the video quality of the screen is perfection.  That's been covered in most reviews here.  I'm not going through all the features of this phone, but there hasn't been one feature I've tried that hasn't worked nearly perfectly.
