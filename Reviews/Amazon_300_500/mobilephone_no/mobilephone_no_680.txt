My previous phone was an iPhone, and that was the first smartphone I owned. While this phone is a step down in terms of available apps and other bells and whistles, the performance as an actual phone is second to none.With every phone I have ever had, I have always had some issues with signal in certain places I frequent, whether at home or work. With the iPhone, I literally had no signal more than half the time. My bedroom is below the ground, so this has been a frequent problem not just with the iPhone but with most other phones I have owned. With the E71, however, I have not ONCE experienced the signal being unavailable at home or at work. I am always able to make a call, and always able to grab 3G signal for browsing.While the apps are a little outdated, they are very practical. The Opera web browser that you can download renders websites wonderfully to fit on the screen, even the ones which aren't built for mobile phones. The e-mail system is very easy on the eyes and functional. Downloading a threaded SMS app makes texting almost as good as with the iPhone. The operating system however is unnecessarily complicated, and this is the reason it gets 4 stars. It doesn't feel natural getting to different functions, and the settings that are available to be changed leaves something to be desired, making it feel as if you never get to really personalize the phone completely to your liking.The stainless steel construction of the phone looks and feels terrific. The keyboard is a bit small, but even with large fingers like I have, the way the keys are raised makes it fairly easy to type accurately. The screen is definitely of adequate size. The camera is nothing that will wow you, but you can take videos with this as well.Bottom line is, if you want a phone that actually functions as a phone consistently, consider this phone. I can do without the games in exchange for functionality and practicality.
