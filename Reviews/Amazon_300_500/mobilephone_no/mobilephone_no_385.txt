I order this phone through Shopcellas and I was so impressed.  I emailed them because I wanted to know the exact day of delivery & within hours I got a response.  Just as they said I got the phone on the 3rd day since I paid $4.95 for a 3 day delivery.I ordered it on Wed afternoon and got it Saturday morning.  Once I got the phone I realized it was a bit loose and I emailed them again to ask about exchange procedures.  They said they would exchange within 30 day of delivery not after.  Without me responding back I got a new phone in my mail 2 to 3 days after their response.  I was able to return the other phone at no charge to me.I am impressed with this company because since I shop through Amazon so much - I have found other companies to be aloof when I emailed for any reason.  This specific company Shopcellas is prompt, secure, efficient and take the time to personally respond to all questions.  This I find very impressive.  I wished they sold more things... The phone is also great - so far so good.  The battery last for a long time WOW!  My only complaint is that is a bit heavy... this phone..  but other than that I love it.. love it.  It takes pretty good photos too..Oh yeah my other complaint is that I have lost minutes because sometimes I use the "back" button and if I press once too many times it goes into "browser".. there goes a minute each time.  I must ad that I only use this phone for calling, texting and photo taking.  For these uses I find this phone to be great.  I just wished the "back" button would be for just that.... Browser button should be placed somewhere else... it can be tricky.I just need to get a case for it.. to safely take it jogging with me.. Does anyone know where to get a case for it? Thanks!
