I've had a Razr since it came out and it's the best phone I have ever used. The sound quality of every call is amazing, even if the phone has little service (which is rare with cingluar in Atlanta). It's almost hard to describe, but after a while it seems to sink in and become even better. Also (responding to the previous statement)"Geez I wonder why people from other countries think that we are sooo materialistic" - The phones were in the UK long before they ever came here so all those people "over there" had the WAY before we knew what a Razr was."I wonder how many needy people that money could have helped feed or clothed right Buffy" - So what you think your $20 that you send to green peace every year helps out so much more than not spending $200 on a phone...how about attacking Bugatti (a car maker) for making a $1,350,000 car, or the people that spend $20+ mill for a house no matter what you say its never going to stop and 200 bucks on a phone is NOT taking place of feeding the poor especially when a phone has become such a mandatory item in American culture."You people agree that the phone basically sucks but oh don't buy it because it can only be used to talk and nothing else but by all means buy it because it's a pretty piece of junk" - I got one when it first came out...accidents happen and it got broken, because I liked the phone so much I bought another one. Right now I'm on my 3rd Razr and I will never own a different phone just because of how nice, simple, easy to use, clear, and yes its looks (I have a black one). So since you made the wonderful comment of feeding the poor lets see you donate the 200 bucks to feeding them...
