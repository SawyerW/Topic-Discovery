I've been using Tracfone for a few years now and am quite happy with them.  I was happy with my very simple Motorola but was starting to use more and more minutes and was considering switching to Net 10, a Tracfone-owned company that is for people who use more minutes than the average Tracfone costumer.  Anyways, I stumbled onto this phone with the triple minutes for life and new that that was a deal for me!  So, I read lots of reviews and they all seem to be very good, and the phone seemed like it'd be a good match for me.  I use my phone for calling (imagine that!) and texting, nothing more, really.  And I didn't want a qwerty keyboard, I was familiar with pressing the buttons on my motorola multiple times for texting purposes. So, I went for it.  And, I must say, this phone has made me very happy!!  I got my 1200 minutes, plus an extra 250 free minutes after googling tracfone bonus codes.  The phone is very easy to use-I don't particularly like reading instructional manuals!  The touchscreen works very well, the "buttons" on the screen are bigger than average phone buttons, for those of us with fat fingers.  Also, my mom, who can't see much without her reading glasses can actually see the numbers on the "dialpad" without putting on her glasses.  So, I just ordered a phone for her, too!  This is an awesome deal, considering that the 1 year 400 minute card costs $100 at Walmart.  So, the phone with a gel back and a car phone charger was a $101.40, and I'll give her a screen protector from me since they come as a 3-pack.  So, a win-win situation!  If you're worried about whether the phone will work in your area, go to Tracfone's website and put in your area code and they'll give you a list of the phones that will work where you live.  I live in the boondocks of Northcentral Wisconsin and the phone works great!  The few roads that I drive on where there's no service, it only lasts about 2 minutes and then I have service again.
