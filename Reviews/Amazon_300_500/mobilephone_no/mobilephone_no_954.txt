Within about 45 days of purchase, one of the android buttons at the bottom would not light in the dark like the other 3.  The manufacturer was helpful, and identified it as defective, but said I had to go through TMobile to get it repaired under warranty.  This took multiple contacts with TMobile who wanted me to talk to everyone else but themselves.  Also had requested an unlock code at this point which met their requirements.  They said it would wouldn't be an issue getting a replacement unlock code.  Just like the warranty, getting a replacement code was a hassle.  Contrary to my understanding from multiple chats with a supervisor and agents, Tmobile imposed new time constraints because they replaced the original new handset with a refurbished one with what appeared to be an older serial number.  They repeatedly failed to issue one the unlock code.  When I finally did get a code - it appeared to be for a different IMEI number - but they said it was basically the same as my number and would still work.  I still can't unlock the phone.  Possibly the refurb they sent me was no good as well.Another seeming defect:  On all three of these that I own for my family, sometimes the unit will not respond to the touch screen (you can't unlock the screen by pressing the circle ... nothing happens).  FIX: the only way I found to fix this is to remove the battery, because the power button won't function either - so no orderly shutdown - just pull the battery, wait, and reinsert it, then turn it on and wait for boot again. Meanwhile, hope you weren't expecting an important call.Save yourself some time, and skip Tmobile branded phones.  On 2 out of 3 Tmobile branded phone models I have owned over the years (multiple units of each model), there were problems with the units and I was not treated to the best customer service.
