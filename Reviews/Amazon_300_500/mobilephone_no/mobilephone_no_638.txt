As one who spends a lot of time repairing and refurbishing BlackBerry phones, I get to evaluate the various models from the inside out. The 8800 series is one of my favorites for several reasons. The keypad is one that the average guy can actually use with a high degree of success. The shape of the keys is about half-flat and the rest tapered downward. This is a lot easier than working with the typical flat topped keys. I also recommend this keypad for "mature" individuals who weren't weaned on texting at age 10.The overall feel of the 8800 and 8820 is like a small brick in your hand. This contrasts to the cheap plastic feeling of a lot of other phones. The main circuit board is sandwiched between two supporting frames that hold various peripheral components including 2 nice little speakers which give impressive sound for such a compact device. The main housing is box shaped and not very stylish as these things go but then I use it for a phone and PDA, not a decoration.The Wi-Fi on the 8820 is my very most favorite feature. Having retired a couple of years ago, I have no need for all the advanced features that a BlackBerry can give you. I don't have a data plan but I can access the internet through the Wi-Fi feature on the 8820. This is great at home or sitting in the coffee shop with free Wi-Fi. Just install the free Opera browser and you can access email through webmail or use the Gmail app. If you get a BlackBerry plan through your provider then you can access all the normal Blackberry features.One additional advantage is that these are among the lowest priced BlackBerries on the pre-owned market and you will probably get most of your money back when you sell it.
