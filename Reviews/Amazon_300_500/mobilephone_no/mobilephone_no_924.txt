The haptic technology is too sensitive on this phone, it is too easy to unwittingly trigger something and then have to do finger acrobatics to get back to my original spot.  I bought this phone unlocked and in the international version because I routinely travel outside the U.S. and having a phone tied to an American phone company is just not practical.  My iPhone 4 was also purchased unlocked, that proved to be the correct way to go.  The GS3 comes with 16GB of user available space plus a slot for micro-SD to add morestorage space.  I have a 32GB SD card in mine.  I have put a lot of videos and photos on mine in the year that I've owned it.  I routinely clear the card and keep file backups in other places.  I have dropped the phone with two different protective covers on it - on numerous occasions - and I still have no issues with it.  I bought the GS3 because of the videos I saw users post on YouTube.  In my opinion this phone records very good video and yields nice results online.  This phone also allows the user to transfer photos and files wirelessly to other Samsung devices, including Samsung TVs.  I learned that last one by accident - I was trying to transfer photos to my daughter's Galaxy Note and my grandson came out of his bedroom and said, "Hey, someone is posting photos on my TV set."  SWEET!  Personally, I think ALL phones should have the on/off toggle button on top of the phone like Apple does it so it's out of the way.  But it's the hypersensitive nature of the haptic sensors on the lower bezel of the phone that keep me from giving this one five stars.  Still, even with the GS5 new on the market, I can easily recommend the unlocked GS3 i9300 to anyone.  It's a good phone, a great last-minute/emergency video camera, a computer in your pocket and something that won't need to be upgraded every year.
