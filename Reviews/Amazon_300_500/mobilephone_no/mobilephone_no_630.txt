My first cell phone, and after a lot of research I went with TracFone over Net10 as I wanted something for emergencies/light use only as cheap as possible. Got on the Value Plan at TracFone after purchasing this phone-with the DMFL of this phone, that gives me 100 minutes a month (minutes rollover every month) and an automatic renewal every 30 days (don't have the hassle of keeping your plan from expiring) for only $9.99/month-can't beat that for price? If I need more minutes, I can still buy airtime cards etc.Now for the BIG caveat-they've crippled the Bluetooth/USB function on this phone! I see a lot of folks wondering how to get pictures etc off this phone-since the USB/Bluetooth file transfer function has been crippled, you have to e-mail pictures to yourself at a cost per minute!From research I knew of this, but figured I'd never use the Bluetooth except for earpiece hookups etc, so my preference of the W376g keyboard over the LG600G TracFone determined my choice. When I connected via Bluetooth to my Sony NV-U94T GPS, the phone function works fine (can make/receive calls hands free from the GPS), but when the GPS offers to receive transfer of my phonebook from my W376g, no go-I've hit one of the crippled Bluetooth functions!PROSCheapest plan I've found for emergency/light useSeems to be a quality unitLike the entire keyboard lighting up at nightExcellent sound qualityFM radio (works/reception great) with RDSCONS (and this is a biggie)Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions crippled!Web browswer key easy to accidentally hit (while scrolling). If you do so, 1/2 minute air time gone!If phone choice makes little difference to you, and you really hate the Bluetooth/USB file transfer function being crippled, you might opt for TracFone's LG600G. Far as I can tell, it's darn near equivalent to the W376g (no FM radio) but apparently they've not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions.Rated 3 stars-if they had not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfers, I'd up it to 4 or 5 stars.EDIT: Just got OEM Motorola Stereo Handsfree Headset # CHYN4516B / #HS120 for Motorola Q/ MPX220/ A630/ V710/ E815/ E816/ V365/ V361/ V360/ V325i/ V323i/ V235/ ROKR E1 Cell Phones (from SF Planet) and am really impressed with the FM radio. I live in a fringe reception area, and the radio pulls in FM stations 45 to 60 miles out-much better than the radio on my Zune 80 does!
