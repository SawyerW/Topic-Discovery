I purchased my phone online through my wireless carrier. The phone arrived 2 days later. The first thing I notice was how thin and fragile feeling it was, which immediately sent up a red flag in my mind. As a result, I paid close attention to how I handled the phone and made plans to get a cover the very next day. I activated the phone and fell in love with it instantly. The next day, I pulled the phone out of my pocket as I walked into the wireless store to buy a cover and found the screen had broken while in my pocket. I had not bumped into anything, I had nothing else in my pocket. Additionally, the pants were not tight, so the phone moved around easily in said pocket. My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void. I would LOVE to be writing a glowing review of this phone, but instead I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth regarding this so-called "warranty". I will likely steer as far away from Samsung as possible in the future. I had an LG that fell from a 6 foot high railing onto a concrete patio and the only thing that happened was the battery falling out. This fragile hunk of plastic broke in my pocket. I think I'll stick with LG next time... in the meantime, I get to spend the next 18 months with a phone that makes me angry every time I look at it. It's going to be a long 18 months.
