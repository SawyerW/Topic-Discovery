After having so many troubles of trying to find a nearby payphone after some situation or other I decided it was time to buy a cellphone but which way to go?,  after hearing so many problematic stories with companies like AT&T; or Verizon and hearing how with most companies like these you had to at least sign a two-year contract with about a $175.00 or $150.00 payment for early cancellation fees I heard about Tracfone and prepaid cellphones and haven't regretted that choice since then.  Like what most expect the Motorola is a good phone and with this one you can access the web and text friends as well though as said by an earlier reviewer you get charged minutes off your airtime total when you do this,  but when I purchased this model Tracfone had put an added bonus with it double minutes meaning as most would expect you pay for 60 minutes and 120 minutes is added to your airtime.  Now the real question for a buyer is probably going to have to be are you using the cellphone for just calls and some texting or the added bonuses of listening to music watching videos and such an such(Though you can download some news and sports information with it costing you airtime minutes),  now you can listen to music on this phone and download some wall papers or new ring tones if you wish but sadly there's no video streaming on this model but for myself I have no problem with that since I feel that if you're going to watch a video than see t.v. or if you're going to listen to music get an mp3 player or Ipod.  So for anyone who's ever been in a situation regretting not having a cellphone here's a great one to check out but for the younger generation or those who wish to have the newest fad on cellphones than you probably want to try something else.
