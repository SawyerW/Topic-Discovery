I did receive my Nokia N8 a week ago and I have been using it in all kind of manners from 05:30 in the morning to 23:00 at night. It is definitely the best Nokia I have ever used. It is extremely well built, for a release software it is also very good with very few bugs. The GPS connects inside my house in seconds. Bluetooth connects to my car stereo for handsfree calling in a few seconds. I make it from 05:30 to 22:00 without charging with a couple of hours listening to music in headphones, an hour of web browsing, an hour of listening to podcasts streamed through the FM transmitter to my car stereo.The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the web browser although better than on the 5800 and the X6 is not as good as Android or iPhone (I have an iPod) and the music player is not as good as on the 5800 or the X6. I have not found a way to tag albums using pictures on the phone or change the name of songs on the phone the way I was able to do on the N86, the 5800 and the X6.After Nokia changed the way they deal with developers with regards to cost of publishing apps and the developer tools there have already been quite a lot of new apps coming for this phone like Angry Birds etc.There is a new web browser plus lots of other goodies coming in a future fw and then this phone will be worth 5 out of 5 stars.Did I mention that the camera is by far the best on any mobile device and the design is also very attractive.The videos and the pictures you can take with this phone are just astonishing. Check youtube for some short films shot with this phone.I bought this phone at buy dot com for 430 using amazon check out. I am surprised that Amazon still sells this phone for 549.
