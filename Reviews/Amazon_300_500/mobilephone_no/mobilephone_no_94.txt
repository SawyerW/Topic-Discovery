I've had the phone for a bit more than 2 weeks and only found 4 bugs.The first one is that you can't turn on the camera flash w/out recording a video like if it were a flashlight, silly but helpfull trick I used to use a lot on my previous Nokia 6265 when in the dark.Second, speakers could have been noisier. It sounds clear but lower than my old one-speakered 6265.Third, keypad is a bit uncomfortable untill you get used to it because it is all flat with no separate buttons and a bit small so if you have big fingertips it would be a bit harder to get used to it.The last one and more important is that I find the phone slow in comparison to my old 6265. I've heard that symbian phones were a bit slow so I don't know if this is "normal" or it's faster or slower than other symbian phones but i remember that i could be writting a SMS back just right after pressing Answer option, with this phone it takes 3~5 seconds before it allows me to start writting also it's a bit slower to get ready to shot a pic with the camera.Besides this sense of slow motion(dunno if it's normal for a symbian) and the other 3 minor bugs, it's an excellent cel phone, camera capabilities are far beyond expected, specially the superb video recording. Simply awesome when using high quality and very good on mid-low ones.Sound on calls (both sides of the conversation)is Excellent using the device and also using the included hands-free.Media sound using earbuds is also Excellent, Nokia earbuds offer less volume than regular earbuds but I think it's more a health restriction than a technical isuue so if you wanna hear your music rock loud, use another earbuds =)Screen resolution and energy duration is also good for the little device, which also feels very solid for a 2-way slider, and I really mean it, it Feels Solid.GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi work simply flawless with high data transfer ratio for BT and WiFi.So generally speaking it's quite an excellent cel phone if you like sliders.
