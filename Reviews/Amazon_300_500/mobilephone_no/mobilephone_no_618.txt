I am an old Palm devotee, way back to the Handspring days. I never thought I would switch, but let's be honest, the Palm based phones are as heavy as a brick (a small brick, but a brick nonetheless!). After carrying around the BlackJack (BJ) I knew there was a better way. I carry it around in my coat pocket and don't even realize it is there. The only thing that took me a while to accept is the fact that I can't just tap on the screen of my BJ and add a calendar item. I used to do this all the time with my Treo 650 and it took a while to be at peace with having to tap a few buttons/keys in order to do the same thing on the BJ. One application, which is totally worth the $15 or so dollars I spent on it, is SBSH Facade. This creates a home screen that is much user friendly than what comes with the BJ.The Blackjack is great, especially with the unlimited data plan. For the first few months I did not have the plan and did not take advantage of it's features. But, let me tell you, the internet on this thing loads up very quickly! I get my outlook e-mail and calendar synchronized in real time in no time! I am amazed at the speed! Previously I had the Treo 650 with Sprint for 2 years, and I hardly ever used the internet explorer and the phone for e-mail since it was so slow, and the screen was only ok, the screen on the BlackJack is amazingly clear. I can read the smallest print! I might not be able to add a calendar item in a two-step process as I could with the Palm version of the Treo, but the extra few steps are worth it given the speed of the Blackjack and the much, much lighter phone. I miss my Treo only in the calendar function, but in everything else I am very happy with the Blackjack!
