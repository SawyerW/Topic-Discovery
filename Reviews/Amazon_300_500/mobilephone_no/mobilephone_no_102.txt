I have been using this cell phone for the past couple of days and I have to say that I am really impressed!  Previously I owned an SE P1i --> Nokia N82 --> E63.  I chose the e63 because I am a heavy texter and the n82 T9 just wasn't cutting it.  I looked at the e71 but since I am on t-mobile and already have an external gps I opted against it (although I still think it is a much nicer phone!).Anyway, having used 2 different symbian s60 devices I can say that the e63 is much improved over the n82 in many ways.  For starters everything on the e63 just seems snappier.  For some reason even though the n82 has a faster processor it is much slower.Secondly the build quality on the E-series is so much better than the N series.  I have seen several E series and N series phones and the E series always feels much more solid.  The n82 which was around $300 when I bought it had such poor build quality I almost returned it.  Although this may not matter...my E63 was built in finland while my n82 was built in china.  The keyboard on the E63 is good but not great.The keyboard on the p1i (which is the best I have ever used on a candy bar) is light years ahead of the E63 but then again i think that the E63 is light years ahead of the palm treo so take it as you will.  The thing that I don't like about the E63 keyboard is that it is a little "soft".  i like my keys nice and clicky so that I know when I've pressed them.Software on the E63 is really solid.  Everything "just works".  The menu system on all symbian systems is a little confusing though and will take a while to get used to.  Its a little annoying to have to break out the instruction manual to look up something but I'll live with it.All in all this is a ridiculous deal for a phone that costs less than many carrier subsidized phones.  If you are looking for a smartphone and don't need 3g or gps I think it would be hard to find a better phone than the e63.  Really.  It is very good.
