...it's difficult to use a phone that can't be activated.While I didn't order this phone for crack deals or illegal dealings as I always figured prepaid phones were used for, I needed this for my job and was enticed by the price of the phone ($25.00) and the free two-day prime shipping.  The phone came as expected, I ripped the s*** out of the environmentally unfriendly indestructible plastic case, and went to town with it.When I got to the "activate" part, I was forwarded to a very delightful person at VZ customer service who quickly identified that the phone was in some sort of lock status.  I didn't listen to all the crazy blah, but the short of it was that the seller did not properly release the phone to be activated by Verizon.  This is protection in case I had stolen the phone.  Understood, but suck.I called Amazon to learn that the only option I had was to return the phone, get a refund, and try again.  I understand Amazon's policy, as much as it sucks for me, but asked if there was a way to reach the seller and find out if they could "remove the lock" on the phone.  This would've made my life so much easier (and would've resolved the problem immediately), but the seller had no customer service number on file that could be reached.  So, I started the return process, shipped a phone that can not be easily resold (since I hacked the living daylights out of that packaging), and I went directly to Verizon.I will continue to business with Verizon, but I suspect that "Wireless Wholesale Corp" will not get any more of my business.  Do what you can to avoid these cats - With this or any products their name is on.  You really don't know if what you're going to get will work or not.  Crappity, crappity, crap.
