Amazon does not offer family plans, and the number porting process is relatively new, so I want to share my experience with these processes (based on the instructions from this website), in addition to the phone itself.Got my phone a week ago from Amazon, with the intent to upgrade to a T-Mobile family plan and port my old number (both these have to be done directly with T-Mobile, not Amazon).  The new phone arrived  earlier than Amazon predicted, activated with a new number.I went to a local TMo store to do my intened changes, as outlined by Amazon.  I already have another T-Mo phone, and the family plan upgrade was a breeze:  the rep called it in and when I checked online my plan was indeed changed.The porting part was more tricky; they told me up to 7 days to change my number from AT&T.;  Two days later my account with ATT was terminated, but still not active on TMo.  After being on hold 30 minutes with TMo, I was told "if you're porting a number to replace an existing number (which I was), it's not done automatically -- you have to call it in a we manually do it."  Good thing I persevered on hold; within minutes I got a text msg saying it's done.The fun part now is waiting for the rebates to be processed.  With the changes I made, my plan and phone number now don't match  up with my purchase, even though it's all legit.  You know how they're sticklers for detail for these rebates.With the phone itself, I'm happy with it and its features.  Call clarity on my AT&T; TDMA Nokia 8265 was better, however.  I do hear the voice hum and amplified ambient noise as others have indicated.  Reception is too sensitive: I move the phone a few inches and the bars go from full down to 1.  But I guess I'm not as picky as other reviewers; I'll live with the minor phone drawbacks to save money on the monthly plan fees.After a year on this contract, I'll be on the prowl for better service as the competition heats up.
