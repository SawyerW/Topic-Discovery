I chose the 3300 (despite its slightly childish look) because I thought a phone/music/PIM combination would give me all the functions I wanted in one machine without going into expensive smartphone territory. But it's been an incredible disappointment, for several reasons:1. The music player can supposedly play AAC files as well as MP3, but it's a different protocol from the AAC used by iTunes. If you want to copy tracks you ripped from your CDs using iTunes' default setting, you'll have to convert them to MP3 first.2. It can't sync directly to a PC--no Nokia PC Suite is available for this model (nor will there be, as I was told by customer service). Apparently, the only alternative to entering all your phonebook/calendar entries by hand is MightyPhone, a 3rd-party web-based service that costs an extra $3/month.3. The Nokia Audio Manager software is terrible! It couldn't complete a single track transfer to the phone, and it froze up for a solid minute while trying. I wound up just copying tracks directly to the drive, but then strange things happened to the track list, which I had to edit in NAM.4. The earbuds on the stereo headset are too big for most women--I simply could not steadily place the right-side one in my ear, and it fell out whenever I walked. (The only way to stop it was to hold the microphone ... but isn't it the point of headsets to free your hands?!?) And since the headset jack is proprietary, you can't just substitute your own headphones.I suppose this might be OK for a kid who just wants a cool-looking phone with decent sound. But if you depend on the PIM functions, I think you'll be very disappointed. I'm exchanging it for a Nokia 3650, which has PC Suite, Bluetooth, and the ability to download other applications (including MP3 players).
