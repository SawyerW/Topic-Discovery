I've had this phone about 3months now and this is a good phone if your looking for a cheap android smartphone. This is also a good transition phone if your not accustomed to touch screens because the circle in the middle can be used to navigate through screens, but not like a track ball.. think more of like clicking arrows. This phone is an early android model (2010 i believe)so there is not a lot of memory so your phone starts lagging if you download many apps but you can expand it to 32gb! and transfer data and application memory into your memory card which is good. I believe this phone is for the kind of people that aren't big on apps but still need the basic ones like google maps, perhaps a chase app, a weather app,.. i would not recommend this phone to people accustomed to downloading a bunch of worthless games, and apps such as how to make pasta recipes from scratch when you've obviously never even boiled an egg in your life(so most teenagers pretty much--this phone is not for you). The speakers on the phone are pretty loud although the mp3 with headphones is definitely not as loud as an ipod, but I guess that's a good thing. You can open up word documents which is great and although the phone lags sometimes if your running too many applications it is not that bad. I had an iphone 3g before this and to me this was an upgrade cause my 3g was old, beat up, and slow..(it served me well though the time i had it so no complaints on apple performance). The Comet is much much cheaper also than most smartphones on the market. Remember people.. phones are simply status symbols and there are good phones for cheap like this one... im a college student and work so budgeting is my primary concern. Im sure this is yours too if you are looking at this phone to begin with..  Do research on your own as I have and see if you find a better phone. I got a deal I guess.. I only paid 85$ brand new.. Amazon:) (but thats around what its worth now a days anyway)
