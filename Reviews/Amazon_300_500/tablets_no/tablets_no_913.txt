I needed a tablet but not one I will be logging around hence my rejection of the I-pad. I first purchased a KOBY 7022 because of the perfect size. I returned it because it was not worth the money in terms of functionality. I decided to do a little research and came up with raving reviews of the Galaxy tab 7.0. I ordered one which came in a flash. I have not been disappointed since it arrived about a month ago. It does all I want it to do and I can just drop it into my bag when it is in a case or in my jacket pocket when it is not in a case-perfect for my needs. I will recommend it for anyone. The few issues I have with it are the following: (1) It has no reset button so if it freezes and the power up/down do not work, like any computer sometimes does, you have no way of shutting it down. I had to go online to read about how to deal with the problem-I got my answer from fellow users and it worked. (2) It is a shame that no other wall/car charger will work with the Samsung tablet unless the ones dedicated to it. If you buy the USB cable, it will not work with any pluggable detachable wall or car charger. You must buy a compatible one from Samsung. Other devices merely require the right USB cable and you can use it on a computer to charge or on any detachable plug-in charger-not the Samsung. (3) As mentioned above, it cannot be charged on a computer unlike other devices out there (4) it's a little bulky- I guess its smallness makes it imperative for bulkiness since a thinner galaxy would not have the required space for all it holds. For example, the I-pad could be made very thin because it is longer and wider so it has room for all the "guts". All in all, my Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Tablet 16GN WI-FI can hold its own against others out there and some more. I love what it does and I love its size. The product itself is a 5 star. The 4 stars I gave has nothing to do with the functionality of the tablet but because of the charger issue which I think Samsung should fix.
