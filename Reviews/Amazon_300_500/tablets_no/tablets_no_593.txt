The GTablet by Viewsonic shows potential in its hardware. The problem is the software. Why they chose to take a side road and put a custom ROM in is beyond me. Instead of the straight Android experience, including the Android Market and Flash support, they deliver an OK interface with Handango market (which is OK, but lacks many features of the de facto Android Market) and make it nearly impossible to install Flash 10.1 which has officially been released for Android 2.2... you can probably do it by sideloading, which requires that you download from wherever you can find it, to your PC, where you then have to transfer it to your tablet, then execute to install from a file explorer app. Just describing it sounds confusing, doesn't it? It's not as difficult as it may sound, but it's simply a pain in the rear to have to do things this way. Don't advertise that your running Android 2.2 unless you make it standard and easy to install all the features that 2.2 promises. I shouldn't HAVE to put in a custom ROM or sideload apps to get what I really want from this tablet. Viewsonic should have known better.It's true that the online update improved performance and solved many bugs, but it just wasn't enough for me, as i wanted an unimpeded Android experience, not someone's idea of it.The screen is bright and vibrant (as long as you're looking at it face on... lay it in your lap and everything disappears because of the small viewing angle), and the sound is pretty decent for a tablet, but overall there's too many issues with this for me to give it a solid recommendation. The good news is that this tablet can eventually run Android 3.0 as it has the hardware specs to support it. Let's just hope that Viewsonic gets it right.
