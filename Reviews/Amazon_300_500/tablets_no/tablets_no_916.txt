I had to post this to due to the negative reviews.  RIM has no plans to ditch the Playbook according to their new CEO on April 10th, 2012.  I also read that Microsoft and Nokia had discussed a joint bid to buy RIM out.  But, RIM knows that they have what the other two companies can not readily do for themselves...a solid enterprise customer base for their smartphones worldwide and a professional grade tablet that rivals the iPad in terms of power, screen resolution, interface, sound quality, build quality, and much more. Like other reviewers, I for one am glad I no longer need to use the button on the bottom of the Apple products I own. The browser on the Playbook is so much better than Safari on the iPad.  RIM needs to market the Playbook better, but it's kind of hard when the Kindles have, for as long as I can remember, been on Amazon's front page (i.e Amazon owns the Kindles).  New apps are coming out regularly.  And, I can just as easily bookmark my most-used websites as icons on the Playbook's main screen or on the browser's main screen.  Plus the iPad is just big...I'd rather carry my small laptop, which has a larger keyboard, around.  My iPad would be collecting dust if it is not being used by my kids for games and Netflix right now because I'm now carrying my iPhone and the smaller Playbook for regular use.  If Apple provides a smaller tablet with a better browser, this may change.  But, that's not in Apple's plans right now. And, it would take a 3rd or 4th generation Amazon Kindle Fire to even catch up to the power that the BlackBerry Playbook has for professional use. Since I focus on more work oriented tasks, the solid professional build quality, the sharp screen resolution, and smoking speed of the Playbook multitasking abilities and is exactly what I'm looking for.
