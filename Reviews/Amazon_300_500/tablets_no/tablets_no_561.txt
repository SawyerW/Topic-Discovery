I bought mine on Amazon as "used" and it is in perfect "like New" condition. I am very pleased with the tablet. I bought this tablet with the hopes of using it for a phone as well. The US model was never meant to be used as a cell phone like the European model of the same (AT&T;) tablet. Once I realized this I decided to use it with Skype because I have a paid Skype number and paid unlimited call service with Skype. By default the internal mic is permanently muted in the Skype application and that was a huge disappointment to me. I tried at least half dozen mono bluetooth headsets and none would pair with this tablet. However I have learned that it will pair with many (if not most) of the stereo bluetooth headsets that support A2DP profile. I am currently using a Jabra BT3030 (Dogtag Style) bluetooth headset with the tablet. It pairs perfectly and allows me to use just about any VOIP application (including my Skype account) and the mic on the Jabra BT3030 functions perfectly with Skype. I can now use the tablet for one of the main reasons I bought it. It gives me a great size screen for web surfing, movies and games and now doubles as a phone with either the AT&T; 3G service or over WiFi. Call quality using this method has been good to excellent even on 3G.I have to admit that until I found out what bluetooth devices will work with this tablet I was a bit disappointed in the purchase. Now that I have the headset and mic issues resolved I am very pleased with the tablet. It goes EVERYWHERE with me.Of course I haven't given up my regular cell phone and don't intend to.I would recommend this tablet to anyone who already uses AT&T; for their cellular service. Just make sure you get a bluetooth headset that supports A2DP profile if you want to use it as a VOIP phone as well as a tablet.
