After months of debating which tablet to buy, I finally settled on the Viewsonic 10.1" gTablet for a couple of reasons.1.They carry it at my local Office Depot, so I was able to actually SEE it, check response on the touch screen, because this seems to be a major complaint on a lot of tablets.  They had it running the dashboard, which I don't really like, but you can switch to classic, which is far better.2.Did I mention that is a Viewsonic with a 10.1" screen?  I'll admit that sometimes the size makes it a little awkward to hold, carry and handle.  The screen is very nice when viewed directly.  However, the view from an angle is not great.  Not even good. I had read that in some of the reviews I saw when I was shopping, so I was prepared for it.  In public, I even prefer it, because people in my periphery can't see what I'm doing.3.The 1gHz cpu, 512 RAM, Android 2.2, 16GB and the optional up to 16GB micro SD card makes this among the most powerful tablets for the money.4.I caught it on sale for $[...] + $[...] shipping.When I got the tablet, I was anxious to see what it would do, so I plugged it in and turned it on.  I don't recommend this.  Let it charge first.  Not sure it had anything to do with just powering it on without charging it or not, but the first time I used it, I was ready to send it back.  Nothing worked.  NOTHING!  However, the second time I powered it on, it took me through a set up process and I have not had any trouble from it since.The only real downside I see with this tablet is that it doesn't have the full market. I am considering having it rooted just for that reason.  I use gmail and gtalk, neither of which are available on the market that comes installed on the unit.It is important to know that this tablet is not 3G capable.  Only wi-fi, which is perfect for me.Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.
