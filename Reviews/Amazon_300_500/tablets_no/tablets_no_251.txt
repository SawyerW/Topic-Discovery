This is my first tablet of any sort....just f.y.i.Ive always had crappy PC's that seemed like they were just barely breathing at all times. currently i have three PC's that go from bad to worse....Finally just got sick of it and wanted to get a real, new, modern way to surf online.I had my heart, my poor, sad heart set on the newest iPad 2 and saved up the money for it. got the money. read the reviews. seemed perfect for my needs. simple. beautiful and fast.That changed when i read the reviews here of the Xoom... before i knew it i was at Best Buy trying out both.I tried the Xoom and immediately loved it. it was a challenge. completely new. more rugged. spent some quality time with it and never became bored.bought it. cost alot. i cried. but i wanted it.i've had this fantastic little miracle for three days now and i completely adore it. the transition from PC to this was/is a breeze. this thing is so insanely fast. its just perfect. everything makes sense and it feels actually bigger than what it is. i am constantly learning more things about it as i go.if you are new to tablets and are stuck with your crappy PC's...i say go for this. it is a amazing machine and you have nothing to fear. the apps are great. the speed of this thing is awesome. setting up took no time at all...and i gotta say im completely in love with it.i havent come across anything yet that i consider a downside yet.....it just rocks PLUS your not locked into the iPad way of life...you can constantly upgrade with this machine and it feels like it will grow with you instead of you outgrowing it.its a large chunk of change and a decision shouldn't be taken lightly...but i have had nothing but positive experiences with this fantastic little baby and i say go for it!!!!thanks to motorola for rockin' it out. amazing.
