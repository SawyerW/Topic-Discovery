I love my Xoom. I did a lot of research trying to decide the best tablet for them money. Before I started my research I was convinced that I would be getting and iPad but I had to research my options just in case.  I ended up purchasing the Xoom (pronounced Zoom just in case you are wondering...I was curious so I looked it up on the Motorola website)and I totally do not regret it.  There are four main reasons  why I choose the Xoom over the iPad 2. These reasons are not in any particular order.1. Cost: I purchased the WiFi only Xoom with the 32gig of memory for just over $500 from walmart (I was to impatient to wait for shipping so I was willing to pay a little more and have it right them). The 32Gig, Wifi only, iPad 2 from walmart was about $600. The 32gig Xoom is the same price as the 16gig iPad. I did not purchase the Xoom just because it was cheaper.2. The Xoom has a microSD card slot. I put in a 16gig card so now I have 48gigs of memory. Do I love the was the Xoom handles the microSD, well no. It is not as user friendly as I'd like it to be but I am willing to bet that it will get better as time goes on.3.  I like Adobe Flash. I think it it cool and the iPad can't...and probably won't use Flash.4. I prefer the Android market. I iPad market is way to proprietary for me. I agree that there are not as many apps available in the Android market as there is in the Apple market...but the Apple products (iPhone, iPod, iPad...) have been around a lot longer that the Android market.  It is only natural that there would be more available. So far, there hasn't been a single thing that I've wanted to do on my Xoom that I haven't be able to find an app for. The Android market is in full speed and I don't doubt that it will surpass the Apple market very soon.
