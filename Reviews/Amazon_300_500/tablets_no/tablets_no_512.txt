June 2011Kyros mid7015I purchased this tablet to play videos and as a book reader.I am very impressed with it. Most of the knocks of the Kyros seem to either have been resolvedor were by people just not willing to learn how to use it.The Kindle is a better book reader but The Kyros is a great alternitive to a netbook or laptop as aportable computer.Battery life is abut 4 hours  which is not great when compared to kindle, but adaquatefor watching a full length movie.The screen is sensitive to exterior lighting, but does much better than my Acer netbook.It comes with a book reader, movie player, utube player and music player preinstalled.The book reader is OK but will only read e-pub format books.The video player (part of the Gallery) is really good. It will play HD avi movies better than most desktop computers.The only problem I have with this player is it uses the first frame of the video as an icon for the clip,it does not seem to have any method of displaying the file name.The music player plays mp3s fine and has a good system of displaying by artist, albums or songs.The internal speakers are not good for music but the headphones do OK.When you connect to a computer you must mount the drives before you can access then from the computer. When a drive is mounted you cannot accesss it from the Kyros.To put music or videos into the machine simply copy them to the internal memory, or put them on the SD card. The player will find them.To but books into the Kyros you must follow the directions for importing books. Found by going to Aldikothe pressing the settings button (right side of home button).The keyboard needs to be calibrated. There is an included program to do this. It only takes a few seconds and makes a huge difference.The only major problems I have so far: You cannot load the Kindle app so you cannot read kindle books.(Nook can be loaded).You cannot load Netflix. (I have read there is a method of doing this but I have not tried it).Don Shelton
