UPDATE: 1/12/12:All that glitters ain't gold!At first glance, this is a neat little tablet.  However, I had major issues with it dropping the wi-fi signal in my relatively small house after a few lengthy web browsing sessions.  This became a quite a nuisance.We attempted connecting the tablet to a portable hot-spot via Bluetooth.  Well, the tablet could/would not connect via Bluetooth (though it has Bluetooth capability.) Also, because it has ONLY A PROPRIETARY USB PORT (not standard), we couldn't link the two manually.The tablet doesn't come with any kind of manual that could've possibly explained or helped to resolve some of the issues we were having. As I was looking for a simple tablet that Mom would be able to basically turn on and roll with, calls to to tech support, or endless tinkering/tweaking are NOT desired...so this puppy had to be returned.*************************************************************************************************I purchased this tablet for my mother for Christmas. She's technologically challenged, so I'm setting up everything before it goes under the tree. She'll be able to get started using it the moment the wrapping paper comes off.I must say, that like most other reviewers, I'm impressed with the quality feel and design of this tablet.  My order arrived promptly and the tablet was already charged enough for me to get to work setting it up and downloading apps immediately!  The display is excellent and it's perfect for mom to see it with or without her reading glasses.My only complaint is that the keyboard case that's depicted with this tablet...does not fit and as the tablet has only a proprietary usb accessory port, the keyboard cannot be connected to it anyhow.  I'm not sure how I missed that little kernel of info during my research.Luckily, I plan to purchase a different kind of tablet for myself, so I'll keep this keyboard/case for that one.All in all, this is a terrific tablet for the price.  I'll update this review once mom's had a chance to weigh in with her "novice's" viewpoint.
