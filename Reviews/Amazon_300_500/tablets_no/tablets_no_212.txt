My daughter got one of these for her birthday.  We thought "great, an inexpensive ereader she can also use to watch Youtube videos" (she's 11 and likes cat videos).  However, it's been nothing but a pain since we got it.  You cannot charge it through the USB cord, only through the wall cord, which otherwise would be only a minor annoyance, but taken with everything else is irritating.  The Cruz Market content for apps and such is extremely limited.  We wanted to add Barnes & Noble's app to it for her, and couldn't because you have to have a higher version of the Android platform in order to install it.  Not only does it not have a recent version of the Android platform, you also cannot upgrade to a recent version, so you're stuck in the stone age forever.  It does have Border's Books app, but frankly those guys are in the process of going under, and I don't want to buy her some content from them, only to be stuck with a few books in one format and a few in another.  I'm not certain if it can do Amazon's app or not.  The biggest problem I have with it, however, is the fact that it loses connectivity to the wireless on a regular basis.  I'm not talking occasionally, I mean that I have to fix the thing multiple times each day, because it can't figure out it has wireless connectivity.  Fixing it requires telling it to forget our wireless router, then turning off the reader's wireless, then turning its wireless back on, then choosing our router and crossing my fingers in the hope that I won't have to redo it because it just didn't take.  Nothing else fixes it, not even rebooting the device.  And none of that is in the user manual you can download from the internet.  Trust me, save yourself some frustration.  Spend a little bit more money and go with a real ereader, not this horrible little device.
