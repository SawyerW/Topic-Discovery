Pre-ordered in June base on the 13 perfect 5 stars reviews. Got the THrive July 8, tested daily. The stars are going away fast:First is the famous sleep issue, happens 7 times so far, sometimes, you can wake it up by holding down the power and volume bottons together for long time to cold reboot, other times, you'll have to open the cheap plastic back to remove the huge battery and put it back so to reboot, a painful & risky procedures. There is no firmware update to fix so far, this takes 2 stars away and will trigger a return if the fix is not coming soon. I use Toshiba products for 20 years, never had to suffer so much, shame on their slow engineers, maybe they got too much shakes recently?Second is the SD card, full size alright, but won't store any apps, nor can it be monitored by the tablet for its status, if you use apps like Kindle to store books and media they stay in the internal memory which run out quickly, those who buy 8 & 16 gbs will be sorry for this, those who buy 32 gbs will be sorry to see competitor Acer charges $120 less. There might be a fix for this I hope, but the 32 gbs is a must and Toshiba over charges for it is a must! This take another star away.Third is how bulky and urgly looking the thrive turns out to be, the back cover is not rubberized, it's cheap plastic, it's a lot heavier than others. The screen is so greasy that you are sick of it. Another star here.4th is the big HDMI is not a plus, is too tight and cheap, it broke the head of my 25 ft hdmi cable, $35 value. The USB doesn't read some hard drives. The camera is on the wrong position. Another star is gone. Toshiba is the only one doesn't give any full version games or apps for such expensive tablet. The last star is taken away by the fake pre reviews. The extra one star is for Amazon not for Toshiba!
