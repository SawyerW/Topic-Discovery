I waited until last summer. 2011, to finally buy a Tablet PC and after much research got my decision down to 3 products - iPad 2, Xoom and Acer Iconia A500.  I have friends that have the Xoom and iPad 2 and could only look at the A500 at the retail store.I chose the A500 because I liked the look and feel, good screen resolution and excellent picture quality when attached to a HD theater system with a 10' screen.  More important for me were two key features..First, the full size USB 2 was quite a surprise because I discovered that not only could I use it with a keyboard and mouse but I could load movies on a USB memory stick and access the movie player on the A500 without having to load them into memory or the microSD card, much less having to use iTunes which I just don't like.  I am able to use different types of video files easily with excellent resolution, including MPGs.  They also look great on the 10' HD theater screen.  I use the Mobo video player app which has extra codecs for MPG files,Second, I love streaming videos off the Internet direct to the HD TV using the Dolphin Browser HD.  My buddies iPad 2 can't do either of these two things.  He was kind of jealous as we watched Fringe in HD off the  A500.  I was considering a DVD player with Internet capabilities or an Internet TV box, not anymore!The Bluetooth works great.  In fact, my buddy with the iPad 2 gave me his Bluetooth keyboard he used with his iPad 1 because it would not work with his iPad 2.I got the 16 GB version and added a 32 GB microSD.  It also has a mini-USB port along with the full size one.  Having a mini-HDMI port was not big deal, I easily got a 10' cable that works great off eBay for around $5 shipped.It automatically updated to Honeycomb 3.2 when it became available, which works great.
