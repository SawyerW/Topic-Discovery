I bought the Archos 7HT with 8gb Flash memory in Jan 2011 and promptly returned it. Why?Pros: There's much to love about the Archos 7HT. Size, weight, features all wrapped into a fast interface. The high-def video is superb. The sound when listening to music is excellent, but only if you use headphones. The Aldiko eReader is top of the line and provides access to one of the best epublishers on the market: Feedbooks.  Last, but certainly not least, is the price point of under $200 making the Archos 7HT (seem like) a real steal; however...Cons: Although the Archos 7HT runs Android, you don't have access to the Android Market and the average user won't know how to get it. Instead, Archos gives you access to the Applibs Market which leaves much to be desired as the choices are very limited in comparison.  The real deal breaker for me, and the sole reason for returning it, is the HORRIFIC and unforgiving sensitivity when screen scrolling. It just doesn't work. Period.  While trying to move a page around or scroll through a list, it will open a menu or press a link that you didn't want. I nearly tore my hair out over this defect. I knew the scrolling was sub-standard before I purchased it, because of all the complaints about I read in the reviews, but I thought "How bad can it really be?" It's bad. Real bad. Believe me. There is no work around to this defect. Using a stylus doesn't help, nor does downloading an app, which was suggested to me. I loved the Archos so much that I tried everything to get the scrolling to work, but my efforts were for naught. It's almost like driving a car with a steering mechanism that doesn't work properly. It has a mind of its own and you never know where you're going to end up. Take my advice: Stay away from this product.Kudos to Amazon for their excellent return policy! Returning this item was effortless and efficient (and cost me nothing). Archos 7 Home Tablet - Tablet - Android - ROM: 8 GB - 7" color TFT ( 800 x 480 ) - Wi-Fi
