ok i have had all the other tablets ipads 1 an 2 plus the xoom and the acer a500.  this acer w500 beats them all with a true full web experience. i can have hulu desktop netflix , onlive gaming and steam. it all works. plus it can double as a work pc.Ok Since this is such a great product i figured to give a little more detail on why this beats all the other tablets.First is Power this tablet has tons of power compared to the Tegra2 and Ipad 2. I am able to play full fledge games like Tomb Raider Legend, Tomb Raider anniversary at 1080p, Yea thats right 1080p with everything just about turned all they way up.Second is this tablet does everything. Unlike other tablets there is nothing you can not do. I am a software developer and i can use my Eclipse compiler and an additional monitor and it actually runs.That said, all other chores are pretty easily done. I had an Ipad 2 and still have a Acer Droid but wll probably sell it because with this tablet there are no limitations.The keyboard docking station is nice if you want to get some work done like serious typing. It also has additional USB connectors for drives, xbox 360 controlls and evertything. else.Ok so the only draw back i have found so far is that web browsing is not as snappy. I think the reason is that it renders everying on the page versus the Ipad which does not support flash.Altough windows 7 is not a true tablet OS it does the job well. I think you have to get use to using the os on the tablet to really see how it works.Example if you want to create, close, or add directories just hold down on the item for a bit and you get a full menu of options. When you see this you are like yea no we can do anything.Other than that I would give this a look.
