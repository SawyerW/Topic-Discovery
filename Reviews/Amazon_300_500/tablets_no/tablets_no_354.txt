SELLER NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STARHonestly, I own the ipad 2 and I love it (AFTER I REPLACED MY FIRST ONE). But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their "brand new product" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me "oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.Basically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it. But if you're planning to purchase from this seller, PLEASE don't. Really. Do not get ripped off in the way I did. You are truly better off buying an ipad(any generation) for the full value.
