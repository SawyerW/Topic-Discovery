I've had the Le Pan TC970 for about 3 weeks now, and it's a pretty nice tablet pc.  It has a beautiful display, is fairly light, and has good battery life.  The processor seems well-suited for what I've used it for: email, Facebook, and Angry Birds!  I didn't experience much in the way of lag or delay, it seemed to chug right through whatever I threw at it.  The speakers are good, not great; I would have preferred the headphone jack to be on the side or bottom instead of the top.Now for my complaints:I've experienced some edge bleed, white light shining through at the edge of the screen.  Not a big deal most of the time, but always noticeable.  Could just be this unit, or it could be a sign of poor quality control.Doesn't play Netflix, though the application can be downloaded. I've seen previous reviews say you can manipulate the software to play it, but that's more that what the average user will want to do - or should have to do.  If the Le Pan played Netflix, I would have given it another star.It won't stay asleep!  Pushing the power button once will put the unit to sleep, but not power it off.  This is the way my other Android devices have worked as well.  The difference: The Le Pan will turn itself back on after a minute.  It can be sitting on a table, asleep, and it will wake itself up.  It's really just annoying, because it'll catch my eye and distract me - something I resolve by powering off, but it could lead to battery life issues down the road.Not a fan of the power connector.  I think they're commonly referred to as "10-pin connector", but being that the other end is USB, I don't know why they couldn't have just made it mini or micro USB for ease of charging.All in all, it's a good tablet, especially considering the price point. If you're looking for email, Facebook, & Angry Birds, I highly recommend it.  If you require a powerful tablet that can run Netflix, keep looking.
