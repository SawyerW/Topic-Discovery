I started out searching and searching for an Android tablet that my son would enjoy like he enjoys playing on my Android fone.  I was about to settle on the Coby Kyros, but I saw the reviews on the eLocity and found it $40 less than the Coby. (Microcenter Refurb for 129.00)  And since it's for my 9 year old son, I got the extended warranty for and extra 29.  So, 160 out the door.  Well I got it home it powered up.  No problem.  Got on the internet.  No problems.  Even the "Getjar" market is pretty good.  But it's not the Android Market.  So, playing with it for a week I found it's pretty very fast.  Uploads web pages almost as fast as my computer.  It has a camera but have not installed "Skype" to see if it works.  It does take pictures and video.  And, they're not that bad.  It comes preloaded with Flash 10.1 which was nice.  It plays music and movies glitch free.  With the update from the eLocity website, you no longer have to re-establish an internet connection when you wake the tablet up from sleep mode.  There is no real "pinch to zoom", but they seem to make it work some how.  Now here's the real kicker.  I found a patch that allowed me to install the Market and have complete access.  Now the tablet runs everything I have installed.  Even "Netflix".  I let the tablet run several movies and it lasted about 5 hours.  And at this point the battery still had about 1/4 left on it.  I would recommend anyone on a budget and fairly tech savy(know how to use google) go pick one up.  Even with the warranty, your still coming out cheaper than an Archos, Coby, or Samsung.  No, it's not a Samsung, but I can't seem to see what the extra 200 gets me.  Again, if you have iPad taste, but Android tablet money, this is great bang for the buck.  Now, the question is, how durable is it for a 9 year old.  I'll add the fifth star if it's still working a year...  No...  Six months from now.
