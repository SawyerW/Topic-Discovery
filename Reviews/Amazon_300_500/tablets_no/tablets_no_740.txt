I have been lucky to first hand tested many Windows (and Android tablets) for my company, we test them then rate them on a scale of 1 to 20 based on several factors. This Acer Tablet (W500) has far exceeded all the others tested. Here are the ratings placed on the tablets tested so far:Acer Iconia W500  =  16.8 (No pen input, nice but strange docking keyboard - should have been hinged)ASUS Eee Slate EP121  =  14.4 (Short battery life, around 2 hours)HP 500  =  13.5IQ10 Slate  =  12.9Fujitsu Stylistic Q550  =  9.3 (Oak trail processor greatly under-preformed - Was half the speed of the AMD C-50 Processor)Nav 9  =  6.5 (Had touch issues)My company is testing every tablet as it is released, they are test and rated then sold on ebay, in the next 12 months we are going to be rolling out a major upgraded. We will placed a larger quantity order for the chosen tablet, thus this is why each tablet is tested then sold. I wanted to write this review on the Acer W500 as it has been the best tablet we've tested to date and hopefully this will save someone some major moeny as you would need a huge budget to test all these tablets. The Acer Iconia W500 preformed well across all our test except HD Video playback, it hiccuped badly and lagged in played both content downloaded from itunes as well as streamed (Including Netflixs), speed measures were very close to the ASUS Eee Slate EP121 (which has the intel I5 processor). Battery life under heavy non-video playback was consistently 5 hours. I would recommend this tablet to anyone wanting a windows tablet today (of course there will be more offerings coming out but so far from my testing the oak Trail Processor is a flop (at least in the Fujitsu offering)! And most other offerings fall way short of the Acer W500....
