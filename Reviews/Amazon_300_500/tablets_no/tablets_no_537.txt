I reeived my CRUZ T301 on 1 Feb 2011. I was most interested in it as an ereader with some computing capability.Pros: As an ereader, it is great. I was able to call up all of the books that I had previously purchased and loaded on a Kindle. I was also able to download the Borders Kobo app and access books on their site. Good battery life too.I found that the browser was functional but not overwhelming. I could sign on to my webmail account and view emails of interest. I never intended this device to replace my laptop for email and other computing options.Cons: The power supply failed after two days use. I could not tether the T301 to my laptop to download apps directly to the SD card. I followed all of the instructions on the help file for tetherng the T301 to a a PC running Windows Xp professional, SP#, but still no luck. It also ceased to allow me to use a version of the "YouVersion" bible that originally installed and worked fine.Velocity Micro's support is my greatest concern. I contacted them re the power supply and the tethering problem. Five days later thay responded that I needed to email them a copy of the invoice for my purchase of the device before they could send me a replacement power supply. I emailed them the requested information. I never did receive any satisfaction on the tethering problem. Several days later, I teceived an emil from the support supervisor stating that I needed to return the T301 as well as the power supply before they could replace it. I might have done that but the deadline for returning it to AMazon for refund was rapidly approaching. So I told the support team to forget about it and I returned the whole lot to Amazon for refund.
