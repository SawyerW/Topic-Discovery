For a year I've been wanting to buy a tablet.  I waited for the Blackberry Playbook because of its  ability to multitask and I was not satisfied with the Ipad and Android models.  I am so glad I waited.  Here are the things I like best:  1) Its screen size is perfect.  I ride the train to work and spend most of that time on my Playbook.  Anything bigger would not be practical for use on the go.  2)  Full flash  functionality in web browser.  The Playbook truly offers an uncomromised web browsing experience.  This is the most disappointing problem with the Ipad, which can not utilize flash.  3)  The operating system offers intuitive gestures and multitasking.  The ability to flip between open apps makes using the tablet easy and fun.  It has the ability to do multiple things at a time, such as watching a movie and browse the web.  4)  Wifi tethering with my Palm Pre.  An additional 3G/4G wireless plan is not necessary if you have a smart-phone with tethering or a Mifi device.  I think it is ridiculous that cell companies want you to buy two cell plans.  5) HDMI video output.  Another great multitasking feature allows you to play video on an your TV via the HDMI output and fully control the Playbook with the video playing.My brother has the Ipad2, so I have had the ability to compare the two tablets side-by-side.  The Ipad2 is great too, but the Playbook works best for me.  Even without the promised system enhancements to the Playbook that will allow Android apps to be used on the Playbook, I think it is a great tablet as is.  I am looking forward to those enhancements, but I would not let that hold you back from buying the tablet now.  It just keeps getting better.About the button.  It is small and hard to press.  However, you should not have to turn off the playbook often.  I leave my playbook on at all times. If you want to restart the computer you can do it via an on screen app button.
