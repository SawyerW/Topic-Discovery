I bought 2 Toshiba Thrives 32gb tablets from 1SaleaDay in Dec 2011 and it came with Google Andriod 3.1 (first version ever). The 3.2 version was released by Toshiba in Sept 15th, 2011. The both units came with tons of problems. Toshiba Service Station shows the new updates, but the tablet do not update the system upon clicking 'update' to the latest version (3.2). Toshiba Customer Service is one of the worst, untrained people in the technology companies. They opened up my case # and told me to hold on any new 3.2 update until they fix their bugs in WiFi connection, Apps and other Andriod software related problems. They will let me know when this bugs were fixed..guess what?.. I never received any e-mail or call from even I called them every week.Wi-Fi sucks and goes off all the time. The apps turns off automatically and brings me back to the home page. Web sites suddenly becomes slow and then turn off completely. I have to switch OFF/ON to bring this thing to the life.  The battery life is no more than 5 hour. The sleep switch and volume switches are located on the side and you can not find them most of the time because of their black color and flat with the cover. iPad at least has this switch right at the front. The overall buit quality of the Thrive is horrible. It seems like made from cheap plastic made at the junk overseas company, assemble and tested by very unprofessional people.This Tablet is total JUNK..DO not buy any Toshiba Tablet products..at least my son and daughter have the iPad 2 with zero problems and best Apple CS (they have to fix Foxxconn issues in China though). I and my wife are really tired of this JUNK and decided to sell on e-bay at the half price. I will vever buy any Toshiba product and Google Android products any loger. Go for Apple iPad or Kindle.
