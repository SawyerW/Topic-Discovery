Ok I've read the reviews here and I am not amused... As a computer technician I know and trust Asus products without question,and with my recent purchase of the T91 my trust has only grown.First off for the yokels that bought this for heavy work loads... you're a moron case in point; with a 16 Gb SSD (solid state drive) and 1 Gb memory topped off 1.6 Ghz processor and a 8.9" screen did you really think that this could handle that kind of work load? And for the idiots that scratched the surface of your touchscreen with the stylus do you poke your wife or girlfreinds like that? If you do bet you spend alot of time "Alone".As a tech and a Sales executive for my own firm I needed a laptop that 1. I could travel with that wasn't to cumbersome (specially when I'm flying) and 2. when I was up in someones roof or in their wall fixing their network I could still have information and a great test tool at my finger tips. The T91 did that and never broke a sweat...if you haven't figered it out then let me spell it out for you..."I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!" My T91 has taken over as mission critical equipment in my work as a tech, I use her to trace network cables, shorts and hub problems. she connects to my test equipment and gives more information on the problems I face. Wireless interfarence and blind spots are no longer problems that bother me.So you want a good system to do a few things when you're on the road? want something not to bulky, enough speed to get info on the road, or you're a tech looking for a cheap alternative to buying high grade test equipment on a buget then look no further... The T91 in my opinion is a great buy and a great netbook / tablet.
