I Have a Apple IPAD 2 that I got for Christmas 2011, and a Kindle Keyboard 3G,+ Wi-Fi, 6" E Ink Display that I got for Christmas in 2010. Now I know the old Kindle doesn't really have the features of the Apple IPAD 2 but, My Kindle is going on two years old and I really stopped useing it when I got my IPAD 2.But,furthmore my Kindle is still not broke, damaged, nor has any loss of batterie life,but it's A totally different story when it comes to the IPAD....First of all I have got say I took extremely great care of my IPAD but, somehow within 3 months it started to show scratches of the back of it. Moveover, it about the fifth or sixth month of owning my IPAD 2 It fell of a three and a half foot table(on to carpet) and the whole screen just shattered, the charging port was also almost totally destroyed and the little circle button that which is 100% the most important part of the IPAD even working at all was destroyed completely.I Called Apple and Asked if they could possibly fix my IPAD 2 64GB oh yea which my parents spent $730.00 dollars for and guess what they said........no, come on keep thinking-_-....................... they said "for another $400.00 bucks we'll give you a new IPAD 2(the same one White/64GB)and we'll of course transfer the data from your other one to the new one." Well,as you could imagine my parents were't about to do that so I was and am stuck with a half broken IPAD and no way to fix it thanks Apple! It wasn't a total loss intil, I couldn't even use my IPAD anymore which happened about two months ago. Now since I can't use the Circle part of the the device I have to turn it off just to switch programs!! I end up now just useing my laptop for everything. I have IPOD and that's great but, APPLE's IPADS' suck badly. If your looking for a tablet for yourself or someone your shopping for, for the upcoming holidays I wouldn't buy a IPAD 3 but, a Kindle Fire HD or something; any will be better than a IPAD!!!WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY!!!!!
