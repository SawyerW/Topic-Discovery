I've owned this device for a couple weeks now. It is truly an amazing device. THe screen is beautiful, the Tegra dual-core processor enables very smooth video playback. I also really like the 7-inch size. I was going to wait on a Tegra 10-inch, but now I'm glad I didn't. This very light device is so easy to hold in one hand. Larger devices may prove to be awkward.But yes, there are some "doh!" moments. One of the strangest is the dark-on-dark buttons for Home, Menu, etc. As many have noted, unless you are in a very brightly-lit room, they are invisible. You kind of get used to guessing their positions, but it was a very unfortunate design decision. The second gotcha is the lack of Android Market access. An Android device without the Market is like a computer without the Net. You can use it, but most won't want to. However, Dexter at the XDA forums has a mod for the device that is very easy to install. Then you have full access to the Market. It was necessary for me in order to get back all of my purchased Android apps, such as Documents-To-Go Full Version. You should plan on applying the mod if you purchase this device. It is strange that Google and the manufacturers couldn't get together on this. Hopefully Honeycomb (Android 3.0) will resolve some of this. ELocity most likely will not release an update that allows you to use Honeycomb (or perhaps even 2.3 with the Market), but I can live with the folks from Xda for now - will send some cash their way!Pros:  Tremendous hardware - Tegra II CPU, screen, etc  Great size, feels sturdy  Good apps support with XDA mod.Cons:  Poor choice with invisible hardware buttons  Easy to run down battery if you are not careful with apps (as with all Android devices)  Must apply custom update from Xda to really use the device
