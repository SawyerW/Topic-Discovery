*****Update 1/23/12*****I have now had this table for almost two months I believe? Anyways, I went to turn on my tablet yesterday, and it didn't respond. I figured it was just dead because I do use it a lot, so I put it on the charger. Today, I tried to turn it on, absolutely no response. Tried to reset it: nothing. I am very disappointed in this tablet. I liked it, but there is no excuse for it not working already. I have not dropped it, and always keep it in it's case. Sending it in asap. Hopefully it'll be resolved soon.I got this tablet about a month ago and so far, I love it. There are a few minor issues with it, though.1. The tablet runs on the Adroid 2.2 OS, and from doing some research, I have learned it will not be able to be updated to the 2.3. Minor issue, but one worth noting.2. I've noticed that sometimes, I have to tap an app a few times or harder than normal to get it to open. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel the sensitivity should be a little better.3. It's pretty hard to get cases for this tablet because it is an "off brand." I bought a leather case for it thinking it would work, and although it was the correct size, I could not get to the home buttons when the tablet was in the case.4. The camera is only on the front. Which is great to use it as a webcam, but not so great if you want to take pictures of something other than yourself.Other than that, the tablet is great. Easy to use. It seems very well made to me, and worth the money.Works as well as more expensive tablets. Picture is good, and sound quality is also very good.Over all, definitely worth the money.
