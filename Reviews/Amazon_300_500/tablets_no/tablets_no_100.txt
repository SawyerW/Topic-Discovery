These machines are AWESOME! They are not for the serious gamer that needs a lot of intensive memory or extreme video. But as a good all around notebook with some pretty nifty features...It's da' Bomb! Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not new, but it has come a long way since then.The fan is typical and not overly noisy. The AMD chips tend to run a little warmer than the Intel chips, but not uncomfortably so. Want a hot running computer...try an Alienware Area 51 notebook....THAT'S HOT!Folks have given Vista a hard time about not being very good...well it's the best Windows out there! Stop downloading viruses, installing third-party freeware, etc. A general rule of thumb that I use is that if I want software that works well with microsoft...then get microsoft software! I do not use Norton, McAfee or any of that other junk. I use MS One Care and it has worked for me...no viruses, no phishing, no adware.The Tablet PC feature of this notebook is pretty cool. I can use it to edit pictures, make drawings, and take notes. The pen/digitizer is pretty good and the overall cost of the notebook itself is not to hard on the wallet.The screen size is 12.1"...take note of that all of you readers that are looking for LARGE SCREEN DISPLAYS. This is a small notebook. If you need a large screen look elsewhere. If the specs say 12.1" screem and you purchase this notebook, don't complain about the screen being small. Take out the stander ruler, hold it diagonally, and imagine that area filled with a picture. That's how small it is. Not too hard to figure out.Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not "new" but it has been taken to a new level.  Much like the iPhone and iPod Touch, you can do the same type of things with this Touchsmart notebook.All in all, this is a great notebook for school or small projects. Perfect for a student or someone on the go.
