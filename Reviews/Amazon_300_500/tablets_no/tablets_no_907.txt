I purchased this tablet for the main purpose of being a e-reader with added tablet functions. I have the iPad as well, but find that the iPad is too large to carry everywhere I go, as the iPad doesn't fit my pockets like a 7" tablet could.I picked this Galaxy Tab partially because of the Samsung brand name, of which I have had great Samsung phones in the past.However, this Galaxy Tab 7" GT-P1010 tablet has been nothing short of disappointing.This tablet needs to be rebooted at least 2-3 times a day, because it just locks up or decides it doesn't want to turn on, and thats when it simply decides to reboot its self.After contacting Samsung tech support, all they say is that there is nothing they can do short of me sending this device back in for them to review it.Different from the iPad, there are NO software/firmware updates made available to the Galaxy Tab GT-P1010. You cant even re-install the original firmware, because Samsung does not give access to customers the original firmware.That to me, seems like grounds for a class action law-suit. All computers MUST accompany access to the original OS be it by disk, download or purchase.This Galaxy Tab has NOTHING an end user could do short or sending it back in and waiting weeks for a decision.I have posted several complaints and negative reviews for this tablet on the Samsung Website, but mysteriously, my reviews and comments get erased, and only good reviews are posted.That, in it self is proof that Samsung is aware of issues with this product and is still willing to mislead the public into believing its current customers are happy.I am sending this product back for whatever they think they can do make it better, which is nothing short of an OS upgrade that Samsung has mentioned it will NEVER offer for this Galaxy Tab GT-P1010.I will be picking up another Tablet, probably the 7" Acer Iconia or similar that at least offers the latest Android OS, more ports (USB, HDMI, etc) at a similar price.I would like to donate this tablet but then I would feel bad for giving someone in need a defective product.Buyer, beware.
