I received this from my employer.Here are my observationsPros:LightweightPortableSurf InterneteReaderCons:Device is slippery - definitely need case or other backing or it could easily be droppedScreen can easily be scratched  unless you have a stand or some way of keeping it off your deskKeyboard is lacking tab, arrow keys,  switching between letters and numbers/symbols is inconceivable for a device you type on.  3rd keyboard for  special characters, keyboard covers up screen. During online chat the chat window from agent disappeared when I started typing.Making corrections to this review I can't scroll down to information I already typed.  No arrow keys,  had to preview then edit, the hit return then delete returns.Hard to place cursor between letters even using a stylusIn app store some games say they are free but eventually you must buy to continue.  Many of the thousands of apps are games and not many useful apps for business.Hard to scroll in form (like this on).  Every time I try to place the cursor I get a pop to cut, copy etcReading books hard because thumb placement on device can inadvertently turn pages or other thumb can take you out of book and to the desktop. Also must hold iPad to read comfortably.Battery life is okay but I expected more (been using for 2 hours am down to 63% from fully charged, now down to 54%You need a computer as you have to sync with iTunes.  Also, have not found a way to delete apps off iPad without iTunesNo USB ports, only expandable through mini sdLarge for everyday use and since back is so slippery is hard to hold securely unless you have a case.Conclusion:The more I use it the less I like it.This doesn't do much more than a Palm Pilot and the palm can fit easily in your pocket or purse, has onscreen keyboard, graffiti, wifi, sd slot, Bluetooth, real word and excel software, email, built-in calculator, eReader, music, etc.  Too bad they are no longer available except on eBay.However, if you want a 10" screen then a netbook is much more useful.  A real OS, flash support, large hard drive, screen can be adjusted for optimal viewing, USB ports, and the list goes on.  Portability is not much different and you can get a lot more for your money.  Price is another plus.I would never have bought this for myself.  As I finish this the battery is at 56%.  Typing this has been tedious and draining.
