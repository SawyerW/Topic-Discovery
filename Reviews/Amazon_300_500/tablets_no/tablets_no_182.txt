I have had my unit for a few days now. My first impression was that the build good quality and design. For what you pay for this unit its awesome. The screen is not the best I have seen, but not to bad either. The tablet is not super fast, but it does what its supposed to do ok. If I need speed I will use my laptop. It does not include apps like facebook or twitter from the start, but there is no problem finding the apk files on the internet and installing it on your own. Archos version of the market is tragic. It does not have much good apps and is badly designed. But again, you can find about any apk file on the internet.The biggest disappointment with this tablet is that even if it has 8 gb internal memory. You can only use about 30mb of this for apps. The rest of the 8gb is used for a virtual memory card. I was totally bummed out by this. I know this is a problem on android phones with older version of android. But this thing has 8 gb internal memory. Why could not Archos give us 200 - 300 mb for apps. There would still be much space left.The touch screen is a old technology and is not really responsive. So you must get used to clicking 2 - 3 times before something happens some times.Looks like most of what I write is negative. But for what you pay for this unit I still think its money well spent. If you're going to use this for basic web surfing, reading ebooks, watching videos and playing music, this is a good buy. If you want a tablet to have 300 apps and games installed on it, I would not go for this tablet. This tablet is brilliant for what you pay, but if Archos does not fix so you get more space for installing apps. This tablet will not be a best seller.
