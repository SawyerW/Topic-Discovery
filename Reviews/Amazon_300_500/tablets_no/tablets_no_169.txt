First the negative.  I would not suggest this product as your first computer or even your WiFi connected gadget.  You have to be able to figure out how to problem solve because this product is not as consumer friendly as an IPad.  It runs the Android Operating System 1.5.  If you don't know what that means, then I suggest you look for a product with a more familiar OS.  Won't play CNN or Youtube movies.  No camera, No G3. WiFi only.  It's not the fastest machine out there.  As a matter of fact, it's a bit on the slow side, so don't expect too much from this 7 inch tablet.Next I suggest you read a little bit about the product and its limitations.Now the good.  It plays videos really well and they look very good on the screen.  If you want to play home movies on the tab, I suggest you bump up the color saturation, but for most Hollywood movies they will look very good.  I play mostly divx encoded AVI movies.  Photos too need a bit more saturation to look good on the tab, but once you find the right amount, the photos look really good. Web browsing is fairly fast and most websites load properly.  I mostly use the tablet to read forums and read articles off of the internet.  The 7 HT is a really good ebook reader. It will display any non DRM epub book, so if you like to read the classics, there are a lot of books that you can download off of the internet for free.  The ebook really was a nice surprise.  It can also stream music with an app called Deezer. The speakers are just adequate for listening, but the 7HT has an earphone jack.The 7HT is a really nice machine if you can live with a couple of limitations.  One thing I could live with is the price.  It is $360.00 less than the cheapest IPad, and it will do about 90% of what an IPad can do.  Cruising the internet is fast and relatively easy with the 7HT and I find it to be the right tablet for me.  I will update this review if I find I have any serious problems with the HT.
