I had several things in mind when I got this tablet.  For one, I wanted a Windows operating system and not any of the newfangled stuff, since I find it very tedious to learn a new OS when I'm adept with an old one.  For another, I wanted several ports, including several USB ports, HDMI, ear phone.I wanted a very portable laptop for use within the house, with a built in keyboard, but the built in keyboard has proved to be less comfortable than using a $40 Logitech K400 bluetooth  wireless keyboard with a touchpad type mouse.  I can prop up the tablet with an old fashioned wire  bookstand  (like the $5 Fellowes Wire Study Stand), with the Logitech bluetooth dongle plugged to one of the two USB ports on the iconia.  The built in keyboard is fixed via pins in a rigid position of about a 40 degree angle, and somehow the junction feels fragile, though maybe it is stronger than I think. So if I were buying a tablet again, I would omit the built in keyboard.I found I did not like the touch screen method of operating the tablet, probably because my finger ends have large surface areas (many people have much more tapered finger ends with much smaller surface area, that helps to more precisely touch a small area of the screen, whereas my finger ends spread over too large an area often causing several icons to be pressed at the same time, causing all kinds of mishaps.I have found I can plug the tablet into our 42 inch TV screen, via an HDMI cable, and operate the tablet at long range with the Logitech keyboard, sitting comfortably a number of feet away, doing things like resolving factual questions on Wikipedia while seated with friends. This tablet gives a very good image on the TV, very clear, refreshing quite quickly.The Iconia also connects well with thumb drives and with external hard drives. It is not happy with the USB hubs I have tried so far.Overall I like it, though next time would save bucks by omitting a built in keyboard.
