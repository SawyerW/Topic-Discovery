I really,really love my Toshiba Thrive! Bought in early November 2011, and from the minute I fired it up,it has performed like a champ.I now take it everywhere with me. I'm lost without it! I didn't expect to like it so much. My friend has an I-Pad and mine is equally awesome and better in many ways! Love the rubber backing, easy to keep a grip on it 8-)  This is my second tablet, the fist being a Viewsonic G-Tablet. I really didn't like that one, the screen viewing was horrible. You had to look straight at it to see the picture, no angles, which made it impossible to play games where you tilt the tablet (like Bio-Ball)and watching movies was also difficult.And,it had to be rooted in order to get a decent operating system, Android Market etc. and I wasn't going there. And only a rear camera, and if you root,it then becomes disabled or so I am told.  I saw the Thrive and started researching- MUCH better! The battery is replaceable (huuuge plus for me), the viewing angles are ..well..EVERY angle is amazingly clear and sharp! It is faster, it supports way more apps,it has Market, Honeycomb, much better resolution camera (FRONT and rear, yay)and has built in GPS!!.. everything I wanted right out of the box! Of course I've added many more apps.Oh yeah, that reminds me, it has more connections & storage options than an I-pad or most other tablets- full size SD card (yay- hate those mini SDs, I lose'em), regular AND mini USB. Charges up fast and lasts about 10-11 hours.  I have not had ANY sleep/other issues, I guess that was fixed before I got mine. I use it every single day (Watch Netflix at lunch, or read a book or play a game, e-mail, shop on eBay-I thought I'd just mainly use it for books and e-mail but didn't imagine it'd be just so much FUN!  My hubby is getting one for Christmas so he will keep his paws off of mine! (shhh don't tell....)
