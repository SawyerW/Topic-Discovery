I really wanted to like it... my review of the tab after several days. i didn't like the form factor as much as i thought i would. i had played with the tab before so i was familiar with the size. it was heavier than i anticipated. the screen was fine, performance was fine. sounds was actually better than i thought it would be.now for the things i really didn't like. because it is wifi only, many apps are deemed incompatible, so will not even show up on the market. apps i wanted on here but could not load. google voice and launcher pro were the first two.the gps will not work without some data connection either via wifi or tethering. while i can tether to my phone pretty easily, it was a step i didn't like having to do. apparently you can buy copilot app that allows one to use this as a standalone gps, i simply didn't like it.lastly, i found that i simply couldn't work the tablet into my workflow very well. the main reason i wanted a tablet was to make me more productive with agenda, tasks and calendar. i didn't like the stock calendar and had difficulty incorporating the tab in keeping track of my tasks easily. part of it is that input is a little strange. i'm use to either a full sized keyboard or swype on a phone. the tab has a thumb only large keyboard, an in between size. while i found typing on the tab pretty good, i prefer either the full keyboard or a phone.at the end of the day, i think i like my old DX2 for taking notes on evernote, keeping track of tasks, and using gps. it's much smaller at 4.3", but i don't have carry another device and standalone gps is very, very useful for me.
