I purchased this tablet to use for showing my photography to potential clients, being that I am not a apple person, I looked into getting the Nexus 10 which had the best screen, however the trade off was the ability to use external memory, which to me is very important and that is not a feature the nexus 10 was missing. The is simple and easy to setup it does not have all of those bloated programs that usually gent installed by the manufacturer. The battery life is really good, The ability to directly use any SD card to copy, edit, erase pictures is excellent. I like how I can use the the tablet to look at all of the pictures taken with the camera on a bigger screen immediately. The downside is the quality of the LCD screen, is not the best as compare to the Nexus 10, Ipad 3 which have the best screen image quality currently available for consumers however this tablet has the Gorilla glass screen which makes it very scratch resistant just like the Ipad and Nexus among other premium tablets. There is some light bleed on the lower corners of the screen which is somewhat visible during dark movies and images displayed on the screen is not really noticeable. The internal storage speed for the memory card is average this is only noticeable is moving large files to the Tablet internal memory from a Computer not a big problem  I am happy with my purchase I only wish there was more accessory available for the Android tables since most of the accessories made are for the Ipad. This makes a great purchase it has dual front and back cameras with LED flash for the rear camera, the internal speakers sound great, the feel to the body of the tablet feels solid and light weight it does not get hot and it looks stylish.
