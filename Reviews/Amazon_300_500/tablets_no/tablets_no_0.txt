I was the first person in line at my local office supply store (Amazon didn't even stock this yet) on that Monday morning when the Nexus 7 was released in 32GB format. And boy was I NOT disappointed!This is a beautiful tablet and has everything one would want or need in a tablet: speedy processor(s); beautiful screen; easy to maneuver once one gets the hang of it (I am a former Ipad 3 user, and have more familiarity with the Apple OS). Android is a bit different, yet similar enough to pick up the basics quickly. I now am totally familiar with it and proficient in its operation.Yes, it's smaller than the Ipad, and that is a beauty and a curse. It is very lightweight and easy to hold for long periods of time. I have a bit of trouble seeing the screen at times, due to aging eyes and the sometimes-tiny print that can appear on some websites. Still, this thing is a beautiful creation, and I bet Google sells a ton of them.One advantage is that the Android OS updates almost instantly once Google releases it. Carrier devices (those sold by Verizon, etc.) can take weeks, months...or never...because the carrier has no interest in helping you prolong the use of your current phone...they have an interest in getting you into a NEW unit. I have already had two updates; first to 4.1 and now to 4.2.In fact, I have become so comfortable with the Android system I have moved to a Android-based phone (a Samsung Galaxy Note). For a former Apple guy, this is huge.All in all, this is the best small tablet in my opinion. I haven't seen the Ipad Mini...and for nearly 80 bucks additional for it...and way less storage to boot...it isn't compelling to me.You won't be disappointed in the Nexus 7. I am very happy with mine.
