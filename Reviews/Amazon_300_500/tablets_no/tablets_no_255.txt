I bought this tablet in feb 2012 as refurbished.  I got it in a few days and have been using it daily ever since.  I went with the xoom after a month of searching and comparing because it was a very solid higher end tablet and my laptop was on the way out.  the xoom has a high def (barely) rear 5 mp video camera as well as a 2 mp front camera (great for skyping).  both cameras work quit well and i have no complaints about them the rear camera has a really bright flash and I use frequently as i have a toddler.  Speaking of which the rugged design has come in very useful since he likes to drop it on the floor and otherwise bang it around.  It has an aluminum case and gorilla glass front so no cracking or scratching (we have laminate over concrete floor).  The 32 gig memory means I have plenty of mem left (20) after installing 36 programs.  The graphics are fantastic games play very smoothly.  I use the wifi exclusively and have xfinity 15 meg internet.  It is verizon enabled I just don't subscribe.  Videos play well.  Overall it is very responsive to my needs.  I purchased this refurbished for $351 and got square trade 3 yr warranty for $83 so I ended up with better warranty for a cheaper price then buying new.  Also the battery life on this is fantastic!  I can play a game for over 7 hrs before it says I should plug in (screen on game actively played) also I never turn wifi off so it is constantly sending, receiving and updating while playing games.  The only real drawback for me is the power cord.  It is bottom center so you can't rest the device on you while reading or playing certain programs.  (some programs don't change screen orientation).  So to sum up great value higher end tablet that is very rugged and versatile.
