I returned my Kindle fire 8.9 after a single day due to no Google market.  A few days later I was at the mall with my girlfriend and I saw an add for the Nook hd and Nook Hd plus NOW WITH GOOGLE Market. It was enough to draw my attention in.  Once inside in saw another sign for the heavily reduced price tag on the Nook Hd and nook Hd plus. I thought man for the price of the one Kindle fire hd 8.9 I could get myself two of these nook hd with cases for about the same price.So that's what I did! I got my self the smoke (grey)  and my girlfriend a snow(white)  with two flip sleep/wake cases for under 300$. The screen is super nice full 1080p with the highest ppi on any tablet.  The only tablet that can compete Round the same price point is the nexus 7 and that's still 199$.With the addition of the Google market they have turned their nook Hd into a full fledged android tablet for 129$! That is a steal for a tablet this good.Beware of the 9 inch nook Hd plus.  Even though it's the big brother of the 7 inch nook Hd it still has the same processor and it shows. The plus is sluggish while the7 inch is zippy with very few lag issues. Not sure why this but beware it is noticeable.Over all we love it! Nook Hd does everything the Kindle fire hd does for the e readers PLUS more with the addition of the Google play store.If you want to change the way the original nook operating system looks for a Google nexus 7 look then I would suggest the nova launcher in the play store. Can't go wrong with the Nook hd 7 inch for 129$.
