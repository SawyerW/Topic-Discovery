Hunted this down for a month, then bought it on Feb 2nd, 2011 when it was released...This tablet is very snappy. On STOCK OS with no mods, it benchmarked at 1950++. My EVO, also @ 1 GHz benchmarked at 1250 and later 1550 once rooted and overclocked on a custom ROM. Quadrant Benchmark test is not made for Dual Core processors. Android 2.2 is not made for Dual Core processors or tablets. I doubt either of the previously mentioned are made for an ASYNCHRONOUS CPU!Speed is excellent. Battery life is not the greatest, but once a custom ROM is put on it with 2.3 or higher, it will be much better. It takes a FULL SD card. I don't know why "micro sd" was noted above, but technically it can take those as well. (Who would want to use slower micro when you have full)Video recording is awesome as well. Great sound and quality. Video chat on the 3G network was NOWHERE NEAR as choppy as my test June 2010 on Sprint with my friend's HTC EVO and mine.Already looked up and compared the upcoming HTC Flyer and was not happy with the fact it didn't seem to have flash on the camera and Gorilla glass wasn't mentioned- 2 HUGE selling points for me. VERY STURDY as DELL products are- compared to the flimsy quality of SAMSUNG.Dell stage is nice, but I'm not one for software already "customized," and every widget does take from battery life. WIFI Tethering is built in, so rooting it currently has few advantages. I'm not sure if ADW launcher or the rooting procedure did, but it would no longer save any data or even do a master clear.10" tablets are ludicrous and you can't type on them.  I can lie down and hold this with one hand without it falling on me.
