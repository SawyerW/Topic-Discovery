I just got my new Thrive and I believe I'm in love. I have been playing with it for a couple hours, never had a Droid system, not to bad at all. I started out with an HP Touchpad because it was great deal on sale, and just to see if I would even like a tablet, now I really liked the tablet thing, especially for traveling. I got my husband a Ipad 2 for Christmas and is it not my favorite, matter of fact very last on my totem pole. I love the operating system, I love the size of the tablet (for typing), love all the ports and SD card slot. Not  much that bigger, but just enough for a much better experience for a tablet. Can't say enough, will you keep you updated.UPDATE: Jan. 4, 2012, I have found something I don't care for, the sound system. I have been messing around with settings and can't seem to get rid of the box/cheap speaker sound, does anybody know something I don't. My HP Touchpad has great sound, and so does my husband's Ipad. HELPUPDATE: October 27, 2013, I still hate the sound system, but the Thrive is really an awesome touchpad. I hate my husband's Ipad, I gave away the HP Touchpad, piece of garbage, good thing they stopped making it. I thought about buying the new Excite, but to many bad reviews.  I love the negative reviews on the Thrive, some are just plain stupid, like the one where the battery went out 14 months after purchase, be glad you can buy a battery for  $15.00, most just go bad and no fix, just buy a new one. My husband has had to replace his almighty Touchpad and Iphone a couple times and I have had my Thrive with "0" problems and it goes with me everywhere.
