This is probably the first time I ever did this, but I stood on line about 1 1/2 hours, day 1 & got an iPad when it first came out. I've had it 12 days now & I can honestly say it rates 5 stars. I've got an Ipod Nano, but haven't ever used a iPhone or iPod touch, but was able to feel comfortable using it immediately.I sold my laptop on ebay after I got the ipad and although it doesn't do everything the laptop does it covers most of the bases, and does it better. For example, if I wanted to use the laptop it would take 3 or 4 minutes to boot up (Windows Vista) & another minute or two to find the wifi connection in my house. The iPad takes literally about 2 seconds to turn on & I can  be on the internet within 5 seconds of turning it on, it always has the wifi connection. The battery does last about 10 hours as advertised, my Acer laptop would never last much over 2 hours.The ipad is extremely fast, just a little slower than my 2 year old desktop. Using your hands to get around on it is natural & Apple's touch screen works so much better than my Samsung cell phone.The keyboard is easy to use to hunt & peck, I don't think you can do touch typing on it, but it works fine for most purposes, e-mails etc. The biggest negative I can find is sometimes you hit the wrong thing with the touchscreen, it's just not as accurate as a mouse, somtimes it's just lazyness I don't want to enlarge the choices before I make them & hit the wrong one.Overall I'd sell my laptop & buy the iPad again in a heartbeat.
