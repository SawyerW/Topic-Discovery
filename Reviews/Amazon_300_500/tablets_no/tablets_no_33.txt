I ordered an ipad from another retailer online and they refused to ship it claiming it may be a fraud order and then someone recommended this and it was cheaper so I bought it. I really like it but because it is fairly new there is not as many cool apps and features like their is for Ipad. Everything I do online this Nexus does not work with, but it does work with Ipad so basically I have to buy an ipad now, instead of spending $700 I just have to spend $950.I can say that this little nexus is great for a portable device to take with you on the go. I bought a small case with a built in keyboard and kick stand so I can use it like a mini laptop, the case was only $14 on amazon. If I owned an Ipad and had to take it on the road I would be on edge, but this device is perfect for that. You can fit the nexus and case easily in an over-sized jacket pocket. I can stream netflix anywhere there is a wifi connection and I can watch live TV on filmon tv from the internet. This is an awesome device for traveling. I bought the 32G so I can download stuff and watch it offline, perfect while traveling. The speaker is pretty good too, I was streaming grateful dead from archive.org and the speaker sounder nice and clear but it was not loud. Listening with the headphones the sound was very, very low and it would be tough to listen to anything in a fairly noisy place using the headphones because the volume on the low side. I was surprised at just how low the volume was when I cranked it up. I would say this is the main drawback, definitely not a headphones listening type of device.
