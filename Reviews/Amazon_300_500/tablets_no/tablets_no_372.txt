UPDATED MARCH 5, 2014I am starting to hate this more by the day!! This is WIFI only and well, my WIFI is constantly disconnecting!! It's not just my home network, but anywhere I go!! Thought maybe it was just me, but is asked hubby how his was since I bought them both at the same time last week, and his is doing the same thing!! Ugh...ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm an Android fan and when my Android crashed, I decided hey I'll buy not one, but two of these things!  Ugh...my hubby loves it, I hate it :(Pros:It is super fast!The battery life is unbelievable! Hubby played games for three hours straight and lost only 20% of the battery life!  I spent hours downloading apps and using them and had the same result. I've been using it non stop since 7am and it's now 10:30am, played my games, used Facebook and a few apps, and now reviewing...I'm at 75%. My android would have been dead long ago as well as the other cheap tablet we have.Cons: my opinion keep that in mind...It's too much of a hassle typing when you're used to a smaller screen. I'm a very fast typist, and this thing is just too big for my liking. Did I know the size? Duh! I may return it for a smaller Android though. If you need a large screen, this is perfect! My mother in law and hubby love it, but again, if you like the smaller screens, it's hard to get accustomed to.Takes FOREVER to set up! Omg, you have to create an IPad ID, an Apple ID, confirm this, confirm that, ugh...Finding apps seems to be mission impossible!  I go to the store, they aren't there!  But if I go to the browser and search, it gives me the Apple download and then I get it. So where the heck was it hiding??All in all, this is one of those 50/50 deals, either you're an IPad lover, or an Android lover. If you love Androids, don't bother. If you love Apple products, it's probably a must have!!
