I bought my girlfriend a Galaxy Tab 2, which is an amazing tablet. I used hers a few times and decided that I wanted a tablet too, but did not want to spend another $350 dollars. I started to search for reviews of cheaper tablets and ran across this LePan 2 tablet. Decided to give it a try. I am very pleased. It does everything that her Galaxy Tab does. Just as quickly and flawlessly, I might add. Her and I sat side by side and loaded the same videos and programs at exactly the same time.. There was little to no difference in the speed. Other than small very small differences in picture quality, I find this tablet very comparable to the Galaxy Tab 2. The picture quality is excellent and HD. Just when comparing it to the Galaxy Tab, side by side, The Galaxy picture is a little sharper, but I think I only noticed because I had them side by side with the exact same video playing. It loads youtube, netflix, HBO Go and any other video from any other site that I have tried flawlessly without lag. The battery life is great and the tablet speed is great. This tablet is easily comparable to tablets well out of its price range. I know that many of the reviews on here talk of issues upgrading the software. I did not have this issue, but mine was already upgraded when I purchased it, so I cannot speak of the ease or difficulty of this action, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone. If I had to complain at all, which I am just knit picking by saying this. The power button is a little small and while the sound quality is good, I wish the speakers were on the front like they are on the Galaxy Tab. These are very tolerable issues, but worthy of mention.
