I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation. I am a gadget girl who luvs Apple products. Honestly speaking, there is such a small difference between the 2nd and 4th generation ipads its not worth the upgrade. If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.To sum it up1st generation- good for a kid2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.Now if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.  The iPad has several things that are custom to work with iPad and don't function the same on the samsung tablet.  If i couldn't have the iPad I would definitely have the samsung.The ipads, all 4 are being sold here for more than it is at the apple store. Amazon used to be my go to place for all apple products but it is a bit ridiculous that a dented,scratched and cracked ipad is being marketed for more than retail or same price as it was when it came out #GMAB maybe the price will come down after Christmas.
