Firstly there are good and bad points to the acer like any other computer however there a sense of individuality. Being a graphic designer the sensible thing to do would get a Macbook pro.....but i don't care for the OS,and i do believe that you pay for the apple logo more than anything, the good points to the acer iconia 6120 is for me the virtual keyboard i can type on it as fast maybe even faster than a normal keyboard and the touchscreens are smooth and really very responsive-Good Points- virtual keyboard for me is fantastic- Acer's software runs well and is very helpful nicely designed also- not as heavy as anticipated still very manageable- Beautifully design with the metal plates on either side as champagne color and the gloss black around screens and very well designed software by acer along side windows 7 (i would say however to leave at windows 7 upgrading to windows 8 proves a struggle)- Very, very very fast!!!! 2.66ghz with intel turbo boost to 2.97ghz (3ghz)its a monster, yes you do get the first generation i5 peocessor but it works, and I've read with 2nd generation the only real improvement would be battery Life but i'll address later in the review....Bad Points- battery life is poor but taking into account the two HD 14" Inch touchscreens it's not bad i can get 3.5 hrs with work on microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop.- sometimes it will ghost type it will freeze for about 10 seconds and then little touch indicators are in a fraction of the screen but this happens maybe once every week, i have noticed however that tilting the screen fixing the problem when happening.Overall i would give the Iconia 4 Out Of 5 brilliant design and i really useful tool for my studies, just loosing some points for some problemsthe advice i can give if you can afford it is buy it give it a go, i wasn't disappointed and yu shouldn't be the only alternative is the toshiba libretto but after trying it it lacks feom the mite of the acer iconia 6120...and if your still unsure wait for any advancements in this technology there are only two of this kindo and they won't be the last this i think is how future laptops will be like, this then is genesis..
