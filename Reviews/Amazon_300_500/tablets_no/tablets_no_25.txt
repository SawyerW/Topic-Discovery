I have owned various Android phones and an Asus Transformer Prime tablet. I've also used other tablets by way of friends and clients, such as iPad 2 & 3, Galaxy Tab 2 7.0" and Galaxy Note. This Nexus 7 is by far the best I've used. While I loved the drawing capabilities of the Note, the resolution is the same as the Nexus 7, so the pixel density isn't as good. Anyway, my Nexus 7 has been fast, responsive and problem-free for the couple of weeks I've owned it. My only issue, albeit minor, was when I first opened the package and noticed that one corner of the backplate had not been completely snapped into place. I gave it a quick pinch and all was well. But it did leave me wondering about quality control at Asus, especially after my horrible experience with the Transformer Prime. Despite that, I continued on and soon began wondering why I hadn't bought one sooner.I'd always thought that 7" would be too close to my Galaxy Nexus phone's 4" screen and thought, "why bother?" And after using the Transformer Prime, 10" seemed perfect. But now that I have the Nexus 7 in my hands and using it a LOT, I understand why it is so beloved. Part of the reason it works well is because the most popular 10" tablets are the same resolution as the Nexus 7 (although that is changing rapidly) and so you are getting the same real estate as a 10" tablet but without the bulk. I can hold this thing easily in one hand and if I put a case on it, will still be able to hold it the same way.I've ordered a case and waiting for delivery, but not even sure if I'll use it at this point. The Nexus 7 is easy to hold and use as it is. My only concern is safety, so the case may be a good idea.
