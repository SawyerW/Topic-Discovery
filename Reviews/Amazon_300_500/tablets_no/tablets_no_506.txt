This is a nice entry level tablet for it's price.While it doesn't use the standard Android Marketplace it does have access to a wide variety of apps.  And there are many other sites on the web where more apps can be found, though for that you will need a computer with SD card for transfer.Took about 25 minutes worth of tinkering with it's internal settings, and my router settings to get the WiFi set up.  Though it does have a fairly good interface for that.The touch screen is very responsive, and you only have to use minimal pressure to get your point across.  It does come packaged with a nice extend-able stylus that has a screw on end-cap lanyard.  Which is a bit on the small side, but nicely portable.  The built in case for it is nice quality.  Held in place by 4 small screws it is removable for those who want to use a different case.  It does however double as a built in stand for hands free video watching.(By simply flipping the top back, and placing the outer clasp back into the holder.) Built in speaker isn't too bad, but a bit on the small side, does get a bit crackly when you max out the volume.On board memory of only 4 gigs is a bit on the small side, but plenty of room there for all the apps you might need.  A secondary SD Card should be used for storage of other media files.I can't rate it's HDMI output, but if you're buying a tablet I'd expect you're not going to plan on tethering it much anyhow.I have found it works great for video watching, music, and even comic book reading by using the right apps.  I will say that it takes some tinkering with the system setting to get it to behave the way that you might expect it to.All in all a good bargain for a tablet that isn't a no name import knockoff.
