Hardware:The design of the iPad is exceptional with smooth curved edges and elegant textures of soft-touch metal. One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.Software:iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and "productivity" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.Overall:It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen. For the price, this is a good buy.
