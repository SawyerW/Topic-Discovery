I purchased this item a few months ago, and it already broke. I called both amazon and the manufacturer, and none will help me. Now i am stuck with a broken archos 43 that wasnt even worth buying in the first place.The device cannot handle 90% of the apps on the android market, as it comes across a problem with multi-touch (which it does not have), force closing, lag, or just about any other problem you can think of.The lag does not just happen with the apps, but the home screen as well. When changing the orientation of the device, it takes several seconds, sometimes minutes, for the apps to come back to the home screen. Most of the time i am staring at a blank screen with no apps.The wifi capabilities of this device are next to none. Do not expect to be able to have a connection unless you can physically see and touch the router, or it will be out of range and will constantly disconnect. Not being able to hold an internet connection is by far the worst problem this device has.The camera quality is horrible. Do not believe their claims of "hd" video or photo. In fact, the quality is so bad that barcode scanner apps do not work.I loaded about 14gb of music onto an sd card and tried listening to my music, but only 10% of the music shows up on the music app! To listen to the music, you have to go to files, and select each music track individually.Basically, if you need to download apps, connect to the internet, use a camera, listen to music, or have a device that isnt force closing everything, do not get this. If you want to be extremely frustrated and literally throw money down the toilet, then this is the device for you. It does, however, serve as a great paperweight.
