I am giving this 4 stars for being what it is...a tablet for $130, not an ipad...My MAIN purpose for this purchase is to use it for my 1 year old to use as a video player during long car trips until he is old enough for an iPod touch like my older kids have.  For this it is excellent...it will even repeat all or one of the videos.  He liked it.  I bought a zippered pencil box at an office supply store for $3 and it fit very snugly in it.  Poked to holes in the top and used a ribbon to hang it from the headrest. The battery lasted 6 hours + with constant video playing.  Yes, it did get hot, but that isn't an issue as he's not touching it.  I don't think it got hot enough that it would damage anything.As for the the rest of it...I did put a firmware on it that does have android market.  I got my gmail to work without any problems.  I use it at home as a recipe book (yeah, my husband think's it's an expensive recipe book) and it works well for that--better than my phone or net book because of small size or too much bulk.The screen is very resistive.  that makes typing on it a pain.Netflix won't work on it.the one i got said 70HB on the box but in the box was 70BHT...with Eclair on it, not cupcake.  Not that I know much about android, but that might matter to someone.  It did make a difference when updating the firmware, so check before you do.For me, it affirmed that I do not want to switch from a netbook to a tablet--and if i did, I'd probably go with an iPad because I am more familiar with the way it works and already own apps for my phone.
