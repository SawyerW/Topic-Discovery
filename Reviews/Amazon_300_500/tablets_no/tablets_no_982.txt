Everyone talks about the Ipad having more Apps... it has more apps because the Browser does not support flash and plain doesn't work. I got sick of my iPad when I had to use my Samsung Charge Droid phone to do what my iPad could not. The iPad has more Apps cause every website has made an app because they don't want to lose businness from the iPad crowd. So I sold my iCant...Enough complaining about my iPad, the Xoom was great as well, but I wanted to share Movies and already Had some I got from my Droid Charge. So the Zoom got auctioned and I got the Galaxy Tab. I noticed there was no Facebook App, why... cause the website works perfect right from the browser. Picture uploads, messaging... yeah there's an app for that, its called the Browser!Runs snappy. Lighter than any 10" Tab on market including the iPad2.Battery is better than my Xoom, slightly worse than my iPad.Screen is Vibrant and great for Movies. Easier to transfer movies if you download "Kies" for your laptop.Speaking of Laptop, I cannot believe that using an iPad requires you to hook up to a Computer 1st! That is just stupid. Both my android Tabs were surfing the Net right out of the Box, no Laptop necessary.Also, updates come Over The Air (OTA). Updates happen pretty quickly as well. Updating my iPad required plugging into my Laptop... again... The download took forever, the Backup took forever, the install took forever.Now all that said, the iPad still has a place. It is much better for younger people and the less Tech Saavy. The interface is dummed down (just icons)... I bought my Kids iPhones and myself a Droid Charge for instance.The update to The Galaxy Tab brings Honeycomb 3.1 but not 3.2 like the Xoom. But it adds the Media Hub that the Droid Charge uses, so the Movies I got for my Charge are now on my Tab, WooHoo!Camera works really good front and Back.But for me, having an uncrippled browser is most important.
