I have owned the Fujitsu 4220 for 3 years.  I also have a new Dell XT2 (long story, my IT department is on a Dell service contract, enough said).  The Fujitsu is awesome, I cannot recommend it more highly.  It is fast, bright and strong screen, has all the features (wifi, USB, PCMCIA, firewire) that you would need.  If you are looking at Fujitsu tablets and weighing the pros and cons of the 4220 and its progeny, I highly recommend you get a tablet like the 4220 with the swivel screen and built in keyboard.  You need the keyboard, and its completely hidden and out of the way when you swivel to tablet mode.  With the extra battery in the second bay, you can get up to nine hours which is great, but the Fujitsu batteries like all batteries lose charge capacity over months and years of use.  I rarely use the DVD drive and most often have the second battery inserted into the DVD bay.  This is a very tough computer, I have had to wrestle it from the hands of a theif and it hit parking lot pavement but is absolutely fine, I was very surprised the screen had no damage at all.  I bought 3 stylus thinking I would break or lose one, but the stylus are also very durable (compare to Dell) and the stylus slot right on the front of the screen makes the stylus hard to leave behind.  I would change only two things about the Fujitsu:  (1) it could be a bit more sleekly designed, its plastic case is tough and flexible which is a great benefit, but the titanium casings on some of the competitor products really look much better, (2) the chips run hot when I have a lot of processes working simultaneously, hotter than my Dell.  This causes the fan to run a lot, its variable speed and at highest speed you can hear it (not noisy, you just know its on), and when it is on your lap it can feel a bit hot (great in January but not so during other parts of the year).
