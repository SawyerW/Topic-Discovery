So far I think this tablet is great.  I can't compare it to other tablets because I've never used one, but so far I'm impressed.  It even has GPS and it works!  I only have a few minor issues so far. I pulled out the small cover to get to the SD card and couldn't get the cover seated back as securely as I'd like. In addition, be careful that that you actually turn the tablet off when you're done by pressing the On/Off button and it asks you if you want to power off. It seems that it will go into standby mode (you can set the timeout for this) but it looks as if it has turned off.  You have to push the On/Off button to get back in. I drained the battery by not doing this. (At least that's what I think happened.) I also don't know how to block websites that I don't want my children going to. I'm hoping there's a way to do this.If you noticed in the section above about other items to purchase, there is a USB keyboard for around $25.  Do Not Buy It!  I ordered it and when it came I noticed that it had a USB-A plug and the Le Pan has a 30-Pin port. (I did hook the keyboard up to my desktop and it didn't work well. See my review for it.) I thought that I might be able to use an adapter or converter to get around this, but I emailed Le Pan just to make sure.  I was extremely impressed that they replied in only 2-hours and politely.  Here is the reply:Unfortunately, external USB devices are not compatible with the TC970. If you wish to connect external devices, they must be bluetooth ready.  Thank you.So, at this time, I am very happy with the tablet and Le Pan's customer service.  Just be careful with accessories.
