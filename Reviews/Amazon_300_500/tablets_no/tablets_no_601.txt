The Dell Duo (Atom N550 Processor 1.5 GHz) is a netbook and having a swiveling touch screen doesn't transform it into an IPad killer. That said, except for the battery life, I like the Duo.  The Duo is a solid little computer with programs like Word and Excel starting quickly.  I don't expect to use programs like Photoshop or Premiere on a netbook, at least not without a lot of cursing.  Dell Stage, the touchpad interface, is amazingly slow.  Although attractive, it should be disabled as soon as possible. Shoe horning a touch interface into Windows 7 just doesn't work well. So far my experience with battery life has the computer dying before the 2.5 hour mark.ProSolid constructionNice keyboardAttractive screen320 GB of storageNon-slip surfacesGood performance (for a netbook)That cool swiveling screenConsHeavy for a netbookTouch screen sluggishPrice premium for touch screenLimited screen view anglesA 3 hour battery and no way to swap batteries?  Michael Dell, I'm telling your motherRight now, I can't see any real use for the touch screen.  The first few times I swiveled the screen was a LOT of fun, but I haven't found a killer app for the touch screen.  Navigating Firefox using my finger was amusing for about 5 minutes.  I did appreciate that if I didn't touch the right spot on the screen, there was a little white crosshair that showed where I DID touch.  The touch screen was teaching me how to use it!  It was telling me, "Not here, stupid."  I still can't tap in the right spot without a stylus, but the little crosshair is quite amusing.The Dell Mini 1012 netbook sells for $449, weighs a 1/2 pound less and has a claimed battery life of 9.5 hrs.  That's 25% cheaper with a 300% better battery life than the Duo. No swivel screen, but the math is compelling.
