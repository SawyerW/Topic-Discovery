The absence of Adobe means I cannot retire the windows system yet. It is not Adobe but the producers of products and the cable company offering only those products.Now that we got rid of the only negative, if you have an iphone the learning curve is nil. A few exceptions; the Safari screen is a tad different. Some apps are grainy in the 2x mode. Response time can be a tad slow in comparison to other devices on the same Wi-Fi.I actually played with dedicated book readers before the purchase of this device as that is the primary goal. The top reason for iPad 2 over the readers is the viewing surface. Oh sure on a reader you can pick you r font. However you cannot pick your screen size.  As long as this is my reader of choice I though "oh well why not make it the computer as well." So being familiar with the iphone there would be almost no learning curve.  I picked the max memory (not that I will use more than a fraction of it) just because if for some reason I wanted more in the future  I would not have to worry if it was upgradable or not. I intend to use the blazes out or this iPad 2 until the technology no longer exists. So far I have only used the Wi-Fi part as one little security password and it was actively accessing the net.  Will pick 3g if traveling is in my plans.  So far there are just too many free hot spots. I may be over planning but it gives me peace of mind to know this animal can communicate with both systems and has plenty of memory.Mean time I am having a great time using this system primarily as a reader.As a reader this by the way does not require Adobe Flash.Owning an iPad as playing around with its potential remids me of the saying form `four quartets' by t.s. eliotWe shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.
