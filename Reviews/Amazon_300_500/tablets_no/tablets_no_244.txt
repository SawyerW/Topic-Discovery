As others who have posted reviews I own both the IPad and the Xoom(WiFi), the IPad was purchased this past Christmas and the Xoom recently when the WiFi version became available.  Firstly and most improtantly I am a convert and no not ot Apple but to the whole Tablet PC idea, I believed they were just another electronic toy and served space between a Smartphone and Laptop.  They are in fact little PC's and can serve up a good PC experence and take up little space in the process, they are reasonably quick and with the right Software should be able to perform most LapTop functions reasonably well.  Course were not talking raging speed here but more than adequate for most task and easliy capable to surf the web, chat, e-mail etc.Rather than to discuss my preference for Tablets I'll just say up front I like the Xoom, the Operating System, Performance, and Unlike Apple delivers a overall better experence if your looking for a complete product versus one that has been Nutered and all the decisions made for you what is and is NOT important, then the Xoom is your Tablet.  All the basics are there and those not working yet will be during the Update process at some point, as for the IPad some of these Basics are NOT there and will never be possible even with furture Updates.  In short what may be trival now could be the difference between a true Laptop replacement or one that partially replaces it and Annoys you when a Function doesn't work cause someone said you can't have it.Of course there are things that the IPad does better, the Screen on the IPad is Spectacular but on the flip side the Xoom is Beautiful (no deal Breaker here), The IPad is simplistic, you know the difference between what is and is not and who makes the decision ( a personal decision)!  I don't think either of these products is a bad purchase and for doing Basic PC task they are both equally adept, but one has the makings to be a real PC the other Does not.Good Luck.
