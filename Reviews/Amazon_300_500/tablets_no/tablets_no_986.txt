IPAD vs. tab 10.1 will come down to your preference. ( I also own IPAD 1 currently)- IPAD pefected features that are made avaialble to you but those features are limited and Apple won't allow user's freedom to use it otherwise.- Galaxy tab provides much more flexibility to users but on each available key features, Android is perhpas not as good as or better than Apple (damn close though)Having said that here are the pors and cons of Tab 10.1 after using for 3 weeks plusPros:- Flexibility, flixibility, and flexibility!- Multi tasking: so easy to switch between apps- Lots of media format suppots, Adobe Flash support (Again flexibility)- Web surfing: I will take this one any day over IPAD2: Flash support makes huge difference. Web surfing on original Galaxy Tab was choppy and pretty slow. This one works just fine.- No S/W needed in host PC for file transfer (vs. Apples iTune). You can delete files directly from the Tab 10.1 as well.- Great display. Lightest among Android tabs- All the Google services (i.e.: email, maps, nav) feel really native and are much much better than Apple- Customizable widgetsCons:- S/W is somewhat buggy here and there. Not hugely critical but still bugging me once in a while. (It feels like the product was launched 3 months before it was ready. Willing to live with it and I hope next firmware will fix most of bugs)- Seems to heat up more than IPAD. With a protection leather cover on it and 2 hours of Youtube, my Tab 10.1 got pretty warm and I had to remove the cover.- I was expecting that this device will support 720P mkv format (Original Galaxy tab did). The 10.1 doesn't and I can't believe it.- Micro SD slot is missing- I want screen rotation lock-up button. This bugs me a lot- Swype keyboard is missing. Android smartphones typically have thisOverall, I would give it 5 stars with the hope that next firmware update will fix some minor S/W bugs.
