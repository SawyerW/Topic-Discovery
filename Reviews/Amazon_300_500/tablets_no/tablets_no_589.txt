I have had this for about a month now and I love this tablet. Yes out of the box it is a bit slow, OK the viewing angle is a bit peculiar for a company renowned for their monitors (but this is only an issue when looked at horizontally) but this is an amazing tablet for the price. I consider myself an average computer user and I was able to port the tablet in about 30 minutes. There are directions at xda-developers that anyone shy of my mother can understand and perform (my poor mother is still looking for the "any" key on her old dos based 386 machine!!). After rooting to Vegan the machine screams with efficiency. No matter what I throw at this thing I can't seem to slow it down. I travel with it, I use it to teach SCUBA classes (on the surface of course), I use it at work, play, for music and games. If I had one complaint about this unit (I actually like that the monitor washes out from odd angles, no one looking over your shoulder) is that it is a fingerprint magnet. I am in the processes of putting on a screen protector and skin to help with the fingerprint issue, hopefully that does the trick!! Look for a review on the Skinomi carbon fiber screen protector and skin in the coming weeks to find out how it went. Oh yeah I almost forgot, my girlfriend threatened to leave me after the first week I got this because I could not stop playing Angry Birds for hours on end, I literally played for four hours straight on a flight to Detroit, two hours on my layover and two more hours to Buffalo and still had over 25% battery life remaining!! This thing is awesome!!
