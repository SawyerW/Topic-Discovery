I've had this for 3 days and not played a lot with it so far, but felt like sharing the cost factor for people looking into this kind of a PC laptop.I bought it from Amazon, because Lenovo's site would take upto 5-9 business days to ship and I had to travel with this. It is indeed a better deal for my requirements after all, read on :) .First of all, this is an IdeaPad and not a ThinkPad, hence it is designed for home users and not enterprise.This laptop has >> 166 MHz Atom Processor, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB HDD with 8 Cell Battery > $478 (no tax and free shipping)Lenovo has the following standard packages.A. [2 models different colors] Same Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB HDD with 4 Cell Battery > For around $399 (if you use a eCoupon found on the internet) + Tax and Shipping. Hence around $450To match this deal, you would need :a.1. Replacement 2 GB RAM (since there is only 1 slot), Note: Atom processors support only upto 2GB. Add appx. $50.a.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.Total -> $590B. [1 model ] Better processor 183 GHz, same RAM, same HDD with lesser 4 Cell Battery > + Cost + Tax and Shipping > appx $480To match this deal, you would need :b.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.But since it ships with 2 GB standard, we can take the difference upto $30.Total -> $510I had 2GB RAM from my 17"-HP-paper-weight so worked out best.PROs* Its mostly-exactly what was expected.* I like the touch-pad, I may not care for the multi-touch, but the feel and behavior is good.* The construction material is good, given that I have never used an IdeaPad, my "ThinkPad" expectations were not shattered (yet).* I configured the VeriFace and VeriTouch, they are cool (considering they are slow but they work).CON(ishes)* The wireless connection keeps dropping, this may be an issue with my tablet (I have 4 other computers at home and none have such issues),  hope it gets resolved soon.* "HD ready" is mis-leading, there is no HDMI connectivity.* The bloatware on the first start is annoying.* The McAfee takes up a lot of space, I uninstalled it.* The OS (Windows 7 Starter) is a pain.* If you run on batteries the laptop will run slow because of the power settings.No comments on the touch yet!For the price its awesome, I am beginning with a 4 star, perhaps more to come.
