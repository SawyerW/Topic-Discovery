I love it but it has some annoying downfalls.  These include the lack of Flash Player and the limited ability to print.  The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.Although printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.The GOOD stuff:The really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.iPad vs Kindle.Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the "go to" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.***********************3G and GPS Chip.I am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the "settings", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.***********************FaceTimeThe Jetsons technology is here.  Works well enough but video can be a little choppy at times however I can't complain about the FREE video phone calls.
