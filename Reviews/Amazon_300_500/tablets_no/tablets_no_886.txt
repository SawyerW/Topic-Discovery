This review is for the ipad mini 16GB Wi-Fi in blackI bought this ipad mini for a birthday present for my wife, she has one of the original nooks for reading digital books and an ipod G4 and she wanted a device that would eliminate having to use the nook and ipod, the ipad mini is the perfect solution for this! I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.
