The acer iconia is a superb tablet...It supports USB which is a great thing.. I can use my keyboard with it.. Moveoever I can transfer data easily using a flash drive..Even the mini SD is a major benefit.. :)Although 3.0 was a bit slow, after the update to 3.1 i am really enjoying it.. It made me change the 4 stars to 5 stars.. ;)The Acer Customer Care is also very kind and polite.. They assisted me with the update when i was facing problems..Comparing it with the Ipad2...RAM (256 iPad) 512 MB iPad2 vs 1 G AcerNo USB port iPad2 (need external sd/usb adapters *) vs USB port AcerNo SD Card slot iPad2 (need external sd/usb adapters *$29) vs SD Card slot AcerNo HDMI output port iPad2 (need external adapter $39) vs HDMI output port AcerNo Camera flash "bulb" iPad2 vs Camera flash "bulb" AcerCamera Rear less than 1 MP (0.92) iPad2 vs 5 MP AcerCamera Front less than 1 MP (0.7) iPad2 vs 2 MP AcerSpeaker 1 iPad2 vs 2 Speakers AcerNo Browser Tabs iPad2 vs Browser Tabs AcerNo Adobe Flash Player iPad2 vs Adobe Flash Player AcerRequires iTunes even for file transfers iPad2 vs Normal file transfers - USB, SD card, etc. AcerCarry On: Tablet + 3 adapters (USB,SD,HDMI) iPad2 vs Tablet only AcerScreen 1024 x 768 iPad2 vs 1280 x 800 AcerI am in total love with this tablet.. :)Comparing it with the Transformer..U don't get USB unless you buy the keyboard doc.. So spend another 150 bucks for that.. Thje acer is going to run any keyboard and mouse with its inbuilt usb..Comparing it with the Thrive..U don't get those looks and no LED flash.. But thrive has the advantage of full SD card and HDMI as opposed to the micro HDMI in acer..Zoom and Galaxy tab are way too expensive and have no USB or external memory..The only let down in the Acer is its screen..But I would say all in all its the best tablet.. Totally love it.. :)
