I have been looking at tablets for MONTHS!  I have been to every store in town that has tablets trying various brands while comparing specs.  I finally had to stop myself ans ask what AM I looking for in a tablet?  What will I truly use it for?  When I realized what my uses were, I thought WHY spend a ton of money.  I want a big enough screen to be able to surf the net, get apps from android, read on a bigger screen, watch a movie on a road trip and play games without waiting 5 minutes per screen load.  As you can see, nothing too fancy, just every day normal usage.  This price was perfect.  This tablet has all I want and then some for under $300!!!  I hope Amazon doesn't mind that I got tired of waiting for them to stock these so I ordered mine from Best Buy tonight.  I did have to pay more because of shipping and tax but patience isn't one of my better virtues!  It will be here in 2/7 or 2/8!!The biggest thing that stands out to me as a concern is the 30 pin connector vs. other tablets.  The main reason I didn't go with the Ipad months ago was the lack of an sd card for extra storage.  Yes it has cloud storage BUT that doesn't help if I don't have wifi access.  With an sd card, I always have my files available.I will update when I get my tablet but I am VERY excited about my purchase!!  Now to decide on a case for it......UPDATE (2/7/12):  I have received my tablet.  Let it charge and proceeded to check it out.  I absolutely love this tablet!  I have had no problems with wifi connections, downloads/installs from the market were very quick and seamless, games are flawless, no lag so far etc.  The clarity is amazing.  The only problem I have encountered is that my husband was watching while I was playing with it and now he wants one TOO! lol  I highly recommend this tablet.  You can NOT go wrong for the money!
