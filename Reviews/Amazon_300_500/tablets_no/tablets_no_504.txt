This review is for the Coby Kyros MID7015 Android Tablet.  After purchasing several tablets before the MID7015 I owned the following: Apple Ipad (8mths), Archos 70 (2 weeks), Coby Kyros MID7005 (2 days), Sprint Samsung Galaxy Tab (29 days).  I returned each of these for various reasons.  The Ipad was too big, the Archos was very buggy, the MID7005 was too under powered - yes I opened the unit to find out why the battery only lasted for ~2hrs. I found it only had a 1250mah battery - smaller than the average cell phone.  I returned it back to the store, in fact a reviewer here may have mistakingly referred to me on his amazon review of MID7015.  I then got the Samsung  Galaxy Tab - loved it but quickly learned it was crippled in multiple ways for US customers.  Returned it during the 30 day return period - I felt ripped off after paying a high cost premium for it and then having to pay the monthly fees on top of it all.  Then I started reading reviews about the Coby Kyros MID7015.  Picked up one from a local Kmart, rooted it and installed the app market.  I am very pleased with this device.  It does everything it is advertised to do and more once rooted.  The price right, the size is right, battery life decent and there is no monthly contract.Let's be clear the MID7015 is not in the same league as the Ipad and Galaxy Tab but it fits my use case just fine.  Email, texting, Evernote, Sugarsync, Web browing, online blogging, online shopping, online banking, social networking, watching a few TV shows, basic gaming, reading books, watching YouTube videos, printing and limited office documents review/creation.I am quite satisfied with my Coby Kyros MID7015.In fact I am writing this review from the MID7015.
