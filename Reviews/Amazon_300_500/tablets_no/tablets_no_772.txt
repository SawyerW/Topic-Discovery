Ok, lots of complaining out there. First off, you get what you pay for. I paid $199 for the tablet, not $500 or more. So, my expectations were realistic. Yes the screen can be a little difficult at times and occasionally when you put the device to sleep instead of turning it off, it locks up and you need to reset it which is a pain. However, I turn it off every time I am done with it and I haven't had a problem with the screen since.It reads Amazon books, Borders format, PDF etc etc. I watch AVIs on it all the time on the plane. I download TED conferences onto it and listen to them also. Screen picture is great, video isn't choppy unless you watch a huge HD movie. I've had issues watching HD movies that are 4GB in size. Smaller movies, say less than 1gb work perfectly.I can shop on Amazon for books, it downloads the books instantly and I am reading in under 60 seconds.My kids use it and love to go on the Android app sites and try games. Yes, some games don't work, but I am guessing that would be the case regardless of which device you purchase. The game / app may not be written for your device.It doesn't have a camera or GPS. WHO CARES! Really, I didn't buy it for that. I bought it to read, watch movies, store some family pics I can look at when I travel and maybe play a few games. For that it is fantastic and would purchase another one in a heartbeat.Like anything else you purchase. Figure out what you really need/want, and what you are willing to pay. Don't purchase it, and expect it to compare to an IPAD. Seems obvious, but so many people complain after buying a device that is 30% of the price of others and insist on comparing it as if they were apples to apples.
