I purchased this tablet with the objective of replacing my Sony PSP to watch movies. I wasted my money. Do not buy this tablet.About five minutes after I started using the Velocity Micro T301 tablet (after allowing it to charge overnight) the screen went blank. The bottom line is that I ended up sending it back to Velocity five times. Each time it was returned, the same problem occurred - the screen went blank. I could not turn it off nor turn it on. About the third time I sent it back, Velocity indicated to me that they had replaced the item. However, when I received it back, I checked the serial number to find that they had not actually exchanged the item. The last time I sent it back, I demanded that the item be replaced and indicated that I had written down the serial number so they could not BS me.I few days ago received the item from Velocity...Well, they had replaced the tablet, or at least changed the serial number on the tablet. This time I was actually able to use the tablet for a full day. When I returned home that night, I plugged it in to charge it overnight. Guess what? The next morning, when I tried to activate it, the bloody thing won't turn on. At this point I have given up. I've turned it into an expensive door stop.However, the Sony PSP keeps working. I've never had a problem with it and I can watch movies, access the internet, and play games. I've owned it for years. I also own a Sony Touch e-book reader and I've never had a problem with it either. I've taken the hint and just purchased a Sony SGPT112US/S Wi-Fi Tablet (32GB) through Amazon. I figure that since my other Sony products have worked flawlessly, this one should too.Do not buy this tablet. You will regret it. If I could, I would give this tablet no stars.
