This device is capable of replacing a few items I keep on me most of the time. I've been able to replace my phone (You really need a headset for doing this) I use only Bluetooth. The internet access as a hotspot, both wired and via bluetooth has replaced my mobile EVDO router. I've also stopped service for my cell modem in lieu of my data plan for my phone. It hasn't quite replaced my GPS. I'm still waiting for a suitable mount to do that.Pros:It can be used as a phone, albiet a large oneIt can be tethered as a hotspotIt's a decent GPSIt's Android basedIt's not locked to a service providerAppealing price for the quailitydecent audio playback quality from the speakersCons:The keyboard is not the best. It's large for the screen real estateNo Flash player.poor positioning of the USB and headphone jacksThe processor is slower than competitors modelsSure would have been nice if...Someone would make a hip holster for itthere were a flash for the camerathere were a video out portOverall, I've been satisfied with the Viewpad 7. Many of the applications I have for my iTouch are available for Android phones. There have been a couple glitches. The memory card had spontaneously erased and unmounted itself a couple times. The battery thought it had 1% power and kept beeping at me all day when it had a full charge. The unit locked a couple times and had to be reset. (btw, the reset hole should at least be big enough to use a paperclip-IMHO) On the other hand, It's been the best PDF reader around. Most documents I use are PDF's and I found that when I open them from an email, it goes into my documents for offline reading. That's been great. I've used it as a hotspot at least once a week. (Thank goodness I have an unlimited data plan)Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recomend it to friends? Absolutely.
