First off it took a month to get to me, which was irritating. But that wasn't the issue when it got here. I had ordered one from Walmart a month and a half ago and had the WiFi issue that some other reviews had talked about, so I sent that one back to Walmart and ordered this one from Amazon.  Hoping I couldn't get two lemons, I was anxious to get it because I loved everything about it except for the WiFi issue.  Now that I got the one from Amazon now it still had the WiFi issue, but current reviews displaying a WiFi fix helped for the most part, the speed test results improved, but watching YouTube videos didn't improve so I figured it was just the YouTube app and was gonna keep it.  That was until I tried the GPS and Bluetooth.  I have a Bluetooth keyboard that I got from Amazon that states it works with Android. It paired fine, but only stays connected for a few seconds and disconnects.  The Le Pan 2 I got from Walmart I got to work with the keyboard after a little tinkering, but no such luck yet with this one.  Then the GPS.  The Le Pan 2 from Walmart was able to use the GPS without any other wireless connections.  This one I have now from Amazon only works with some other wireless connection.  I don't get it?  I guess I was just unfortunate and got two lemons like another reviewer mentioned earlier, and now I'll probably be sending this one back as well.  I want to try ordering again, but I'm getting tired of waiting and shipping charges, back and forth!  I really really wanted to like this, because its a great product with what does work on it, but its frustrating when all the features it should have don't work properly.
