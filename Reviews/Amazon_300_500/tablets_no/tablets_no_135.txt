I am surprised at how much I am using my iPad.  I expected to use it mostly for movies, pictures and email, but I have had it for a 3 weeks and am using it all the time.  I also have an iPhone and some have call the iPad a glorified iPhone.  In some ways it is, but it does much more, although it still can't make calls.  I find it easier to use, and of course easier to see, than my iPhone.  I downloaded an application that allows me to view and edit Microsoft Office Exel and Word which now has made my old computer start to collect dust.Yes, there are some websites I can't view completely due to not having Flash but so far, it's been a minimal issue.  The iPad is easy to turn on and off and to set the airplane mode when flying.  I bought a few extras to go with my iPad, such as a case with an adjustable stand and a bluetooth keyboard.  Both are necessities to me.  And of course the apps are plentiful and useful.  My only caution about the "free" apps is that many aren't really free.  They might be a 30 day free trial or you need to upgrade (for a fee) to make them work best.  They often don't tell you that in advance, or at least I didn't read far enough in the description.  I did download a hidden object game and really like how easy it is to enlarge the picture on the screen. I haven't uploaded my iPod yet, but it will be nice to have my music on my iPad when I'm traveling. I can also download books from the Kindle onto the iPad which will save me from carrying another device.Overall, the iPad is getting used much more than my laptop computer.  I just got back from a 3 day camping trip, and the only electronics I brought was my iPad.  I have the $25/month plan from AT&T; so I can either use the AT&T; 3G or any public wireless to connect.  I highly recommend it.
