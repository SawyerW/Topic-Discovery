I bought this iPad for my two sons who are 5 and 3 because I was sick of them changing the settings and doing weird stuff to my laptop even with windows live family safety installed. This was my best purchase of the decade. The parental controls are amazing. I have Safari, iTunes, App Store, etc. all disabled. They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it. When we do leave the house and are away from WIFI they have plenty of content to keep them happy, esp in the car on long trips.I have an iPhone so I haven't use it for myself yet. If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard. However, I just installed Windows 8 on my PC and I hate it so much I am considering selling it and purchasing an iPad for myself.I'm also saving up to get one for my 67 year old daddy whom calls me weekly asking me how to get the sound and video back working on Skype and how to get back to his FB page on his laptop. Some people just don't need a lot of settings to control!
