Mine is the 64gb version. It's rapidly becoming a replacement for my laptop (I'm typing on it right now).There are still things that I have to connect it to the laptop for that should really be able to be done via wifi - iTunes syncing, batch uploading PDFs, syncing photos to and from the iPhoto library. These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.It should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.The virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.The battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life. Again, not really a limitation on the iPad, but something for users to be aware of... I've labeled mine "iPad only" just to be absolutely sure I don't hurt my other equipment.The front facing camera is pretty low quality. As a camera intended to be used for video chat, thats ok.The rear facing camera is pretty low quality.  As a camera intended to be used for actually taking pictures, it's pretty inexcusable.This is where they lost the star in my rating - I can get around the other deficiencies with iOS apps and by connecting to the computer, and just by being careful, but there's no overcoming a built-in hardware limitation like this.
