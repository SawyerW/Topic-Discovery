I originally bought a first-gen iPad 3G, and was--eventually--very happy with it. I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't "magic" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)When Apple brought out the "retina" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T; 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.For three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.The iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful. (Thank you, Google, for keeping Apple on their toes.)I look forward to upgrading to a refurbished  "retina" iPad when Apple brings out the next generation. But for now, the iPad 2 is terrific.
