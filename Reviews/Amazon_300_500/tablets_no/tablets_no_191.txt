The Lenovo S-10 is a great little PC if you can get around its quirks.  Keyboard is bigger than most netbooks and has a really nice feel.  I haven't used the quickstart yet much but it seems like a useful feature.  It comes with Windows 7 starter (not the full blown Windows 8) but that seems to do everything I need -- I don't really care if I can't personalize the background on my netbook!  Some people complain about the built-in mouse pad.  I don't really have any problem with it.  If I'm going to do a lot of "mousing", I use a little USB-connected portable mouse.  The two "quirks" that I had trouble dealing with are the power button and upgrading the memory.  The power button is located on the outside lower left of the screen -- exactly the place where it seems I naturally have a tendency to want to grasp it with my left hand at times.  I was continually shutting the machine down until I reconfigured the system so that the power button "does nothing".  The power button still turns the machine on and will turn it off if you hold it (for an emergency shutoff) but this prevents the accidental shutdowns.  The second quirk is trying to upgrade the memory.  You can go to 2GB (from the original 1GB) and the memory is super easy to remove and replace.  But what kind of memory works seems to be one of the best kept secrets of the universe!  The users manual says it takes DDR2 memory -- WRONG!  Obviously an outdated users manual.  It takes DDR3.  After two unsuccessful attempts, I called Lenovo Tech Support.  Although they originally said you couldn't upgrade the memory, when pressed, they finally came back with a list of two (only two) models of memory that were guaranteed to work.  One was a Hynix and the other a Micron model.  I finally located the Micron model and it did work (although it appears to be the same specs as the Samsung one I tried that did not work).  Now that I finally have the S-10 configured the way I want it, I do like it.  But it took a while!
