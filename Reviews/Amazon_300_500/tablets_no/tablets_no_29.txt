When getting ready to purchase this tablet, everything about it looked really great. I like the physical design and size. The software used is really great. The fact that it is Google makes it even better, especially for syncing purposes. The problem = there appear to be a large number of defective models in existence. The primary issue with my particular device is instability when it comes to tracking my fingers. This has become so much of an issue that it basically renders the device useless. I bought the device to use as a quick reference with PDFs and other documents, and also to search the internet; the stability issue makes it very hard to actually scroll through documents and typing using the 'swype' function is virtually impossible; additionally, the screen frequently experiences 'phantom touches', causing inappropriate clicking and accidental mistakes. Forget any sort of gaming. Warranty services provided no help. Further research into the issue seems to indicate this is the result of a grounding issue that affected many of the Nexus 7 devices.Likes:- Physical design & size- Software design & syncing abilityDislikes:- Large # of defective models - results in touch input instability- Warranty services: To no avail, I went through a long period of communication with warranty services to try to fix the issue. They finally suggested that I mail the device to their warranty center, which I did and which resulted in $20 out of my own pocket. When I finally got the Nexus back, the only thing that came with it was a sheet of paper that summarized the complications I stated in my claim; there was no indication as to any solution they tried to implement, or if they attempted anything at all. The defect remained unresolved and communications from warranty services ended.- Processing: The device seems to run slow pretty often; however, this may be partly secondary to the grounding issue mentioned previously.
