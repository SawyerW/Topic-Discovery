The Archos 7 Home Tablet is a decent surfing device if you're looking for something with a larger screen but don't want to spend a lot of money.  I have an iPod Touch and was looking for something larger for surfing.  This device is by no means an iPad and I knew that going in.  You are able to multi task such as streaming Pandora or iHeartRadio while surfing the web.  I use the Touch for some games (which I haven't played on this) and apps, but found myself more often than not wanting a gadget for surfing the internet that had a larger screen.  This device is also an excellent e-book reader and has an app where you can download a TON of free books!You can play Youtube videos if you install Skyfire.  The video quality is excellent and speakers sound good.  The app library is not the full Android Marketplace and it would be nice if it were able to access it.  You can find apps around if you're patient and don't mind messing around a bit.  I upgraded the firmware to a newer version first thing (it will erase any apps you had that didn't come with it so do it if necessary right away before downloading too many apps.)I wanted to experience Android and for once get in as an early adopter of a tablet rather than waiting.  The resistive touch screen interface can be tricky but you get used to it and can swipe, just not flick like the i devices can do.  If you buy it (and for the price if that's what you're willing to spend I say do it) just give yourself a few days with it before deciding if it's for you or not.  Engadget said you get what you pay for and I tend to agree with that statement.  I was willing to spend what this gadget cost and I'm good with it feeling comfortable that I have a nice surfing and media device with a larger screen.
