I had high hopes that the Coby Kyros 8125 would turn out to be a bargain, or at least an acceptable compromise. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work well enough to be usable.The good: Unlike other reviewers, I actually liked the screen. It's an 800x600 4:3 display with a resistive touchscreen. After owning devices with resistive touchscreens and capacitive touchscreens, I prefer the greater accuracy of a resistive screen with a stylus. The resolution isn't quite as high as on my Nook Color, but frankly my eyesight is not as good as it once was, and I actually found small text to be more readable on the Coby. The resistive touchscreen has a texture that is not terribly pleasant on the fingertips, but it works as well as a capacitive screen with fingertips, and is far more precise than a capacitive screen when used with a stylus. I like the exterior build quality as well: the tablet looks nice, and the controls all worked well. The overall speed and responsiveness of the system is good as well, it is not at all sluggish.It is a medium gray, not black as stated in the product listing.The bad: First, the screen orientation sensor does not work well, so that it was frequently at the wrong orientation, and turning it off locks the tablet into landscape mode, not portrait. That's something I probably could have learned to live with. Battery life appears to be poor, hardly better than a laptop. Worst of all, the wifi is abominably bad. It doesn't even function reliably, and range is poor as well. Even a few feet from my router, I couldn't get it to function long enough to download apps. For a device like this, that's a show-stopper.I'm returning the tablet in hopes of finding something with a similar screen, but better function.
