If you are an audiophile who collects 24-bit music, and are chained to your desktop at home to listen to it on your high-end headphones, this is a great portable solution.  This tablet contains a high-def audio system, so you can set it to 24-bit, 192kHz and enjoy all your studio-quality music with your headphones.  I have this tablet paired with a Headroom Airhead portable amp and my Sennheiser HD 650 headphones (I didn't spring for an 800 model yet) and the setup is great for when you're mobile!  There are very few portable solutions for 24-bit audiophiles, and this is probably the best solution.  You can leave your 24-bit files in its original FLAC format and play it back at full quality.There is 32GB of onboard memory, which a small portion will be used for the Windows 7 that comes installed on it, but the rest is free.  An SD memory card slot, along with 2 USB ports are available.  I have a 32GB SD card, and at this point, if your wallet allows, you can spring for a 128GB card.  With 2 USB ports, you could have a total of 3 SD cards running (with additional SD card readers in those USB ports) or just carry your music on a portable hard drive and plug it in.This is just a heads-up for 24-bit audio enthusiasts.  I'm not too keen on HiFiMan's portable players, as they seem to downsample the music to 16-bit.  I don't like iPods and while the Cypher Labs audio module for the iPod may be great, the module costs more than this tablet.  Aside from this tablet, my only option for high-def audio would be a Sony M10 digital recorder, which has a memory card slot and uses AA (or was it AAA) rechargeable batteries, but all my music would have to be converted to WAV for use on the player.  This tablet forgoes the conversion and allows more memory cards to be used.  It's bigger.  But this shouldn't be a problem if you're a serious, sit-down-and-listen kind of audiophile.a BIG recommendation for audio fanatics!
