I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who has had both a Thrive and an iPad 2...and now have the iPad 2 again after returning the Thrive. I'm sitting in a recliner typing this review on my new iPad 2. I mention this because that's what I'd come to know from my tablet experience, and it just wasn't the same with the Thrive. The Thrive is very feature-rich, and Honeycomb Android very slick. I won't dive into the features, because you can find those on the product page and elsewhere. There was simply just too much going on with the Thrive for my taste. Android is one thing, but the widescreen and accommodating the ports into the device on the thrive translates into a larger device, making typing out something like this review more of a chore than you would think playing with the device in the store.. For the time being at least, I have a Motorola Droid Bionic Android phone. Navigating through the Bionic in the palm of your hand with a finger or two...not so bad. Navigating through an Android tablet - tedious in comparison. The iPad is clean and smooth experience all around. My opinion - if you're looking for all of the features that set the Thrive apart from the iPad as well as other Android tablets, then you probably should be looking for a laptop. No need to mention the differences in the App market, other than to say that I'm a musician and Android just doesn't have much for musicians. If I were you I'd check out the apps before settling on an Android Tablet. If you're on the fence with iPad on one side and Thrive or other Android on the other, just scratch the iPad itch. Trust me...it won't go away.
