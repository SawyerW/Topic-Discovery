While I did not by my g-tablet from Amazon, I bought it from an office supply place locally. It is loaded with bugs, and it doesn't have FLASH installed, and I am still looking for a way to get it installed (might have to root the device). It doesn't use the traditional Android Market Place, it has its own. The only thing I am using it for at this time is to listen to Pandora Radio. This is also the worst version of the Pandora Application I have seen; but it was on this devices market place. There have been at least two updates applied to the device. It still is very clunky, in that it is slow to context switch and to respond to key presses. With each update it does get a little better; but this thing feels like a generic port of the Android 2.2 OS. I have a Droid Incredible (un rooted) and it is far superior as an Android device. The other annoying thing is the default application/desktop/wallpaper, maybe again with rooting it may be possible to change the settings, and get the traditional Android Market Place. After I first powered the device up I had it get into a situation where the browser would crash all of the time, and this thing is heavily dependent upon the browser. The situation was fixed by doing a hard power cycle, and it hasn't acted up since. The display on this thing is bright; but a very limited viewing angle, maybe +/- 45 degrees of perpendicular.This thing has a lot of the specs to be a top notch tablet (except the display); but that is if the manufacturer puts some resources behind updating and adjusting the port of the Android OS. It feels like it was intended to be something like the Sony Dash which costs a lot less money. As a owner I hope it gets better; but I would not recommend this to somebody wanting a device like the iPad. For somebody wanting a android toy to hack on, this could be the device.
