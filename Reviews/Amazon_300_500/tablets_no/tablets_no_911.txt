I've used this device for 7 months now, and I'm disappointed. From the beginning, we were promised an upgrade to a faster, smoother Android operating system, Honeycomb, but we never got it. Apparently Samsung splotched up this product as a competitor to Apple, reduced the amount of RAM for the equivalent 3G models, and just gave up on this model when newer models came out, forgetting about the hundreds of thousands of people who forked over the 350 to buy what they thought would be a good product.I initially bought this product because I hate the whole idea that Apple has cornered the industry on Tablets, and I wanted to just use a decent device to read ebooks, surf the web, play games, and send emails. I initially liked the easy drag-and-drop quality to this device, and the kindle app worked fine (which is what I use this device for 70% of the time) but the iPad has that too.After using it for a week, I realized I didn't get what I paid for. The operating system was slow. If more than two programs were run, the device slows down. It crashed on me a fair few times, at least a few times a week, and I used it for about 10-15 hours/week. Multitasking is a joke, almost as much as the operating system. I thought initially that the poor operating system for this device was to blame, but almost all android devices have the same problem. When I played around on an iPad 2, I noticed a difference of light years. First, you can run multiple programs (scores of them) and the multitask function on the iPad doesn't slow your OS down. More RAM. Better functionality. No hangups or freezes. And more apps.So for those who hated Apple as much as me, put aside your hatred for just a few minutes and play around with an iPad. Then, save up about $186 (currently this is listed on sale as $314), and get the iPad 2. I'm not an apple fanboy, and I have a PC, but this is my honest opinion of this product.
