The Archos 7 takes some figuring out. It's mostly not that difficult to set it up, go online, that sort of thing, thanks to the very helpful instruction booklet anyway. However, as many have said, its best use is for watching videos. Trouble is, your videos have to be the right format. That means you may have to convert some of them by getting a video conversion program. As it turns out, there aren't many videos I am able to convert, either. It would be awesome if you could watch all the DVDs you buy on your Archos, but they are fixed so that you cannot convert them. Some people know how or have the equipment to be able to get around this, but not myself. All I can use the Archos for is watching material I once downloaded from file sharing programs. I guess you could transfer most bootleg DVDs too. Folks talk about watching YouTube on their Archos. That would be very pleasing to me, but the Archos 7 doesn't come ready to do this and you have to find a way to get around that too. I still haven't figured it out. So, basically, I'm very limited to what I can do with my Archos. I can look at pictures and a very small selection of videos that I converted and transferred to the Archos by my computer. It's neat, but it could be a lot neater. Being able to watch YouTube at least would make me very happy. At least I can check my e-mail and surf the net for text stuff. Anyway, the package is great if you are tech savvy and can work around those problems. It comes with a recharger and USB chord, and also a set of ear buds. Over all, it's cool, but I wouldn't be too happy if I had paid the full price for it since I haven't gotten around the YouTube problem yet. If you think you can though, and as long as you have a good computer and router, you should be able to get some enjoyment out of the Archos 7. It's a slick looking device too, and I appreciate the kickstand as well.
