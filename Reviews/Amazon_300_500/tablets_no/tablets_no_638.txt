I am really excited about this product, I wasn't sure if I wanted to get a tablet or a small laptop but after comparing prices and analyzing what I was planning on using it for, I thought a tablet was the way to go.  My main use was going to be for travel, I wanted to have something with me that could get on the internet and had a larger screen than my smart phone. I say "was" because I find myself picking it up to use instead of walking over to my computer. This product is perfect, it has a large clear screen, it's lightweight and I picked up how to use it right away.  The only complaint that I have regarding the product is the power cord, I would think that such a small device would have a small cord but it reminds me of a mini computer power cord even with a box in the middle of the cord.  Annoying when your trying to pack one carry on bag and you already have a bunch of other cords and clothes along.  I guess that if this was the only complaint that I have, it must be a good product right?One other issue that I'm putting here as well as a complaint to Amazon, that has already been filed, is about the shipping.  The product was ordered on Jan 11 and I received it on the 14th using their standard shipping, great turn around and not the problem!!  What was unfortunate was that whatever company did the shipping knocked on the door and then left my package on the doorstep.  I live in an apartment complex, had I not been home (there was no way for them to know I was) I doubt that package would have still been there by the time I got back.  When the tablet was left, my apartment leasing office was open (they always accept packages) and I do even have a patio that they could have dropped it on.  I just want others to be aware that you might want to track your package and try to make sure someone is home so the same issue doesn't happen to you.
