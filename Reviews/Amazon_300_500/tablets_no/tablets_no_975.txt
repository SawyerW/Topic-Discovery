It's been 5 months since I purchased my Nextbook Premium and I've had no problems with it at all.  I have downloaded Amazon App store, downloaded all kinds of books on it as well as FliqCalendar and Colornote.  I use it mostly for work, so I have a few company videos on it as well.  I also have downloaded photos with it without any hassle whatsoever.I have found the Customer Service folks at efun ready and willing to help me whenever I've called them.  I use AT&T; for email, which evidently is not compatible with the already downloaded email app, so they helped me download maildroid and I've enjoyed using it without any problems.I did purchase a screen protector and a wallet to help protect it and I carry it everywhere I go.  It's on most of the day and only takes a few hours to juice up.Use the usb connection provided and documents flow flawlessly from my computer to the device.  I've even downloaded all sorts of documents and it comes up in the ereader on the device.My only complaint is the Kobo - an application that was installed at the factory.  While Kobo had the contract with nextbook, setting up and downloading books, including free books, was quick and easy.  Now Kobo is telling me that the device is no longer compatible with their book service.  Huh?  This device accepts all forms of books, so that's a Kobo issue, not a nextbook issue. Also, I've noticed that the newer ones have a different applicaton installed, so I don't think anyone purchasing a new one will have this issue.This is a quick little machine.  I don't play games on it and I've downloaded 10 applications to help me in my businss.  The wifi is quick and easy to connect.No, this is not an i-pad.  It's not a cell phone.  It doesn't have a camera.  Big deal.  This machine does the job and then some.The best question is "would I buy this again?"  Yep, when this one dies, I'm getting another one.
