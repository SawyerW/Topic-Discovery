Update 20110624:Following a comment in the Tablet PC Reviews forum I found that my EP121 display has a yellowish tint in all corners except C2. The tint appears on whitish backgrounds with the triangle sides being about 1/4 inch. For me, this does not detract from my Rating or Usage of the EP121. I mention it because a number of folks reported the issue in the forum and some folks here might be bothered by it enough to not purchase. I haven't seen any Asus response to this issue.I got the 64GB SSD model Monday, 7 Mar. My first Win7 i5 Slate. I like it more and more each day. I'll be updating this review as I get more experience.Two objections:1. Short battery life - 3 to 4.5 hours - Overcome with Energizer XP18000 Rechargeable Power Pack for Laptops for 8+ hours.2. Portability - Overcome with a ScotteVest.com Tropical Jacket/Vest which has a large magazine pocket to hold the EP121 inside its folio.I'm an old geek, 64 years, who may switch in an instant from a paint program like ArtRage to web development via WAMP which the EP121 handles with ease. My VirginMobile MiFi220, 4 port travel USB Hub, XP18000, Promini BT KB/TP, EP121 and more easily fit into my ScotteVest. So when I'm at a Kauian beach I can go from surfing the web to swimming the surf in just moments. The display on the EP121 is good enough for my outdoor viewing.I'm running stock Win7 HP and bought the 3 Pack Microsoft Office 2010 Home & Student (Disc Version) for it's OneNote features which works fine to translate my hand written notes into text for Word. Video calls via Skype work fine. The EP121 works fine with my Vivitek H1080FD 1080p Home Theater Projector (White) and New Arrival! brite-View "Air SyncHD" (BV-2322) Wireless 1080p HD Video/ Audio Transmission Kit in Extended Display mode at 1080p.Having hacked my way from S100 CP/M in the late 1970s to Linux in the 1990s and Android in the 2000s, I'm now interested in a Windows slate that just works out of the box. The EP121 does just that - it works.If you want a tablet just for consume mode I'd recommend an iPad. For creative and productivity usage I don't see any slate better than the EP121 right now. I love it!Allen
