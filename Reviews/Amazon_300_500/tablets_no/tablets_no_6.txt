This is not my first tablet, I have owned and used the iPad, and a Android 10 inch tablet prior to buying this one. I have to say I can't find many things wrong with this one. The Nexus 7 is made by ASUS and everyone knows that ASUS makes top quality products. The size is perfect for holding with one hand and the touchscreen is very responsive even with an aftermarket screen protector on it. Android 4.2 is currently the newest update and it works perfectly. The screen resolution is and I can look at it for hours and not have any issues with eye strain or pain. (Wish I could have said the same thing about my iPad) The 32 GB model offers plenty of storage space on the device and with being over 50% used it is still just as fast and responsive as it was right out of the box. The speaker on the back of the device is adequate and what I would expect from a unit of this quality. The Front facing camera is great for streaming video call via Skype and the clarity is great. There is no rear facing camera but as I have found on a device like this I wouldn't use it even if it did have one. The case has a textured back which makes holding on to the device easy. The battery life is excellent and in my experience with it only going into sleep mode and getting moderate use all day long. I only have to charge it every three days. WiFi works wonderfully and has great range.The only drawbacks I can see are little things like no SD card support. and the software lacks a camera app (though you can get one on the Google app store.)This is a great unit with loads of possibilities. I would recommend it to everyone I know.
