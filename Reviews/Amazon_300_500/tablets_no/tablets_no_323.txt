I bought an Apple iPad 2 from UK 3 months back.At the time of sale, Apple doesn't mention a very important and critical maintenance aspect of few of its products that is, they do not have a part levelreplacement policy.This I have come to know after contacting the Apple india support. The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that itleaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.In my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracksand said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPadanymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I dont want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similarproduct from other company's offering.I even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.In addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided likeHDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connectwith other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers.The intersting thing is that other similar products inmarket have these things built in.Having burnt my hands after buying my first "Apple" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product. I only wish I had this piece of advice before....
