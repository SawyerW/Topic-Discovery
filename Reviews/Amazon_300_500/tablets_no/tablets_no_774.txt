I got this about 2 1/2 months ago on sale for 89.00, and honestly that was the selling point for me.  I had been looking at tablets and just couldn't justify 500 for one, so I took a chance on this.  I'm glad I did!The tablet is well constructed and feels good in the my hands, I added on a case for under 5.00 and a 32gb class 10 sd card for 35 more. 135.00 for a 32gb tablet is sweet IMO (I recommend a class 10 card strongly it helped out alot.Pros:It plays videos quite well with the Youtube app, which is available on the almost non existant Cruz Market.Music plays well (wish it did visualizations while playing though)load times are pretty fast for music and video.The price!external speakers work well, just not as good as using headphones or my pc speakers plugged in (with pc speakers this is one nice sounding machine.I only have to charge this every 3 days or so. (I use the Scannerradio Pro app most of the day and with display off it just lasts and lasts)Cons:The screen isn't as sensitive as I would ideally want it to be  but far from a deal breaker for me (LS settings is a free app that helps you adjust it to its highest sensitivity. (sometimes it seems to help other times not).It freezes when i plug it into my win 7 desktop but not on my win 7 laptop when plugged in?!?hard to think of negatives, I really like this tablet.  Overall, if you want an affordable tablet that can play music and video well and do basic web browsing this could be the item for you, if you want to buy this just to play games I would pass thoughThis is my 1st tablet and at first I was like ehh it's okay, but with some experimenting (getting rid of the apps I didn't use)(tool link can be found at Cruz forums).
