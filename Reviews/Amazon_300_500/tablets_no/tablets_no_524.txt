After researching tablets for some time, it came down to either the iPad or the Galaxy Tab.  Both of these tablets seemed well constructed and responsive to me.  The iPad has a slight edge over the Galaxy Tab in its touch screen functions (pinch zoom, etc.), but both work very smoothly overall.  The biggest problem for me with the iPad was its lack of a real USB connectivity.  With the Galaxy Tab, one can simply connect it to a computer with the supplied cable and mount it as a disk.  iPad does not have this convenience; getting data in and out of an iPad is cumbersome at best (think of it as a large iPod Touch and you get the idea).  Also, there is no external storage on the iPad while the Galaxy Tab accepts microSD cards.  The iPad's larger screen can be an advantage when viewing magazines, newspapers, etc., but it is really to large for an eReader.  As an eReader, it is pretty flappy and tiring to hold after a short time.  Galaxy Tab excels in this area.  Apps are better at this time for the iPad; many Android apps are cell phone oriented and appear as a little rectangle in the middle of a big screen.  Probably this will change as Android evolves, but the advantage goes to iPad at the moment.  What it comes down to is personal preference.  The smaller size and easier use as an eReader make the Galaxy my preference; you may prefer the iPad.  But, don't be misled--tablets are not PCs!  If you had planned on all of the niceties of, say, Microsoft Office--well, they just aren't there.  Tablets work fine for email, web browsing, viewing most documents, etc., but they simply do not work well at all when more "heavy duty" processing is required.
