I admit that I was a little wary of getting a Thrive due to some of the negative reviews but I've had my thrive for about a week now and not only does it function perfectly, it has also helped me close a pair of business deals due to (as the clients put it) the sheer coolfactor of being able to use a tablet for web design and business management.I used to go met prospective clients with my net book, but the Thrive does pretty much everything I used the net book for and does it in a way cooler way.  I'm actually writing this review on the tablet right now and I am having no issues at all.A couple of pieces of info that you need to know before buying, and this goes for almost any tablet.  First: you will need to spend a little bit of money to customize the tablet to your needs.  I use mine for business so I needed a couple of paid apps to up the functionality for business purposes, specifically I needed an word processing app (quick office pro HD) a web dev app and a billing app, all of which ran less than $30. You should also get a case to protect it, which will add a little in the way of bulk, but we are talking about about a half inch and a half pound. You won't notice much difference in portability and your investment will be safe.Second: it is not particularly easy to type without an attached keyboard (which the thrive makes easy to get as you can get a UsB or Bluetooth keyboart to use) or you can do what I did and just get used to the touch screen...I would estimate that I can type at about 85' of normal speed on the touch screen keyboard.Lastly: you are likely to spend way too much time playing with your awesome new bit of tech...buy on a Friday so you have the weeked to fool around with it.The Thrive is a great tablet for those who want the freedom of the android OS, the ports that don't come with most other tablets and the functionality that may endup replacing your laptop all together.In short, buy a Thrive, you will be glad that you did.
