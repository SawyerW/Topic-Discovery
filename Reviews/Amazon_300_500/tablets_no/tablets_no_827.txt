The review  ***For me, Thrive beats Galaxy Tab and Acer Iconia***  has a lot more details about the assorted features and is the main reason I purchased the Toshiba Thrive!The reason I'm writing this review is because of some things that weren't really covered in that review related to experience using it for awhile.1)  When it comes to Android Apps, the Toshiba Thrive has fewer problems with running apps than most other devices. Just go check out some app reviews in the "Android Market" and you'll find that some of the other more popular tablets, like the Galaxy are listed more often with bad reviews of apps because the app doesn't work with their proprietary architecture, and application of the Android Operating System. There are inconsistencies and incompatibilities in some of those other devices.2)  In my experience, my Toshiba has had NO PROBLEM running any app that doesn't have universal problems. But, by avoiding those apps that have less that 3 to 4 stars or better, I have rarely had problems. And the problems are fixed quickly by the developers because they're universal problems and they update them quickly.3)  I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with this tablet and have used and appreciated the full sized ports on this device. I also love being able to add another GB of Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media. Just be careful and make sure you ***unmount*** your Toshiba from your computer before disconnecting it from the USB port, or you could damage the SD card, especially the 'micro' cards. Also, if you remove the SD card from the Toshiba, be sure to ***unmount*** from the tablet as well. When the SD card is installed, there is an icon in the lower right shaped like the card. Just tap on that icon and a pop up offers the option to dismount the card. It's that simple. The trick is... Remembering to do it.4)  If you've read the reviews suggesting an unusually fragile screen? I wouldn't be too concerned. Granted, it's not the "Gorilla Glass" I've read about and would really like, but I've had NO problem with mine. Of course, I avoid leaving it on the dash in the car in extreme heat or cold. I have a case to help protect in and to use as a stand. And, I'm careful not to put undue pressure on the device in any way. As far as resolution. The only thing that might be better is the iPad or iPods. But without Adobe Flash, you can't get the streaming video like You-Tube. And I've enjoyed using You-Tube too much to sacrifice it.I truly hope this is helpful.Walt B
