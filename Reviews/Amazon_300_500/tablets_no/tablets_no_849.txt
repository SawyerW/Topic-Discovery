16gb Toshiba Thrive:I'm an Management Information Systems major and I wanted full access to my tablet, which meant... usb/mini usb input, sd input, hdmi output, battery access, and an Android OS.First of all, I can't believe people complain about the weight!! It's only 1.7 lbs, lolAlso, the size isn't bad at all. I like the thickness. It gives you something to hold onto. I also love the way the back is textured. I wish it was made with gorilla glass... Other than that, this tablet get's a 9/10 from me. Sure, they could have made it a little better here or there... But for someone who wants to have access at anytime with a variety of different storage methods.. This is PERFECT!The interface is smooth and the tablet works great! There's some bloatware on the tablet that you can't remove (well.. not easily anyways), but it doesn't even take up 1gb. Just take it off the main screens and ignore that it's there. I've got ~13gb free to use and that's plenty for apps! My 32gb SD card holds my movies and music. I've got my Logitech Mk550 (BB $40) plugged into the tablet when I'm using it at home. Logitech Wireless Wave Combo Mk550 With Keyboard and Laser Mouse (920-002555)*I'm not using a screen protector because I've got a case on the tablet, so I'm not worried about about the screen getting messed up. (I always daily clean the screen with a soft micro pad anyways because I'm OCD)*I got this on Amazon for $16 and it works great:VERTEKS (TM) Toshiba Thrive 10.1 Inch Android Tablet Multi-Angle Leather Folio Case Cover (Black)I got the 16gb tablet for $130 after a pricing mistake at a local retailer. WIN!!! I'd probably pay up to $350 for this tablet.(Then again.. I wouldn't EVER pay more than $350 for any tablet..)^I'm cheap :D
