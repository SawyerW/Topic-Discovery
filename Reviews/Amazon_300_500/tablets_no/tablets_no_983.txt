I have had my 10.1 for a month now and I am mostly happy with it. Two things that bother me are - the browser some times get bogged down and the keyboard suffers a delay (might not be a Samsung problem), secondly the power button/lock screen button gets tripped be accident if I hold the tablet wrong or set it down leaning against something. Oh and one more thing that can be considered a negative- mine came with a locked bootloader. Some are unlocked and some are locked. There will be a lock icon when your tablet boots up - that means your bootloader is unlocked. No icon at bootup and you have a locked one. You may want to google this if its important feature for you. I am waiting for somebody to figure a way around it. That might be important to some if you want to put your own customised  kernel. I did root mine and have been modifying it for my needs. It did ship with honeycomb 3.1.  The battery life is excellant, the screen brightness is awesome. It is almost as light as a feather. I find that not having a sd card slot is a plus. I think it makes my tablet more secure as honeycomb supports whole device encyption. The power cable is a bit short, but you can attach a common radio cord to the end. The prongs on the plug slide out and you can insert a longer plug (the type that go to most portable radios). The sound is fair. The tablet seems sturdy as well. There is no keyboard lag except when using the android browser that I have seen. The wall street journal app was not working for honeycomb the last I checked (3 weeks ago)Hope my review has helped.
