The other reviews are right, it is a fine little computer for a good price.however...I've worked on quite a few laptops and netbooks in my day, and this one takes the cake for having the most garbage pre-installed. I understand, Samsung, that this is how you keep the prices down. You get money from Norton and all the other devs so that you can sell the hardware for crazy-low prices. I get it...but you're going too far. Cleaning this thing off is taking up far too much of my life.Some of the garbage you'll find on the NB30:BatteryLife ExtenderEasy Network ManagerBonbon QuestNorton Internet SecurityDaycare NightmareEasy Content ShareEasy Display ManagerEasy Resolution ManagerEasy SpeedUp ManagerEasy Battery ManagerEasy File ShareFast Booting SWFlip WordsGalapagoGame Pack (one of 3)Gem ShopGoogle ToolbarInsaniquarium DeluxeMahjong EscapeMicrosoft Choice GuardMS Office 2010 trialMS SQL Server 2005 Compact (yeah, I need that on my netbook)Norton Online BackupSamsung Recovery Solution 4Samsung Support CenterSamsung Update PlusSkype ToolbarsSkypefour Windows Live applications I don't want...and this is just what I have left to uninstall. I already got rid of at least 6 applications before I got annoyed enough to write this review.For those of you who want to manually clean this stuff off, you have a few options:PC Decrapifier (google it) is decent but sometimes buggywindows uninstaller works fine but often leaves stuff behindRevo Uninstaller (google it) is my favorite way to go as it really gets rid of all the cruft these crappy apps leave behind. only problem is that it is a very manual process and it takes time.You could also install windows clean and just not have any of the crapware, but then you have to deal with getting all the Samsung-specific drivers loaded so that the function keys and on-screen displays work right, etc.As I said, it's a fine little computer and the price certainly is good, but I give it 3 stars because it epitomizes why people dislike Windows PCs. My time is worth money, so I'd gladly pay more for a different SKU that is CLEAN and doesn't drag Windows 7 through the mud. I'd also give that system 4 or 5 stars.
