The good:-The case is metal, which gives it a nice feel.-USB (micro and full-size) - If you're so inclined, you can plug a USB hub into the USB port and then connect a keyboard and mouse. A cursor appears on screen when using a mouse (if you're using Android 3.2), so it feels like a regular computer. I make regular use of this feature.-HDMI - You'll need a micro HDMI-to-HDMI adapter to connect it to your TV, but those are cheap. The HDMI output works as advertised.-SD (micro) - A simple and cheap way to extend the storage capacity of your tablet. I have the 16GB tablet, so this will probably come in handy in the near future when I start loading tons of stuff onto the device.-If you want to copy files to the tablet, just connect it to your computer via USB. The tablet's storage devices appear on your computer as external drives so you can just copy/paste whatever you want. Nice and easy.-I even like that the power supply plugs into a separate port.-The price - For all the features this tablet has, the price is very reasonable.The bad:-Crappy screen. In bright light there is a highly visible pattern of "X"-like objects on the surface of the screen. In low lighting, the color, clarity, and brightness just aren't as good as other tablets I've used (iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab).-This tablet is larger and heavier than others. I don't mind it, but it is noticeable.-The device ships with Android 3.01 and if you want Acer's official Android 3.2 update right now you'll have to do a little bit of work to force it to install. Acer's "update" feature does not appear to work as it should, since it always informed me that 3.01 was the most up to date version, which it wasn't.-Battery life isn't that great.Overall:It's a worthy tablet if you want tons of ports, 3G/4G data capability, and you don't want to spend too much money. But the screen sucks, so you might want to demo this device in a store before going through with the purchase.
