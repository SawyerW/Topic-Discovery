I had been wanting a tablet for a few months, but not looking to drop hundreds of dollars on one.  I knew in my heart of hearts it would end up being a learning toy for my 3 year old (which it DID end up being).  So when this went on sale for a hundred, I snagged it.My only complaint is it has some weird app market built in and no support for Google's market, nor Amazon's.  There's a website I found that walks you through working around this issue and putting the Google Marketplace on it manually, then you can get all the cool Amazon apps (Kindle, Cloud Player, etc...)As I said, my 3 year old started playing with this almost right away with a couple freebie learning apps and loved it.  He quickly figured out how to change the desktop background and other odd things and was able to bring me up to speed on it.As far as durability goes, we always supervised tablet play and my 3 year old is pretty mature for his age, but accidents happen and this has held up for almost a year with no major problems to speak of.Now that my kid is onto other things, I use this primarily as a Kindle and e-mail in bed, and my wife uses it for Facebook and light web surfing.The battery is pretty good, but you HAVE to turn it all the way off when you're not using it.  The problem there is that it takes a solid 2 minutes to boot up.  There's a sleep mode which comes back up instantly, but 12 hours in sleep mode, not plugged in will kill the battery.  I leave mine plugged in most of the time anyway and use sleep mode, so it's not a big deal.If you want to get a tablet to see if you'll like it or want to get a young child a tablet that won't be the end of the world if they drop it and break it, I highly recommend this.
