I bought my Thrive in September. I loved it but even with EXTREME care the glass developed a stress crack. (I purchased the ruggerized back cover, the Toshiba leather case, applied a screen protector, slipped all that in a padded neoprene case and carry it in my brief case...you would think that would be enough precaution. Nor have I dropped it or exposed it to an extreme environment such as freezing weather or in my car on a summer day) I spent 3 days attempting to talk to someone in Toshiba customer service/abuse. When I did finally talk to a representative I was rudely dismissed as a fool who did not know how to take care of her electronics. I have since done extensive research on Toshiba Thrives and found this is a very common complaint. The glass screen is known to spontaneously crack under ANY circumstance including holding it by the corners! Any reviewer that tried to get Toshiba's customer service to help tells the same stories about getting hung up on, trying to get a "real" person and the rude attitude. I was informed that ANY crack in the glass is the owner's fault and not covered under their 1 year warranty. The fix would be an out-of-warranty issue and for $25 (a special mailer they send) I could mail it back to them for analysis. The estimate for repair....hold on to your hat...somewhere between $160 and $400. Even the cheapest repair would be more than half the price of a new Thrive. I told the Customer Service manager that I believed this to be a manufacturer's defect. She said that my complaint is the first she has ever heard of this glass issue - can I assume this was her first day working there? I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the "paper weight" Toshiba!
