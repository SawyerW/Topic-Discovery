I got this primarily as a reader, to replace a Literati (which sucked). I wanted something that did more than read books but didn't need to be a full blown laptop or smartphone. This fills the bill for under $200 with no additional fees for access. WiFi, Email & games are pretty painless to set up. I've been able to find free WiFi in lots of places even in the burbs. Many apps require some trial and error. The Kindle and Borders apps are useless if you have your own books (free from many torrents)and only work with books you buy from their website. Cruz recommends Wordplayer but I found it to be unstable and with a poor format that was hard to read or customize. For reading Aldiko works great but you have to use the older version for Android 2.0 or earlier. The built-in Browser works well, also tried Dolphin which was a little easier to use. Battery life seems to be ok especially if you shut off wifi when not using. Battery will charge while usb is connected, or so it claims. I never left it connected long enough to test it. Had a little trouble connecting to PC at first. Didn't realize you had to click on usb icon on cruz and "mount" the SD card. Wasted lots of time trying to find WinXP drivers that aren't needed. Once you figure it out, file transfer is a breeze. I tried the CruzSync/ZumoDrive app that comes with it. It allows access to files stored offsite kind of like FTP. I had trouble transfering files from Zumodrive physically to the card. Acessing them via WiFi wastes power and has lots of transfer errors for realime things like music play.  The 4GB card that comes with it seems big enough for now but it's good to see it will take up to 32GB card. Spec says it has 4GB internal but don't mention you have no access to it or that OS uses almost all of it. Overall a good product.
