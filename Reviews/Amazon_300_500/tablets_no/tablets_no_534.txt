I bought this in preparation for a vacation with my wife to see her father in Finland. Several reasons:1)7" form factor.2)The price.3)It has an unlocked quad-band phone(few tablets offer that, especially not the iPad).4)and especially not at This Price.5)Documents-to-Go INCLUDED and that worked VERY well with Swype.6)GPS and so much more.There is no doubt that Droid 2.2 does not do certain things; but for my needs, this did everything I wanted on our trip. I appreciated that I could use it for data if needed, text AND Phone Calls all in one package. I kept our journal wherever we went, and Google maps and the GPS even got us to our hotel from the train station in Copenhagen with ease. The size is right, and it fit nicely into a jacket pocket. I felt very comfortable knowing I had it with me. By the way, the phone works well as a speakerphone or with the built-in bluetooth; but the included stereo earphones isolated noise and my wife and I could share them to talk more privately with folks back home. (Yes, I cleaned the bud before offering it to her.)Battery life was absolutely fine and I never ran out, but I did NOT use it for movies or constant data downloads - only as needed - and I charged it every night.  Speaking of which, the thing comes with International Plug Adapters for just about everywhere in the world. How cool is that?!One negative: the camera is not one you would want to use for important pictures. It's only "ok" at best. If you've got nothing else it will "take a snapshot" but "not a photograph" if you get my meaning; and I really think you should use a "camera" whenever you take important pictures, anyway. (I'm so old school.)Yes. I would recommend this to a friend.
