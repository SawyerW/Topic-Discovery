You are either going to pick this up and love it, or pick it up and wonder what the heck it is.For me this is a great product. If you have an iphone or an ipod touch you know how to use it, it really is just bigger. Although it's faster and easier to use because the keyboard is larger and there is more screen area to use for applications. i bought the Wifi model initially and loved it. I put my movies, music, games, RSS readers on it and never looked back. The iPad truly is a great device. I imagine that there may be other brand coming out but in today's marketplace the iPad is the best portable computer I have seen.Some people say that it has flaws, I have only run into one website that I frequently use that didn't work, and that was CNN. All other sites I visit have changed their video formats over to html5 or other ipad friendly formats. Flash not running on here is really not a big deal for my applications.This makes a fantastic book reader as well. I've actually read more in the last few weeks with this then I had in the last few years. It makes reading so accessible because no matter where you are if you have a few minutes you can pull up a book, read a chapter and then move on without having to carry a book around.This is a fantastic product, I can't say enough about it. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because it's a bit heavy, and that's the only reason. But if you consider the battery life in my experience has easily been 10-14 hours without a charge you realize that's why it's heavy. It is so nice being able to have a computer that you can literally use all day and still not be able to exhaust the battery.Great product.
