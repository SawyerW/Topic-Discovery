it's a nice tablet. the screen is under resolution and the viewing angles are bad true , the battery life sux to say the least. but being how you hold a tablet the viewing angle is a non issue. there is an unofficial release of honeycomb for this, i recommend not putting it on this tablet and sticking with froyo 2.2 because of the icon size and resolution. bottom line to me is its easy to use, took less than a day to learn to navigate it. has gps a free trial of turn by turn navigation, usa maps for it if you choose them cost a whopping $5 if u want north america all it jumps to $20 , i know i wont be driving in mexico any time and there is always just plain old google maps. it has the android market and u can put amazon market on it. tons of apps for it though AAA roadside is not compatable nor is american express app. need a usb extension cable as the one provided is short buit with extension there is no issue it works fine to charge. i dont have the dock yet they want $69 for it but seeing whats built into it , it takes this solidly built small tablet to the next level. hdmi out and usb ports plus it holds and charges at the same time. cameras are fine and the bar code 1 and 2d scanners work perfectly.the biggest plus comes when you open the port for the sim card holder ( this is wifi only version ) but the suprise comes once you realize it takes a full sized SD card instead of the micro ones. if resolution is the most important thing for you then this is not your tablet, but if you can stand droid 2.2 aka froyo the res for that op system on this unit works fine ( not sure when ice cream sandwhich is coming out but its supposed to bring the tablet and phones op systems all together )
