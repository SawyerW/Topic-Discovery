(Wife): I've had this laptop-tablet computer and have mostly enjoyed it for about 2.5 years now. Been running MS Office the whole time. Used to use it for work. (Bought w/ my own money, since work wouldn't provide sufficient computers for us for a long while.)Pros:- Will run MS Office- Actual keyboard (as opposed to virtual, although that option is also available)- USB ports- Touchscreen(-Can be propped up like a tent for mini-presentations)- Seems reasonably durable- Screen can be protected more easily than on iPad- Aftermarket replacement parts (and possibly upgrades) sometimes available for tech-savy risk-taker types- Seems to play back audio okCons:- Cannot put in sleep mode -- will not turn back on until battery is nearly or completely drained, and then only from a charger until charged -- fixable by disabling sleep mode altogether (my experience, anyway)- Mousepad can be temperamental -- haven't found a way to adjust it effectively- Tends to crash & reboot when playing video -- appears to be an issue of overheating / poor heat dissipation- Very slow processing when getting overheated from video playback, even w/ bloatware disabled- Difficult to use finger as a mouse pointer on touchscreen -- many touches / swipes do not register properly for me- Brightness should be adjusted manually for tent-prop presentations during setup- Not sure how to adjust brightness manually when it attempts to do so automatically (when user switches back and forth between keyboard and touchscreen)- Volume control can also become semi-unresponsive when switching between keyboard and touchscreen -- has required me to adjust manually several times- No video export via VGA-type connector for larger presentations- Heavier than iPad- Chicklet-style keyboard (not full-sized)Day-to-day, this laptop / tablet works decently for my use. I wish it functioned a little better, but I've learned to live w/ the quarks. I use the keyboard so much that an iPad doesn't make sense for me, so this has been a good compromise for me. Once they come out with more user-friendly / efficient tablet-laptop computers w/ keyboards that run full MS Office and do video, games, etc. without crashing, I'd have to recommend those over this one. I do really like the tent-type design for mini-presentations -- those can be fun -- and a great way for showcasing picture albums at home. = )
