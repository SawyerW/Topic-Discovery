To anyone considering the Asus Eee Pc, I highly recommend it!The Eee Pc is an awesome little convertible laptop.  I got it to use in class when I start college in the fall. From just using it a little, I know that it will be perfectPros:Touch screen- makes surfing the web and playing games simple and easySpin and fold down screen- Gives the device a tablet feel without decreasing functionalityStylus- Built-in stylus works well with touch screen, and is always handy due to the slot right under the screenAsus support- Customer support people were very nice and helpfulSpeed- Many think the computer is too slow, but considering the price, and that it is a NETBOOK, it is not bad, I purchased an extra GB of RAM for it, but for what I payed, I think it was plenty fastBattery Life- Brand new out of box, has about 6.5 hours of battery lifeWebcam- Offers ability to use skype (or similar video chat) and a built in program allows you to use it to take photosOne of my favorite things- Wordpad (yeah I know it is not microsoft office, but its gotten decent) has a utility that opens a small window that you can draw in on the touch screen, and once you are finished, the image is placed in the document.  Will be perfect for taking notes in Math or science where you need to write formulas.Applications- Several of the pre-installed applications are actually pretty useful (although some are annoying) and they help utilize the touch screenMore- Countless more pros, that you will just have to experience for yourselves!Cons:Touch screen problem- About a week after I got the device, after very light use, the bottom inch of the touch screen stopped responding. After two failed attempts (by different asus support guys) I sent it to the service center because they beleive that there is a hardware issue.  I have yet to receive the product back, but as long as it is repaired, I will be happy and would change this to five starsSorry guys, but I can't come up with any more cons, this is the perfect netbook/convertible/laptop for me!I sent my Eee PC to the Asus service center, and it was repaired (Hardware malfunction) free of charge. Since I got it back, I added a 1 GB stick of RAM, and the little netbook runs perfectly and quickly! I absolutely love this computer!
