I bought my G Tablet on August 2, 2011 and paid a small premium to buy from an Amazon-fulfilled seller so I could get it the next day with Prime. Even with the extra cost of my impatience, the tablet was still under three hundred dollars, and I was happy that I got such a good deal on a 10-inch tablet. iPad, Xoom, and Galaxy Tab be damned, I haven't looked back since.Having done my homework, I immediately ditched the stock OS and installed CyanogenMod (CM)  7 RC1, which ran quite well and gave me no trouble. However, I had been reading about the available Honeycomb (HC) ROMs and decided to give them a shot. I read Ray Waldo's article comparing the three big HC ROMs and decided to go with Gtabcomb (GC). I used it for a few weeks, and it ran fairly well, but not as well as CM7. I didn't want to go back to Android 2.x, though, so I stuck with Honeycomb. Not having tried Flashback (FB), I installed that and have been running it since. While it's certainly not perfect (camera doesn't work and HD video is pretty sketchy), I love the HC interface, and FB seems to run better than GC. I stopped using GC because of its stalled development, and I didn't even try Illuminate because of all the sketchy things I heard about it. I'm hoping that the remaining issues will be solved when Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) and its source code become available. (Side note: I think Google really screwed the pooch by not releasing the HC source. I don't care how hideous or hacked together the source is, Google should have just released the damn thing and let the community fix it for them.)Bottom line: the G Tablet's 10-inch screen, 512 MB RAM, 16 GB storage, 1 GHz Tegra 2 CPU, expandable MicroSD, USB slot, HDMI with Malata Zpad dock, and perfect price point make it the ideal toy (yes, it's a toy) for anyone who can use Google, read a few instructions, and ditch the crappy Tap-n-Tap with some rooting magic.
