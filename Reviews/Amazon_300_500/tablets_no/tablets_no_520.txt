To be perfectly frank, it's a sub-$200 Chinese tablet running an outdated and stripped version of Android. As a self-deemed "Android Power User," I was less than impressed. For anyone else, it would work just fine.The stock OS has a very low pixel density, so everything on the screen is huge. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of the stock OS is that it can be turned on and rooted in less than 3 minutes. There is plenty of stuff on the internet, namely xda-developers forum, that has step-by-step walkthroughs for loading a newer ROM onto it. It also has trouble recognizing any blank SD cards. I found the workaround for that is to shut the unit off, insert the SD card, then reboot the system so that it can initialize it at startup. Any other time just gives a "Blank SD Card" warning, and the "Format SD Card" function is useless.The hardware itself is nice, the unit feels very solid and well-built. The resistive touchscreen can be a little persnickety sometimes, but it gets the job done. The system has an 800MHz (really ~750MHz) that will under-clock itself to save power. At idle, the system runs at around 100-125MHz. It also has 256MB of RAM, not much to say. It supposedly has 4GB of storage, however, about 1.8GB are somehow missing, I assume taken up by system files, but Android doesn't have that large a footprint. Oh well, an 8GB MicroSD card was $14 here on Amazon, so no trouble. My only gripe about the hardware, is the lack of USB charging support. The tablet can only be charged through a small jack with a wall-wart transformer.Overall, the tablet before an OS upgrade gets an "ew," and after, it gets a resounding "meh." It works just fine with Aldiko, I haven't tried to watch any videos on it yet, but it supposedly works well with mVideoPlayer. I personally am going to relegate this to development duty and pick up a better quality one for everyday use.
