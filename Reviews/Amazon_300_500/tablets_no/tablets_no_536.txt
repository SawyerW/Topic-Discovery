I have had my Cruz T301 for about a week now, I did a lot of research before I picked this tablet to get into the tablet world. This is a very good tablet for the money, yes all of the things most reviewers had said, both good and bad, are true. It is a bit slow, no app market (but I have installed .apk files from the web with no problems) the screen is ok, takes a bit of getting used to, but for a little over $200 you do get a great reader, I like it very much as a reader (updated the Kindle app) you also get a pretty good portable media player with a 'full sized' SD card reader, an ok web browser, true no flash (but I don't think you get flash on the iPad either)...I got this device to see if a tablet would be something I would use long term, as a test case for future buys...so far I think it was a great buy and first taste of the tablet experience. I will most likely wait a bit before my next tablet, first because between the T301 and my smartphone I can do anything I would want to do in the mobile world, and secondly I feel that by the end of this year the Android tablets will really come into there own and I think the end of this year will be the right time to upgrade to a full fledged tablet. I think for the money this is a great buy...it is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, but feels very well made. I am haveing a bit of an issue with audio in the headphones and have started a support ticket...I will report back to let you know how they do in the support world. but the sound from the speakers in fine and really not bad given it's a tablet.
