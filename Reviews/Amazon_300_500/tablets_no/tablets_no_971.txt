I purchased this tablet on black Friday; easy to configure and I'm not an Android guy, I have  always worked on Windows based computers and using an I-phone for quite some years.I'm blown away about the flexibility and speed of this Android based Acer Iconia - Kudos to both Android and Acer.Hardware:The battery life of the Iconia is really good giving me an average of 7 hours; quality of the tablet is one of the best if not the best I have seen, screen quality is excellent and used material is Gorilla glass. The body of the tablet is made of a durable aluminum construction no cheap plastic here. This is a superior tablet that is well designed and thought-off; as one of the hardware features a full USB bus which is hard to find on tablets, the Iconia has really all the goodies. I tried some USB mouse and keyboards and they all worked flawless.Software:Apps are almost all free and if you need something special you might find it for a small price. There is a abundance available and I was truly amazed not to see to many errors actually very few and the ones that had some little glitches I uninstalled, easier than Windows; just drag the app to the trash-can and done.Excel, Word and PowerPoint documents are working perfect with Documents To Go Full Version from DataViz. As well desktop access moving files back and forth worked like a charm with Wifi File Transfer Pro all transfers are fast of course depending on your connection; nevertheless the Iconia was never the bottleneck all by all there were no bottlenecks. Another app that I liked is HeyWire which is an SMS text messenger all that combined with Astro File Browser and AVG Anti-virus free as well and I was ready to roll.Music - Pictures - Streaming Video and web browsing are part of this great experience and all work as well as on a fast desktop computer; amazing the way technology is moving.I would not hesitate to highly recommend this high-end Acer Iconia to anyone on a quest finding a tablet.I have no relationships in any shape or form with any of the brand names mentioned above.I'm very pleased with the Acer Iconia and will update this review because time will tell the story of consistency and reliability.Roland
