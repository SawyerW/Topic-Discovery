I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my husband from an affiliated website for about half the price of what they are selling them for here. I knew they weren't going to be awesome, but my husband had been talking about getting a Kindle Fire and I wanted to make sure he'd actually use a tablet before I spent any real money buying one for him. And I figured I'd grab one for myself too as a cheap comic reader. Well they were barely good for anything. They were difficult to use and mine wouldn't turn on again after the battery died or it was turned off (somehow we got it working again... for a while). There were a lot of random freezes and I can't even count how many times we had to reset them just to get them back to their slowly functioning selves. There was also a very limited app availability. I couldn't even find a comic reader so my husband rooted them both. They worked a bit better, but we found ourselves just using our phones and leaving these things in a drawer because they were still buggy enough not to mess with.I decided a few days ago I would try to use mine for recipes in the kitchen since I don't care at all if I drop eggs on it or ruin it in any other way. It charged fine but then wouldn't connect to our home wifi even thought it showed it was connected. I tried to restart and now the thing won't turn back on. All the softkey lights come on, but the screen is black. Black as the soul of the person who created these tablets and sold them to humans. And probably as black as the mood of anyone who ever bought one of these, especially at full price.What a giant piece of crap. Best Buy is having a "Turn in an old, un-working electronic device and we'll give you $5" promotion, but even these worthless turd tablets aren't on their list of acceptable devices. Leave this page now. Never buy this tablet. Live your life happy and free and far away from the Velocity Cruz T103.
