After several months spent researching a tablet for my wife (she's not a tech savvy) and for me as well, I came to conclusion to get this Thrive 32GB version from Toshiba.  Here're my top ten reasons (not in particular order)1. Full size USB, HDMI, mini USB, SD card for fast and easy access.2. Repaceable battery3. Open most common format documents I throw at.4. Play majority of musical and movies formats (will try .mkv as soon as I have my bigger size of SD card, this would be a plus)5. Decent front and rear cameras (2M/5M)6. The touch and user replaceable of back panel.7. The screen color is very vibrant8. Very responsive and fast execution.9. Fast battery charging (between 75-90min) from initial setup.10. User friendly OS, easy setup and fast app switchingBesides all those I have some cons about this:- Problem waking up from hibernation (fixed in new patch)- No way of killing any individual process / opened app. "Task manager" will become longer as you open more apps.  It's fast and good when you're switching between them.- Power plug to tablet is sticking out about 2". It's in the way in some cases. I think 90 deg. angle type is better.Will update this review as I spend more time with it.  So far I really like what I have. Need more killer apps and more fixes to work out some HW bugs and Android OS.  Lastly, I got it much cheaper here at Amazon.comUpdate: Aug 16, 2011It plays movies beautifully with no jerking or delays even via HDMI port to TV. Fast file copying from USB. It doesn't recognize .flv file format but it's ok after installing third party player. File manager is fast and easy to use.Update: Sept. 7, 2001  Tried several audio codecs for MKV files but none of them worked then found BSPlayer which plays properly and more like subtitle etc...
