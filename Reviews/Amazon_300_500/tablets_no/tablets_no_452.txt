It's an iPad! The tablet that all other tablets are measured against.Yes Apple has released the new iPad (or what the rest of us call the iPad 3). Apple Marketing, please think about your naming conventions in the future! But I still love my iPad 2!I use my iPad 2 just about every day. I mainly use it for reading email when I don't feel like pulling out the Macbook Pro. I also use it as an eReader (Amazon, Nook, Safari Books online, MacTech magazine, iBooks, etc). No it's not the retina display. But if you can't afford the retina display this is the next best thing. I can read this one just fine, so no upgrading for me.I didn't choose one with a data plan (would have been 3G when I bought this - last year), but I don't find that I need one. One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).The camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.It is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.Yes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.The iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever. Still I recommend some kind of case. The smart cover is good, but doesn't protect the back. I'm still looking for my ultimate case.I have made it through an entire plane ride (cross-country 6 hr trip) without running down the battery completely.Looking for the best Tablet experience, don't want to have to figure out some convoluted interface? Buy the iPad.
