I didn't purchase the iPad from Amazon, I got it from a nearby pawnshop, but, wanted to write a review anyway.  I got this after my laptop failed on me and I went to get a warranty replacement.  My main reason getting an iPad is that it was light, easy to carry around and the touchscreen was easy for me to use.  For me this is very important due to a physical disability that limits my range of motion and limits my hand use, only able to grip something pretty light.A laptop was awkward for me to move around and difficult to carry if I was using my manual wheelchair.  I don't have the money for a second gen iPad, so, I went this one.  I've had it for about a week and couldn't be happier with it and the ease with which I can use and move it.  Like some of the other reviews have said, it does have it's limitations, especially since I do a lot of photoshopping, which has always been best done on a desktop for me anyways.Other then that I use for school, I go online, and for my books for school, regular books (the iPad makes it easier to read books and newspapers because I do not have to mess with pages nor try to keep the book open), the touch interface does not require a ton of pressure and the swipe to get though falls within my range of motion perfectly.  I would drop stuff trying to press buttons bore while I tried to balance and work a mouse too.I'm not sure about writing a full document, such as I would for school, yet as I ran out of money to purchase the program I'd need to write it then export it as a .docx (format required for my school).  I have even gotten Dragon for speech to text on here and it works better (so far) then my version on my desktop.  Overall the iPad has been a great benefit to me, I have only had to my desktop for a few things.  I love this device and am hoping to get the iPad 2 at some point soon.
