While I've had this laptop for 5ish years and thus is no longer one of the most up-to-date (thus my review may no longer very helpful), I do have to stress that this is an excellent laptop that I use on a daily basis.It survived a lot - I dragged it to the US, Europe, Australia and back. It had a drink spilled all over it, a couple of kids that used it to draw with the pen were pressing it hard enough to leave scratches (and they really did press hard) - yet it still works just like it did on the first day.I did replace the battery at some point, and upgraded the disk to an SSD. By now, I installed Windows 8 on it, and the LifeBook boots in mere seconds. You wouldn't believe it's a 5 year old laptop, were it not for the slightly dated specs (1024x768 resolution, old graphic card, which is still perfectly suitable for office work though, 4 GB RAM).One feature I really like is the hardware lock, with the buttons integrated on the screen. You can set them up so you have to press a certain combination, otherwise the laptop won't start. Someone not knowing the combination cannot even get to the BIOS - the screen stays black, so this is an excellent pre-boot, pre-BIOS protection that might just deter someone who's eyeing your laptop from stealing it (especially when they realize it won't turn on).I can't really find a fault with it. Maybe this laptop was built before planned obsolescence became such a big thing. It's robust, doesn't look, feel or behave flimsy in the slightest, and just keeps working. You can sometimes find this model for $300 on certain bidding sites. If you need a solid office device, and you trust the vendor, you are making a great pick with this device.
