When I first got this device, I was very excited, but as time went on it began to lose its appeal as its limitations began to show themselves.The Pros:-Small Android tablet about the size of one of the phones-Able to access Wifi-Huge number of media file types supported-No monthly data bill-Access to Google AccountsThe Cons:-The Touchscreen: The touchscreen is horrible and there is little you can do to calibrate it correctly. My screen jumps around when my finger is in the middle. You have to push very hard in order to get it to register, often with your fingernail. The calibration does not resolve this as I have calibrated it many times.-Android Market: This device does not natively support the Android Market. It has an alternative version installed called AppsLib. The selection on AppsLib is nowhere near the selection of apps on the Android Market. There is a way to install the Android Market, but it is several extra steps.-Lack of Power: This device has since the start felt slightly sluggish. This has only increased once I loaded it with apps. I often have to wait for my home screen to display (sometimes over a minute), and many apps have lag or simply freeze then close. Also many apps will not work with this device. Google is good to prevent you from downloading them, but it is annoying that I am not allowed to install certain apps because the device lacks the power or a feature.Conclusion: This is an ok device. It allows you to access the internet, and run apps. However after a period of time, and after using better devices it becomes somewhat annoying. I would recommend that customers considering this device look at the Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Android MP3 Player. It is a little more money, but it is worth it because the touch screen is much better, and it has enough power to run everything smoothly.
