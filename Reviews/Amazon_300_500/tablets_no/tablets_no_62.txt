I'm a developer and Android fan who also happens to have and Android phone which I love. So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets. Let's see what happens a year from now.Hope this review helps.
