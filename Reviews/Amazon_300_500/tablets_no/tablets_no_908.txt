I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 WiFi only version with my eyes open.  I did not need a mobile network connection.  I was willing to live with the sub par specs that the WiFi only model came with because the size of the device was perfect for my needs and  it suited my purposes.  The first problems began to occur on day two when the device's Home button stopped working.  I called Samsung and they said they were not familiar with the problem and encouraged me to perform a factory reset. I did that and lost all my data and settings.  This happened once a day for the next several days. Each time my only option was a factory reset.  I looked up the problem on the various forums and found a few people with the same problem and the only solution was a factory reset.  In addition to that aggravation, the device then began to freeze up. I called the Samsung support line and was to hold down the power button while simultaneously pressing the volume up button thus, you guessed it, initiating a factory reset.  The Samsung Website does not even contain any support info for this particular model and was of little to no use.  After spendingmany hours on the forums I finally learned about the Samsung Sync software for the device called Kies.  This has a terrible interface that is not intuitive at all. I connected my device to the computer using Kies and checked the firmware for updates, finding none. At that point I had enough and decided to send the device back to Amazon. The only bright spot in this purchase is the Amazon Service.  I am surprised and saddened that a company with Samsung's reputation and resources has put such a poor product on the market and then offered such poor support.
