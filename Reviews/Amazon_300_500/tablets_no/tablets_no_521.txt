I bought this tab on Black Friday excited to be getting a tablet that was an android tab.  The reviews that I found while deciding to buy it said that it was a good device so I decided to get it.  It was great for about the first 3-4 weeks, then all it does is freeze up. I can't even keep the case that it came with on it because I have to reset it all the time.  Most times I would reset it and as soon as it booted back up I had to reset it again. I contacted Coby about it and they said that it was a known issue and that I would have to install the software update for it from the website. In order to do the update, I have to go "buy a Micro SD card larger than 2GB to load the update. It won't do the update without having one."  So in order to fix a defective device buy Coby, I had to go buy a SD card to load the software into it since it didn't come with one.  Then after doing the update, it is still running very slow and locking up but they won't replace it under the warranty just for it freezing up and now even with the app library upgrade too, that keeps force closing so you can't even download your apps back onto it from having to reset it when updating the software.  How insane is that????  The device is defective obviously if the update still doesn't fix it and yet I can't get it fixed with the warranty.  I definately recommend DO NOT BUY!! You would only be wasting you money.  I am now going to be getting me the Samsung Galaxy Tab instead that doesn't have anywhere close to the issues this has.
