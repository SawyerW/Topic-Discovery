The device set up is devious. I got just one chance to enter my Wi-fi password. I did so correctly, but it was quickly denied with a recommendation that I set up the iPad up using iTunes, another piece of Apple related software. If you don't have access to a computer-- tough luck! I downloaded ITunes onto my computer, connected the iPad, and low and behold, this time it accepted my Wi-Fi password. Could it be that I was manipulated to get iTunes loaded onto my computer? And while I was about it I had to uncheck opportunities to download other Apple software that I don't want.  Anyway, the iPad screen device lit up, finally! If the iPad had eyes it would have seen my scowling face, but I pressed on and eventually set up my e-mail account. The clock on the iPad face was wrong so I tried to change it. That should be easy right? Wrong! Internal clocks gave correct time for all over the world, but the clock on the icon was wrong. Hmm, I thought I'd better look at the manual, which of course is not included with the product. However, the tiny info card that comes with the iPad says it's available on the Apple web site. Ah, ha! I found it. But it wants to know what software is in my iPad. If there's an easy way to determine that, it escapes me. I suppose it's in the manual but if you don't know what manual to look for, you have the perfect catch 22. Anyway I made a guess and looked at the manual. There are 137 pages. At this point I decided the iPad is not user friendly and I'll return it . . . as soon as I've found out how to remove my e-mail password now stored somewhere within the iPad type 2 with software type ????
