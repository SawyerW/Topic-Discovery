The Toshiba Thrive does run the current Honeycomb build of Android, as you do have access to Google Movies, but the story of this device is the ports. You get a full-size USB port, mini-usb port, full-size SD card slot & full-size HDMI port. The HD dock gives you two more USB ports and one HDMI port, so you could plug a mouse, keyboard and hard drive into the Thrive at the same time and theoretically drive content to two monitors. Toshiba has included a file manager, so that when you plug in your external hard drive, you will be able to view all of your files in a very easy to read interface. There is also support for MS Office documents and the usual productivity apps from the Marketplace as well. Not only that, but Toshiba has included a full-functioning media player that supports Windows Media files, either audio or video. This means that you will not need to convert files for playback on the Thrive from your Windows PC. This is the only Android tablet that does this, until the Lenovo Thinkpad hits the market on Tuesday.With the Thrive and upcoming Thinkpad, you can actually be productive on a tablet and these are the only two examples of Android tablets that you can say that about. The only bummer here is that for some reason, the Honeycomb Netflix app does not yet support streaming on the Thrive, but I'm sure it will be coming shortly. I would only recommend this device for office use, as it's value is best served in the workplace. For consumer devices utilized mostly for content consumption, there are other Android tablets that are better options for that. Having said that, I can highly recommend the Thrive for use in the office. It has been a very useful tool for me.
