I'm very happy with the Cruz Micro e-reader and I'm only interested in it as an e-book reader. Now that that's out of the way...I first went to the site [...] which has support for the reader and updated the firmware . According to the FAQ on the site some Android apps are compatible with the Cruz e-reader including the Kindle app and the Nook app, so I tried to download and install them. What a exercise in frustration! I finally called the support line and after about 10 minutes I was talking to a native English speaking individual. After describing my problem I was informed that yes, the Cruz is indeed compatible with some Android apps including the Kindle app. However...you can't download and install them without some serious work at finding a site from which to download them. The Kindle app and the Nook app are not available on the Cruz app store...yet, they are on the Android app store, but you can't download and install them from the Android app store to the Cruz e-reader. IOW you can use them if you can find them!! The gentleman on the phone was very helpful and provided me with the sites to find the necessary apps but that should not have been necessary. The Cruz reader support site should have expanded on the fact that you cannot easily find and download them to use on the Cruz e-reader and is very misleading about how easily they can be downloaded and installed. I now have the Nook app, the Kindle app, and the Borders app.On the plus side the Cruz e-reader was pretty easy to get networked with my home Wi-Fi even with the router using WPA-2 PSK and Mac address filtering. Discovering how to find the Mac address can be a bit challenging and seems rather unduly convoluted.All in all this reader is definitely worth the [...] we paid for it when it was on sale.
