As others have said, it's a good value for $200.  But I take that a little bit further and say that I'd rather have this gadget than the $500 iPad.  Why?  Here's why.-It is smaller and almost half the weight.  This makes it comfortable to hold and view with one hand, which is difficult with the iPad.  I plan to hold on to it and watch videos while stationary biking at the gym, which would be difficult with a bigger tablet.-The screen is matte.  It has much less glare than the iPad.-I use it mainly to watch videos.  In this capacity, it excels, supporting more video formats than the iPad, and coming in a widescreen format instead of 4x3.-It does most things as well or nearly as well as the iPad.  Aldiko is a great ebook reader, you can download Swype to make typing super fast, videos and music play great, etc.-It plays youtube and flash videos if you use the Skyfire browser.Of course, there are drawbacks.  I wouldn't give it a low rating though because it's missing features that only come with $500 tablets.-The screen is resistive, and occasionally doesn't register your tap.  This improves with time, if you turn on the click-on-tap sound setting.-The Android marketplace doesn't work from the device.  To get apps beyond the basic ones, you must either install another marketplace (like Slideme) or search around the web.-The chip is supposedly slower to lower the pricepoint.  I haven't noticed this much.So for a student, or younger working type without much cash, this is an insane buy.  Tons of tablets will be coming out this year, but this one works perfectly fine and may still be cheaper than anything else coming out for a long time.  7 inches is a perfect size right in between small phones and big iPads, and I've enjoyed using it in various situations during the week I've owned one.Enjoy!
