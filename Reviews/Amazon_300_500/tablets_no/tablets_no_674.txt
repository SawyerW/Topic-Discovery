I used this for months before even thinking about writing a review, mostly because I didn't have all that much occasion to "authentically" use it. I can't, unfortunately, compare this to other brands of portable GPS, as my only other GPS experience has been with Honda's built-in system. If you have to have GPS, don't have a smart phone, and are unlikely to need this on-the-fly, I could recommend it. But not without reservation.The biggest problem I've had with it is that it takes FOREVER for the unit to acquire a signal when first turned on. It seems like the longer it's been off, the longer it takes to get a satellite signal, but I wouldn't swear to that. Sometimes, though, it takes ten or fifteen minutes, and if I'm actually trying to go somewhere, I very rarely have that long to wait.Once it does get the satellite, it works fairly well, though it's not super-intuitive. The touch screen isn't greatly accurate, but it works well enough. You definitely can't use it while you're driving, but, I mean, I guess you're not supposed to do that anyway.The maps are good and accurate, but the route is never the one I'd choose. This is true of all auto-mapping software, though, and just a problem with the genre.The screen is bright and easy to see, and the contrast changes automatically for day or night, which is nice. I can't figure out how to shut up the woman who gives the directions for more than a few minutes a time, which is the number one reason I've pretty much completely stopped using it.Again, most of these issues are with the genre itself, and this unit does perform well (other than the satellite thing), and seems reasonably priced for what you get. Recommended, but of course with these caveats.
