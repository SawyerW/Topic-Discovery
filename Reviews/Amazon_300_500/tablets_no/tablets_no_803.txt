This is definitely productivity. The windows 7 with slate is not totally perfect, somethings you click other things that you did not want to but is good enough. The best slate to make drawing with the digitizer pen. I totally recommend the product. I installed a lot of programs and agree that the memory is not enough but i'm planning to buy the Lexar Professional 128 GB 133x SDXC Card. which is going to give me more memory than hopefully i will ever need in a portable computer. I've been playing with this Slate for about two weeks and I can tell you that no problems have been shown so far regard of functionality, speed, or quality. I think Asus is in the right direction, if this is the first generation I cant wait to see the second or third generations. i heard rumors that they released a new windows 7 Slate which has a bottom charger that fits in a dock station, that dock station has a bigger battery, hard disk and keyboard which makes the slate a laptop as well just detaching and attaching the slate to the dock station. I wanted to buy the iPad last year but i have so many windows based programs that i decided to wait, i knew that someone will eventually make a decent windows based slate and the time is right here, this is the one. some people say that this first generation slate is the bad just because is the first one but as a real Asus EP121 buyer i can tell you its just the best, much better that anything on the market so far.UPDATE AS MARCH 17:Lexar just released the 128 GB SD Card. with that baby you will hardly ever need more storage. I personally use the installed 64GB memory for program installation and those confidential documents, pictures and other stuffs i do not want to keep secret. and the 128 GB SD Card for storing the music, videos, movies, etc that usually are more memory consuming. And of course I back up the SD every often with my desk pc which has much more memory[...]
