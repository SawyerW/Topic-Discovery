This review is for the original Nexus 7, 32gb. I have had my Nexus 7 for about 9 months and life has not been easy for the poor machine. I have a 5 year old who loves to play games on it and has been known to drop it, I have dropped it myself a few times, it gets carried in a messenger bag 4 miles every day while I walk the bumpy streets and get jostled in the subway, and I even left it outside on the top of the car (who put it on top of the car is still up for debate) for 3 days which included being driven around for miles on bumpy streets and getting rained on. Thankfully I have a cheap case which seems to do a decent job protecting the device (there was moisture sitting on the machine itself after being left outside for a few days). The Nexus 7 keeps ticking. It keeps providing hours of enjoyment watching movies I have loaded onto the hard drive, as well as through Netflix,and provides plenty of music and light gaming for the families enjoyment. I also use it to access email, surf the internet, read books, and plenty of other things. The device has slowed down since I originally received it, but not horribly noticeably. It still runs well with most thing I use it for and I have had no serious issues, never lost data, never had it malfunction, and never needed it serviced. It is certainly worth the cheap price it's offered at. I hear the new Nexus models are faster, lighter, and better over all , so I may need to pick up another one for the family.As for battery life, mine seems to take a while to charge, however, once charge it holds it's charge for a LONG time. I am not kidding when I say that it was used almost non-stop during a 7+ hour car ride with video or gaming, and never once did we need to plug it in (it has done this trip several times).
