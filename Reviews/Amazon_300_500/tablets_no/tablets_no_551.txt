This was on sale for $99 on Black Friday so I thought it would be an OK, cheap option for the kids. I had low expectations for $99 (I dislike reviews where people clearly didn't understand what they were paying for), but even at that I still feel let down. On the plus side, it has a USB port and an SD card slot for importing files.BUT...You can't download typical apps. Forget Angry Birds. Forget YouTube. You have to use the Facebook mobile site. YouTube's webpage wouldn't load. I was able to get Gmail, but that's not exactly something I'd pay $99 for. We thought we might upgrade to Android 2.2 but the hardware under the hood still prevented the aforementioned issues. While I expected no Android Market, the Cruz Market was awful. So not much in the game department. We then got the idea that it might be a good media player- I loaded the regular SD card on, connected the USB to my computer to transfer MP3 files, and the thing then promptly crashed.Now here's the thing: If you are going to be a paperweight that lights up, at least light up. So we had to re-set the thing and *maybe* it will be an OK media player with the SD card I supplied. Please bear in mind that we didn't just open this on Christmas, we've been tinkering with the thing since Black Friday so it would be ready out of the Box after Santa visited.  But time is money, and the low cost is cancelled out by the time suck to get the thing to be a hundred bucks wroth of useful at something. We then bought Coby Kyros 7-Inch Android 2.3 4 GB Internet Tablet with Capacitive Touchscreen - MID7022-4G (Black) and they were a superior option for the time/money.It is an OK eReader or mobile web browser and that's about it. If that's your thing, it is more than a 2. However, if you want some typical games for the kids so they'll leave your iPad or Galaxy alone, it is lacking.
