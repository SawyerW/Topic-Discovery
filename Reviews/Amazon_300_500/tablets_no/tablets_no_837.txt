Got the Toshiba 16GB Thrive for over 3 months now & has been happy thriving...  find the SD slot, the USB & HDMI ports indispensable...  the picture is crisp & bright...  yeah, the sound isn't too good but at least it's stereo...  the GPS driving mode works but you do need Wi-Fi connection initially to search for the directions to your destination, but you do not need any Wi-Fi connection after the directions are established for the GPS to work...  I purchased screen protectors when buying this tablet but I have not need to use them yet since the original screen film/protector that the tablet came with works great, it's durable & bubble-free... (I just carefully cut the tiny peel-off tab from the bottom-left corner of the film & also scratched off the big TOSHIBA logo in the middle of the film, the rest of the writing around the borders came off on its own in about a month...)  & I got a good priced Belkin neoporene case for the tablet for carrying in my bag which works great...UPDATE Jan 2013:After a little over a year of frequent use but with good handling, the tablet proved to be not as rugged as it appeared.  One corner of the tablet rim (the frame part b/t the screen & the back cover) chipped off (about 1/2 inch) which I crazy-glued back on.  Also, I'm starting to notice some extra give of the tablet rim from the back body of the tablet, like it's un-gluing apart; hopefully I can get at least another year of life with this tablet before it falls apart totally.  The rugged look of this tablet is definitely deceiving.  My friend's I-pad that are rough handled by their toddlers are holding up strong even after 2 years.  I also upgraded my tablet to ICS, & soon afterwards the tablet was not charging, but when I took the battery out & reset the tablet, it charged up fine again.  Other then these problems, the tablet still works well, but I will remove 1 star from my original rating b/c the tablet's physical body is not as durable as expected.
