This is a review of the Nexus 7 tablet, branded Google, made by Asus, 7" with 32GB storage.  I am mainly comparing this model to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, a 7" with 8 GB storage, but with an expansion slot.  I recently acquired the Galaxy model, and reviewed and returned it.  Recent builds of the Android operating system do not make good use of storage expansion.  You may not install apps to it, and many apps which write data cannot be configured to write to it.  While you can use the storage to copy large media files, I felt that the 8 GB available for apps was too limiting.  so I returned the Galaxy and acquired the Nexus.The Nexus is a near ideal 7" tablet.  Android runs beautifully on it, with apps opening noticeably snappier than on the Galaxy.  The processor seems faster and the screen resolution is higher.  Additionally the rear of the unit, with a kind of a textured rubber is friendlier for holding the unit.  I don't want to be too disparaging of the Galaxy, as it is a strong and capable unit.  I just feel that the Nexus is better.  (As I write this, there is word of a Samsung Galaxy 3, so the market is rapidly evolving).The Nexus has the latest version of Android (Jelly Bean), and can be set to automatically update the OS and any apps in the background.  Wifi performance has been excellent.  Netflix and HBO streaming video run very well, and it is, of course, an excellent ereader, supporting the Kindle app and others.  The unit has stereo speakers, but for any serious listening, you will want to use headphones.  The audio volume through the speakers is low, and even through headphones it doesn't get really loud.  I am fine with this, and I note also that there are apps available for boosting volume.In short, everything I've thrown at the Nexus has been handled well.
