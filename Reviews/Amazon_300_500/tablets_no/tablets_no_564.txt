Creative's Ziio is definitely one of the more affordable tablets now on the market.  Depending on what you're looking for in a tablet, this may (or may not) be the right one for you.It does a fantastic (10/10) job at playing a huge variety of media file formats without a hitch.  It plays divx, xvid, mkv (some mkv files play without sound, unfortunately), and more.  It even supports video formats that my wife's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1" is unable to play.  Also, does great with mp3 and other sound files.  So, if you're looking for a straight up media player, and nothing more, this is the gadget for you.  It also has a mini hdmi-out jack (no cable included), for viewing your media files on TV.However, it doesn't excel at anything else.  Not being able to download apps from the app store is, of course, a huge drawback.  In addition, the browser is pretty awful because it lacks its own "BACK" button.  Often, when you hit the permanent back arrow below the screen, it will minimize the browser instead of taking you back to the last page viewed.  It's absolutely necessary to install another browser, especially if you want to view pages like facebook, which is basically unviewable from the built-in browser.  Also, for some reason, you cannot view youtube in full screen mode -- I can't figure that one out.The speed of the device isn't great, either.  There tends to be a (very slight) lag when you switch from one application to another.  Many apps don't work on the device because of the lack of system resources or other compatibility issues.  It is also absolutely essential to install adobe flash -- which is hard to do when you can't download it from an app store (and for some reason, it will not install from adobe's website!).  One final nitpick, if you want to use your own headphone/mic combo cord, no dice -- you can only use the built-in mic.The way I see it, this is a solid media player that also lets you surf the internet (although it doesn't do a great job of it).
