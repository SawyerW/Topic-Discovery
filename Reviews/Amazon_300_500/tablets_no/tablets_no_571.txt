I should first mention I have a Creative Zen 32 GB and really love it, so I was really excited to get to try this tablet.  The device does have semblance of the Android operating system and allows you to do much of what you would with any other Android tablets.Describing the device, the case is plastic but it  doesn't feel cheap.  This Tablet feels more like the Amazon Kindle 2 only with a color display.  You can use skype with this tablet, it has a microphone and a poor quality camera but it works for general use.  This device supports Amazon App Store and most of the daily free apps will work on this device with no issue.  There are some preinstalled apps from creative I wish could be removed but I can live with that.  I really appreciate that this device has a slot for an SD card and it recognized my 16 GB micro SD card with no issues allowing me to double the storage.  Physically I wish the buttons at the bottom were backlit.  Especially at night on a flight you have to turn on a light to verify the button you are pressing, although in time you will learn their positions without needing light.  The screen isn't horrible, but it's isn't great.  It's a resistive screen thus it responds to pressure of your finger or stylus to take input.  Sometimes the device wasn't as responsive as I thought it should have been to touch.  The included stylus is ok, would consider purchasing a better one like this one Amazon Basics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices.I ended up purchasing a different device and gave this as a gift to a friend.  The Creative Ziio supports flash, allows memory to be expanded and is generally a decent tablet.  I would recommend this device as a starter tablet but deduct 2 stars for some of the design issues I highlighted.
