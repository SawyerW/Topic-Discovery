Here's my experience with the Toshiba Thrive 32 gig at105:1. I got it to be a book reader and web browser. 5 stars for both.  I downloaded Firefox Mobile and it works great.I can type on the keyboard with no problem and the response is great. No complaints.I downloaded Adobe Reader for Android and now I can read pdf books  to my heart's content. I can zoom in and out even on color pictures, just like on my desktop computer.I downloaded wordplayer and now I can read .epub and .mobi books beautifully with full font and spacing control and apparently can link up with calibre library on my desktop. Can adjust brightness while reading books by swiping up and down. Couldn't be happier with the reading capabilities.2. I tried to connect to an external usb hard drive and was unable. I think it has to be reformatted to exFat which I haven't looked up yet. But: This Toshiba at105 supports sdhx natively, which means you can put a 128 gig sdxc card in the full-sized sd slot. By the way the max capacity for sdxc is 2 TB, although I don't think you can buy bigger than 128 gig right now.3. One star of for it being 1.5 lbs. I knew that going in but I wanted full size usb and sd and hdmi slots. I am willing to put up with 3 oz more than Galaxy Tab 10.1 to have those slots! If  you read books than this is lighter than some books that you might read and actually in landscape mode is about as wide as an open book. I read in both landscape and portrait mode and love them both.4. If you want light- get a phone. But if you want to read and browse just like on your desktop: here it is.edit: April 19, 2014. Almost 3 years now. Absolutely no problems. Not even a scratch on the screen. Love the  full size ports. Plug the hdmi directly to  my tv and do youtube or anything else. Only negative is it's a little bit on the heavy side.
