This is an amazing device! Just an oversized iPod Touch? That comparison always amuses me. Really? Ok....then buy an iPod Touch and write letters, and read articles and/books, watch videos, etc. on that tiny little screen. One of the major points of the iPad is it's larger screen!!  Some guy wrote about how the iPad sucks because of fingerprints on the screen. Really??? He must have filthy fingers!! When using my iPad I don't ever see fingerprints that get in the way of using the device. Oh sure, I see them when the unit is OFF, and then I wipe it clean if needed. But when it's on?? Please.The iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people "purchase" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say "it sucks" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows? But I doubt it.
