I purchased the Toshiba Thrive mostly for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. I was mostly interested in getting it for learning games and Kindle books for her. I was debating between this versus the Kindle Fire. I'm extremely happy with my decision based on a few features.Pros:-Nice size. A 10.1" tablet isn't the best if you're traveling a lot or are really interested in having a light, small tablet. But it's perfect for watching movies and playing games.-Screen: The screen isn't equal to say the iPad, but it's pretty close. For rougly half the price it's a really great product. We use it for watching Netflix and it delivers a great picture. Also use it for reading childrens Kindle picture books and it has great quality with that as well.-Android OS: Really enjoy the usability of this tablet. The OS is very smooth and easy to use. My 7 year old has no problems with it.-Removable battery-Speed: I can browse the internet easily with this and feel like it's pretty fast.Cons:-Sound: The sound quality sucks. When we're watching a movie on this the sound has to be turned all the way up, there can't be any other noises around and you have to keep your hands away from the speaker or you just can't hear anything. Headphones make it better, but there's only one jack. This is the worst thing about the tablet in my opinion. If you're thinking of getting this for media functions like movies and music, you might want to go to an electronics store to try it out first.-Battery life: Not nearly as good as the iPad, but again, it's half the price, so I can deal with it. It does have a removable babbery, so it would be feasible to get an extra for long trips and such. When we take it out we leave WiFi off and don't really have a problem with it dying.
