I have owned my N810 (affectionately named N8 - or Nate) for about 6 months now and it has become invaluable to me.  These are the activities with which I use it:- communication, using Google Voice, or Skype- receiving and sending email, either via included email client, or web-based email- web browsing- watching and saving YouTube videos- tracking and mapping via GPS unit- taking notes- games/entertainment with OS2008 games, or using Palm Emulator and my favorite old Palm Pilot games- listening to music; sound quality is EXCELLENT for a hand-held (and I'm a musician, and picky)!- recording voice notes- taking photos and making small videos for online use- keeping recipes; its small size make it excellent for reading in my tiny kitchen...and I can listen to music at the same time!- reading eBooks- text messaging via Google Voice/wifiThere are only a couple of cons that I have found so far.  The front-facing camera, intended for use in video conferencing, makes photography tricky at best.  This is acceptable to me, though, since it was never meant to replace a digital camera.  The other is that the O/S will require a learning curve for the average point-and-click Windows user.  While the device is definitely easy to pick up and use with the installed software, and loading new programs from either the Nokia website or the maemo site using the application manager, most more detailed tasks will require a certain amount of learning for most; in short, it ain't Windows :).There are numerous other uses and apps for this device. Even after 6 months I feel I've hardly scratched the surface of its possibilities. It is always on the road with me, has replaced my laptop on weekend trips, and replaced my more cumbersome bedtime books and magazines. It has saved me money in this way, and also in cell phone/texting costs; it has already paid for itself - probably twice over.In short, N8 has replaced both my Zune and my Palm Pilot, and become itself an irreplaceable part of my life.
