I think some of the negative reviews of this product were written before the more recent firmware update - after the update, I haven't hit into any bugs.  This is a great product at a great price with one caveat; there is no android market.  If you're okay with downloading apk files from another website & copying it over, this isn't an issue at all.  Here are my pro's;Pros- Great price compared to other tablets- Bundled apps (Music, Video, epub reader, etc) are actually quite good.- Fast CPU, tasks are very snappy- Long battery life - I can watch about 6 hours of video before a recharge, many many hours of music- Bluetooth is low latency.  You can watch a video with bluetooth headphones and it will be in sync.- X-fi crystalizer works & makes your music sound better.  Not the gimmick I thought it would be.- Video playback is high quality - plays everything I've thrown at it without any problems and you can hook it up to a TV over HDMI- microSD slot is niceCons- There should be a slot for the stylus in the device- The touch buttons on the bottom are hard to find in the dark- No android market.  Most Google apps work (maps, earth, navigation), but a few don't (reader).- Consider the camera a bonus.  It has the quality of an average webcam- Power button is hard to hit- No flash, although an upgrade is supposed to be on the way (March, 2011)Overall, I'm enjoying it a lot - good price & good performance.  I also like the resistive screen because I like being able to use a stylus.  This resistive screen is very usable with fingers, too.  Creative put a lot of work into the entertainment capabilities, and the software & quality are top notch.
