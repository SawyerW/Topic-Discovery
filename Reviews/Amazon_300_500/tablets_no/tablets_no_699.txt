I was bummed when I missed out on the closeouts of the HP Touchpad. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a tablet when I have 2 small children. So, I'd been looking for some time for a tablet that was reasonably priced & got good reviews. I am so happy to have found LePan. I have an Android phone, so for me, it was simple to use. It's not perfect & I'm sure if you're really techy or want all the bells & whistles & latest OS, etc, this isn't for you. But, if you're looking for a good quality tablet that's fairly priced, THIS IS IT! And under $200, was a steal!!PROS:~Easy interface~Great graphics, including video.~Good sound (I'm not listening to music all the time though)~Solid~Expandable to 32GB~Not a lot of "bloat"ware pre-loaded!~Able to download apps from not just android market but others~Good Wi-Fi speedCONS:~Front facing ONLY camera (a bit weird, but I don't really need it as a camera, my phone is 8mp)~Freezing when battery is low (quick fix with reset button)~No "accessories" other than carrying case~Proprietary plug~Navigation keys aren't raised & go dark after a few seconds when on same page for some time, making it a little difficult to hit correct key when you're in the dark.I have yet to update the firmware. The company posted instructions & on the first day, they were very confusing, but they have since updated them & seems to be easier than I thought. I did call the company, had to leave a message, but I did hear back from them that same day. Also made 2 "cases" after registering my tablet on their website & have very quick responses from them (both were also reason I called). I haven't tried skype yet, but there are plenty of others that have given advice on how to fix that problem. (I also have it on my phone, so not too big of a deal for me).I wanted something to email, browse web, & keep kids entertained while out & about. This exceeds those capabilities! I even downloaded a texting app & can text from it, instead of using my phone!I didn't give it 5 stars because of the older OS, difficulty updating the firmware & the freezing. I would have given it 4.5, but that wasn't an option.I'm glad I got it before they were out of stock! Originally bought from Amazon with 2 day shipping, but there was delay & wasn't going to get it until after xmas, so canceled & got it from Walmart. (Walmart added tax & a special fee)If you're on the fence & don't have a lot of $ to spend, or worried because you have small kids . . .this is the tablet for you!! My kids love it!! & so do I!
