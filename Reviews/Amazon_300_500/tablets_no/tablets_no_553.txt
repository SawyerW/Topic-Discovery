The Velocity Cruz is a great product! IF you are only looking for a e reader that has additional features. As a e reader it functions well although the page flip time had a noticeable lag compared to running the same Kindle software on a iPhone 3GS. The web browser it came with was kind of sketchy but a upgrade to Skyfire made web browsing acceptable. It also opened up the ability to watch flash based videos and made you tube videos clear (the you tube app it came with is unusable! video is all blocky and choppy.) Getting Skyfire loaded ended up being a real chore since the Cruz does NOT have access to the Android marketplace despite what the product details say: Access to the official Android App store. WRONG! it only has access to its on app poor store. Access to the Android app  store is denied! After using a mirror site to download Skyfire web browsing and video were acceptable,Most apps will not install and those that will install do not usually work. Angry Birds, Forget it! There is NO workaround to load Adobe Flash 10.1 on here either.Initially I was very excited to get this, even paid the $10 for the ability to edit Microsoft office on this. But the excitement quickly wore out and I tried to do everything I could to keep this. I gave it up, it doesn't do what the product detail say it does, does some of it half-a@@ and performs the rest well, after some help.If you are ONLY looking for a e reader with web capabilities, ok. But this is sooooo dangerously close to the full potential it could have had, it will be hard to justify the price within a few weeks. Spend the $50 more and buy a minipad running Android 2.2 with twice the on-board memory 512MB, full 1080p HDMI output, Adobe Flash etc.Do your research and there are models out there with slightly more cost and MUCH better performance!
