This has to be by far the worst purchase I have ever made and after over two years of owning this slate, I'm fed up and want to warn others. Battery life is depressing, averaging 2h running on power savings mode, WiFi disabled, screen time out after 30 or so seconds of inactivity and lowest brightness. The CPU is okay for day to day activities but you can forget watching HD videos (that's if you like your movies littered with lag spikes and slow downs). ANY sort of gaming fails on it and I mean any, not even Counter-Strike or Quake III, games made circa 9/11 run smoothly on it at 640x480 as well as all newer games. Music production also is very limited on this guy as a few instances of the most basic of VSTs, a few Kontakt instruments and some convolution will send it flying to >75% CPU usage in FL Studio 11. It can't even handle recording from my Presonus USB Audiobox without huge pops and delays. The USB port covers will break your nails trying to pry them open, the screen developed yellow splotches around the edges of screen and it will sometimes start tapping/clicking repeatedly the top right hand corner of the screen, the bluetooth module stopped working all together alongside, the micro-HDMI no longer is detected on monitors/TVs and the headphone jack reverted to mono output shortly after I bought it. The turbo boost feature also never fails to turn on when I least need it and only makes an appearance on boot up or when I'm hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL. The only redeeming features were the quick SSD, stylus capabilities which helped me with my studies tremendously and the adequate ram. For something I paid upwards $1000 for this is a joke on consumers. This will be the last Asus purchase I will make and I'll advise every human being I encounter from here on out to run away from Asus products like it's a volcano that just exploded raining ash and other mediocre products onto everyone around it.
