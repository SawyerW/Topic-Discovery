Hello all concerned.  I can't believe I am writing a pre-review.  I am so tired to buying and trying the big 3 (iPad 1 & 2, XOOM, and ACER A500).  I was about to return the XCOOM and go back to the Acer Android when I came across this machine.  WOW, just what I was looking for and I read every review.  The main application I tested on each of the big 3 was a product called LogMeIn and Documents to go.  Well, LogMeIn gave me the functionality but it was from my Home computer not the unit itself.  Furthermore if I could not get a good and fast line to the internet, it performed dismally.  Then there was Documents to go...  I was somewhat impressed until I tried to use a moderately complex workbook that had spreadsheets pointing to one another and used auto-filters to a great extent.  I could not even see my data.Then in comes the realization, Jack you need a Windows 7 device so you don't need this stuff and problems.  Further with Windows 7 I am able to use SharePoint so I will always have the latest files available to either my home computer or my Acer W500.  The Keyboard is a real bonus as well.  With the Keyboard, I am saving an additional $110 over the $599 price of the XOOM.  so I bought this here for $449 instead of $709 and expect to have highly superior functionality.This all would be moot if I were just looking for a music and video machine.  Then one of the Big 3 would have sufficed.Thank you for listening and I promise I will write and update to this after I have used my new machine for at least 1 week if not 2.  I should get it on Monday thanks to the $3.99 for Overnight since I paid Amazon for the Premier upgrade...  A very good investment if you buy just 3 or 4 such items a year...Bye for now...  Jack
