We put a SwitchEasy cover on our iPad 2 immediately to protect it, and after many months in a house of 4, it still looks and performs the same as it did in the early days.It's a beautiful unit, with a weight that beats out the other tablets.  But really, it isn't the quick loading time, ease of multi-tasking, handsome hardware, beautiful resolution, or even cost that made us get this over other tablets.  It's the ability to have so many tens of thousands of applications.I use Kindle app, Moviefone, Scrabble, Netflix, and Groupon all the time.My 3 year old uses Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and wide variety of educational apps and games.My 6 month old loves Itsy Bitsy Spider and other children's apps with music and interactivity. She loves to send the spider climbing.My husband loves playing with the newest apps like Vid Rhythm (from the company that makes Rock Band).When my husband's parents visited from England, they loved it that the daily crossword puzzle on The Guardian's website was FREE and interactive.We all love getting on Skype to speak to family in other countries.  The camera is great and I even took it outside last weekend to show my sister how well my tomatoes are doing.On early weekend mornings, we usually put educational DVDs for my son. However, my husband likes to watch England Premier League football. So what he does is watch it on the iPad while my son gets to watch his DVDs...everyone is happy!It's been stepped on, dropped, taken to the beach, on picnics, and has endured a lot of use with no problems.  And through all of that it has given us so much entertainment, access to information, connection with friends and family (Facebook, Skype, email, you name it), peace at the restaurant ("here, why don't you play with Thomas the Tank Engine?"), and something to do while sitting in a hospital (streaming Netflix instead of the $12 daily charge at the hospital).It's absolutely wonderful.
