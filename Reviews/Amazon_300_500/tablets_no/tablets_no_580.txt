I read up on this before I bought one from Woot a few weeks ago. The fairly consistent word on the web is that the hardware is very good, although the screen leaves a little to be desired (poor viewing angle. lower resolution than the Xoom). I've upgraded 2 and I have another one the way. The biggest hurdle you will have with this device is when you first power it up. After you try to play with it for a few minutes and setup WiFi it will probably hang up, reboot, and /or forget any settings you put in the first time. Don't panic or get discouraged. The second time it starts up you SHOULD be able to setup a WiFi connection and do the first update. It is pretty stable once the update is installed. You will need to do some Google searching and studying but if you have fairly average computer skills you should have little trouble installing one of the custom ROMs out there. I recommend installing ClockworkMod08, then VeganTAB5.1 Final and the Beta Vegan Launcher for Tablets. TNT Lite is ok but the Vegan Tablet Launcher works better with VeganTab and is way better than the other launchers you get. I'm holding back the 5th star only because of all the work you have to do to make this a great tablet. Once all the upgrades are done, it deserves a 5 star rating, especially considering the price, roughly half the price of the Xoom. It's really more like 2 stars out of the box, 3 stars after the first update, and 5 if you install Vegan (ROM + Tablet Launcher). With all the development going on for the gTablet across the web, I would not be surprised to see Gingerbread and probably even Honeycomb to become available at some point in the future.
