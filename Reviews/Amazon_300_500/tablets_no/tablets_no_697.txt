- This is a great tablet for 1/3 price of an IPAD2.- Use IPAD2 covers & case($7). They fit almost perfect except the navigation buttons and camera. I cut those out to tailor fit.- SD micro card upgraded to 32mb ($29).- Movies (flv,mp4) are easily recognized on the SD card by navigating to the folder you place it in.- I own an IPOD Touch, but getting use to the Android system is easy & intuitive. More flexible than iTunes. Keeps the tablet independent of the PC, with connections to PC if needed (MicroSD, USB, BlueTooth).- Speakers are very good------------------------------------ Standby & Freezing----------------------------------The StandBy mode does not work. If I allow the unit to go into Standby, I will need to press the reset button to restart it. I always turn the unit OFF when I'm done. It takes 20 seconds to turn ON, and another 20 seconds to grab onto WIFI. As a casual user, I don't mind waiting 1 minute for the unit to come up and ready. For business users, this is no good.The unit also freezes sometimes. A few times in the middle of a Appl download. I reset to restart and it continued & finish download. A few times in the middle of just using it. Again, for casual use, no problem. I'm not sure if this is inherently an Android 2.2 issue, or a LePan hardware issue.They should have just made a button for the RESET switch vs the indented style that requires a sharp object to press. I keep a paperclip with my case to reset the unit.-------------------------- Summary------------------------For Casual users it is an excellent mix of functionality, speed & value.Not for business or heavy users due to Standby & Freezing issues.####### UPDATE #######################################################After returning my unit for a replacement, all the issues above have been resolved. No more freezing, and the standby works wonderfully. Obviously, the last unit was malfunctioning and thanks to other Amazon reviewers that replied back with their experience, it convinced me to return and hope for a better unit.  Raising my review from 4 stars to 5 stars now. Excellent!
