Pros- The design is great. I love how thin this is compared to the first model. Not bulky at all and very easy to carry around. Also, it looks very sleek and modern.- The battery life is wonderful. I use my iPad 2 for hours on end and by the end of the day, there is still more than 50% battery.- Facetime is a great feature. My boyfriend and I Facetime daily and it's just like being there with him. Really cool and great for people who want to video chat with their family or friends.- Great resolution. Nearly every app and feature of this device is crystal clear. Better than an HDTV.- There are literally thousands of apps that one could download & lot of great free ones.- Very fast internet that NEVER freezes or force closes. Even the most detailed, memory eating web pages will load in a couple of seconds.- You could view many websites at once. With the iPad 2, you don't have to close your Yahoo! e-mail to access your Facebook. With this, you could open up several tabs to multitask.- Fast touch keyboard that is large enough to not make mistakes. I take my college notes on this daily and it's fast enough and easy enough to keep up with even the fastest-speaking prof.- Good memory space. I only got the 16GB and I'm very surprised at how much data it holds.Cons- The camera is ABSOLUTELY horrible. When I went to take my first picture, I couldn't help but notice the graininess of the camera. So, if you're looking to purchase this & do a TON of photography, I wouldn't recommend it. It's worse than a 1990s digital camera. Less than one megapixel.- Sometimes the screen rotates without me flipping it. Not a huge deal but it could get annoying.As you can see, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Overall, it's a good device and a smart buy. You could practically use it anywhere and for nearly everything. Very glad that I purchased this.
