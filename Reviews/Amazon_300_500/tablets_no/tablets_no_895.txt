I wanted to wait for Galaxy Tab 8.9, but just decided to get this since I preferred 7 inch screen for more portability reason. This device is just half the size of iPad. I use this device for watching movies I downloaded which are divx, xvid, mkv codec movies. So far, I haven't had any problem playing any types of movie files I have. It even plays .mkv file over 3GB. One thing to clarify on the other review is that connecting to PC USB port actually charges (but slowly) somehow status says it's not being charged. Same thing happen when I connect to an external battery, it slowly charges, but status says it's not being charged.Pros:-you can watch HD video in original format (divx, xvid, mkv, etc) without conversion.-wifi-only version has GPS (unlike iPad). I installed MapDroyd(lets you download maps) for off-line navigation-full support of Flash (so far, no issues accessing flash sites that I usually visit)-SD card slot (for up to 32GB)-comes with ThinkFree office (you can read .doc .pdf, and etc)-you have choice of 3 app stores (Google Market, Amazon app store, Samsung app store) Samsung app for u.s. version has only few apps now, but hope it grows bigger-portable size - you can hold with one hand, and it goes into your pocket-you can connect to any pc to transfer the files (movies, musics, docs, etc) unlike iPad which requires iTunes.Cons:-Reader's Hub is missing somehow.-Proprietary connector instead of mini or micro USB-most of the apps I installed work fine with the resolution, but a few apps are displayed smaller in the center (for example: Engadget app)So far, I'm very happy with the purchase. I own iPad too, but recently I haven't really used iPad because this tablet. I wish I get gingerbread upgrade for Galaxy Tab soon.
