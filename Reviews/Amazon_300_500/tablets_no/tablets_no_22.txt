This tablet is excellent! It's fast, sleek, and powerful. The myriad of apps available on the android market and the smoothness of this tablet makes me want to take it everywhere! With a MoKo Slim-fit Case for Google Nexus 7, it looks kind of like a small Bible which I'm used to carrying around anyway. With the Bible app, I don't even have to bring my leather Bible anywhere.I love sitting down, reading, browsing, listening to music, and playing games with it. I have notebook apps for school, planners, calendars, and more. I considered buying an Ipad mini because I don't want to carry large devices (might as well carry a laptop), but when I looked at comparison videos I saw that the Ipad mini couldn't really be carried with one hand like this baby can. This feels really great in the hand and once again, it looks great! It looks like I'm carrying around a small book and can even fit in big jeans pockets or pretty much any jacket pocket. For ladies, it easily fits into any size purse. It also beats the Ipad mini in price by about $100. It even beats the price of most smart phones! I haven't tried it yet, but I heard you can even use it as a phone, albeit a big phone. The stereo quality isn't very good compared to the speakers I have hooked up to my laptop (Insignia NS-PLTPSP2 2 Piece Speaker System), but that's to be expected.Pretty much my only complaint of this device is the lack of a back facing camera. That means, if I want to take a picture of something I have to turn it around and look at it from the side... which is kind of awkward. Still, most people have smart phones or actual cameras for pictures so it wasn't really a deal breaker for me.Anyway, this is a great product and I am one satisfied customer!
