The first tablet I tried was a Galaxy Tab.  It had a great display, was light weight, and very fast.  However, it lacked support for SD cards or thumb drives and only had a proprietary USB connector for recharging and file transfer.  My review of the Thrive is somewhat a comparison between the two.  The Thrive is much heavier and thicker.  That makes it feel much more substantial than the Galaxy and allows for a full sized USB and HDMI ports and a mini-USB port.  It also supports full size SD cards.  The back has a waffled surface for better grip and is removable to allow for battery change out which is not possible on the Galaxy.  You can change the back out for different colors, but that's just fluff and the backs are expensive.  The Thrive control buttons aren't as easy to find by feel and the power light is annoying.  It also blinks while in standby which shortens battery life.  I haven't found a way to turn it off, but that would be a great option.  The display quality is somewhat lower on the Thrive compared to the Galaxy.  Also, there seems to be big difference in overall speed between the Galaxy and the Thrive.  I don't know if it's different chipsets or firmware or both, but it's noticeable.  You can't video conference over Skype because the Thrive uses the Tegra chipset and many Android apps available for my Droid phone aren't for the Thrive.  One big drawback is the Thrive uses a 120v recharging brick which means you can't use the USB cable for charging.  The big factor is the Thrive is $100 cheaper than the Galaxy.  Given the lower cost, full size USB port and SD card support, and similar displays the Thrive is my pick.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.
