I WORRIED FOR NO REASON!!  I ORDERED 3 OF THEM, FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR ADULTS, I OWN I PADS, NOOK TABLET, AND JUST GOT NEW NOOK HD 9 INCH, I HAVE SMART PHONES AND I PODS, MP3 PLAYERS SO I AM  WELL VERSED ON THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT -  I OPENED, SET UP AND TRYED EACH ONE BEFORE I WRAPPED THEM, THEY ALL CHARGED IN ABOUT 5 HOURS, CONNECTED FAST TO MY WIFI WITH NO PROBLEM, THEY CAME WITH SCREEN SAVER, HEADPHONES, CHARGER, CORD FOR CONNECTING A USB DRIVE OR USB DEVICE, AND WARRANTY PAPER, INSTRUCTIONS ( FOR SOME GENERAL INFO) , THEY HAVE 5 SCREENS YOU CAN PUT YOUR APPS AND THINGS ON. IT CAME PRE LOADED WITH MOST BASIC APPS. AND CONNECTED EASY TO GOOGLE PLAY WERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TON'S OF FREE OR PAID APPS. I WENT TO YOU TUBE AND IT WORKED FAST AND PLAYED GOOD, I BROWSED ONLINE ON EACH TABLET AND THEY ALL SEEMED JUST ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS MY NOOK, AND I PAD ( OR NOT MUCH DIFFERENT) VOLUME IS NOT VERY LOUD BUT THEN NEITHER IS MY NOOK. THIS IS A NICE 9 INCH TABLET FOR THE PRICE AND I JUST DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS, TO ME IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS ALL THE OTHER TABLETS OUT THERE, IT ONLY HAS A FRONT FACING CAMERA. YOU CAN EXPAND THE MEMORY UP TO 32 GIGS WITH A MICRO SD CARD. NICE FEATURE. OVER ALL IT LOOKS NICE HAS A SMOOTH FRONT SCREEN AND THE TOUCH WORKS GREAT I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT, OVER ALL I THINK THIS IS A NICE TABLET AND FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A BASIC TABLET THAT YOU CAN USE APPS AND INTERNET I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BUY AND SO FAR THE COMPANY SEEMS VERY GOOD ABOUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND HELP. I WOULD SAY BUY IT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD 9INCH TABLET AT A GOOD PRICE.
