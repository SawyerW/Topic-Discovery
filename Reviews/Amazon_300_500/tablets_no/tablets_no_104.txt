I have been looking at netbooks for a while in order to have something a little more portable than a laptop and more usable than a smartphone for basic e-reading, email, and web browsing. I was close to buying an iPad when I came across the Lenovo S10-3T. After reading the reviews on both products, I opted for the S10-3T as it seemed to have the functionality and expandability of a netbook, but the touch screen capabilities of an iPad. I have been very pleased with my decision and have found this to be the best of both worlds. Below are the pros and cons which are consistent with what I had read in other reviews -- note I gave this a 5-star review because despite a few cons, I believe it to be the best product on the market today. Also, while some reviews have complained about the battery that sticks out, I have found it to be quite handy for holding when in tablet mode.Pros:* Touchscreen* Fast* Intel platform (can support multiple OSes)* Expandable - USB (wireless broadband, printer, external drive, etc.), SD Reader, memory* Near full-size keyboard (for times when you have a bit of typing to do)Cons:* Windows 7 Starter -- this is a functional OS and probably could have gotten by with it, but wanted something a little more configurable -- upgraded to Home Premium* The pre-installed software is more than the configured memory adequately supports -- either remove some of it or add more memory.* Somewhat heavy for one-handed holding (this is going to be the case of any of these type of devices unless you want just an eReader).There are a number of sites which have some good tips for configuring this device. I found the [...] site to be very helpful -- thank you Jesse for the info.
