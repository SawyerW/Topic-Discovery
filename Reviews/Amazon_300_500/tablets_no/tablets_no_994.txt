I did a lot of research on tablets and the Acer A500 is right there with all the others in processor and ports. So basically it is the same as the others with two differences. One it has a flash on its forward camera which none of the others have. Two I got the 32GB for the price the other tablets had for 16GB. That sold me.I got it in the mail 48hrs after I clicked order so no waiting for my toy :) Now here is what you need to know to make your initial experience good. I had issues and had to do a bit of research to find what to do. This like any computer has it's quirks in the operating system (OS) wise so here's what to do: As soon as you open the box plug it in for at least 2 hrs before turning it on. Set up your Wi-Fi like it asks. As soon as it boots up go to settings. Change to screen time out to the max (I believe it is 30 min). *Turn your tablet to portrait view and keep it that way till completely updated. Then go to the About at the bottom and check for updates. It will have the OS update to 3.1 (but it will be numbered 4.10 something). Start the down load and do not touch the screen again till just before the 30 min screen time out to keep it on. Remember you have to keep it in portrait view. Once that update is done it will unzip then reboot. Once it is done repeat the download update check for your 3.2 OS update.Apparently there is a few bugs with the orientation and also the update has to be done before anything else or it will give you a update version error. I had to factory reset several times before I found all this out but it isn't Acer's fault. I've been around computers for awhile and know how they can be fickle for no reason. If you followed my steps you should fly through the update process in a few hours (depending on your Wi-Fi speed) and be using it.Hope this helps!
