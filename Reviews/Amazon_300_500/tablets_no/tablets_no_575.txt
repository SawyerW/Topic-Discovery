Viewsonic has recently updated (mine was updated yesterday 12-23-2010) the software and added functionality to their G-Tablet which now makes this little tablet computer a complete winner. If you are interested in a 10" tablet, get this one asap. I've played with all three major tablets, Ipad, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Viewsonic. The Viewsonic competes or beats all three in almost every category. The biggest rap against the G-tab is probably the viewing angle on the screen. You pretty much have to be right in front of it to see the screen clearly. But overall you can go where you want to go and have a great internet experience with the G-Tablet.I bought the Viewsonic Gtablet right around Thanksgiving because it had (or was supposed to have soon) everything I wanted in a tablet computer...that is, a tablet I could use like a PC. Back then the Viewsonic did not have the updates it has now, which is what makes this little tablet such a bargain. Waiting for Viewsonic to deliver proved to be a good move. While many people tweaked theirs to make it better, many others who are not as tech savvy returned theirs. This could have proved to be a mistake if demand now exceeds supply. My patience was rewarded with a great little device.Is it perfect? No, but it just blows the doors off the competition re overall function (it's fast, has flash and a clean user interface with enough apps to keep me busy (yes, even Angry Birds) as apps are added) and price (you won't find a Galaxy Tab or Ipad for anything near $399.) Once people realize what a deal this tablet is compared to the Galaxy and the Ipad, they may be more difficult to find and purchase.SUMMARY: Viewsonic stumbled badly in their rush to get this tablet to market, but they've made it right. And, updates will continue to be made which will make this tablet PC even better.
