First let me say Amazon is and was great!!  I am thrilled with Amazon and the responsiveness and follow through.  I bought three Coby Kryos Mid 7025 Tablets for my children for Christmas.  For starters the tablets did not have access to the market.  It comes with a program called AppLibs that is supposed to be another market.  Only problem is that Applibs would never connect, even on a great wifi connection.  This was not a big deal as I quickly found the needed files, installed them on a SD card and installed the Google Market.  When you do this you get the old market since this is an older version of Android.  Doing more research I have not found an upgrade path for this device to new Android releases, and frankly I am not sure the CPU could handle it.  Biggest problem is that the devices freeze up when doing even simple stuff like listening to music or playing market games.  I have each device freeze up and lock down at least three times.  When it is not freezing up it is releasing error codes that make you do a force close.  The other big issue is the resistive touch screen.  You really have to push down hard and it's better to use a stylus or fingernail.  Using this type of screen it is easy to open applications mistakenly.  When you try to scroll throughout the screens random apps open, which is extremely frustrating.  My advice is to save your money, spend a few extra dollars and get a capacitive screen.  You may be saying, "Well, surely it's Ok just for younger kids".  Don't fool yourself, that is exactly what I said.  It's not, when they are constantly having issues and bringing it to you to fix you realize going cheap was not a great option.  Get the capacitive screen with the latest Android version.  OR, get an iPad and everyone will be happy!!
