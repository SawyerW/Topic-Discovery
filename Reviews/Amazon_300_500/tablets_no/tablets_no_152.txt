ok first things first, if you say that the ipad is just a jumbo ipod touch you ave probably never used one. it has awsome picture quality, its fast, and easier for children to use and have them enjoy it because of its size and not worrying about them droping it because its too big for them to hold, so they'd have to lay it down to use it. i let my little brothers use it and they have never droped it and they love the size of the screen, they like using it more than their ipod touch's. i use it for email, texting and phone calls, yes phone calls, you just need skype or a phone app like i use, plus you wont look rediculos because it uses the microphone and the speaker so its like a conference call. sound quality is great, i love watching my HD movies with my friends and its real HD not like the fakey HD the ipod touch has. my parents and my old folks like to lay it down on their laps to use it because they complain that they cant hold it because they cant grip it (they are 85 years old of course they cant grip anything). my friends like that you can change the background if you want unlike the ipod touch where its the boring black all the dang time, mine is the family reunion photo. which reminds me you can put real photos on the ipad like old photographs from way back when. and there is no wrong way t hold it, even on the menu screen, just tilt it in the direction you want and it'l adjust for you, it comes handy when you have a group of people and you don't want to pass it around. this ipad is definitly worth the money, because it has internet, movies, music, tv, phone, text, email, games, your photos, your videos, books, and educational things for the little kids.(PS. excuse my spelling i have a C+ in english >:( i cant spell word i never use)
