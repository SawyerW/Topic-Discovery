Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - BlackI had been researching for a android device that has good reviews and falls below the cost of an iPad, almost all the android tablets that i had been researching had some or the other issues that was debatable and the most were *un-branded tablets with no support information; with a bold move Coby Kyros was my preferrable choice and costed me about $130 and the main reason for selecting this is because of the support Coby USA site offered; almost immediately i upgraded my tablet to newer firmware android 2.1; now about the device i absolutely love it because the 7 inches screen size is so slick and easy to handle with one hand and it has got a very responsive display to all my touches; wifi doesn't seem to be a problem and watching youtube videos and browsing webpages were awesome; now to get into the R&D; section i was so in need to instal android market place because the market place offered by Coby's version wasn't broad and good (i dont blame them for that) so with community help I was able to root my tablet and get the android marketplace installed along with google! my tablet is now loaded with more application and still runs like a champ; finally i wrote this review with my usage (2-3 hours a day and have about 12 MBPS internet).UPDATE: 06/03/2011I sold my Coby Kyros back to amazon thru trade-in program because now that I own a Dell Streak 5, I was not determined to have 2 devices doing the same job! Coby Kyros remained to be a good start up tutorial for me in getting accustomed with the android world I would still recommend this over any other device for the price its being sold for!
