...but I love it!I was skeptical at first for getting one because the specs didn't/doesn't seem to justify the price.  I have a laptop, desktop and a very good Android phone so I didn't really need this.  But I've owned many Apple products (Macs and iPods) too, but never an iOS device.  So, as a birthday gift, I wanted to splurge (haha).Not to sound like an Apple ad/fanboy (or SJ-RIP), but I do like its `convenience.' I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).Granted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.I'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).  I know there are less expensive tablets and/or tablets with better software/hardware specs.  But this device is a delight to have when/if you don't want to use your smartphone or computer.
