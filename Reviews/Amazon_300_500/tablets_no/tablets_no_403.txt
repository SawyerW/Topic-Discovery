My husband talked me into buying an ipad2 after listening to one too many complaints about my Droid phone. So I dumped the "smart" phone, reverted back to a "dumb" phone and got an ipad. I just love it! It's small and light - fits in most of my purses without a problem. I carry it around all the time - has my grocery list, my address book, photos of my grandchildren, my calendar, my favorite music, maps & GPS and links to my ebay auctions. It has Angry Birds to keep me amused while waiting at the doctor's offce. It has Pandora radio, which is AWESOME! It has a screen I can actually SEE and a keyboard I can actually USE! No more struggling trying to do things on that stupid "smart" phone. AND it never calls anyone by accident like the Droid used to do. A lot...I have a laptop at home for my business use, so I didn't expect it to be a substitute for that. But when I am shopping on ebay, it's much more pleasant to sit on the couch with my little ipad than to sit at the desk with the laptop.I find it works seamlessly with wi-fi and Verizon wireless. I got the $20/month 1 gig plan and it's plenty for me. I bought a docking station with speakers, so my stereo just became completely obsolete. The battery life is outstanding - especially when compared to my laptop.The only thing I am not wild about is the Itunes interface. It has taken me quite a bit of fussing to master the art of getting stuff transferred over to the ipad. But I've got it down pat now - thanks to a little extra help from an Apple customer support rep.In short - you can have my ipad "when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers".
