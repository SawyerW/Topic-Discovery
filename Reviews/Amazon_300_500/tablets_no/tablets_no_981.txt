I've owned both the iPad and iPad2, and now this one. After owning all 3, I have to say that I just really like Android more than iOS. I like the fact that I can look through the file structure and place shortcuts easily on the desktop. There are workarounds for this on iPad, but to me it's just more user friendly on Android. I love the fact that I can use news and calendar and clock widgets, for example, and customize the setup to my tastes, which is just more restrictive on the iPad. The gmail app is fantastic, web browsing looks great and it's an all around good solid product. Honeycomb works great and looks great, and this tab is a lot of fun to use.From a hardware perspective, there aren't a ton of differences between this and iPad. However there are some important ones, biggest in my opinion being the widescreen format versus iPad's 4:3, and the fact that the Samsung can play full HD videos. To me, that is a great win for this product as I have several HD videos for my business, and they look great on here. It's light and slim, and easy to grip (in my opinion, easier to grip the back than the smooth metal of iPad.)However, there is a lack of tablet-based applications available at this time. Apple has them beat on quantity and quality of tablet apps. This is the only downside and at least it seems that Google is working on it, so I imagine the market will grow rapidly. Soon we will be able to download movies and rent them in the market, but until then it gets a slightly lower review on my end.Overall it's a lot of fun to play with and great competition to Apple.
