I wanted to buy my wife something nice for our anniversary.  She likes to browse the internet, play games, and manage her emails.  But she doesn't like the bulk of the dell laptop she has to lug around,not to mention the slow performance and software issues we recently had with it.  So I went down to our local office supply store (sorry Amazon) and purchased the wifi version last weekend. Let me say that this thing is awesome.  The OS is super responsive and the internet is blazing fast.  Setting her email up was easy and it ties in nicely with the Google calendar she already uses.  Maps are beautiful and Angry Birds is crazy fun!I was a bit worried that she wouldn't get the OS because she is used to the iPhone, but she got it right away.  And it was nice that I was able to link my droid x marketplace apps to the Xoom.  She hasn't complained about the weight of the unit and the power button location has not been an issue.  The only complaint I have heard from my wife is that the volume buttons are a bit stiff.  After I used it I would have to agree, but it seems like that is the only gripe we have.  Heck, I am even starting to look for it on my downtime so I can play with the unit!Now, this is just my review of the Xoom and I won't get into how it compares with the iPad2 because I don't own one. I am sure it is a fine product, but the Xoom meets our needs and does everything we would like it to.  I guess the only thing I can say is that price point and availability somewhat contributed to my decision.  Overall, we are extremely satisfied with the purchase.  I just cant wait for the marketplace to get flooded with tablet optimized apps!Update 1 - Flash works beautifully on the unit.  I was able to watch the latest episode of Fringe without any problems.  And the speakers sound incredibly clear as compared to my laptop.  You just have to remember to download Flash from the Android Marketplace and you're set!
