While everyone ran to buy an iPad, I opted to buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab (T-Mobile) and found it to be an excellent choice.  The size is great, it's not too heavy to handle and it can easily fit into your purse or pocket.  Many times, it's not convenient to tote around a laptop so having the Galaxy Tab gives me quicker access to the internet no matter where I am; it is easy to use and navigate, and the loaded apps are very accessible.  I love the personal radio app.  The music is clear and it continues to play music in your chosen genre until you stop it.  The battery life is excellent!  I'm glad to know that I don't have to tote the charger every time I leave the house.  The camera is clearer than the one on my Blackberry phone.  Another reason I bought the Galaxy Tab is because it comes with a GPS and Kindle already loaded which took the necessity of buying 3 gadgets down to 1.  It is easy to use email and the keyboard is easy to navigate with one hand.  I absolutely love the Galaxy Tablet and would recommend it highly.  It is also easier than a laptop to use when traveling... it is not cumbersome and you don't have to look for an outlet.  Watching t.v., movies, or listening to music is SO much easier with the Tab when you're on the go.I bought a leather protective case which has a stand alone feature so you can use the Galaxy Tab and free your hands at the same time.  LOVE IT!!!  The leather cover does not make it bulky and it has appropriate holes so you're able to get to whatever you need without taking the Tablet out of the case.  I also bought protective film covers to protect the screen.  These two items are optional but I believe they are very essential if you want your Galaxy Tab to have a long life.  Protect your investment!The Samsung Galaxy Tab will not replace my laptop but it is a great addition to my electronic family.
