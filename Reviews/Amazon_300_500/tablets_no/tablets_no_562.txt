I absolutely adore the galaxy tab. There may be tons of tablets out there in the market catering to various screen sizes , but i feel that this 7 inch galaxy tab beats all others. I still feel the 7 inch screen is the best size for a tablet and better than the 10 inch tablets out there even though they have honeycomb. List of things i observed* Very good build quality* The screen looks amazing, bright, crisp and pleasing to the eyes.* 7 inch screen makes The device extremely portable and light. It can be held in one hand like a book. makes reading ebooks and webpages a charm.* The front facing camera works really well during a video chat.* Has a very good battery life. I have used this tablet for watching videos and listening to music for almost 7-8 hrs and still there was some 30% charge left in the device.* The android experience is great. Angry Birds looks awesome on this device. HD videos looked even betterSome things which can be considered a disadvantage* Charging port is samsung proprietary* No HDMI port (this is not really a disadvantage , just a feature samsung decided not to include).* Since i purchased the AT&T; tab it came with a lots of bloatware which makes the device sluggish at times.* No honeycomb support yet!But in all, i would definitely recommend this tab over all the tablets, mainly because of the pricing (its dropping very fast) and the experience of a really high quality, fast portable tablet (unlike the 10 inch tablets which are big to be actually handy and portable).Another point to note is, during 2011 there are a flurry of tablets announced and which will be available soon. But in the 7 inch market The  galaxy tab is still the King
