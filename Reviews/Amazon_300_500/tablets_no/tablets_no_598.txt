Pros:1. More ports than Moto Xoom at similar bulk2. Tegra 2 chipset (not fully utilised, see below)3. Strong developer community at XDA3. At 270$ it is not a terrible price for a 10'' machineCons:1. Awful viewing angles2. Heavy3. Android buttons (home, menu, back, search) are not illuminated4. Unable to fully utilise the Tegra 2 as some apps (Dice Player) require hardware accelerated Honeycomb rather than Froyo or Gingerbread5. Unable to access many tablet apps as they are locked into the Honeycomb market6. Honeycomb roms are not hardware accelerated and limited to 3.0.1Thoughts:Booting up the Viewsonic tablet you see 3 birds with vivid plumage with the caption "See The Difference". This seems like a horrible joke to me as the only difference I could see from my Galaxy Tab 10.1, a friend's Thrive or Transformer was that the viewing angles were beyond just being noticeable to being a hindrance to general usage of the tablet.I understand that this tablet is nearly half the price of the 10.1 but the sheer lack of quality that went into this machine is boggling. Having owned a B&N; Nook Color I can say that the notion of illuminated buttons is not a new thing that Viewsonic could not have imagined on a tablet and its absence is quite handicapping when trying to read at night.Much like the other Malata zPad lines this will probably never have HW accelerated Honeycomb and may never see official Ice Cream Sandwich although given the talents of the people at XDA and if Google makes ICS less closed than HC then we might just see it.Overall Review:This product is currently useful only as an occasional toy for a child who might break something more valuable but I think even a 4 year old would begin crying for an iPad 2 after 5 minutes with this thing. The other use is as a toy for a grown person who enjoys new roms, new kernels and seeing what can be squeezed out of a stone if not blood.
