The tablet itself is a winner in my book. One of (if not) the nicest Tegra 3 tablets I have seen, spec wise and sheer cosmetics of the unit are excellent. I love the design of the casing and screen, claiming thinnest tablet of it's class in the world is a nice notch in your belt Toshiba especially with whats included.I know the previous model the AT200 series people were somewhat unhappy with the sharp edges on the back of the unit when holding the tablet. Seems this has been addressed with the new body design. As well, there were talks of issues with the screen flexing from the rear when pressed, this is not the case with the AT305. I feel the gorilla glass thats on this will be more than tough enough for what I would consider an "Acceptable" amount of force. I pushed it with enough force to where I cautioned myself to stop and there is no felx on the front side.The tablet is quite lite to hold and does not seem to fatigue me with an hour or so of use. Response of the hardware coupled with ICS is virtually instantaneous and then fluid from that point forward. Threw a couple HD videos on and watched them for testing, and display was very sharp and clean (No stuttering or anything like that). Depending on how you encode the audio in your movies seems to reflect the output volume wise. Some movies were quieter than others, but I fault that on the encoding processed used when making the movie.Can't comment on the speed of the SD Slot, however I have a class 10 32GB on the way and expect to maximize the bus without issue.Things I am waiting for:- Rooting method so I can use some of my favorite apps (Root Explorer, Titanium Backup, AdFree, Cache Cleaner, Terminal Emulator etc...)- A nice hardshell/softshell case that will protect well but also not add too much bulk to the device as I LOVE how thin it is.Will update with other thoughts the more I use it.Hans
