I've had this Xoom for 7 months and it's been my constant companion.  Because I have several gmail accounts it's the easiest way to quickly check my email, and I love having it close by when I'm reading (actual hard copy books)so that when I come across something I want to look up online I don't have to wait and hope to remember to do it next time I'm near a computer. With the Xoom finding a copy of the Romanov family tree or getting more background on a fascinating throwaway line is fast, easy, and convenient. Also comfortable, since you can sit on a couch or in bed rather than at a computer desk. I thought I would use the Xoom as more of an eReader than I do, but while its big, high resolution screen makes it great for surfing the web it's heavier than I want for an eReader--for that I still prefer the Sony 350 or PRS-T1 eReaders which can be easily held in one hand. The Xoom is perfect though for looking at eBooks that are in color or have a lot of pictures, and since I can access all my Sony purchased books on the Xoom that feature has been a huge plus. There are also a lot of Android apps for other book readers, and using them you can get books for Nook, Kobo or Kindle--the Kindle application is especially wonderful because it makes it possible to quickly and easily download and read those Kindle free book samples, plus there are a lot of free books offered for Kindle.The Xoom has just been upgraded to Android 4--the Ice Cream Sandwich--so it has several new features, widgets and perks, one of my favorite being the ability to create attractive desktop folders.  My enthusiasm for using the Xoom meant that all my bookmarks and apps were really starting to clutter up the screen.
