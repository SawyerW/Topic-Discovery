I've had this tab for about 3 months now, and I still can't seem to put the thing down. It's an extremely well made tablet, in regards to both hardware and software. It's thin and lightweight, yet doesn't feel cheaply made. The display is flat out amazing, which is what you should expect from a Samsung product. The speakers are surprisingly loud and of decent quality, although nothing to write home about. The battery life is outstanding, I can go days before needing to recharge. Samsung uses their TouchWiz UX skin on this tablet which, IMO, is a great user interface. It adds a button to take screenshots (a very welcome addition), along with a nifty feature that allows the user to select from a series of small programs that can run on top of whatever is currently running. These small programs include a calculator, calendar, task manager, and notepad. It's a cool idea that actually works very well, and comes in handy more often that you'd think. The Android experience is different for all people, and admittedly takes some getting used to. That being said, I'm a huge fan of Android and think it works extremely well on tablets, especially this one.There are only a few minor drawbacks to this tab. One of the most talked about is a lack of ports, which is definitely a disappointment. There are no native HDMI or USB ports, nor any memory card slots. Samsung does sell dongles that allow for HDMI and USB connectivity, but it should have been included out of the box. Not a dealbreaker for me, but for others this can be an issue. The only other drawback is the extremely long time it takes to reach a full charge.Aside from those two issues, this tablet is phenomenal and I highly recommend it. I would have given it a 4.5 out of 5 stars, but since I couldn't I bumped it up to 5 (4 stars would be doing this an injustice).
