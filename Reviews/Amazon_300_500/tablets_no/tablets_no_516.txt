I purchased this item from an aquantience for $50.00 as a gift for my 5 year old son for christmas.  He loves to play with my full sized tablet, so I figured that he would love one of his own.  The tablet charged quickly,but the frustration imedietly began.  First it was difficult to get it to stay on line. For some reason this tablet picks up a weak signal where it is constantly knocked off line where my full sized tablet always has a strong signal.  Then there is the app store - you can download the apps with no problems, but when you go to use it? - a failed comment comes up forcing it to close on most of them.  Some times the app store does not even come up properly.  The one game he loves the most is Angry Birds as most kids do.  This game is not even available in the app store.  You can find free downloads of this game on line, but upon attempt to download tha abobe reader which it says it needs it wount allow it to happen.  One other thing is that the screen does not seem to respond with the use of my finger tip.  Although the stylet seem to work better I find myself constantly opening things that I do not want to open when all I want to do is scroll the screen up and down.  I just hope that these problems are just due to my lack of knowlege on how to use this devise.  I wish I could give this product a higher rating, but I cannot.  My son has not used it due to him getting frustraed with his games crashing and lack of Angry Birds.  He wanted a DS, but I thought this would be more fun.  I regret not getting the DS now.
