I am a college student, was psyched when I found out about the news of the relase of this product. Many people gave good reviews so far, but I am guessing that they have higher sensibilities in using the device or they haven't used yet enough.Let me tell you directly that electronic pad is irreplaceable to pen and paper.It can be a different story if you are young and not used to pen and paper or much, but if you get used to taking notes down on pen and paper, nothing can really replace that.It is extremely annoying to not have keyboards attached, 12.1 inch may be the largest on the market in terms of tab, but let me tell you, it can never replace the comfort of having 15 inch laptop with solid key board and a screen that will sit by itself and that you can rotate in which ever degree you want to work in.If you are a college student and do pick up and leave down your back pack and mostly don't think too much about what's already in there, this laptop should not be bought from YOU! It is extremely fragile (in the sense that the corners that make the plastic wrap will break), and your computer will get detatched, and your screen is going to get all messed up!If you are an engineering major, draw many graphs, take notes on heavy math equations, again don't buy! I know that one note seems to have this awesome feature of converting your manual equation into math equation, but seriously, the program confuses for sigma with E, and it becomes extremely combersome to manually change all the equations to convert them correctly that you took for 50 minutes(it will literally take you extra 1 hour, no kidding).The electronic product, and the one note compatibility, put in best words, are still in developing stage. Unless you want to be a guinea pig or a pioneer(whichever word you prefer), don't buy(and especially you are a collge student like me!)!Also don't think that you'll get a warranty for the pieces coming off from your hardware. There is a specific statement inside the warranty guide that goes something like: we are not responsible for your own mishandling in the product and the physical damages due to your action.
