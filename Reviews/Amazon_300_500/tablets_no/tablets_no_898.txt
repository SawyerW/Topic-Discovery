I have to say that I'm very impressed with the device, if you are a Windows OS user and you know how to navigate and "investigate" things...using this OS is no different, I fail to see where people are complain about it. Setting up getting my Hotmail was a breeze, and the connecting of the USE to PC to transfer files is smooth, at first I thought I had to use the Kiles app to transfer but with tinkering around the device there are multiple way to connect, the Kiles software was not working with installing on Windows 7 but when I saw you can select how to connect with USA and changed it to "Mas Storage" option it worked great, I like the fact there is more than one way to connect to PC to transfer data, very cool option.Looking at videos is great and not pixelated or stuttering....included flash was a smart option, the camera is pretty good for what your getting and the option for VPN settings just really sealed the deal here so I can get my Exchange e-mails from work w/o issue and the wi-fi is very good. I have been decided between this and the Ipad, but this won me over for a few reasons: Camera, weight and size (definitely didn't want some big 10" tab to walk around with, might as well just use my laptop) android market, major difference, I'm just floored with the amount of content there is on there and a good amount is free! LinkedIn is awesome and this app called US Route 66 (I think that's the spelling) is amazing...there is no way you can browse all these apps...just mind blowing.There is no reason to even say you can't find something you like. And the ability to add extra memory is great and when I read that you have to pay a fee to add more memory to the iPad, I thought that was nuts and if you do want the additional memory, I read that you have to buy an external adapter, so that right there was a no go.Anyone on the fence of getting one...I say its very much worth it and for the price, you can't beat it.
