I will say that I did not buy this from Amazon, but I recently got one of these for my daughter's birthday.  I wanted to get her an inexpensive tablet of her own.  What I ended up with was a cheap tablet that doesn't work.  When I tried to use it the browser kept crashing.  I had to use my tablet to figure out the problem.  Apparently there is an issue with Google (the devices defaut browser) that causes it to crash.  If you go the the company websit they helpfully explain that you either need to pick a new web search, disable Java or both.  Oh and they don't plan to fix the issue, so hope you weren't planning on using the Google App store.  But they have an app store of their own you can use, so no biggie right?  Except out of the dozen or so apps that seem to be on it, most of them are shopping apps.  So much for the games I wanted to load for my little girl.  Oh, hope you don't want Netflix either.  Or Youtube.  Or most of the most popular apps out there because they are no longer compatible.I was able to find a website that instructs you how to fix some of these issues.  I just need to go on my computer, load some other software and apps onto the SD Card, open them on the tablet, change some of the operating code for the machine and I'll still have less functionality than a Nook.  So basically the only thing that may still work on this is the Kindle eReader, although I haven't tried it yet.  So, it looks like my daughter is getting a new Kindle and I need to find someone who just wants a crappy eReader.  The only plus out of all of this is that I didn't spend too much on the thing so I haven't lost all that much.
