I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, who recently (due to curiousity from watching me on my iPod touch,) became addicted to playing Angry Birds & Words with Friends... He is not the biggest tech geek in the world, though. He has only owned a Mac computer, which he is so convinced is such a superior computer that he wouldn't even considering spending the money on a non-Apple computer product... So, you can understand why I was so worried to get this lower costing "Acer" tablet..I was so worried that I would have to hear grumbles of "but it's not an iPad...!" after giving this to him on X-Mas.. Well, boy was I worried over nothing...! He opened it up and literally it is now 2 weeks after, and he has not put it down except to sleep and go to work. If he didn't have to drive for his job I'm sure he'd find a way to use it there too...!I have had my iPod touch for about a year and have always loved it... So when I actually was able to pry this out of my boyfriend's hands for a few moments to check it out, I was really quite impressed. Pricewise, it is on the higher end of the tablets - but for this quality and for such a reputable company, you will get your money's worth here.. The features such as expandable memory w/SD, great front & rear facing cameras, ability to play flash; all were factors in choosing this over the iPad... We have only had one little issue with the wi-fi on a WEP encrypted wireless connection at a restaurant we go to often; but out of the box it set up and found our home network in less than 2 minutes.. By the 3rd minute out of the box I had already installed Angry Birds and we were ready to go.. Well, -he- was ready to go - I couldn't get near it for the first day. :)*****edit: June 9, 2012... 7 months later & still going strong.. we have never had a single issue with the Iconia tablet.. he still uses it non stop and brings it everywhere!! i have never regretted getting it for him once, it was the best gift...
