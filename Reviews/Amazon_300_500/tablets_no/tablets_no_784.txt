I have owned this for about 2 weeks now.Definitely not for entertainment. I use it to take notes in class and OneNote works great with it! The touch responsiveness was a little glitchy.. It froze sometimes and had a hard time switching between the pen and my finger but after I downloaded and installed the drivers it works really smoothly!Firefox 4 has touch support so you dont have to use the scroll bar on the side of the screen you can just sweep your finger across the page to scroll up and down.Sometimes it is hard to be accurate with your finger when trying to click on a small object but this is just a minor detail since the pen is perfectly accurate.It never heats up even after hours of streaming netflix to my tv from it. The longest I streamed was 11 episodes of '24' in a row and each episode is over 40 minutes long.It is really thin for all the hardware its packing and very light also.Dont have to worry about the screen scratching. Only thing is it glares sometimes and when the screen is dark you can see fingerprints all over it.The pen works even with the screen off and projecting on my tv. this makes it so i dont have to use a mouse.The USB covers are really hard to get open and even after they open they dont open very far so it is difficult to plug anything in to them.I think it would have been worth it to wait until they could knock the price down and improve the battery life; however, i was way too impatient and I am sure a lot of you are too.Overall I would recommend this!I did not buy from Amazon I bought from Tigerdirect and have the 32GB SSD and 2GB of RAM
