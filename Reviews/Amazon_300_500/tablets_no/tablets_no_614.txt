Got mine as a Woot refurb - despite a bit of bother upgrading the OS (Toshiba's fault), the hacker community got me up and running.  Had it for over a month, so ready to say, I love this thing.  I imagine most Tegra 2/Android 3 tablets would be about the same - the advantage here is the SD card slot, full size and mini USB, and HDMI port.  So, how often have I actually used them...or needed to?  I have used a PS3 controller to play Shadowgun and hooked the HDMI up just to check it out.  Both worked flawlessly with no effort on my part.  That was impressive - even Windows 7 has to hiccup and burp before it will agree to do that.  Android is definitely the best user experience on top of Linux that I've encountered.I'm really just reviewing to put in my thumbs up, given that others have had problems.  I believe Toshiba has worked out the shutdown problems - at least, I've never seen them.  The real question then is do you need a tablet and, if so, iPad or Android.  I find the tablet to be a wonderful companion computer.  I've used an iPad and I really can't see any difference between it and the Android.  The app you want may not be on the Android market yet - or perhaps vice versa.  I have been able to find everything I want, mostly for free - SAMBA client, DLNA client, MP4 AVC/AC3 video player with hardware acceleration.  I usually end up buying the apps just to support the makers.The gizmo is a great little video player, within reason.  Word is that the Tegra 2 does not actually do full HD, though i don't think you need full HD on a device this small.  However, that would be a sticking point, as the Tegra 3 is quite a bit more powerful, and the iPad 3 will be as well.
