I have been very pleased with my 10" Toshiba Excite 64 GB purchase. At first I was hesitant to buy it because some of the negative reviews about the light-bleed. However, after getting this tablet and using it for 2 weeks, I have to say this problem is NOT a show-stopper in the least.Yes, you can see some light-bleed on the all-black boot-up screen at the beginning, when you reboot the tablet. But other than that, it is simply not visible and the display looks crisp and fantastic. If you are a true video-phile and are OCD about having zero light bleed during your dark movie scenes, chances are you would be using the tablet's HDMI-out and streaming the movies or You Tube content through your big screen plasma or LCD TV. So your movie will look ultra-dark on the big screen. Frankly, I don't bother and watch all the video content directly on the tablet in HD. And it is smooth as silk with the light-bleed being a non-issue...UNLESS you are looking at an extremely dark scene. Even then, it just does not take away from the overall experience. This issue has been over-blown by some of the reviewers, IMO.Here are other great things about this tablet: 1) NVidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor is very fast. 2) Couple this with the MX Video player from Google Play store, and there is no video format that it can't handle. 3) You can store all your photos and videos in the full-size SD card slot. I put a 32 GB Class 10 SD card in it and it is seamless. But I think 64 or 128 GB will work just as well. 4) Just as thin and light as the latest i-Pad. Very sleek form. 5) Stable, have had zero crashes after 3 weeks of use. It came stock with ICS, but Toshiba has made Jelly Bean available and I love it. 6) Despite the thin, light form factor, it feels like a solid build, and comes with Gorilla Glass.Be careful not to confuse this tablet with the even sleeker looking but LESS powerful Excite 10 LE. Toshiba should have done a better job differentiating the model names.
