How much do I love my iPad2?  Well, as I joke I tell to friends, my husband is threatening to name it the corespondent in our divorce suit. That's only a half joke.  I've had this wonderful piece of personal technology since shortly after it was released in April.  It goes absolutely everywhere with me.  I commute on the train to work, so I got the 3G version for connectivity when I am out of wifi range.  With AT&T;, it is a reasonable $25 a month for 2 gigs of data transfer, and that is more than enough.  And I can turn the 3G plan on and off on a month-by-moth basis if I don't think I'll need it.This thing is so much more than its specs.  Here's what I use it for:  My email, both personal and work; reading Kindle and iBooks; reading the NY Times in the train, as well as checking about half a dozen other news sites for the latest information; reading magazines in their full-color glory (I recommend Zinio); watching movies and TV (Netflix streaming, Hulu Plus, ABC, You Tube and more -  it's been a godsend since last week's hurricane, which lunched my living room TV); participating in discussion forums and blogs; checking Facebook; shopping, shopping, shopping; checking weather; getting maps and navigation; having video chats with friends; using Skype for landline calls when I was in Spain and couldn't use my iPhone; playing with jigsaw puzzles, my favorite time suck.  There's much, more more, but I'd be here all night.I know that other Android-based tablets can do most of these things and can even do something's that iPad cannot.  But I love the look and feel of the iPad -  it feels very light in my hands, even with a leather cover.  And I love the incredible range of apps available from Apple.  Some Apple-haters would accuse me of "drinking the Apple KoolAid" and let them.  All I know is that this is the best piece of personal technology that has yet been invented.
