I was looking for tablet that was close to a laptop in terms of operation, but lighter than a regular laptop and I was not really interested in a netbook. I was initally going to get a Xoom, but the non-working SD card slot was a deal breaker for me, the Samsung Galaxy did not have any USB or SD so I chose the Thrive. I have had my Thrive for almost 2 weeks and it had pretty much lived up to my expectations. I have had no problems with using the USB port with flash drives, it was unable to see my external drive. The failure to come out of sleep has gotten a lot of complaints, but it is not a deal breaker for me. After reading the Toshiba forum, I downloaded Advanced Wi-Fi app, which prevents the Wi-Fi from shutting down in sleep mode. The theory is that if the tablet is downloading, updates, emails, etc, and the Wi-Fi shuts off in the middle of the download, it causes the issue with coming out of sleep mode. The Advance Wi-Fi app has worked so far, until Toshiba comes out with a fix.Aside from that, the Thrive has been everything I wanted in a tablet. I can remotely log into my work computer through LogMeIn and Splashtop, no problems connecting my work email, it picked up my wireless printer, although I haven't tried to print yet. I put a 32gb card in the card reader and have had no issues moving files into the card from the tablet.As far as the weight and feel of the Thrive, it feels bulkier and heavier than the iPad. It almost seems as f the Thrive is twice as thick as the iPad, however for me that was the trade off for the SD card, USB, mini USB and the ablilty to replace the battery.Overall, despite some, to me minor issues, this is a great tablet that gives me most of what a laptop would in a tablet sized machine.
