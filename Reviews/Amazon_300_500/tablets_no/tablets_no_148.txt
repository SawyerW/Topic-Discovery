Review of an iPad 1st GenThis is going to sound very "romanticist" styled review of the device which turned the world over and created a plethora of industries all it's own.But I will not subject this review nor waste your precious time "with apple fan fair!" however my perspective of the review is more around the durability of this 1st Gen apple product!Why write this tripe!!Personal curiosity and wanting other with iPad 1s and 2s and the recent 3rd Gen to come forward and share their "durability" and " longevity" stories with the rest of the readers of this fine platform.Now let's get startedBackgroundOf course I was one of the lucky few who got the 64 gb 3G unlocked iPad 1sCoversThis iPad went through a bunch of alterationsApple coverProtective skin coverSkinIT Homer stickerSo what eventually what stood the test of time, water falls, coffee spills, my 3 and 5 year tougher than THOR fury on sharingHomer skin it PLUS the skin protectives PROVED WORTHY!Type of treatmentSo in total about 5 people used this massively dirty dirty iPadMy mom my 2 brothers myself and my son and daughterOffice e colleagues borrowed for hours on end at least 4 times a weekMost abuse; kids smashed pewed and spilled milk over this at least 10 timesAdam has thrown this device around at least 4 timesHe has sat on the screen while throwing a tantrum 2 timesdevice has been traveled at least about 12 countries at varying temperatures and altitudesBattery has been charged and discharged more times I can count50 plus drunk poetry sessions and small musical gigs have been spewed on itabout a 1000 pages worth of penultimate notes and minutes of meetings been typed up50 plus ideas started on the notes and crokolus boards established200 musical and crowed pleasing audiences with remembrance of zeppelin Sinatra and oasis and Metallica all blasting hotel rooms and friends housesabout a 3000 photos and art work has been processed or altered on this tabletConclusion - this thing has been beyond used and abused!Today after 3 years this marvel of tech engineering is kind of wearing downThe symptomsBattery seems be giving way now - charging cycles and recharges are slowerThe screen touch response is far slower. Despite cleaning cache memory constantlyGames frame rates dropping and responsiveness is far slower than usualAll apps now load up very slowlyFinal word : this thing still is rock solid in my book! Like my old MacBook and MacMini which all had working SuperDrives unlike the newer models -post 2007The point: I hope if anyone out there has similar experiences with their iPads 2 and 3 and are willing to "critique" the build quality!In my view apple on desktops and laptops haven't done a good job with battery and moving parts like super drives -- I hope the same is not true for newer generation of SSD based devices  like this magical device! They should take a sad cue from McDonalds quality control!!! get consistent behind a magical product
