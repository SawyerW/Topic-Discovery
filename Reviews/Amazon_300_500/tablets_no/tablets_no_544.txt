Purchased this tablet mainly to compare it to the iPad and as a cheap reader (I didn't see any reason to fork out 500+ on a tab until I'm sure I'm going to like the platform).Upgrade to Android 2.2 was no problem, took roughly under 15 minutes to get the upgrade installed. The tablet comes with it's own Android market but there's not much in it. Kindle App works fine on the 2.2 upgrade and Amazon App also has no problem (these are still native installs on the Cruz).The native PDF reader leaves much to be desired (basically uses the pre-install office app). Downloading a replacement PDF reader from the Cruz store was a bust (none), and every Amazon PDF reader app I downloaded either did not install, or crashed on start.I'm blaming the tablet, it is what you pay for (very underpowered), but most of the problems is with the Android platform. As Android begins to mature, some of the Apps will not run on the older hardware (you see the same thing with Apple apps on the older versions of the iPhone and iPod Touch). It's just very irritating if there is not a free version to test with before you make a purchase. Additionally, seems some of the apps are buggy depending on the hardware. On this version of the Cruz, there's only 256MB of RAM, so there's a lot of resource contention. With the apps running in the background, doesn't leave a lot of free RAM to start up a new app. Also, the Android system, at least on the Cruz, had a lot of processes running in the background when the device startsup. Also, some of the pre-installed apps start automatically when the device starts up, which leaves less RAM for apps you want to start manually. I've had to go and force shutdown these apps to free up memory.If you plan on buying this, I'd wait till it hit the $100 to $110 dollar range, you won't be able to get the bigger (and better) apps to run on it.
