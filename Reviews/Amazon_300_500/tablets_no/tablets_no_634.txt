I decided to do this review for one reason during the holidays I was at my grandparents house loading all the stuff from Christmas in the car while setting my thrive on the roof and yes I was retarded I know. As we drove away and managed to get a few blocks away I realized my precious tablet was not with me and started to go into shock. As I retraced my path and looked for my thrive. To my suprise it was laying in the street still in the case I bought. The only damage to the thrive was nothing just a lil dirt that needed to be wiped away.Now for the review and simply said its amazing. I'm an avid computer user so I needed the thrive to keep up with my laptop which I use like my life depended on it and it holds up better than expected the OS is smooth and the change between tasks is without hesitation. I've gotten at least 9 hrs out of a charge while watching some movies and playing games .External ports r always a plus I just hook the thrive up to my flat screen and instant Netflix or just a bigger computer screen. The external hard drive makes movies and music simple even though there is already plenty of internal storage and the SD card makes pictures from cameras and upload to fb or ur favorite. Sight extremely easy.Things I recommend1. A Case they come in handy and make handling the tablet very efficient2.amazon app. Place  you will thank me later for that one considering half my games come from the marketplace plus with android most things are free.3.nothing more needed that's just how easy and self sufficient the thrive is there are a few other reviews on here that have great app. Ideas but I don't have the time and I've typed this whole thing on my thrive in just under 8 min plus I'm watching TV so there u have it pick one up today and leave the Ipad and other over priced devices to the in suspecting mass's
