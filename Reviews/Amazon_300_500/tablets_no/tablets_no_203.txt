I was really hoping that this would be the tablet devise that I would keep for the next few years. I had high hopes, with the Tegra 2 Processor and impressive hardware. Sadly, this devise is crippled by its software. I don't mean Android, which I love, but the manufacturer's implementation of the software. Aside from the web browser, which works great - fast and responsive - all else has short comings. I attempted to load about 12 games and apps onto the devise, Angry Birds (didn't work), Homerun 3D (this one worked), one of those car race games (didn't work), Google Sky Maps (loaded, but didn't run), Monopoly 3d (didn't work), and a few others, and only about 20% of them worked on the devise. I also own the Huawei s7 and about 90% of those same apps worked on that devise. Considering that the specs on both devises are very similar, I can only think that this is a problem with Elocity's configuration of the Android software on its devise.  Video playback was ok, but it coudn't seem to handle (with Rockplayer) any of the 720p mkv files I had. And while I understand that mkv is a more demanding format, the devise is meant to handle 1080 mp4s, so this lack of smooth surprised me..... In fact, it played video just about as well as the Huawei devise with its underclocked Snapdragon processor. I am returning this item today, after one day of use. If the apps don't work, what's the point of having this devise. I hope they address these shortcomings in the software, as it was an otherwise appealing looking devise.Maybe Elocity will get this review, and make some changes... I'd be the first to volunteer to beta test, as I really wanted this American company's devise to be a success.
