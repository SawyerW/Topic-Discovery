First, I am tech savvy. I mainly use a PC. I have owned an iphone before. Don't use macs. This is my first ipad. It was given to me as a gift. I use android based phones.My impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.Overall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.The speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.Lack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones dont have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.No siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.If I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1. It can do everything the new ipad can do and more.
