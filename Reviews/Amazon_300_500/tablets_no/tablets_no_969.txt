I have owned this tablet for about 2 months now and i have to say it has done evrything ive wanted it too. People tryn compare it to and ipad2 but its more like the ipad2 should try to compare to it. My little brother-in-law got an ipad2 and i have to admit it is alot more comfortable to hold but man is it limited to what the user can do with it. It has nothing on the acer a500 the acer is sooo customizable its not even funny. Its processer is way bigger, it has more pixels, the cameras are way better, the list goes on and on. All i can say is if you are tryn to decide between an ipadf and this acer then hands down get the acer you will not be let down this thing is awesome. I also have 2 kindle fires that dosent even come close. The only let down is that it is kinda heavy but thats just because its made with better quality things inside. As far as the GPS mine quit working afetr a couple times and i read its because the facvtory isnt sending enough power to the GPS chip to get a good siginal to lock on, well if you go into the app store and get the sygic GPS app inside that app it has a setting where you can push more power to the GPS chip. Once i did this it has been working perfect ever sence it locks on in about 10 sec and it even locks while sitting inside my house. Also the google maps navigation that comes already on the tablet will work as well with no problems. The sygic app is only a 7 day trial but then its only like $11 usd for it so to have good working GPS its worth that to me.
