Bought this tablet for reading primarily the Financial Times, other publications I now get in paper form and my favorite stock site, Seeking Alpha.  I was lured down the Android path by having a mostly decent experience using an Android Samsung phone for about a year.  Got the LePan II after reading the glowing reviews and have been mostly impressed about how it works.  However, the one site I want to have work, doesn't, namely Seeking Alpha. Going to SA in the Android browser results in a crash  every time.  It freezes in Opera, and loads a blank page in Firefox.  Yet it works on my  Samsung Android phone.  What's the difference?  Samsung vs LePan I can only conclude.  I've had the LePan II for a few days and since we are starting off this badly, I can't just wait for the other sites that don't work either, and god knows what else.  If I get a solution, I'll repost, but for now, I'm not very impressed.Edit 6/30/2012.  I did a recent firmware update and now the browsing works better (in all fairness, trying SA and other sites on public wifi seemed to work just fine, it's something about my network that the LePan doesn't like).  However the battery state, that a few months ago started showing 50% irrespective of charge state, but with the new firmware installed announced that the battery state IC had failed.  I just dealt with it for a few weeks, but the tablet started going into these states that required a reset to get it to start so I contacted LePan support for warrantee service.  They were quick, asking me to to a system reset, then when that didn't work, issuing an RMA immediately.  That was a week ago, and the tablet is with them.  I'll report back on how the service went.
