Ok, I've never owned a smart phone or used any kind of apps, but I thought I would give this a try.  Everyone seems to be making a big deal out of these things nowadays (great, I sound like a grandma!).Anyway, it was easy enough to start up when it arrived and charged pretty quickly.  Right away I had a hard time with the touch screen, it would highlight something that I wasn't even close to or scroll through things way too fast.  I thought it was just because I wasn't used to it, but it never did get better.I tried some of the preloaded apps first.  I didn't like the email app because it seemed like I could only delete the emails after I opened them, maybe there is a way around this that I don't know about, but it was annoying.  I get a good amount of junk mail and just wanted to delete it right from the inbox without opening the emails themselves.I tried the ebook app second, tried to search for some books that might interest me, but it just seemed to be book and writers I've never heard of.Tried getting on the web, this worked ok except one site I frequent uses Java and it was not installed, nor do I know if it's even possible to install on this.  Facebook also looks funky on it.  It's ok for news sites or craigslist, but not too much else to me.I then searched for Apps in the App Library thing, I couldn't find anything I wanted and it showed were free Apps.  Nothing to buy.  I thought maybe I could find something I like in the Apps that actually charge, but I could not find a way to get to them.Overall, I'm not liking this tablet.  I know there are some fixes for my problems by reading forums, but it seems like too much work.  I'm not a complete idiot, but it doesn't seem worth it spend the time trying to fix all these things when a laptop or netbook can just do it right away.Honestly, if I didn't get this through the Vine program, I'd probably end up returning it.
