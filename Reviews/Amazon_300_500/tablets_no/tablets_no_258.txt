This thing is awesome.  I purchased this to compliment my HTC EVO and my MacBook Pro 13".I am a non-traditional student and this device was purchased to bridge the gap between the many times I don't feel like lugging my MacBook Pro (which isn't heavy, but I have a bag for it which is heavy), but having a 4.3" screen like my EVO isn't enough.  It's for that 15-25 minutes you are burning between meetings, classes, or before a class.  It's for sitting on the couch and vegging out and not having to deal with a MacBook's lid.The downside for this is the weight.  It is lighter than an iPad 1, so it isn't dork heavy, it's just heavy enough to be uncomfortable.  Having the proper protective case for it helps give you the confidence to hold it in ways so as not to worry about scratching it or whatever.  In fact, I don't even think I would like to have it if they didn't make a great case for it; and I carry my EVO in it's full glory of nakedness.  Another downside is the smearing, but I don't know how you'd fix that.The strengths of the Honeycomb 3.1 OS are fantastic.  It's buttery smooth, just like the iPad.  While there aren't 100,000 Android tablet specific apps out there yet, like the iPad, I would say there's enough to keep you busy and happy, and a lot of the apps already in the app store(s) are sufficiently supported by Honeycomb and they look just fine.I do suggest getting your hands on a 3rd party keyboard.  I have SwiftKey and I also have Thumb Keyboard and I totally suggest the Thumb Keyboard.  The marketing isn't as sexy, but the TK is THE keyboard and no I have no affiliation with them.Good luck and enjoy the tablet.  I love it!
