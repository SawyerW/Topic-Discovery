Many other reviews already highlighted the pros of this device, here are some of my experience. I like how the Android that came with A500 is very close to stock. I had in mind the fullsize USB port to connect mouse, keyboard, flash drive and game controllers. On many other Android devices, even the lowest volume setting is too loud with earbuds and in-ear-monitors connected, on the A500 its just right. I had other Android tablets, but returned them and eventually settled with the Acer A500.WHY I CHOSE A500 over devices below:-Acer A100: A500 has much better WiFi signal detection, the A100 signal detection was very poor to me.-Asus Transformer: The Transformer doesn't have full-size USB port (on the device itself) nor LED flash. Transformer uses mini-HDMI, but micro-HDMI seems more common which both the A500 and my Android cellphone uses, so I didn't need to buy separate cables.-Toshiba Thrive: I really like the Thrive, it has a very slighter better screen than Acer A500 and similar amount of ports. However, it lacks the slim, aluminum design of the A500. No LED flash.LOW POINTS:-GPS antenna seems weak.-Screen quality is only average. Try a more expensive tablet if you need vibrant colors, good viewing angle and easy viewing under the sun. Check out tablets with "IPS" screen, also some upcoming tablets will use AMOLED screen.-Even though I have no objection for the weight, I can imagine people with fragile wrists having problem holding this device over a period of time.PET PEEVES:(I can live with these issues, but consider them as feedbacks for Acer developers.)-No file manager included (as of Honeycomb 3.1). You'll have to install one from the market. This actually isn't acceptable considering both the Asus Transformer and Toshiba Thrive come with one.-MicroSD folder directory is located at "/mnt/external_sd" in your file manager. Acer should realize not everyone is an Android expert and make it more apparent to locate.
