Bought after over 2 months of tablet research, sequence of several tests on different brands and makes at BestBuy, and very heavy focus on application compatibility for 'preemptive' estimation of upgrades/usability.Top reasons for buying:1) Front camera2) Value for money3) Online reviews4) Tests/experiments with other units viz..n00k, k!ndle F!re, Ip@d, s@m$ung G@laxy tab, etcPleasant surprises upon delivery:1) Build quality2) Touch screen responsiveness3) LCD resolutionNot-so-pleasant surprises:1) Weight2) Buggy apps for Android 2.2(not a Le Pan issue)3) Wi-Fi radio strength4) GPS dependent on internet (since its based on google maps navigation, not on the Unified GPS platform used on car GPS devices)*** I refuse to compare this unit with the iPad, since the business model and integration of the 2 are very different ***Ipads are indigenously built by Apple - Software to Hardware to packagingThe android platform is different, since the software is developed by Google (Kudos!), and they have made it so any manufacturer could port it onto a mobile device meeting the minimum hardware requirements. This in itself, is a commendable design, unlike the AppleIOS, which frankly goes bonkers if exposed to unknown hardware. The Android platform handles different hardware  makes pretty  splendidly, obviously with some quirks, as anticipated with any open source software platform.Point is, evaluation of android tablets should be distinct, in that, the hardware and software should be compared separately.Hardware  SoftwareSuperb build quality  Gels beautifully with the Le Pan HardwareChiseled shape, sits well on the palm  Impressively fastSlightly heavy for a wrist pivot over long duration  Buggy versions of apps for 2.2(ex-skype)Power button needs getting used to, not complaint-worthy tho  Incompatible with GoogleHangouts(2.3 onwards works)Brilliant touch screen resolution and responsiveness  Secondary memory read/write is faster than expected4.5 stars to Le Pan for the hardware  3.5 stars to Google for Android 2.2 (4.5 for Honeycomb)Synopsis - Le Pan has a winner here. I paid around $200 for this unit, which is a steal, and I would strongly recommend buying the Le Pan II with 8gigs of internal memory, so you can install more 'frequently used apps' locally, for even faster response.That said, I am delighted to have purchased this unit for $200, and would buy another Le Pan too.PS - If you are not comfortable with upgrading on the android platform, get help from xdadevelopers, but do not get deterred. The Android OS is superior in architecture, and unless you are willing to be hostage to Apple's barricaded eco-system, you are better off with an Android mobile deviceRecommended improvements:1) Newer android version on factory build (Le Pan II has it)2) Changing mic placement to front panel (for better audio feed during video chat)3) Ultra low profile power button, with inward inundation to avoid accidental brush/touch.
