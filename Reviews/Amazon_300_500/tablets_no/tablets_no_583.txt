I did alot of research before purchasing this product. The hardware specs were the deciding factor, it is $200 less than the closest Tegra 2 tab. Yes, the display is somewhat angle limited but I do not find that to be a problem. USB ports are hard to come by with other tabs.It does seem from the posts that hardware quality may be uneven, but that is why I use Amazon, easy returns! WiFi is the same as my laptop on "G". Screen touch is very good. Skype seems to have some issues, but with Microsoft now as owner, good luck to all of us in android world!The real power comes out when you root the tab and install a custom ROM. I am now running Vegan 7 Gingerbread (1.1 tab firmware) and it is awesome, take it to a store and place it next to a Honeyconb tab! Flash and utube work fine in a web browser, better than reduced capability mobile apps. There are several great sites out there which provide clear guidence, make sure to look for the latest posts, the developers move fast.Any smart (and carefull) person can root the tab but be aware of some major items:Make sure you know if you are running 1.1 or 1.2, they are completly different paths.The 1.2 upgrade has been currently pulled back by Viewsonic, but you can find it in the user sites.If you flash to 1.2 you can try the Honeycomb versions in developement.If you stick to 1.1 the developed base is mature.Do you research, I created a new favorites folder for "gtab" and just started to save web pages. Lots of utube instructional videos out there too.The real beauty is as an unlocked tab you can move at will to newer, better ROMS. You will be able to do a wireless tether with a rooted smartphone for a home rolled hotspot. You can also overclock the processor which will then scream past a stock Tegra 2 tab.I would have given 5 stars but this is not a plug and play device, however with some relatively lite file loading and attention to procedure you can have a powerfull Andriod tab for a superb price.
