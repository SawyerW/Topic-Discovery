I would have given this 4.5 stars, but I rounded up for being pleasantly surprised.I purchased mainly for the price (~$250), but after reading some of the negative reviews, I had second thoughts.  I went as far as clicking on the Cancel Order button, but decided not to follow thru, because of the warning about the order already being processed.  Glad I didn't.I have/had many devices (iPhone, iPad, Samsung Infuse), but the the PlayBook was the most impressive out of the box - namely, because of the fluid navigation and speed of the browser.  I'm sure part of my surprise was due to lowered expectations from reading negative reviews, but the PlayBook is a top notch device (or has potential to be).I mention "potential," because the hardware and interface design is outstanding, but, as many have complained, a lack of native email support and limited applications makes this incomplete.  Hopefully, the OS v2 will release as planned and the promised features will be there.  If it does, I think the PlayBook will be hard to beat.The most impressive feature is the the menu/navigation system.  It is unique and very practical.  To elaborate, the design allows you to view/utilize 100% of the screen until you invoke more options by swiping from below or above the screen.Negatives (all app related): no Netflix player; no LogMeIn, no native email and no Droid Market (until next OS release in Feb)Positives:  hardware; menu/navigation, sound, HD, no iTune-like bloat-ware to manage media (e.g. music, video, pictures)Now that I've experienced the goods, I wish I had paid $50 more for the 32GB version.To be fair, my positive impression is significantly weighed by the promises of the release of OS 2.UPDATE 2012.1.2:PlayBook passes droptest... My son dropped it from about 4 ft onto our ceramic tile floor.  Zero damage.
