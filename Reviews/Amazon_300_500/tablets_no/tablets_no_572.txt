About 2 weeks into the ZiiO 10.Very nice tab for about $300 US.  Wish it could do file xfers via bluetooth.  Also, I have to do a hard reboot just about once a day, not horrible, but that you have to do it at all implies stability issues?  More down the road?  Who knows.The processor is proprietary, I guess; it runs android 2.2 fine.Not much of a game player, but of the few I've loaded (actually, others have loaded), about half of them seem to work properly . . . maybe more than half.The HDMI out is really cool -- only watched a bit of one or two movies, but quality was good.  Some ghosting, but might be the source.  Also, sort of wish it didn't have to be a mini connection (C, I think) on the Z10 side; the cable was only like $10, but the nickels and dimes start to add up, ya know?  The vids run and look very nice on the Z10's screen.The usb is the kind that most of the other Creative products I have use (which is the more common connection; Mini?) so that's cool.  Wish the unit would charge via the USB.SD Card support: handy.Resistive screen:  works fine.Definitely need to back light the front panel buttons.A case would be nice . . . even a cheap one that would protect the screen -- as it is, I bought a $10 soft case made for netbooks and it fits very well -- more nickels and dimes.Stylus came with it . . . now, if I could only find it.  :)  There should be a way to attach the stylus to the unit.Just got the bluetooth D100 speaker and looking forward to hooking that in.  More later on that -- but I've always liked Creative's audio prods.  I'm sure it won't let me down.
