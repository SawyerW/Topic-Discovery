First off, the product description at [...] lists a T301 with 4 GB internal flash and a 4 GB SD card inside the box.  What I received was a T301 with 2 GB internal flash and no SD card.  Suffice it to say that I did not get what was advertised.  The vendor, Worldwide Distributors, sent a 4 GB SD card later but would not upgrade to the 4 GB model.  They offered a refund but I decided to keep what I got and avoid a trip to the post office and more wasted time.  I wish I had listened to one of the reviews below that warned of this.As for the device, I concur with most of the reviews.  It is definitely not an IPad.  It is more of a big Android based phone.  Once I upgraded the OS to version 2.2 and loaded some apps it worked okay.  It was pretty much what I expected and suits most of my needs.  It is compact and travels well.  The installed ebook app works fine and it gets decent Internet access.  Don't expect full browsing capability, however, since you mostly get directed to mobile app web pages.  For instance, I tried to get to Google Maps and the Skyfire browser just died.  I suspect the 256 KB RAM is culprit. It is also a little slow but I expected that given the processor it has.  The external SD storage of up 32 GB is a nice feature as well as the replaceable battery.All in all, I like this device.  If you want to do online banking while watching TV or take it with you on the road to check e-mail then it is a good purchase.  I advise that you get a T301 with 4 GB + internal storage because all your downloads and app installs default to internal memory and that gets used up rather quickly on a 2 GB model.
