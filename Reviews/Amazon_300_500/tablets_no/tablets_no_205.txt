5/14: Now that I have had a few months of experience using the Cruz on a daily basis, I have only become happier with my choice in eReaders. I have had absolutely zero problems and I use the Cruz virtually every day, both for reading and to browse the web and follow my e-mail. Yes, web browsing is slow, but my much pricier and more powerful netbook is not any better.Also, the opening of the Amazon Market has added an easy way to add some fun apps. With the item still selling at very reasonable prices, I would recommend this to anyone interested in a reasonably priced eReader that can do a more than decent job as a tablet.I've been playing with my Cruz e-reader for bits and pieces of a day now, and have had no problems getting this product to handle every function it is advertised to do.  It took very little time and limited tech knowledge to access my Kindle and Borders accounts, read my e-mails, load apps, and open web sites through the browser. Connection to my wireless router was easy and the connection does not drop anywhere in my house. It's size and weight are good for long term use. Yes, it is a little slow when accessing programs and the "touch" screen takes a little effort toget used to, but I am not seeing the major issues in these areas that some other users report. So far, I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to my friends and family. I think it is a great value at the $119.99 price I paid, which seems to be a frequent price on Amazon or through Borders. If I could add a half star to my rating, I think that would more accurately reflect my assessment of this e-reader.
