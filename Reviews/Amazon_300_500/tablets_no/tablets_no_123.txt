My wife and I both own ipads. She got hers in November and I got mine recently. This device rocks. It reminds me of my Iphone 4 on steroids with a much bigger screen. I started to go blind playing games on my iphone. The ipad seemed like a logical choice. I am very happy with it in most areas. Feels good to the hands, light, easy to tote around. Very easy setup and a breeze to use especially if you have an iphone and or ipod touch. I was using it within minutes right out the box. Web browsing is easy. Very handy for checking e-mail. A ton of programs of course through the Apple app store. So why not 5 stars. There are two things that bother me about this device. It has major issues with downloading games from the ipad app store app. Why that is I don't know. I have tried and least 3 games and ended up just downloading them on my main laptop and syncing. Easy enough but why the extra step?. I never had problems with iphone like this. Second of all it does not do flash video. Apple stupidly made a decision not based on customer needs but based on a stupid conflict with Adobe. Flash is still widely used throughout the internet and its a pain to not have this capability. You can use Cloud Browse app as a work around but its clunky and not worth the hassle. On the positive side the battery life is great. The ipad is the beginning shift to major laptops having touch capabilities and I would not be surprised to see lets say a macbook air with  boot capabilities to run both ios an mac os as well as windows 7. Stay tuned Apple has some tricks up its sleeves but for christ sakes get flash to work on this device. At over 600 plus dollars there is absolutely no reason it can't. Steve Jobs is stubborn. Com'on Steve loosen up. Flash will not destabilize the iOS operating system. How come Android OS can do it with no problem. Can you say Android tablet coming soon.triple
