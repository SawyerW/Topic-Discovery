I've had my new ASUS EP121 for the weekend now and I must say that I am quickly falling in love with this little device.  However, if you are not familiar with owning a Tablet PC you might find your new toy to be much like purchasing a Backhoe.  You can do a lot with it, but you need to learn how to operate the thing to really enjoy it.  The USB ports take some getting use to.  They can be difficult to work with but my advice is to not try and force a connector into the slot.  You need to take your time and line it up before trying to connect.  Be careful proping the device up in its "monitor" position and then trying to connect a device into the USB slot.  I actually caused the computer to flop over onto the desk and this gave me the ebbie geebies. Fortunately the device does not have a rotating hard drive.  The harddrive that you have on the system is one of the fastest that I have seen but it is small and you will fill it up if you are not careful.  I strongly recommend getting at least a 64 GB smart card. I would also recommend getting a Microsoft bluetooth mouse just to make life easy for you.  You will not always be using the touch display and the mouse comes in very handy.  I also absolutely love the Microsoft keyboard.  Excellent tactile touch.  Wish the home key had greater accessibility but other than that I am ok with it.  For both the mouse and keyboard I strongly recommend everyone purchase energizer ultimate lithium batteries so that you don't have to keep replacing them. I also purchase a new Axiotron Digitizer pen off ebay for about $10.  Keep in mind that not all digitizer pens will work with the Tablet PC so be careful and do your homework before pulling your wallet out.
