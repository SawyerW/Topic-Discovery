*Update 8-22-2011- Still use everyday and still incredible. All the Toshiba firmware updates come easily in the service station and have fixed ALL my issues such as the SOD, auto on and a much snappier screen. If I lost or broke this unit, I would go out and buy another tomorrow.Okay it's now time for me to chime in and say something about the Thrive.  I have had it now since July 12th and use it everyday.  I am an active member of the Thrive forums and have had the SOD and automatic on issue as well.  I am still SOOO happy with this Tablet!  I won't bore you with the technical details nor the advantages of the ports for that has been discussed over and over.  I will say though, I am happy with Toshiba for dealing with these issues unlike any manufacturer of computers I am aware of to this point.  The tablet is thicker which is a GREAT thing since when I held the iPad and the Galaxy they were too thin for me and felt like I could snap them with a good push (I wish I could try that sometime).  The Thrive is built sturdy, has tons of great features and will have support for aircards, NTFS formatted drives and Netflix soon enough.  MY sleep issue has been eradicated with their last update.  So if you are on the fence about this issue don't worry...it's all good.It rocks and is getting better with all the support updates.  Having the SD card (I have a 128gb SDXC card) is awesome.  Full USB was used many times to load in files from my other computers and don't get me started on the HDMI.  I see no real flaws in this unit at all that have not been addressed.  Placement of cameras, battery, etc...is all revealed to everyone.My ONLY gripe at all would be placement of the volume control.  This must be an Asian thing but my left click gets the volume louder and right lower...which is counterintuitive.Overall a great Tablet and the best I have tried out of the top 6.
