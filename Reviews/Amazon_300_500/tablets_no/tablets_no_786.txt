I almost hesitate to call this a tablet. The only thing that makes it a tablet in my mind is the lack of a direct-attached keyboard and the portability. I can say that in the two+ months that I've had this device, I've used the bluetooth keyboard twice. I'm constantly using the pen to write emails, reviews :), use my Quicken program, access websites, etc. This is a huge bonus for me personally. I'm absolutely loving it.This 64 GByte tablet was bought to replace my kitchen netbook which was incredibly and infuriatingly slow. I needed a Windows computer for some of the applications I need, so the iPad and Android devices, as nice as they are, were useless for my purposes. I have found that I do tend to carry this around occasionally to do some light reading or for some training design work where I need to take notes, and the notes are a combination of text and diagrams. It's in that area where this device really shines for me.Overall, I gave this device five stars for the touch/pen experience, the screen brightness and sharpness, speed (the i5 processor is wonderful), and the leather/leatherette case which protects the device and offers different "standing" positions. The device is heavier, which for me is not a minus because I fully understand that this is still a computer with serious horsepower.The only minus is the battery life. I did not take off any stars for this because I knew that going in, but if this device could, without accessories, go almost an entire day without recharging, it would be ideal for taking on business trips. On average, I get about 3 to 3.5 hours from this with web browsing, reading, and watching shows and movies from Netflix and Comcast online.There are cheaper options out there but this device is @ the top of the list if you're looking for speed, screen brightness and sharpness (viewing angles on this are superb), sound, and a smoother touch/pen experience.And this entire review was "hand written" with the pen :)
