I am a studio and stage musician that was looking for a tablet to put set lists on and be able to write lyrics with.  I record with musicians in Silicon Valley that are senior scientists at Apple and Invidia, so I have been an iPhone user for quite some time.  However, iPad 2 is a bit cost prohibitive and after researching dozens of Chinese knock-offs I decided to go with Viewsonic G.  The 16 gig internal storage, dual processor speed, and micro-SD expansion made it stand out in the under-$300 range June 2011.  With no experience at all in the Android world I had no problem figuring out the basics.  Downloading a few apps was far easier than dealing with iTunes and I was pleased to be able to move files from my laptop and locate them on the pad with a familiar Windows-type file manager.  Along with the tablet I purchased a screen protector and a case with a built-in USB keyboard - which I highly recommend.  It is essentially a touch-screen laptop that I can pull the tablet out for more portability and to be used on stage without the awkwardness of an actual laptop.  I have no interest in playing games or watching movies on it...but I have several chord references, tuners, and various music-related apps.  I have also switched over from a Kindle to the Kindle E-reader app (the larger size and back-lit screen is a little more practical for me).  It appears that some early kinks were worked out because I've had no issues whatsoever right out of the box.  I will be ordering one for my wife (also a studio and performing musician).  I am so happy with this purchase that I have upgraded to an Android phone (I'll wait a while to let my Apple buddy know.)
