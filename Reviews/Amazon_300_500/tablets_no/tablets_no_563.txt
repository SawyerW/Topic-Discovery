Got this as a gift and spent a few days with it. I do own an iPad.Pros- My media files do not need to be processed by iTunes, I can just drag and drop to the ZiiO after it was recognized by my PC as a USB drive.- I can play all the video files I loaded to it, even up to 1080p trailers, play it back on the HDMI on my large LCD TV and it looks great.- The player is much lighter than the iPad.- The micro SD card slot is very convenient, after loading it with media from my PC, pop it in and had no problem browsing through the files.Cons- Resistive touch. I got used to it, it was not that bad.- Display is not as good as iPad. But then given that the unit is about half of what an iPad sells for, it is very usable.- Android 2.1 only, I expect they will offer an upgrade to Android 2.2 in the future.Ran the Quadrant benchmark and got a score of 2037! That is more than the Moto Droid X 2.2+.I was able to run Kindle and download books on it. No problem with Maps and Street View either.I am a happy camper!____________________________Updated: April 8, 2011I upgraded my ZiiO to the latest firmware release(Froyo) and I am still a happy camper as it supports Flash now. I hope they will release an accelerated Flash plug in soon then it will be awesome for the value of this tablet!Oh, I just bought an iPAD2, still frustrated that there is no Flash support. Probably will return it or put in on eBay as it is not such a big improvement over the first gen iPAD._____________________________Updated: Sept 22, 2011Looks like Creative finally posted a new firmware (2.00.14) and the accelerated Flash Player to go with it. I upgraded it and it works fine.
