Those who gave this device a bad ratings should probably buy iPads in the first place.This pad becomes useful once I applied the Google MarketPlace hack on the device.  I do need to stress that the process isn't totally straight forward and does required some technical skills.  It took me about 3 hours to process the info from the cookbooks on web and applied it successfully.  (Google with keywords: Coby, Kyros, Guide)PROs:The screen's visual quality is better than I expected. The 7" size is also perfect.The build quality is ok considering the low price.Last but most importantly,  it can be hacked to run Google Market Place.Cons:No built-in cameraNo GPSNo multi-touch screenDoesn't charge from the USB portWill NEVER support Android 2.2 or 2.3.  Android 2.1 is buggy and slow.Doesn't come with Google Marketplace. It is not COBY's fault. This is common in every Android Pad.* Awful short warranty period of 3 months.** $10 return shipping even for warranty repair.  It has to be paid by money order*** 5 weeks turn around time for any repair(If they don't lose your unit.)Basically, if the unit breaks on you,  consider it a goner.TWO MONTHS AFTER  (WARRANTY REPAIR):The unit stopped charging.  The power adapter tested fine.  So it is time to go through the warranty repair process.  Coby's warranty is a short 3 month.  The hold time during the call wasn't too long.  However, to send the unit back,  COBY requires a money order of $10 for return shipping.TWO WEEKS AFTER SENDING IN THE UNIT:Called up the support line to find the status of the repair.  The warranty repair turned into a nightmare.  Coby support couldn't find the case number in their computer.  They couldn't even find any record of my previous call,  my address,  name ... etc.  They said just wait 4 to 5 weeks which is their normal turn-around time.
