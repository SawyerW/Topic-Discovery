Synopsis for now, more to come... The version I bought had 2GB ram, Windows 7 Home Premium, 250GB hard drive, and the standard non-extended battery (3 or 4 cells).  I love this machine, it's not perfect but it has quite a bit of functionality for the money.  It's the swiss army knife of computers.  It isn't really the best at anything but it does more than anything else out there at this time - as far as touch-pad/tablets are concerned.  I'm not sure a 1GB version would work well enough but other reviews here will tell that. Also, some say the Home Premium version makes this work better, so an upgrade may be necessary.Bullet points:Note: See the many Youtube videos about "Lenovo S10-3t" for tips on usage and tuning the machine to work better.* Sumatra PDF - I found this program to be the best for reading PDF e-books. It's small and smooth on flick-scrolling pages. I read mostly text so have not tested it much with graphic rich PDF's.* Firefox Browser with plugins - The "Grab and Drag" plugin is a must for touch-browsing.Pro's: everything. This device gets allot right in abilities/functionality, especially for the price and compared to the iPad.Con's:* Standard battery lasts longer than many notebooks but nothing great. I would recommend a 6 or 8 cell battery.* Even with 2GB and 4GB SD card running as Windows "ready boost", things sometimes slow down. But not often enough to be too annoying. Good overall. Still, not the smoothest touch-pad experience. Don't expect it to be as fast/smooth as an iPhone or iPad.* Keyboard and Touchpad could be better but are sufficient.* The left side buttons for changing screen orientation and starting up the Lenovo NaturalTouch app are hugely annoying.  They are too easy to hit on accident when using the S10 in portrait mode.* Not sure how useful the NaturalTouch app is, and it crashes fairly often. They'll probably update it and fix the bugs in the future.* It's a little heavy.Again, not perfect, but a great machine for the money!
