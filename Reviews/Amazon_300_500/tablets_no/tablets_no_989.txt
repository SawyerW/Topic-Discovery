I was skeptic whether or not the offline GPS would work on the tablet, because samsung is pretty notorious when it comes to GPS. (my galaxy S phone is a piece of poo for offline navigation, coz it will take forever to lock satellites & and usually lose them). This one works, GPS locks in a blink. Together with the "download offline map", the new lab feature from google Map, I prefer the 10.1 to Garmin.GPS & navigation is another reason you might want to buy the 10.1 than ipad, because not only is the ios Google Map application still in ancient age, but also the ipad wifi version not equips with offline GPS.Apart from GPS, the tablet is alright. Good construction. Honeycomb rocks. Thin, light, screen is bright, sharp, and wide, best screen in tablet category so far, ipad2 included ( I compared them all in best buy side by side, transformer/thrive/xoom/ipad2 ).The only thing that I don't like is the fact that samsung chose to not having memory slot, not even the tiny micro sd. This has a draw back when you connect it to computer, because the only available protocol is MTP (not sure if it's the galaxy fault or Honeycomb poor decision, or what), which is not as convenient as mounting it as "storage", which allow you to access just like a filesystem. In MTP you can only copy files to it (not confirm, but from what I've experienced so far).Anyway I use Ubuntu 11.04, when plugging the tablet in, it recognizes without having to install any samsung driver. But for whatever reason, tranfering many big files, sometimes fail, like couple days ago I attempted to transfer 3 movies about 1G each, 2 succeeded, 1 failed, I had to re-transfered it. Well, I can live with it.Hopefully, soon there will be other competitors who releases thin light good screen ones to put pressure on samsung to include memory card slot, coz right now they are the only one in the category, so they can do whatever.
