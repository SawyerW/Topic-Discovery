I'm an iOS developer with a published app on the App Store. I've developed an iPad application as well and used iOS personally for some time.I'm also a heavy user of Google services (mail, cal, docs, etc.) and after using these on my first break from iOS I was sold on Android.(I used to have a Droid X and now own the Nexus S 4G)However, recently I was thinking of buying a tablet, and in the end after writing up all the features and applications I needed and wanted, giving each one a weight in importance and then rating the experience and quality of each on both platforms based on reviews, the Samsung came our ahead (very slightly) for my criteria at least. There are a number of things I really would have wanted the iPad for (It is sooo shiny!) but in the end I bought the Samsung.I love the Mac (owning both a Gaming PC and the new 27" iMac and MacBook pro) but I get more done with less hassle in the Google ecosystem.What appeals to me about honeycomb 3.1 (I am quite pleasantly surprised at just how much better it is than gingerbread) is how closely it ties with your Google account. But this was not even what I based my decisions on (those were things like screen quality, connectivity, battery life, etc)However, there was some issue with the Samsung. Mainly for me was the problem with the keyboard dock intermittently not being recognized fully, as well as sporadic temporary problems downloading apps from the market (tested on several different WiFis and even after a factory reset type thing)I am hoping these issues may be sorted out, but although disappointing, I have decided it may not be worth giving up (and returning it) on what I have come to love otherwise.PS: I also don't like Flash (hate that as much as Skype and Facebook), AND I would have loved to have a iPad to develop on.. but the other plusses of the Android just shines.
