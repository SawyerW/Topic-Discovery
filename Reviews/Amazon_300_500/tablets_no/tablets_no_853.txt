I really wanted & expected to like this tablet but it didn't make it easy.First was the display. It isn't as clear as other tablets I own & this bugs me everytime I use it. It seems washed out like it needs a lot more contrast, especially on white screens or webpages (which is pretty much everything almost). I wish it was sharper.It seemed slow right from the start, even though its the largest one (32gb) & I added an additional 8gb sd card. Every browser I tried on it seemed to choke and pdf files would never fully load. So this meant I could never fully load the user manual on this device. Other apps loaded ok, not great but tolerable.The sound quality is so-so & at first extremely low until I figured out that I needed to uncheck the "default" setting under "multimedia" & move sliders up to increase volume (default setting are only set to about 25%). This increased volume but does not improve quality.The video is hit or miss for me.,,,,sometimes it works & sometimes not and with the not so great display, it just makes it worse.There is no Netflix either or Hulu but Hulu isnt technically available on any mobile devices.As for some positive things,It came with a few good things like a Printer app, which should be on all tablets. It prints from wifi and other printers which is great.There is an antivirus app but I think its a trial, still good though. It has Honeycomb but does not have an update for latest yet.Also, they included a pretty good file manager app which makes file transfers easier.The ports are a nice plus. I love the full size USB port for external drives.All in all, its a decent tablet. Maybe I'm expecting too much but I can't return it, only exchange so I might get used to it,I don't mind the look of it either. Its a little thicker than others but it doesn't bug me. I am gonna see if "rooting" it may bethe answer.All reviews I read seem happy with device so maybe I'm the rare exception. In any case, I suggest seeing it in person before buying.
