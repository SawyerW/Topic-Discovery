I bought this tablet a couple of weeks ago. It was decent while it worked but it kept crashing and crashing for unknown reasons. Thought it was the battery but even after recharging it would go down again. You can't download anything from the android market but if you download apps from another source i.e an android smart phone they will run fine on this tablet apart from Skype which does not work anyway. Keyboard reduced functionality can be fixed by downloading an app named swype which makes typing much easier compared to its original keyboard. Many of its software drawbacks can be fixed this way. Also you have to be aware to open system manager regularly and close down programs that run in the background. If you don't pay attention to this its performance will be severely affected. The screen is ok although not of the highest quality. One big advantage of this sort of tablets that make them more competitive to Kindle or other similar devices is the fact that it can read pdf files through a great variety of good readers. It offers microsoft office functionality through 'documents to go' with some basic edit capabilities. Videos are ok although u tube will not open on this table unless another program (best tube is downloaded).I don't know if my device (returned today) was defective but by reading other reviews I realise I am not the only one who had similar problems. Overall it comes to accepting that you buy what you pay for. The only reason I bought this item was to give android a try which is comparable to snow leopard installed on my i Mac. If you want a flawless functionality an ease of use and you are willing to pay a decent sum then wait  for the iPad 2 or tablets on higher price tags with probably offer a better reliability.
