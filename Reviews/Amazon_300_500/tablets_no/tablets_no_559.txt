If you're looking for an e-reader, go buy an e-reader.If you're looking for a tablet, look elsewhere.I can forgive a lot of things. No android market? Fine, I can use Amazon Appstore. Not the newest version of Android? Fine, 2.2 (it comes with upgrade instructions to get you to 2.2) is new enough for app compatibility.The major problem here is the kind of CPU this thing has. It uses a MIPS architecture, rather than ARM. These are different kinds of CPU that computers can have, for the less geeky readers. This comes up when you try to install apps from the Amazon marketplace. Any app which uses native code (specially optimized bits of the program to speed things up) won't install on this, because it has the wrong kind of CPU.No angry birds.No fruit ninja.No netflix.No recent flash support.I couldn't even get a simple wordfind app to install.Ugh.The worst part of it is everything looks on the up-and-up until the very last second of installing an app. You can install Amazon App Store just fine. You can download the app. You can begin to install the app. After churning for a little bit, it quits with an "Application Not Installed" error. That's it. No clue what to do. If you're not an android hacker what the heck are you supposed to do? How would you know what's going wrong?My kids certainly didn't. I had to tether the tablet to my PC and use ADB (Android Debug Bridge, a developer tool) to see what the real error messages were from the Android system itself. On the plus side, the tablet comes already rooted (at least, after the 2.2 upgrade, I didn't check pre-upgrade).Sorry this review is very long. Bottom line: If you wanted games on this, don't buy this. If you didn't know what most of the stuff I said up there meant, don't buy this.
