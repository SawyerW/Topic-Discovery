After my bro got a Velocity Micro Cruz 2.1 tablet for Christmas, I just knew I needed one too. :P  I was going to get a Velocity too, but I started hesitating when he found out that he couldn't install a lot of apps; Angry Birds and other games/apps wouldn't install because of the lack of a 3D GPU and the outdated 2.1 Android OS.  A few days later I got an ad from Big Lots, and saw this tablet for $130.  I went by the store and bought it the next day after reading a few favorable reviews.  I opened it, booted it up, got it on the charger...and promptly downloaded, installed, and played Angry Birds. :D  I was amazed at how smoothly the game ran; it never locked up, and barely slowed down at all on the big levels.  After having used it for 2 months, I can honestly say that I've thoroughly used this tablet enough to write a review on it.Pros:Quite fast. (NOTE: speed decreases if you install a lot of apps.)Can play graphic-oriented games; Angry Birds, Krazy Kart Racing, Cut the Rope, etc.App compatibility-I've never found an app I can't installBattery runs for hours when surfing the Web or reading books, but drains a lot faster with games.Easy to hold in one hand, the borders on the side of the screen are the perfect width.External buttons: Home, Settings, Search, and Back buttons below the screen help when an app isn't responding.Touchscreen isn't iPad-quality, but is very responsive.Great value for the money: an equivalent tablet would be $150+Cons:Sluggish when lots of apps are installed on the deviceInternet is slightly slowLocks up sometimes when opening graphic-oriented gamesNo camera/micFavorite Apps:GetJar marketSlideMe marketLast.FM (music downloader)Words FreeNote Everything (great notepad)Wiki Pro (Wikipedia app)Offline DictionariesMailDroid (email client)Expense (expense-tracking app)Algeo (graphing calculator, great for math students)Aldiko (ereader app)Smart Office (Document reader/editor)FDroid (another app marketplace)Amazon AppstoreFavorite Games:Angry Birds (of course!!! :D )Checkers/Chess FreeDS Tower DefenseKrazy Kart RacingMinesweeper ClassicReflexionsXeno Tactic II LiteOverall, the tablet is AWESOME.  As you can see, the pros far outweigh the cons.  My biggest recommendation if you are planning on buying one of these is to download the Astro File Manager app and put the shortcut to the Astro Processes Killer on the home screen.  When you are about to play Angry Birds or want the tablet to speed up, kill all the processes with the aforementioned app.  This speeds the tablet up to handle those big games.  Also, don't expect this thing to be an iPad.  It's not.  It is a low price, high quality, occasionally sluggish Android tablet that has NO access to the Android Market that plays Flash video, reads ebooks, surfs the Web, and plays games all in a compact, sleek package.  I would recommend this tablet in a heartbeat.
