I have been shopping for a replacement for my laptop for quite a while.  I an leased to Microsoft because of software I use at work, so while the Droid tablets were nice, I had to have something with Windows.  I started looking at the 7 and 9 inch tablets but they are too small to actually work on.  I went back to a laptop as the prices were reasonable and the performance was there but still I wanted a tablet.  I keep things a long time, so I wanted something that would last me through a few upgrades of the OS.  Looking at the Asus Transformer and the Dell tablet / keyboard neither really was exactly what I wanted.  Then I found this on line.  The reviews were mostly good, the hands on videos were impressive, so I got one yesterday and I could not be happier.Pros:- it boots super fast thanks to the solid state drive- the processing speed is impressive, even when multi-multi tasking, thanks to the dual core i5- the weight is next to nothing compared to the concrete block of a laptop I came from- the cost is comparable with similar laptops- plugged in or in high res mode the screen is ultra clear- use handwriting with stylus, Blue-tooth keyboard or on-screen keyboardCons:- battery life is as stated UNLESS you actually need to see the screen.  In battery only mode the screen dims to save power and if you push it back up to max, the batter life is actually about 2.5-3 hours while using it.  Sleep mode saves on this if you are not working on it full tilt.- the USB slot covers take an act of congress to get out, finally wound up using a screwdriver, maybe they will ease over time so that you can do it with your fingernail.Overall:This is a great tool for work and play.  It is crisp, clean and fast fast fast.  Can't wait for Window 8 to get released to upgrade for a fully optimized Windows Touchscreen experience.This is a keeper!
