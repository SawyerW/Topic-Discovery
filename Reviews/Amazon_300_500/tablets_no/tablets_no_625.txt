My Toshiba Thrive was one of the best purchases I have made. Even though the Thrive is an older, end-of-life'd model, I chose it because of the beautiful functionality of the product. I travel for work and am frequently at trade shows. Being able to just carry this instead of my laptop, presentation folder and in-flight entertainment system (PMP) is a huge benefit. On the trade show floor, I am able to use this for all of my on-the-fly presentation material and with the full-sized USB ports I am able to instantly give the material to anyone with a thumb drive on their keychain! Video playback is excellent and with the expandable memory slot, I am able to travel with a few 32Gb SD cards that hold hundreds of movies!!Another bonus is the ability to instantly swap out the battery -- and replacement batteries are now available for a much more affordable $20 or so (compared with the $60 to $80 when it was first released). So I keep a couple extra batteries in my bag and I am good for all-day use.Cons: Even though the ability to swap out the battery is a bonus, the battery life itself isn't really that great -- 5 hours at best. In addition, accessories such as cases are extremely limited. I think there's only a few styles available, let alone anything like a case-keyboard combo. And since this is not an old model (the new Toshiba is the Excite), new accessories won't be coming out.Overall, this is an excellent business tool and entertainment source. The iPad, by comparison, leaves a lot to be desired. The iPad has no expandable memory -- which is a major downfall -- and you have to use iTunes to manage any media. And even though there's loads of accessories, I would never chose an iPad for those two main reasons. And of the Android tablets on the market, this one, even though older, is an absolute work horse, and that is exactly what I needed.
