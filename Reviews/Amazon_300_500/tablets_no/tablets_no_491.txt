Don't get me wrong.  I really like the iPad and most iProducts.  We own 4 iPods of different vintages and models.  The current nano is like magic.  (see Clarke's Law).  I just don't like Apple and their holier than thou and more superior than thou attitude about their products and operating systems.  Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.  And as I suspected that person was in for a rude awakening when it came to making the iPad work and play well with others (the rest of the world that is android and windows based) and don't get me started about not supporting Flash.  So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail. Speaking of buying things, you will have to buy the smart cover and you will probably want the back smart cover and an a longer power cord and then a carrying case. Also with all things" I " you cannot add memory, no sd card slot but that's ok you can store things in the cloud.  I don't want to store things in the cloud.  Clouds invariably blow away or want to charge you rent. There's a lot of things to like and a lot of things not to like about the iPad as with any tablet I have seen.  You are paying a premium over the competition to join this club and the iPad is just not as tricked out with ports and interfaces to the real world as I would like.  Works well and makes users happy so there is somerthing to be said for that.  Can't imagine someone not being happy being given one as a gift.
