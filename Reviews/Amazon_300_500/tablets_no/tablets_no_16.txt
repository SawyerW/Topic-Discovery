I am an Apple device user, not because I am a fanboy or shareholder, or no other bias, but just because since the day I moved from Win Vista to Mac OSX, and iPhone, my life became less cluttered, and less of headaches. Last year when Nexus 7 was announced, I realized that there is some "spark" in this tablet and it hit the right spot where I can carry this device in my jacket, giving me exact balance of portability and size. In last 12 months, I went through 3 of these devices, and here is the breakdown.(the only reason I kept on buying them was due to its right size, iPad mini is bigger for what I would carry)1. Original 16 Gig, 250$ N7, came with a squeaky glass. It worked fine but the sqeaky glass always scared me, when will this thing fall apart? Sold it, to upgrade to Cellular N7, and to get rid of the squeaky glass.2. Cellular 32 Gig, N7. Worked fine till 2 months later, the speakers died. Google play messed up replacement, refused to send another device and refused to give my money back. Credit Card company had to intervene to rescue my money. (I am not buying anything from Google play, their support is horrendous, and the staff manners are unheard of)3. WiFi 16 Gig N7, 200$, from Office Max. Similar story, 2 months into using, Missed touch inputs, USB cable breakdown, occasional tablet freezes, getting hot on its back, occasional unsolicited restarts. Sold it again.None of my devices were manhandled or dropped. They were treated with same care and dignity as rest of Apple devices.I am not comparing contents on Apple and Google ecosystems, as what I need is universally available. I think it is more of an ASUS issue than Google, but if Google is going to use low quality hardware to keep prices low to capture market from Apple, who always deliver quality products, I think Google is liable as well.Compare this to my 3 year old iMac, 2 year old iPad, I never had any such issues with them. They Just Work.
