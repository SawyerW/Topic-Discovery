I had this GPS only for 2 days. Where can I start... You are required to have either Internet Explorer or Google Chrome for their website to work properly and allow you to download updates. This means that almost half of the web users that use firefox, safari, opera etc are treated like garbage. I only found out about it after I called their tech support as they have meticulously hidden this fact from their web site.Another fact  that they have hidden is that this product (as well as the GOTO line of GPS) is NOT READY FOR THE MARKET!! After downloading some new voices (I needed Greek so my father can use it easier) to my GPS I realized that these voices were grayed out and I couldn't select them! I called tech support yet again (I'm not the type of guy that calls tech support for nothing normally) and guess what: the software that downloads and installs languages, voices, updated maps etc has a bug and doesn't work properly with the VIA series... In other words: If you re stupid enough to buy it, you're on your own if you need anything more that what it has in it when you bought it. At least these were free voices... What if I had bought some that are not free and didn't work? I asked them to forward me where on their web site there was a warning about their buggy software... How was I supposed to know this before I ordered this GPS.The one star is for Amazon and the store that shipped this GPS cause this was the fastest shipped product I ever received (what irony...) and Amazon makes the return request a two mouse click process. I hope the request will go through and I'll get rid of this piece of junk. Back to my Garmin, forever!!!
