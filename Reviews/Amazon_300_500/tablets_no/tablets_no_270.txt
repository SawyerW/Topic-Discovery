The idea of a tablet pc is a good one, this however is far from good. The thing is SLOW. HP has done a good job of fitting quality hardware in a small package, yet it is not enough. There are other tablets out that have better internals and may support a full OS better, I am unsure about that. What I do know is that this machine is not really capable of running Windows 7, at least not well. It runs very slow and the interface is very difficult to use on a touch interface.Often times while using it I find that I plug in a keyboard and mouse and use it as a tiny little laptop. I think this machine would function well if had a smaller OS something like linux maybe. However, you would still run into the problem of the interface. If you are looking into purchasing one of these, I say do not. If you want a small computer to carry around to do little things, or to simply surf the web, get a netbook. You can get a netbook that is much more capable than this device for a fraction of the price. If you are looking for an alternative to something like an Ipad, I suggest an asus tablet. If you are looking for a "WOW" factor, by all means by throw your money at this. Currently I do not think this device is up to standard for windows 7, or windows in general. The idea is there, and this is a start, yet far from where we need to be. I have been using this thing for about a month now and after that initial, "this thing is cool", I have been nothing but disappointed with it. Also please do not think I am some fool biter about a bad product here, I am an IT specialist and believe this is not practical for any type of business use at all. I would wait another year or two to buy a tablet, or look into one that has the droid OS on it. I am not a fan of the droid OS personally, but the practicality of it is much high.*OS= Operating System
