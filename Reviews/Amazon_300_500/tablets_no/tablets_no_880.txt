UPDATE 15 May:I did end up having to deal with the tablet freezing up and some apps force closing, but I think this is due to ICS not being stable enough yet to work with all the different apps and processes. Oh, I ran a benchmark test and got a 1300 MHz (1.3 GHz?) score.Ended up returning because of the light bleeding, and because I felt a bit overcharged for this tablet. However, if the price drops to around $400, and ICS becomes a bit more stable, I'll most likely buy it again...INITIAL REVIEW 12 May:(I didn't buy mine through Amazon, but I wanted to leave a review anyway). So far, so good! Fast, light and the screen seems bright enough for me, though I'm not too picky about screen brightness issues other than "bleeding." Yes, I want a bright screen that displays colors impressively, but I don't need iPad quality. I would, however, take issue if I had problems with the wifi or touch screen (which I did not). I'm happy to report that I was able to connect with my network with NO disconnect/reconnect issues (which I had with another tablet). A few lag issues and one or two force closes with apps, but I think that's because a few apps may not yet be compatible with this tablet. (Also, I have a tendency to try and switch tabs, screens and programs too quickly)! Music and videos play with no stuttering, and I haven't had any sound issues (no echoes or distortion with my headphones). Sound without the headphones is fairly loud, but why have the speakers on the bottom? Go figure!One more thing, if you were wondering if the processor is 1.5 vs. 1.2 GHz, I think it's actually 1.4 GHz. Amazon has got the processor speed wrong according to the NVIDIA website.Give me a few more days to play, and I'll update my review on - IMHO - a very "worthy of your money" tablet!
