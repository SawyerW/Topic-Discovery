This tablet is awesome. I bought it as a replacement for my laptop, now I knew that I would still need my laptop for flash related games on the internet but I hardly ever play those anyway. This does very well for me for school. I can type papers on it using Google docs, I can slip it into my backpack and go where ever. Its very durable. I've only dropped it a couple times, and both times were hard falls on the corner and it doesn't even have a scratch. The back plate is durable too, it doesn't scratch easily. I've dragged this thing along my porch, kitchen tile, even the pavement a little, and it only has a couple scratches. Now one thing that I like about it is that in portrait orientation I can type with 2 thumbs like I can a phone. That's pretty cool. Thenlandscape keyboard is much like a computers. This has some cool games, and it plays them all nicely, no lag at all. Wireless is pretty fast, and strong. Not as strong as my laptop, but stronger than most portable devices. I liked honeycomb, but ICS has more features and has a sleeker look in my opinion. Over all I like this tablet, and would recommend it for anyone who wants a tablet for personal and school use. Oh, and I should say that I found a dent on the back plate that wasn't there before. I think it got there from my backpack, but it gets squished in there with books and binders and clothes, so its not that bad. And the screen does fine too, there's hardly a scratch on it. Battery life is excellent by the way, I can get usually 2 days with heavy use. I've been using it for about 4 1/2 months and i plan on using it for plenty more years to come!
