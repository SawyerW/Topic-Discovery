I have had a pair of Fujitsu Lifebook t5010's for about a year now and I really have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about.  I have one at home and one in my office that I have sync'ed data wise for ease of use.  These two laptops are easily the most dependable computers I have ever owned (starting back in the Apple IIe days).The motion/shock sensor has saved my data on more than a couple of occasions when I fell asleep holding the computer in my lap and had it tumble to the floor.The screen is bright and easy to read in all kinds of lighting conditions including outdoors (I have another laptop that claims you can read the screen outdoors but with the Fujitsu YOU CAN).I have never had any problems what so ever with the pen and pen callibration took less than five minutes and I have NEVER had to re-set or re-callibrate the pen.Tha battery charges quickly and lasts on average over three and a half hours per charge if I am not watching movies or using the dvd drive much which cuts into battery time.I routinely use this with a 31" external monitor with no problems what so ever.  The graphics card is not really a gaming card so don't expect blazing fast frame rates but it is faster than my Asus VX-2.In tablet mode you can have it in portrait or landscape and you can set it so that it either follows how you a re holding it or maintains the setting you have chosen.I have Windows XP Tablet Edition as the operating system on one my t5010's and Windows 7 on the other.  No problems with either oS.It is a fast powerfull computer and after a year I still have not found anything I did not like about the computer.You can find these laptop/tablets anywhere from $450 (refurbished) up to about $1149 on line.EnjoyDRBurroughs
