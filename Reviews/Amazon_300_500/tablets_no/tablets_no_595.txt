I had been going to bestbuy once a week for a couple months playing with the new tablets when they came out trying to find one for my wife. I thought I had found it when the Thrive come out but then heard about the sleep of death issues and decided against it. Then I did a search on Amazon and came across this tablet, read the reviews and people were giving good reviews except for the software. They basically said when you get it you would to have to root it with newer software. So I got on YouTube and watched a video on how to do it and then ordered the g tablet. We recieved the tablet superfast from the seller Woot,charged it up then turned it on, registered it and then hit the update button about 30 sec later it was done and this tablet runs FANTASTIC!!! without having to do anything else to it.  This hooked right to our wi-fi at the house with no problem. When it hooks up to web sites it may do it a tick slower than the ipad2 but faster than the galaxy tab.So its right there with the tabs that cost twice as much. Screen quality seems pretty good but without being able to compare them side by side I cannot tell for sure but I am happy with the g tabs screen. Speakers are the same as other tabs and they just plain suck. We have some enternal speakers plugged into it and it sounds very good.  We have had this tab for acouple weeks and are very happy with this tablet. It is heavier than the ipad2, we are waiting for some new cases that are coming out next month.They have a kick stand type feature that would be perfect for holding this tab up while you use it.  Overall, I would highly recommend this not only because of the great price but also because its a very good tablet and it would hold its own against the higher priced tablets out there.
