The good - at 10", it's easy for my wife to read, and it's easy for her to manipulate the screen.  As an ereader it is easier for her to see the text than a 7" screen would, and for Angry Birds it's hilarious how well she can play it on this tablet over, say, her phone.The bad - I thought ALL Android products came with the Android Market.  This does not - and it turns out, a lot of tablets don't.The considerations - This tablet uses a resistive touch screen, so it can't do the two-finger "pinch" movements.  My wife has some digital difficulty due to microstrokes, so that's good for her.  It also requires a bit more pressure than the capactive screens do, again that's good for her.  Others may find this irritating or make it almost unusable - be forewarned about this (again, for us, this made it a better choice.)Contrast is excellent on it.  The buttons on the border, however (home, menu, back, etc.) are hard to see at times, due to the lack of contrast.Battery life, as always, could be better.  Until they're powered by quark spin, however, you will ALWAYS hear that.  She can read a book for up to six hours without any problem - and on a fresh charge, she can play Angry Birds for over three hours.  Or Solitaire or Mahjong for three hours.  I call that acceptable.  Your mileage may vary.  I don't know how long the battery will last running videos, we don't on this unit.It can play Flash videos, but it can't run the Flash games on Facebook.  I find this a plus, the wife finds it neutral.  Again, YMMV.It gets four stars because of the lack of the Android Market.  If Creative fixes that, I'd give it five.
