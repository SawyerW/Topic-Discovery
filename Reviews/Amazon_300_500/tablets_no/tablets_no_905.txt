First let me say, I started off with Apple products, not because I love Apple, but because they worked. I knew it would be a matter of time before someone came up to challenge Apple. I watched as the Android OS came mature. It is still in need of refinement but it is "OPEN". This is the main reason I am giving Apple the boot. They try their best to entrap you in there eco-system. All I want is a device that will let me add whatever I want to it. Android is my device of choice.I like the Tab mainly because of its size. I have a iPad 1 and it is not easily transportable as the Tab. See how many things you can stick you iPad in vs the Tab. I can live with the small screen, because I am use to e-readers. Screen resolution works for me and navigation is simple. Now after being on Apple os for a while, it is taking a little while to get use to the new screen interface. The more I use it the more I am beginning to like it. It does has it's limits but so does the iPad. Really the only thing I hate is that the Tab is a phone in other country's, not here, If it was I would switch over to it and use it as a phone/tablet.The only reason I am giving the Tab a four star is because it will get slow at time and very rarely lock up. I am sure this is because there is too much background stuff going on. After I better understand the os I am sure I can get rid of most of this.Bottom line is this. If you want a device that you don't have to learn, iPad. If you want to squeeze as much as you can out of an device and can be patient and learn. TAB or android.
