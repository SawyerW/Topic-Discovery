First of all, I do like this tablet.  It is not a flawless, polished piece of technology, but it is pretty good for the money.  If you want a flawless tablet experience, spend $700 on the iPad.  I love that this has USB ports and TWO SD card slots.  The ethernet is also nice since large downloads, like GPS offline maps, can take a long time over the wireless.  I use this to check my email and surf the internet when I'm sitting in bed or out and about.  Its much lighter than any netbook which would have been my other choice. Some notes on my experience so far.The Cons:- Get a screen protector, the plastic scratches easily.  I found some that are made for it on ebay, search for "superpad" (it's the same thing)- Sluggish interface response, you can find some youtube videos floating around, that is not the video being choppy it is the interface, use your finger nail or built-in stylus for best touch results- "cheap" feel, plastic can be bent out of shape, etc.- Visible screen flicker when holding in vertical position- Speakers are not very good at all, any kind of noise in the room makes them basically in-audible- display is not visible at all in sunlight, even on brightest setting.- GPS requires external antenna, some have complained about GPS lock on time, I live in the northeast and it does it by the time I can exit the GPS settings and get the GPS test program running.- Shipping did take awhile, but was well packaged and shipped right away, its just coming from China.- I have locked this up once or twice, but its hard to say if it was an android app, or the OS it's self.The Pros:- Cheap!- 2 SD card slots that support 32 GB- 2 USB ports, the case I found on ebay has a small usb keyboard built in which is awesome when typing an email on the road- Ethernet port for when there is no wifi- Lots of apps in android market place.- Some folks have been successful flashing this with Ubuntu Linux which I would love to do, but if you mess it up you have an odd shaped paper weight.
