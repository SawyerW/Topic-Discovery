I researched the heck out of buying a tablet.  I purchased an ipad as a gift for my husband and my son took it over.  It was a pain in the neck trying to get the ipad away from him.  Our family of 4 already each have our own ipod touches 4th generation and I have a droid smartphone.  I saw how much more my droid could do over the iPad.  So I saw this great deal over the summer on refurbished Toshiba Thrive 16 gb.  They had a 2 week return policy, no questions asked.  So I said why not give a try.  Boy I am thrilled that I did.  I wound up purchasing 2 Toshiba Thrives for myself and my daughter and my son was so jealous!Here are the features that I love about the Toshiba Thrive.  To this day 4/6/2013 - It still stands out over the competition and I constantly trying to find another device to beat this and it has never happened.:1. Ports include:  mini-USB, HDMI and USB ports2. Full-sized SD card reader - compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media  -- Unlimited storage by purchasing multiple sd cards if necessary3. Microphone / Headphone jack4. You can go onto Flash websites!!!5. Bluetooth - you can connect a keyboard and basically use it as a laptop6. Extremely happy with the Speakers7. The screen looks identical to the iPad.  I think the thrive looks better than ipad.8. Removable and replaceable battery9. You can customize yours by changing the back of your Thrive.10. Can purchase apps from Google Play & Amazon Apps - nice feature you only pay once and you can install it on all your droid devices.  Love that feature.11.  AFFORDABLE!The only drawback is that you can not get a Thrive with mobile access.  Not a problem for me because I can turn my droid into a hotspot and viola my Thrive has internet access on the go.If I do find a device that beats the Toshiba Thrive, I will update my review.  In the meantime I will continue to love my Toshiba Thrive and recommend it to everyone.
