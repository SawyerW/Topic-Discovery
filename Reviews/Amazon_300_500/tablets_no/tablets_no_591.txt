I ordered my gTablet on a Friday and paid for one day shipping. It arrived, perfectly packaged, the next day. I unpacked it, plugged it in and started playing with it. I did an OTA update and started investigating the tablet to familiarize myself with it's operation. I found it to be very intuitive. I'm new to the whole Android experience and still haven't had to crack the owners manual. Being a fairly intelligent guy, though, who figures things out pretty easily, I decided to test it a little further. I took it to work and let a coworker, who was curious about it, play with it a little. He also hadn't had any experience with Android or Android based platforms. After showing him how to turn it on I turned him loose with it. In no time at all he'd figured out how to connect to the company wifi and was trolling the internet, posting on Facebook and playing games on a couple of other websites. Like I said, this is a very intuitive system.  The gTablet, despite my painstaking (I thought) research, isn't exactly what I wanted in a tablet. That's my fault, though, and not the fault of the tablet itself. I was looking for something bigger than my iPhone, but smaller and light than my laptop for light gaming, internet, and streaming movies. The gTablet fills all but the final requirement. In my research i failed to notice the fact that Netflix and Hulu don't work on Android or Android based systems yet. That's where it's my fault.I also had a few problems with the stock virtual keyboard. It failed to recognize keystrokes on numerous occasions. I'm glad I ordered a keyboard style case for it.Other than the keyboard and the lack of apps I find this to be a nice addition to my electronic "arsenal". It's fine for what it is, but I think I'll save up and get an iPad.
