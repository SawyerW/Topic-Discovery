Not being a huge fan of Apple products, I was looking for aHappy to say that the Thrive delivers. Mostly.Despite its bulk, there's something about having some heft to it that makes the thing feel more solid. Granted it can make your arms ache after a while of holding but it doesn't feel like it'll snap in half if I hold it too hard either. That 32GB of internal space (the model I got) helps quite a bit, though I'd recommend getting a large SD card to match as well; you're going to fill it up quickly if you play games or download movies on it like I do. Between a laptop and this, it was a close call, but the Thrive won out on the grounds of portability and the fact that the battery can last for half a day at a time if you don't do a lot of web surfing/video watching on it.Only things keeping it from perfect 5/5 are:1) I didn't root right off the bat. Feel stupid for upgrading immediately, as that blocks out a lot of stuff I could do and use otherwise. Still love it to death; just a bit saddened that companies feel the need to block off so much access just because they can - especially since Toshiba doesn't really support the Thrive anymore :< 2) Needs better HDMI-OUT support. Looks blocky and pixelated when I hook it up to the TV.3) Stock browser is absolute bollocks. Minor complaint, really, as there are workarounds that are easy enough to get hold of.and 4) Seems to lag horribly and/or crash with some videos (basically any video site that's NOT YouTube). That might be related to me not getting it rooted, but whatever. I can deal with it.NOTE: Don't be a dunce like me and just upgrade the firmware immediately; take time and figure out how to root (opening access to the "Super" account, basically the equivalent of a Windows Admin account) your Thrive. A lot of things require root access, and unless you want to have a lot of heartache that your little Thrive isn't pushing up to speed, get it rooted ASAP!!
