After doing mucho research, and after justifying that I need a tablet so I can get on the Internet in my home without leaving my recliner, I popped for the Nexus 7 32Gb.I could not be happier.I love:Auto upgrading,(Mine went to Android 4.2 a few days ago),  the screen size, the ability to purchase off the Amazon store as well as the Google store, the ease of the menus, e-mail, Internet, YouTube, and the ease of which it downloads apps on demand, battery life, the color is just fine and the print is great. You can also download apps to hook onto a USB drive without any trouble at all.  I just cannot see the huge money difference between this and the fruit product.I don't like:The auto on function of Facebook telling me all my notifications whether I want them or not, having a credit card number somewhere inside the unit for buying apps, and so far, although I know one is probably out there, no real good way to virus protect, or a firewall. AVG, where are you??I don't plan on using it outside my house, since I don't trust open Wi-Fi in places like Starbucks and the like.Otherwise, if you are looking for a tablet, I HIGHLY suggest you at least give these a ride and see what you think.Oh, by the way, Big Lots carries a nice, neat pouch unit with zippers that holds the unit and all the accessories like earbuds, stylus, etc, in another pocket without letting them touch the tablet itself, and it has zippers for everything. Cost? $6.00UPDATE:Found AVG for tablets, runs great, updates automatically.Main uses now: E-mail, FB, buying things, playing games, getting news and weather.  Still believe this is a fantastic tablet and will continue to use it.  BTW, battery life is great.
