I bought this Nexus 7 32G at the end of January 2013 via online store and have had it since February 2013.  Within about 3 or 4 weeks it became glitch, with apps crashing.  But I could live with it because it allowed me to take advantage of the app store.  So for months, I actually enjoyed the tablet even though the screen would not fill with pictures all the way or something else would close unexpectedly and the sound was not all that great.  However, last week, Tuesday 07/09/2013 the sound stopped altogether.  I had already bought a mini speaker to compensate for the poor sound quality.  When I plugged that it in, I got sound from the tablet, but that was the only way I could hear anything.  I called ASUS support and right away they asked had I dropped it.  I had not.  I promptly sent it off on the same day, Tuesday, 07/09/2013.  Until today, I still haven't heard a word.  I called ASUS support myself and was told that they received the tablet yesterday, 07/15/2013 and that I should received a 'repaired' tablet within 7 - 10 days from 07/15/2013 their receipt date.  Mind you, they sent me the label to send the tablet back.  So now, I haven't had the tablet for a week, and probably won't for another week and will now received a'refurbished' tablet, not the brand new one I bought last then four months ago.  I REGRET THIS PURCHASE and now know I should have spent the money on an IPAD.  What a waste! All the other companies that offer tablets have no problem with sending out a new tablet when something like this happens.  I know now I should have invested in an IPAD or KINDLE.  They know how to treat their customers.
