This tablet has exceeded my expectations.  The screen is very bright and vibrant, its processor is very fast.  Video playback is excellent.  I find myself using this tablet for everything from surfing the web to creation of documents.  Another plus point is that is has Android ICS on it, which in my opinion is way better than the previous versions.  I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.  I was frustrated when I found out the difficulties involved with getting picasa albums to sync with the gallery, but once I got it to sync it's been no problems since.  I really don't know how I got it to sync, but I went into the gallery and saw that my picasa albums were synced.  The keyboard is also nice, its keys well space for my big fingers & paired with the very responsive touch screen make it second nature to type on, to me it feels almost like typing on my desktop keyboard.  I can't wait to find out the endurance of this tablet, I'm hoping it will last a long time.03/14/2014: After a year I'm still pleased with this purchase.  The tablet works just as good as it did when I got it.  The battery life is great, I use this tablet more than my PC.  My only gripe with it is sometimes it's slow to come out of sleep mode, other than that I'm overly pleased.  I'm thinking of purchasing about 3-4 more.
