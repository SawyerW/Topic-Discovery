Ive had a friend travelling to the U.S. buy me one of these through Amazon. Was worried at first I might get a refurbished unit but no, it was New and flawless as stated ;)You can expect to have a low battery level, so once you start it and go through all the setup it will tell you if you want to upgrade to the latest OS version, which I did, and thus have to wait for battery levvel reach over 20% for it to start the download and install, it was looooong but I didnt mind.In regard to the start from zero (from off state) it takes 2 minutes to fully load (some have stated as long as 5 minutes!). The screen is fantastic, speakers are incredible.Key points to my purchase of this tablet where: 64GB!!! (have tons of music & video loaded and still have around 30GB, this tablet will come with a little less of 5Gb from factory), wanted to try out the Blackberry Bridge feature, its really good, all emails, SMS, BBM are handled with the Playbook without having to take my 9380 out of its holster. Dual HD Cams is a nice feature :)Regarding apps, well there will be no support of BB10 (latest software release is OS 2.1 from february 2013, hope we keep seeing more updates, but for now Im OK with it), you get a limited choice of Apps no doubt, and most "likeable" apps are paid... too bad, not much of choice for games (free ones, you do have many paid games out there which are very nice).For the amount of money this costs, I think it is a very good deal! It will make a nice travel companion :)UPDATE: after a week of use Im pretty happy with it! All connections (wifi, Bluetooth, Bridge) work flawlessly and Ive managed to download quiet a few applications and games! you can find a lot of sites with games/apps available for the Playbook! (do not rely just on the App World). There is a program called DDPB which will let you "sideload" Android apps to the Playbook! So Im sure that if you get a Playbook that little program will be your best friend, very easy and straightforward to use.
