I kind of took a leap when I ordered this device. I found it for $159 with free shipping on Amazon and although I was leaning toward the new "mini" nook or the upcoming Kobo e-reader, I felt that the combination of Android 2.2, a capacitive touchscreen and color display was worth a roll of the dice.As my primary goal was to have an e-reader with a touchscreen (preferably not a resistive screen) to view scanned PDFs and other e-books for school, any other functions such as wifi and multimedia were strictly ancillary.Pros:--Android 2.2 (no clear path for upgrades, although there is a minor swell of folks looking to port 2.3 to the MIPS processor in this device)--Beautiful color 800x600 display with good contrast and color tone--Wifi with G & *N* compatibility--Uses standard SD cards for expansion--Real mini USB port for charging, data transfer and ADB support--Separate charging port for fast charger--Well finished, with nice overall look (I own an original Motorola "Droid" phone and like some heft and "industrial" feel to my devices)--Rubberize paint on back of case has nice feel and is easy to grip--CHEAPCons:--A little sluggish at times--Touchscreen can be wonky, but I think that's mostly because it's a little weak processor-wise--Display could be a little brighter--Volume from built-in speakers is weak--MIPS based chipset, so many apps don't install correctly. However, this seems to be a developer issue, as many of the well-review apps work fine.--Wireless range seems to be a bit lacking, but certainly workable in a normal home or workplace--Gloss screen can be taxing to use in bright light/sun--Did not come with an SD card, but who doesn't have a handful of these laying around unused anyway?Conclusion:If you understand the limitations of this device, it's a great compromise for what little it costs. Android 2.2 is getting a little long in tooth, but there's some hope that 2.3 might get ported to the platform (and probably will if these less expensive devices sell well). If you are looking for an e-reader that you can use in direct sunlight or under strong overhead lights with no glare, this is not the right device for you. BUT, if you don't want to pay 2 or 3 times what this thing costs and want a nice color display and a fairly good casual e-reader, it's hard to go wrong.
