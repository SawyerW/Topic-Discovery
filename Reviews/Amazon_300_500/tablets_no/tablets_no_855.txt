Bought this tablet because I found the specifications were great -Full HDMI, Full USB and Full size SD card slot. Thats like best combination one can ask for in a tablet without spending a lot on the accessories that you have to buy with other tablets out in market.But when I bought this tablet, right out of the box the tablet was defective. NO sound from the speaker. I upgraded to ICS, did factory resets, but no change. Being in quality profession all my life, I understand that a product could break your QC fire wall unintentionally and make it to customer. But the real test is when the Manufacturer recognizes their mistake and gets it fixed.I called toshiba customer support and it was a nightmare. The case manager (one level up then the tech support) had no basic knowledge of the product. Said the tablet is discontinued because its 5 years old ! She cant do much but if I wanted I will have to ship the tablet at my expense (25$) to get it repaired. The repair will be free as it is under warranty and if they will not be able to fix it, they will give me more options later. The timing will be about 2 weeks. Really ? Thats the best toshiba can do ? They have my money for a defective product and cant do much but repair and not replace ? I feel being cheated.Why should a customer pay for a defective product and live with a repaired unit right out of box ?? Did I buy the product to get it repaired ? Toshiba claims to be leading innovators and I would like to ask the management - Is this your innovation ? Sell defectives !Will stay away for Toshiba. Apple, Amazon, etc does what it does because of customer support.Hope someone from Toshiba is reading this. They can contact me to get more information. The tablet still is defective !
