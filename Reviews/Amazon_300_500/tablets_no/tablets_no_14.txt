After owning a Nook tablet for the last year or so, I was amazed at the power and versatility of the Nexus 7. The Nook was very restrictive about what I could install and it seemed that they went to great lengths to dumb down what an android tablet could do.That is definitely not the case with the Nexus. I still use it as a reading device, but now it has pretty much become my main computer. I've been building my own computers and writing software since I got my first Atari 400, but now I rarely sit down at my desktop, anymore. In fact, when I do use my desktop I am usually controlling it from my Nexus. There are some tasks, like video editing, that are easier to do from the desktop, but I've become hooked on working from this little monster.I have resisted getting a cell phone again, but I'm able to text for free using Google voice. I'm also impressed with all the text to speech and voice command apps that are built into the new android jelly bean os. I have never used Siri, but it can't be as accurate as Google voice. No, it's not 100%, but darn close.The only criticism I have is with the WiFi version. I understand that you need to install a SD card for the 4G version in order to get access to a network, but why remove the slot from the WiFi version. 32G is a lot of storage, but storage space is something you can never have too much of. I tried to load my music collection onto the Nexus and ran out of space. My workaround is to put it on a big flash drive and connect it with an OTG cable when I want to listen offline. Not a perfect solution, but it works when I need it. I would rather be able to put it on a SD.Bottom line, though, is that I'm extremely impressed and very happy with my Nexus 7.
