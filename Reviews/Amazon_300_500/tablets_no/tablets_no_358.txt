So first let me say I looked and drooled over the iPad 2 for what felt like forever!!! It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases. Apple is always coming out with new and innovative products, accessories and updates. Great purchase!!! I am very satisfied. I am a Android lover, and iPad almost has me convinced I need an iPhone on my next go-round!! We shall see! If you don't have an iPad, dont hesitate, get it, it is well worth the price.
