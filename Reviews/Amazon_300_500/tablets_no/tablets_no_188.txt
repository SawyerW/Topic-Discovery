I purchased this item mainly to watch videos on. The 8GB of internal memory was under 7 GB after the operating system grabbed what it needed.  That was fine with me because I intended to store my videos and music on a 16GB microSD card. Big mistake.I'm familiar with Android, but try as I might I couldn't get the thing to recognize any file on the microSD card. First I mounted the card directly on my computer and copied some videos over. The Archos didn't even see them and just said the card was empty. I then tried hooking the Archos up to my computer with a micro-USB cable and transferred files that way. Same result. I placed the files into a folder on the card.  The Archos showed me the folder but said there was nothing inside. Nothing I did could make it see any file on the card not even installing them via the sdcard folder in internal memory.Then there was the touch screen.  I knew beforehand it was a resistive screen, not capacitive, and that was fine with me.  What was NOT fine was the unresponsiveness of the screen.  I had to calibrate it multiple times before I got it to work, but even then the top and bottom edges refused to respond properly.  I had to take a stylus and shove it up hard against the top edge of the bezel to get the screen to respond.Finally there's the matter of Archos tech support, which is a joke.  I could could never get through to a human being in spite of their being open 24/7 (really?). Even at 2 AM all I got was the infamous "We are experiencing an unexpectedly high volume of calls. Please stay on the line and your call will be answered by the first available representative."So I give up.  I'm returning this thing and never buying another thing with the Archos mark. The home tablet is a piece of poorly-assembled junk.
