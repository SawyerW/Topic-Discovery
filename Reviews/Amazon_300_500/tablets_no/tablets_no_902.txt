Got this item thinking it was the same as the 3g Tab without the 3g.  It is not the same product.  From the outside it looks the same, but the inside is different.  I tried to load many different Android Apps and about half of them said that it was not a compatible device.  For example:  XM Radio, Fandango, Alarm Clock, Windows Live Chat are just a few Android Apps that will not load on the Wifi Tab.  They work on the 3g Tab, but not the Wifi only Tab.  Talked to Customer Service at Samsung and they confirmed that the Wifi Tab is limited and can not be upgraded.  I really wanted this to work, but am forced to send it back since it was not what I expected.UPDATE May 15:  Got the Verizon 3G Galaxy Tab and LOVE it.  I had to get a 2 year sevice data plan for $20 per month, but the Tab only cost $199.  This one is FASTER, GPS is better.  Bonus is I can use the Tab as a wireless hot spot.  So other family members can use the wifi only Apple products while we are on the road.  We are more of and email, and lite Internet users so the 1GB data package is just right for my family.  Another bonus is the Tab has a phone number (no voice calls) so you can text message for 20 cent pre message or add a texting plan.  I also discover that Windows Live Messanger can handle text messaging, so now I am connected to that sevice).  Overall:  5 stars for the 3G Tab and 2 stars for the wifi only Tab (now that I know what was missing). By the way, this is a Great GPS if you have a big enough data package.  You can always upgrade your data package so start small and see what you really need after the first month.  The local V store had the best prices.  The $20 per month included the wireless hot spot...no extra cost.
