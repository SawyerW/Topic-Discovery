Whether you are a Windows user or a Mac user like myself, you will find that the Apple's IPad 2 is incredibly easy use. Heck, I taught my grandmother how to use it in an hour and she has no grasp of technology whatsoever.CustomizeOne can customize the placement of their applications based on how often that one uses them, by category, by favorite, or however ones wants, you can completely customize the order of your apps.Camera and WeightThe IPad 2 is thinner then its predecessor as well as lighter, it also includes a front and rear camera which makes video chatting via Facetime efficient. However, the quality of these cameras are nowhere near the standards that one expects to see from a piece of technology, especially at the price that Apple charges. Apple cites that the small mega-pixel camera is the result of a thin design, which I understand. I do not use my IPad to take pictures, I do however carry it everywhere. It's thin and light design enables me to slip it in to that last little space of room in my backpack without adding much weight.Media and GraphicsFor those of you that are on the go, you can use the IPad for games, music, videos, and even writing word documents. I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small. That and the not so great quality of movie graphics, makes me reluctant to do so. The graphics on the IPad 2 are good when not watching movies, when watching they are are not terrible but they are not great, and can be vastly improved.The KeyboardWhat bothers me the most about the IPad 2 is the keyboard, the letters are shrunk so that the keyboard can fit, but it was not done proportionally. The lack o  a quick transition between symbols, numbers, and letters makes note taking inefficient on the IPad 2.
