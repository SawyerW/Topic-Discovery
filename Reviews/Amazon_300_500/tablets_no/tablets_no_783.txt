As one of the first to get my hands on the new tablet, I was worried it would not do what I needed. I was very pleased to find that it does and has enough features to add functions for those who need more.I was surprised to find a Microsoft 6000 bluetooth keyboard in the box. It paired using the ademdum enclosed in the box. Because I needed to re-pair it after an upgrade to Windows 7 Pro (our office uses a domain), it resisted. A little known fact is that if you hold the reset button on the keyboard for 30+ seconds, the L.E.D. will alternate colors and it then pairs easily.For those wanting better mouse control than the touch screen, a bluetooth mouse should work, but there is 2 usb ports that would allow a wireless mouse to work as well. It is important to have the USB so you can add a DVD/CD device can transfer data or restore the system (although there are provisions to restore through a USB memory stick.)The screen is bright and the case serves as a stand either vertical or horizontal. There is a stylus, HDMI port as well.One of the intersting features is the button on the top that opens the onscreen keyboard so you don't have to drag it out from the side of the screen.The larger button near the screen serves as a Ctrl Alt Del key so I can log into the domain.For the size of the screen, it is relatively light, much lighter than a covertable tablet/notebook.Although a consumer oriented device, I see potential in the health field, as I am in, to market this for charting. Since the battery is not user replaceable, I will purchase a power supply for each room I use so that if it gets low, I can plug in.The power supply is small and as light as they could make it.Get one and have fun.
