Short ReviewOverall I haven't decided if I am going to keep this tablet. There is nothing wrong with it but at the price point the Dell Streak 7 may be a better choice since I am looking to implement this into a business application that will be getting heavy usage. It does have some lag on occasion but overall the tablet is snappy and responsive.How To for AT&T; to save people time and frustration.(Tmobile does not have 3G/4G in my area so I cannot test it but from what I have seen in the specs it should have the capability to work on Tmobile's network on the 1700 and 2100 frequency):First thing you need to do is go to an AT&T; store and activate a sim on the DataConnect Personal for Tablets plan they will need to use an IMEI from a valid AT&T; device that they sell since their system will not accept the IMEI from the Viewpad.Second item is once the SIM card is active and you install it in your Viewpad all of the APN info will be incorrect. I tried to copy the APN info off of a Samsung Galaxy in the AT&T; store that was working but it did not work for me on the Viewpad.The settings that worked for me are as follows (These settings are found in Settings-->Wireless & Networks-->Mobile Networks-->Access Point Names):***I think all settings are case sensitive***Name: AT&T;APN: broadbandProxy: <Not Set>Port: <Not Set>Username: <Not Set>Password: <Not Set>Server: <Not Set>MMSC: <Not Set>MMS proxy: <Not Set>MMS port: <Not Set>MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: NoneAPN type: <Not Set>**If this still doesn't work try setting the Network Mode to GSM Only and once it connects change it to GSM/WCDMA auto to get faster 3G speeds.Update:Device seems to be more stable than expected. The Viewtab is significantly more stable than my LG Android 2.2 phone. Even though this tablet is not the fastest device, overall for price/features it is a keeper.
