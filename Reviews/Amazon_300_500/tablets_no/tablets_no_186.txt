Lets start with the good:The Archos 7 home tablet looks great - it feels great, and (on paper) it is a well spec'd tablet. It has USB host, a MicroSD slot, Wi-Fi, a kickstand, a 7" screen, long battery life and a whole host of Android applications.[...] ([...]).In reality, the Archos 7 is just a very basic Android tablet - very little effort was put into making the software experience anything to write home about. The Archos media player is probably the only good part, because it works well, indexes media nicely, and adds support for file formats not normally supported in Android.Sadly, that is where the "good" ends - the screen is dreadful, the touch portion is a hassle, the kickstand is a weak piece of plastic, and the USB host feature requires an additional cable.Performance is sluggish, the Archoslib market is a very poor replacement for the Google Android market (which you can't load onto it) and the selection of available apps is poor. Yes - you can load your own apps onto the device, but why put more effort into this?I do think Archos deserves praise for the Archos 7 - and I think Android has a future on tablets, just not products from Archos. They have a poor history of product support, and they tend to abandon products very quickly (just ask anyone with an Archos 9).The worst part of the Archos 7 is the Android 1.5 operating system - seriously, you are over a year behind the trend with this, and lose out on a bunch of features. And sadly, knowing Archos, you'll never see this thing move on to anything beyond 1.6.All in all - you really do get what you pay for. There are not many alternatives (other than the $[...] one I mentioned), but there are many on their way. So, if you have some time (and patience), wait for a while, and there will be much better choices.
