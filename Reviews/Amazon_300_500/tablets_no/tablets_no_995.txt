So I purchased my Acer Iconia A500 Tab last week and using Amazon Prime it arrived in two days. I have been playing around with it and I personally love the massive versatility it has given me. The Android market has endless apps to make your tablet just that... YOURS!Pros:+ The display and resolution are amazing! Images are extremely crisp and Youtube, granted your wifi connection is hi-def quality.+ Audio produced buy the tablets speakers is not Bose quality but definitely sounds respectable. Granted most ppl will use audio jacket or bluetooth headsets to start email their audio. Quality will depending your headset.+ The user interface is amazing! It runs Android 3.2, after initial system updates. I prefer android over IOS on Apple products. It provides a better level of customization.+ Processing is very nice. Also dependent upon your network connection. Have had minimal issues which were easily fixed by existing and restarting the browser. Processing throughout the applications is extremely fast as well. So apps do require initial startup which can take a bit longer but afterwards run well.Cons:-No 3g service. Yea it sucks if you want to browse while out but this can easily be solved. Acer does have a model which can but put on a data plan through AT&T.; So if you want both Wifi & 3g.... Consider that model, which I think is A501.- Use interface: again the interface is definitely a preference which varies from person to person. If this is going to be a gift for a lesser technology inclined person... I honestly would suggest an Apple iPad. Their system would be more "user friendly", whereas Android suits the more technological advanced personnel whom values customization.Other than that general knowledge, I enjoy my Acer Iconia A500 Tab. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone that's wants one and is looking for a great deal.!!!
