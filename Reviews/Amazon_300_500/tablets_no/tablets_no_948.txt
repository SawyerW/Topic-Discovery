I bought the Iconia A500 from Best Buy a few weeks ago.  I had originally gone in to pick up a XOOM but after seeing the price tag on the A500 with nearly identical features I decided to go with Acer.  I really do love this tablet but after two weeks (coincidentally the amount of time Best Buy allows for tablet returns)I started having trouble with some widgets disappearing and acting kind of odd.  I thought a reboot would fix the problem but the tablet failed to load past the ANDROID screen.  I contacted Acer technical support and was floored at how incompetent they were.  They would copy and paste from the user manual (which is not included and must be downloaded) giving me solutions that require the tablet to actually boot.  They eventually deemed it a hardware problem, though it was not, and told me to FedEx it to them.  I spent an entire Saturday afternoon scouring some forums at XDA developers and Phandroid.com trying to find a solution and learned that this is actually kind of a common problem with this tablet.  Eventually some nice soul gave me a solution to restore to factory default.  This erased all my data but it was better than sending it to Acer and probably waiting for 2 weeks to get it back.This is an excellent tablet.  I'd even go as far as saying it is the best current Honeycomb tablet.  However, keep in mind that Acer customer support is horrible and if you have problems you might be on your own.Oh! In case you have the same problem as me, here is the solution: Plug in a USB keyboard and while holding down the volume up button (closest to the power button), turn on the tablet. When the message appears that says "clearing cache" appears, release the volume button and press the home key on the keyboard.  A menu will appear that will allow you to reset to factory defaults.  I don't know why the Acer people didn't tell me to do this.
