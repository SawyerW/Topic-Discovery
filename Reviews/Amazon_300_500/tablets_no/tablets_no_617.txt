I registered my Thrive 16GB on August 19, 2011. The input/output ports were the primary attractions of the Thrive and my initial judgement has proved to be correct - the more I use the Thrive the better I like it. Since I bought the Thrive I have used it every day. I took it on a 15 day riverboat trip in Russia instead of my 13.3" laptop and it was wonderful, compact and very useful. Good wifi on the boat so I could check email and web surf with the Thrive as if I were at home. Took over 500 pictures with a 10MP camera and all pictures were stored on the Thrive with plenty of room to spare. I keep a 16GB SD card almost full time in the SD slot, then loaded pictures using a USB SD card reader feeding into the full size USB port on the Thrive. Stored pictures both internally and on the 16GB SD card. So good backup. I also carry a 40 GB digital wallet with USB connection and backed up pictures to it - the USB connection worked flawlessly with the Thrive. I have used the full size HDMI port to connect the Thrive both to my HD TV set and also to an Epson projector using an HP HDMI to VGA connector dongle as my projector does not have an HDMI input. I also have an Android smart phone, so my calender synchs beautifully among Outlook on my desktop and my Google calender on the Thrive, the smart phone and my Toshiba Portege laptop. All told, the Thrive has more than met my expectations. A week or so ago it upgraded to Android 3.2, but I haven't seen any specific changes, altho I have not had the "sleep problem" others have reported. No, I do not work for or have any relationship with Toshiba other than using and liking their products that I carefully selected and use. BTW, I sometimes use a Logitech Bluetooth mouse with the Thrive and it works well - more precise but not as fast as my fat fingers.
