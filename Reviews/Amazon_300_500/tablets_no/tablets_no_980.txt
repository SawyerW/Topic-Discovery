I will try to keep this short and sweet. I have the ipad 2 and the Samsung Galaxy 10.1. I wanted to have access to both app stores. Mainly I just like gadgets. I have tried the Acer Iconia, the Xoom and the Asus Transformer, as well before deciding on the Samsung. I would have purchased the 7 inch Samsung Galaxy, but the service plans at Verizon were not worth it. So how is the Galaxy 10.1? Pretty impressive. I would give it a 4.5, but rounded up for benefit of the doubt.Pros:- Look and feel is fantastic.- Weight is lighter than the ipad 2; I think it is substantially noticeable. This is likely due to the plastic material. I was worried about that at first, but not anymore (I chose the dark gray back, I think it looks great).- Resolution looks terrific.- Buttons are sparse but build quality is well done. I tend to judge build quality by how the buttons and such function (I was not a fan of the tiny Xoom AC pin, nor the Acer lock screen button. The Transformer felt really cheap due to the bendable plastic back. Too picky? Perhaps)Cons:- No HDMI, micro USB etc. I know they will have a dongle, but I haven't found one yet.- Lack of accessories so far.Comments:- It's probably just Honeycomb 3.1 but the choices are very sparse for lock screen wallpaper. The default is the blue broken street looking thing. I wanted to use that for the lock screen but it disappeared after I changed the main background. Very weird.- The box did not indicate what color the Samsung would be (unless it's near the SKU code). We had to open the box to see if it was white or the dark gray.- Is there a default movie player?Overall, the Tablet feels great. As I stated I already own the ipad2 and love it. It's a matter of preference between the two. Now let's get those Android Tablet apps out there!
