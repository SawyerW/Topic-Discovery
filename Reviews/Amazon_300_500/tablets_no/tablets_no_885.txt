So after already owning two iPads in my household, an iPad 1, which I purchased when the iPad was first released and an iPad 2, which belongs to my wife, it was with reluctance that I was looking in a retail store at the new iPad mini.  After all, do I really need a third iPad?  There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.  I find that taking this with me on a business or personal trip makes the bag much lighter and for equivalent features.  Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).  I would say size wise, it is about 70% of the full size iPad but this has no great impact on the ability to read emails or type any differently than the larger iPad.  The full size iPads almost seem too large now that I am accustomed to the compact mini.I don't want to get into all the features of the iPad overall as I have not noticed any differences between this and my other iPads.  I have heard the RAM is less on the mini, but I have not noticed any difference as previously indicated.  It is well integrated with other Apple products, which I love about the iPads.  I can take a picture with my iphone and instantly it appears in my photostream for viewing on my iPad, iMac or AppleTv screensaver.Overall, great buy, even with two other iPads, I don't regret this purchase one bit.
