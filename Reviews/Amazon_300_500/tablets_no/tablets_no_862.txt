I am convinced that the nice reviews which caused me to buy this paper weight were folks like myself excited upon arrival and the cool light weight feel it has wifi-ing. But like me after seeing thats all it really does and a hundred hours of getting to know it, folks are too ashamed to admit there mistake. This was suppose to be in a minor form of course like a laptop. Far from it. After purchasing the upgrades on 3 different office suites, Doc2go, QuickOffice, OfficeSuitePro, to work with M/Office. There all worthless. Doc's that you loaded via, SD Card or USB print out strange, only what you create tranfers to the printer correctly. Yeah you have to buy a new wifi printer too. Oh by the way you'll have to get a new ExternalHD formated xfat to transfer files via usb.  Whether you transfer doc's via USB or SD card. Lot of the docs come up garbled, and won't print clearly.You certainly can't do any editing of the transfered Office docs. SD card upon proper removal and reinserted won't be recognized unless you shut down the Thrive and reboot. But it hangs upon shutting down, so you have to do a Hard Shutdown. Really cool isn't it. Oh and tech will guide you to a file to assist but there befuddled why the file to fix doesn't show up on your tablet. Did I mention I have about a hundred hours or so of my life getting to know my new pal. Doesn't matter anymore anyway. If I had a dollar each time my NFL.Network site disappeared while on it I could retire. Needless the say I have a lightweight websurfer and the grandkids have an expensive game toy to play with.Bought a 10" Netbook, yeah its heavier but it works like a computer because thats what is. Wife has a IPad should of got that instead, better screen and I knew what I was getting. So you want a computer buy a computer,the thrive is a wanta be, want to surf, play games, read get an IPad. Just one man's expensive opinion.
