When I was looking for a tablet, I was mainly looking for a cheap e-reader. Well, on a whim I took a look at the Coby Kyros and saw not only would it suit my purposes as an e-reader, but it would also play NetFlix, web browse through wireless connections, and of course do all the things android tablets are known for. The 8-inch was $169and I felt comfortable that the tablet would be worth taking a chance on. For a whole ten days I waited in anticipation of receiving my new "toy" in the mail. Finally it arrived, but I had to go to work in 30 minutes, which meant I had to wait another 8 hours before I could play with it. At midnight, my shift was over and I arrived home ready to try out the new device. Within 48 hours, I was overwhelmed by how perfectly the machine performed I started to worry that there was nothing else to get excited about owning the tablet. Of course, some time has passed, which makes me more objective of my purchase.First off, the touchscreen can be difficult at times. I had a hard time learning how to scroll without attaching a wireless mouse to the usb adapter (included, thankfully). Other than that, the tablet works great.Netflix has no trouble streaming, but the app is not included. In fact the worse part about the tablet is the apps can be hard to find. Android Market has a lot of free downloads of awesome apps, but the tablet is not supported, because it is not a phone! I have tried everything, yet Android Market will not let me download a single app. There is an app install on the tablet that allows some app downloading, but a lot of the good apps are locked up in the Market. I have had to hunt down free app in download sites like Megaupload and Rapidshare.The apps are the second biggest problem and for now that seems to be the last. The apps are, in fact, solutions to any other problem that one may have. If there is something you want to try to do, then just search for an app to do it.
