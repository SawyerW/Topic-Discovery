I have had my Xoom since November 2011, it came with Honeycomb and it automatically upgraded to Ice cream Sandwich with no problems at all. The Xoom seamlessly interfaces with my PC which means that I don't need to get pulled into the Apple world. I use the Amazon cloud, Kindle books, and Amazon and Google Apps. So far 99% of the apps, videos, books, and music has been free with the exception of an office app that I need for school. I thoroughly enjoy my Xoom and surprisingly my husband (who is not at all computer savvy) loves it too. It came out of the box with little functionality app wise but that is exactly how I would want it. I don't want the manufacturer to assume what I want. I went to the Amazon app store and have filled it up with so many free apps that anyone picking it up is entertained for hours. I personally love the fact that I can watch videos read books and play music and games while flying across the country on a single charge. I downloaded a free Kindle app and have access to numerous free kindle books and many more for a charge, if I decide to join Amazon Prime someday I believe I can get a free Kindle book every month and free video downloads (that's what my friend told me who has Amazon Prime). I watch Netflix all of the time too without a hitch. The cameras are fantastic I can actually see the picture that I am taking and share it right away with my family. I found that I can turn the camera to the front and put myself in the picture, great when you don't want to ask someone else to take your picture. Anyhow I really like my Xoom and would recommend it to anyone.
