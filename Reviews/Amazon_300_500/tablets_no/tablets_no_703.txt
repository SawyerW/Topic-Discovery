Actually I might have been reviewing it on my Le Pan I when it decided to stop working for the 327th time, in which case my review was lost forever.Don't buy this.  I mean, the fact that you CAN'T buy it on Amazon anymore should put a damper on that, but if you happen to be searching for reviews before buying it from someplace else (like a guy in a van who is also selling meat and stereos) keep in mind that this thing fails on so many levels it's mind-bottling.  (Not mind-boggling, I mean it practically converts your mind into diet cola and bottles it.)One entire side of the screen stopped responding to touch input.  The reset switch (the one accessed through a hole on the back of the thing) stopped working.  It took maybe five tries to get my flash card to get recognized, and occasionally it would stop showing up, making the tablet useless until it decided to start working again.  The battery's connection to the board is awful so it occasionally stops charging and you have to open the thing to reconnect it.  The power button isn't soldered to the main board very well so some owners (such as my lucky self) have had to bust out our soldering irons or reflow tools to fix it.  Le Pan's technical support for the thing was utterly nonexistent even when the thing was the only product they made, and now they appear to have forgotten the thing ever existed at all.  The only high note was that it set my standards for tablets so incredibly low that my new Jelly Bean-running tablet seems like a cross between Superman and the Messiah.Oh, and speaking of Android versions, Le Pan once stated that the 2.2-running TC 970 would be upgradeable to newer versions.  And technically they were telling the truth, but only because they apparently considered "buying a newer model of tablet" to be upgrading.
