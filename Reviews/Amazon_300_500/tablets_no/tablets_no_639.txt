It's not Ipad2-sexy but it is the tablet that's picked up most in the house.2011 had a glut of Tegra2 10" Android tablets so spec-wise there's not much to differentiate (10", 1280x800, Tegra2 dual-core) it from many of the others except:-full-size SD card (the card's edge barely sticks out - I'd consider it a non-issue)-full-size HDMI port-brilliant screen (non-IPS but still great with good viewing angles, disable auto-brightness if you want to control the levels)-rubber backing (I hate to say it, but this is one of the best features.  It's easy to grip with no fear of it frisbee-ing out of your hand like some tablets!)-interchangeable back cover (for different colors)-replaceable battery (good feature on paper, but I haven't had a chance or need to use this as the battery life is acceptable for everyday usage)-included applications (there is some bloatware on there like game demos, but some usable software as well)Of all the devices in the house (3 tablets, 4 laptops), the Thrive seems to get the most mileage since it's just easy to pick up and hold/cradle while watching TV, etc.  I've also got the dock which makes it the largest (though the most functional) alarm clock ever.The full-size SD card slot really came in handy when I needed to get pictures right away from someone that lives out of town.  Just popped the SD card out of their Canon point-and-shoot and popped it into the Thrive.  Copied the pictures over and gave the card and camera back!  No fuss, no muss.  Sorry, can't do that with an Ipad.Performance is good and Honeycomb is snappy when swiping between screens and applications.There are more "advanced" tablets, but when it comes down to ease of use and comfort (even if that means no fear of dropping it), the Thrive is a great choice.
