Here's what I thought when I first bought this a year ago: This  my first tablet. Got it through my carrier (T-mobile). I've had it for a few weeks - so far so good. The battery/charger thing is kinda weird (battery can't be replaced, charger cord is short). If the battery goes completely out, let it charge for a while, then you can turn it on. I don't know why it took me another trip to T-mobile to figure that out. LOL! I guess I've never had any device that totally lost all its juice.Nice size - not as big as the ipad. I was thinking about getting a Nook or a Kindle but, I'm glad I went with something that's not a dedicated e-reader because, with the Android market, there's so much more I can do.Here's what I think now (May, 2012): DO NOT BUY THIS THING! #1: The battery life is very short. I can't make through a work day without charging, which presents problem #2: the cord that came with it is very short (4 feet maybe?) which means you have to be sitting right next to the outlet to use it while charging - which is most of the time. All that stretching from outlet to couch caused the cord to fray and I bought a replacement online (not through Dell, it's way too expensive). The cord was much longer, thankfully. #3: It freezes for no apparent reason whenever it wants to. And since you cannot access the battery at all to just take it out and let the thing reset, you have to wait until it runs out of charge (which won't be long - see #1) and then let it reset. I ended up giving it to my teenage daughter. I'm holding out until my contract with tmobile is up on this thing and I'll probably just get the real thing - an iPad.
