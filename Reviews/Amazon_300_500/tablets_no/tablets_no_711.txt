I love my lepan tablet. I got it for xmas as a gift for myself. I have had some minor issues bcuz i am very new to this. But all in all a great tablet. The apps are great. I have transferred my files easily. You do have to play with it awhile to learn it. It has way more functions than the specs reported you just have to play around with it.  You can email from all your accounts. My new favorite thing is that i can wifi print using  Google cloud print. Download google cloud print to your pc and download the cloud print app from the market its free. Your printer doesnt need to be cloud print ready but it does need to be wifi.The user manual is installed jus press the help icon. Also charge the battery completely at fitst use.I'm still working on video chat.  I can hear and see the other person they can hear me but they cant see me and i cant see myself.As far as freezing it will at times especially if you are pressing buttons like crazy you got to give it time to complete the one function before you ask it to do another and some large apps you may install might have an effect on it freezing as well.I think its a great tablet everyone i show it too is now purchasing one. You do need a screen protector and a good case.I have a folio case for 10.1 size tablets by Caselogic and it works great and i can access the function buttons. I also purchased a speaker dock for ipads and ipods and it works great. I downloaded officesuite pro for creating documents and it includes excel and powerpoint. I just dont know much abt the latter two so still figuring it out so i can print the documents i create via the cloud. If anyone knows let me know. Otherwise everyday i learn a new use for it. Buy it.
