I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months. Take note that I am severe o.c.d. here, therefore, there is absolutely no way it got wet or dropped or any other sort of freak accident occurred on my part to hurt it, as suggested by every single troubleshooter out there. It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago.. I am already tired of talking about this. I am just getting angry about it again...I had the same sort of problem when I received an iPod shuffle for an Xmas gift years before.... The people I know with Apple computers can rarely read discs I send them and the friends I have with iPhones have all switched back to droid types...I do not know why this brand is so popular but I will never buy from them. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank Apple for ruining a few gifts for me. Some really good hearted people spent a lot of their hard earned money to buy me thoughtful gifts which, thanks to your lack of consumer courtesy and a tendency to charge way too much for inferior products, turned out to be complete flops.As an extra added insult (to me, not you)... I am writing this on my friend's iPad 2 (the same as mine, that he bought about the same time as mine) He beats this thing mercilessly, gets it wet, steps on it, drops it, lets his toddler do horrible toddler things to it EVERY SINGLE DAY and guess what? This sticky disgusting thing never misses a beat for him.Go ahead and laugh.
