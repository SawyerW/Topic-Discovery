I am VERY upset that this tablet only lets you install just under 3 gigabytes of applications no matter what size you purchase.  Lets put this in perspective, you say 3 gigs of apps is plenty right?  Consider this, I have a Need For Speed game from EA sports installed (461megs), I also have Google Currents installed with 21 magazines inside it (1.13gb) and Google Music (237mbs)  for a total of 1,728,000megabytes or 1.73gigabytes in three applications.  With that in mind I have about 1gb left for apps and with the rest of my apps I have run out of space, try updating apps when out of space.......argh.  So why didn't I just get an SD card and move the apps over to it?  I bought one but not a single application can be moved over to it, even apps that I KNOW for a fact should be able to move to the card (Nexflix) for example...nope.  APP2CD does not allow it and Norton Utilities will not either.  So, I can't even update Google Currents for "current news/tech stories", it says my memory is full, guess I can delete some of the books but I don't want to and I don't want to play the game of "do I like this application I installed last week enough or do I delete it to make room for this new app in the market, it looks cool".  I am VERY upset.  If you plan on installing applications with big footprints or games that take advantage of the Nvidia chipset you better think twice.  One final note, in settings/storage it shows I still have over 2gb of space left, that is not app space it is picture/doc/video space.UPDATE: You cannot uninstall Kaspersky Tablet Security.  If you do not purchase it, it just stays in the system tray and tells you it's not licensed.  I thought Microsoft got sued for making people have to have Internet Explorer installed without any way to remove it.
