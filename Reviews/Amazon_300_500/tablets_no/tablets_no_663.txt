When  it works, it is great, but...I am totally frustrated with Dell and this product at this point.  The product would not accept a charge.  After three weeks of bumbling and fumbling and hours on the phone with India, they finally agreed to take it in for repair.  Problem is, the repair facility is in Mexico in a facility run by another company, Flextronics..  Bottom line is that the best estimate I have is a total of 5-6 weeks for the tablet being out of commission before possibly being returned from the repair facility.  Thus far, they have been unresponsive on my request for a new unit.  It has been a real horror story of customer service.  They wanted me to arrange conference calls between myself, Fedex, and India because they did not prepare the proper paperwork for shipment overseas.  They even wanted me to prepare the commercial invoice to send it to Mexico.  They were also too cheap to pay the extra $15 to pick up the product on a Saturday.The instructions said to wipe the unit clean of any "sensitive" data, but this is impossible because the unit will not take a charge.  As instructed, I have removed the SD card and the SIM card before returning the product, but I am still concerned about the fact that there could be sensitive data on this unit, a unit destined for Mexico.Meanwhile, the monthly data contract for T-Mobile continues, me paying their bills without me having a product for at least a month.If you do buy this product, I would consider an extended warranty (3rd party as I don't recommend Dell at this point).  If you are beyond the warranty and still have a monthly obligation with T-Mobile, you could still be paying their bills monthly without a working product.  If you do have a problem with this product, it will be a nightmare.If Dell thinks this is a better way to do business, I suggest they think again.
