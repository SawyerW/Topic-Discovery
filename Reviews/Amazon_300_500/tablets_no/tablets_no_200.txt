Received the product about a week and a half ago and have been using it up until today. The device itself is sleek and fairly fast, but there are quite a few problems both with the device and Android. For starters, the camera is a terrible quality and appears to be poorly connected to the device internally (while using it the screen tears and lines are noticeably visible). The device has a sim card slot but does not allow its use at this time, and while their website explicitly states it is not multitouch even the 1+1 pinch touch that is allowed responds buggy. The device had quite some trouble reading my microsd card at first which prompted me to have to reformat it and redownload everything that was already on the card. A few of the very small ammount of apps available for it from appoke and getjar refused to work at all. I found the device had quite some trouble finding and connecting to networks even after a firmware update, and these issues coupled with a variety of android issues (such as no market until honeycomb)finally prompted me to return it.Bottom line: The product had some great specs but they seemingly skimped out on some of the more important aspects of a tablet. If you dont mind the network issues and have no problem configuring it with custom firmware then you may find this a better product than I did. However, for the average consumer I would suggest to simply wait for another revision of the product or until a new batch of android tablets are released in a few months.EDIT: The company recently announced a new series of Tablets targeted at various price points which will come with both the tegra processor and Android honeycomb (which should resolve the not having google marketplace issue). If you are thinking about buying this product, you may want to wait it out a bit.
