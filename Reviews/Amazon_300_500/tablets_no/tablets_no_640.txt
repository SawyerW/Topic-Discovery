the tablet market has become a heated battlefield. Many companies are coming out with great items in this area.  Acer, motorola, samsung, Asus to name a few, all have 10 inch dual core tablets, all held up against the pioneer of the field, the Ipad. As other reviewers have pointed out, a few things stood out to me with the toshiba.  First, I like the inputs it has. The full HDMI and usb ports made it nice, with the bonus of a full size SD card.  I like it because i can swap SD cards from my cameras and computers quickly to my tablet, without any messing with transfering to the micro SD and hunting down the adapter.  Also, a replacable battery was a key component for me. I have had my notebook battery die and thankfully i can replace it, and my cell phone batteries never last much more than 2 years or less, so i have replaced them.  I didn't want to be stuck sending in the entire tablet for battery replacement. I can order one up and replace it. With this, the tablet is thinker than the competition, but i like it since it is easer to keep a grasp on it.  with the ruberized back on this too, it easier to grip and seem more protected. With the screen shield, this thing seem more durable.  As far as graphics, It's so far a wash with the competition, all using the same dual-core processor and all 720P resolution at this time (1080p likely on the way), and all are up to date on andriod honeycomb 3.2.  At this time, it's splitting hairs when picking a tablet, but for the small things listed above, I picked the toshiba.  As far as Ipad, seemingly over-rated, non expandable, and proprietary as usual.  Can't agrue though with the stabilty of the Mac operating software though, So far though this android has done fair, better than a couple of the phones I have had.
