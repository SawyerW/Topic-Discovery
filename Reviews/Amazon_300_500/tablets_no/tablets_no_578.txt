To continue from where I started, after buying this device it is very natural to want to thrash this device, and its not the buyer's fault entirely. But if you do that you may not notice what lies beneath, beneath the most inexorable software that comes stocked with this product is some piece of hardware that takes some time to getting used to appreciating. You may not appreciate this device instantly but you will if you stick to this for at least two weeks. And not that it will happen automatically but it needs some work from your side too, like 30 minutes of effort for a layman and after that what you are going to see is a treat for your senses. And the experience is even more rewarding due to the fact that you put in some effort towards flashing a new ROM -- and in turn saving some money for yourself -- you will feel good about this too. And further knowing that you can re-flash the image whenever you want -- no need to stick to the same ROM -- also keeps you more interested with this tablet. So rooting this product takes it to a level higher than an 'ipad' -- atleast according to me -- i've used ipod touch before, but this device beats that experience, I mean the touch screen experience, the market, the out of box support for so many codecs, the flash plugin, the ability to attach a pen drive and start browsing immediately, full scale web browsers and the list goes on.Rooting this device is made very simple, trust the people who have done it.So overall 4 stars for the product, one star less for the build quality -- the plastic casing etc -- and the product is heavier to my liking.and yes the viewing angels too is a problem, but then I guess that is true with any LCD screen tablets, you have to live with it.EDIT: I am using VeganTab custom ROM. I dont know which of all available custom ROMs is the best, but as of now I dont see any reason to move to another one.
