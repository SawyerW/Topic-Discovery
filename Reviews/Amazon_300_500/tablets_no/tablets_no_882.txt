First off, I'm not going to rip this thing apart.  I feel the Mini is an absolutely wonderful form-factor, and I recommend it -- just not yet.The good:The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor.  You might not think this is much, but seriously, it is.  I absolutely love this aspect of it.  In addition, the Mini is just wonderfully light and easy to hold (I have big hands, though).As much as people rip on the screen, it is comfortably bright, and the battery life seems to last quite well, even if brightened up a bit.  No complaints there.The bad:That same screen, as others have said, suffers from its low resolution.  Had this tablet come out a year ago, it would have been earth-shattering.  Now, when other offerings from Android are coming out with far better resolutions, it's just meh (the Apple Mini's contrast and color are still superior to the Nexus 7 by far, though).  If you are someone coming from an I-pad 2, you won't care about the resolution so much.  For everyone else who is used to I-phones with substantially smaller, yet sharper resolutions, you will notice the difference.Also, and this is a big one for me, I have found that the I-pad Mini is slow to buffer YouTube videos.  I'm pretty sure this has to do with it having half of the Ram of its larger pad family members.  Cutting the Ram in half was a big mistake.  It also seems to cause lags in surfing on only some sites that are more graphic intense.  I wasn't sure if this problem was one of my own, so I tried out some other Mini's in the store side-by-side with I-pad 2's and Retinas.  Same thing... slow Youtube buffering.  Quite a bit slower.I want to tell you to buy this thing, but I just can't.  I want to tell you to wait until next year when the tech is there to up resolution and add more Ram.  For the price, the Apple Mini disappoints.
