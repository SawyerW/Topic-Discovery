I've had this tablet for just over a year, and it is one of the most aggravating pieces of "new technology" I've ever seen.  The web browswer is a joke.  In May of 2012 (or thereabout) Google screwed with something in a browser update that now causes it to crash just when you want to start reading something.  Finally contacted customer support (they're pretty helpful) and they said to download another browser (now using MSN).But all I really wanted was for my husband, who's not very technically inclined (and doesn't care to be), to be able to surf the web for sports scores, news, weather, and to Facebook with the kids.  Not a lot to ask...don't even care to have Youtube or other streaming service, as he doesn't want it/use it/care about it.  Just the basics I mentioned.  But even Facebook is a challenge. Every time he'd get to something he wanted to "like" or comment on, it would close.  When I complained last week, tech support told me how to download a Facebook Mobile app (I thought it already was).Well, I did that today, and now it just brings up a blank Facebook page in my husband's account, with a little circle in the middle that says "loading." Period.  We'll grow old waiting for it to finally load!  The funny thing about this is that, on my Facebook page, it reports that my husband has started using the new app!  HA!  Maybe he has, but we sure can't prove it by looking at his Facebook page on the tablet!Like I said, a frustrating and disappointing piece of junk.PS...If I'd known when I bought this that Amazon was coming out with the Kindle Fire a few months later, I'd have saved my $150 on this mess and bought a Kindle Fire.
