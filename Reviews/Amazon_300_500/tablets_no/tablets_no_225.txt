I was looking for a new and more functional MP3 player.  I also wanted some additional features - like video playback, Wifi web access, etc., but I did not want to be saddled with another cellphone contract & monthly charges.My daughter has an IPod and I liked it a lot - but wasn't totally happy with it being an Apple product.Actually, the biggest reason I didn't want a IPod is that there is no support for removable-memory - no support for Micro-SD memory.  I bought the 16gb Archos 43 - but with the SD memory, memory is theoretically limitless.So far, I am thrilled with it.  It's the perfect size - bigger display than the IPod but not much bigger footprint.  The default software on it is pretty good - but I opted to find a new MP3 player app (trying Winamp's app right now).  However the supplied video-playback software is awesome.  I spent the $14 on their cinema-plug-in - to add more formats including VOB video format.  It is incredible - through the Samba file-sharing, I can access my video-library on my home network and play them back through the device (including just pointing it at the folder containing my DVDs).  Or - I can simply copy video files/folders onto a Micro-SD card and then insert it into the table.I will say that the resistive-screen isn't nearly as nice as the capacitive/multi-touch that other hardware uses.  But on the positive side - it is incredibly easy to use with a stylus (I took the one off my old Palm Pilot) - and actually, with my bigger fingers, it's easier and more accurate.I have an HDMI cable on order to test the display-to-HDTV option - but I have no doubt it will work.So far, it's an awesome buy for $200....  Blows away the IPod - and that's really its only competitor....
