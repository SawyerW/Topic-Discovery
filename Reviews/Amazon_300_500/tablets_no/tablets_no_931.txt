Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I recently purchased it because, at the price, it seems like a great deal.  You get 64GB of storage (a similarly priced Android tablet would have 8 or 16GB), and the hardware platform is similar to other 7" Android tablets.  I was aware that the app store would have far fewer options available than what one would find in Google Play or Apple's store, but to be fair, there were quite a few options for games and other tools.  The unfortunate thing is that the unit arrived partially charged and would not allow me to recharge the battery with either the provided power adapter or the USB cable.  After doing some quick searching on Google, I found that a number of people experienced this problem -- either after first opening the product or after using it for a year.  Another negative is that the tablet has a very long boot up process.  I actually thought on initial boot that it was simply stuck on the initial BlackBerry screen given how long it took, but it eventually started.  I then assumed that this was probably just a delay due to it being the very first startup, but on a restart I found that it was the same thing.So, overall, I would urge caution in purchasing the tablet.On the positive side, it's got good hardware, great storage capacity, and some obvious software advantages for BlackBerry users.  Additionally, while it may not have the selection of apps and games that you may find for iOS or Android, it's not as if the store was completely empty with choices either.On the negative side, however, I find it hard to "trust" the device as it seems the ability to recharge is a common problem.  Additionally (and others have mentioned), BlackBerry is obviously abandoning their tablet line, so the long-term prospects for the device aren't great -- but if you can get one that works (and recharges), I'm sure it's fine for many uses.
