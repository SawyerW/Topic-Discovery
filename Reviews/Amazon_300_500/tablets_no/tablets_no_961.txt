I bought this tablet because I needed an Android device for development but I already owned an iPad2.  The two devices are similar in some respects but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.  My review is based on a comparison between the two.iPad2 Pros over the Iconia:* MUCH better display than the Iconia.  Watching movies on the iPad is much nicer with its LED screen than on the Iconia which has a LCD screen.* All applications downloaded from the app store are tested to make sure they work with the iPad.  Several applications, including favorites like HBO GO, don't work on the Iconia currently.* More secure in that only approved apps from the app store can be installed without rooting the device.* Better battery life than the Iconia in my experience.Iconia Pros over the iPad2:* Significantly cheaper than the iPad2, I paid $369 for the Iconia vs $499 for the basic iPad2 with WiFi.* Better form factor and easier to hold with its landscape orientation in my opinion.  The iPad2 is a bit more awkward to hold with its portrait orientation.* Built in USB, HDMI, and SD Card ports allow you to connect the tab to any device, including a TV without having to buy special Apple hardware.* Front and rear facing cameras have a flash, which is a big plus over the iPad2.* Open Android based OS which gives more flexibility in which apps you can install.Overall, I can't say that one device is better than the other, because I think they're meant for different types of people.  As with the PC market, the general choice is between a tightly controlled apple platform that puts a lot of emphasis on style but is more expensive and less flexible and a relatively open system that gives the user more control over the device and makes it easier to integrate with more software and devices.  If I had to pick just one, I would go with the Iconia, though, primarily because of the cost and the flexibility you get with an Android device.
