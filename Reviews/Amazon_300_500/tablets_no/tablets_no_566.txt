I have owned the ZIIO 7 for only a few days and normally it takes me more time to form my opinion.What I was locking for is a video player with more than a cell phone screen. I am also interested in ebook readers. Thirdly, price, the iPad attracts me but is priced as much as a very good netbook computer that can do as much (and more) than an iPad.The Ziio is a good video player with excellent sound and an adequate sized screen for VGA resolution. I find the touch screen responsive and precise. Had I not read that it is "older" resistive technology I would not have noticed because it works and it works well. Navigation is easy and it is easy to add Android apps.Wireless communications is supported better than many higher priced tablets. Another feature that I appreciate is the multitude of audio and video files type that are supported without a slow and messy conversion software. As for ebook reader, you can get an app to read pdf files and the result is better than the 6" Amazon kindle (I own one) and with a free app you can import books designed for the kindle and have a good reader (in color). I give Kindle the edge because I like the daylight e-ink reading ability and the Kindle has far longer battery life. Another advantage the Kindle has is its weight, the ziio weighs almost as much as the iPad whereas the Kindle is much lighter and less tiresome to hold. I would tolerate the heavier ziio for a hundred dollars more than the Kindle because you get many other entertainment and productivity options. Ziio has a good free hand pen pad that lets you take notes freehand. With a camera and video support with an accelerometer to keep you pointed up.I like the ziio and it appears to be a sturdy and well made product with plenty of Android apps (many free) on Creative's web site. Creative makes quality and value priced electronic devices and they support what they sell. You don't need to make an appointment at the "genius bar" to get your questions answered.
