So after everyone else in my family got tablets or smartphones, I knew I would have to get one too.  I found this on NoMoreRack and the price was rights so I got it.  I was a little nervous, since it was a no-name brand and my track record with NoMoreRack has not been great (brought so called $80 headphones for $7, sounded like $2), but I ended up getting it just before Christmas and trying it out.I was very impressed!  It was fast and responsive, and handled gaming, surfing, and even Youtube quite well.  It was a bit thick and heavy, but not unbearably so and it performed much better than any of my family's budget tablets.  I thought that I'd found a real winner!Until it died.  The day after I got it, I was doing some light gaming.  The battery was wearing down, and I was going to run it out and recharge it.  It gave me a message about the battery being low (10% I think), and then the screen was covered with white lines and static (that's the best way I can describe it).  I put it to sleep and then woke it up, but the lines/static remained.  And then it shut down with a pop.  Needless to say, I doubt it will recover, though I am going to try.  It has a 12 month warranty, so I'll see how well they respond.  If they do well, then this is just an exception and not the rule, and I'll change my rating.  If not, it will remain.So in conclusion, based on the other reviews here, it appears that this is an impressive tablet that suffers from quality control problems.  If you get it, be sure you can take it back or be prepared to wait on warranty service (I'll edit this review when I've had that experience).UPDATE: It seems that the whole "white out" thing happens every time that the thing gets low on power.  As such, I am confident in my rating.  If they can fix that irritating bug, then this will be a 4 or 5 star product...
