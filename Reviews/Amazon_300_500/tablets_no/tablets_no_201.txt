Several weekes ago, I was caught in a quandry.  Should I fork over $500 for a iPad, which I already know doesn't support flash, or should I go with the Galaxy Tab.  I don't need a contract for I have already own a EVO and have the "hotspot" enabled.  So, I took the Galaxy Tab for a test drive.  I couldn't embrace the $529 charge I incurred, so for the first night it stayed in the box.  Low and behold, I find out about the Elocity A7.  Here's the scoop in a terms that are very easy to understand.The Elocity A7 is a an EVO on steriods.  Meaning....bigger screen, faster processer (great for games and website loading), standard HDMI port, USB port and a Micro SD card port as well.  Internally, the Elocity offers 4G of storage.  Almost...half of the space is used for the platform and software preinstalled.  You can extend the memory by 64 GB by using a a microSD card and a flash drive.  Now if you are like me, you constantly carry flashdrives, so watching movies, interchanging programs are a breeze.Now ask yourself, why pay over $500 for a tablet that you can get $150 cheaper with more bangs and whistles???I took the Galaxy Tab back after I settled in with the A7.  Yes, there were issues with it not accepting the Android Market, but was fixed with the firmware update.  Enbrace the forum that is offered by the company.  And yes, DEXTER is the MAN!!  There are issues with the "pinch screen" methods, but I mean...is that REALLY necessary.  Be honest with yourself....I have only one glitch with the Wi-Fi.  Only one!!... By the way, there is nothing cooler than playing Angry Birds on your HDMI tv using the A7.  I hope my review helps those that are sitting on a fence.
