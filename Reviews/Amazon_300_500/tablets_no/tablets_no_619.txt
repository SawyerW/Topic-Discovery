I just picked up the 16 gig from my local best buy and am writing the review using it. So far keyboard is nice and quick. Video looks good can't wait for Netflix to become available on the tablets. Screen is super responsive.The oly downside I see so far is I can not find all the apps in the appstore that I have on my mobile phone.UPDATE:Just got done using it for most of a day. Took it to work with me and am now back home, Battery is at 54%Google maps was used very heavily as well as adobe pdf viewer. Both of which worked very well. Was able to use street view and it appeared clearer than it did on my work computer. (most likely attributed to the fact that you are not blowing it up on the larger screen)I also got to use the USB functionality to transfer a PDF onto the device. I like toshiba's built in file management much better than astro which i use on my android phone. Very simple layout and easy to learn. It is evident that a computer manufacturer set this up.Also worth mentioning, When the table locked and the screen fell asleep on its own, it did not like to unlock causing me to reboot a couple of times today. HOWEVER this only happened while i had a 74.3 MB pdf open and only when it fell asleep by itself, not when I hit the lock button.If you are concerned with camera quality: when you are in bright spaces taking pictures of still life, it works ok, the lack of flash is a major problem here but does not concern me because I never planned on taking many pictures with a tablet in the first place.If there is anything else you are curious about leave a comment and I will try to examine it. I will use any excuse to play with my thrive more IT IS AMAZING.
