The need for a home tablet such as the Archos 7 is debatable.  Everyone is wired(less) anymore and yet another screen that does the same thing as every other screen seems frivolous.  Considering I don't own a gadget that runs any kind of an app, I was curious if the tablet is even worth playing with. -Eventually after I was able to grab some WiFi I enjoyed what the limited but sleek and handsome Archos had to offer.  Most exciting to me was the idea of an Ereader while Aldiko is built in and you can grab some great old public domain material this thing isn't exactly the answer to the Kindle, plus a backlight screen that kind of flashed a little on the lowest light setting left me wanting more.  Next up the apps I barely know an app from an apple but I like games, and there are some fun free titles to be found on the service the squashing games seem to work best with this units inability to run many of the tilt driven games. digital music plays well on this unit and it plays FLAC files perfectly (a big plus for me).  The video looks spectacular but given the units somewhat limited intial memory  you will be deleting and transfering alot unit you grab a miniSD card.  The power on button stinks it took me a week to figure it out properly and the manual and documentation are kind of a why bother.  The ac jack and headphone jack are too close and can be confused for one another without close inspection.  GREAT SCREEN< BATTERY LIFE< CODECS seem to play every audio and video file I throw at it.  The browser works well and websites look great but I would use it only in situations where it was the only option.  The price is right and the screen is a beauty.  The real drawback here is touchscreen only controls that sometimes misfire, which a rubber tipped stylus seemed to remedy.  Overall pretty cool and great for traveling with movies as they still seem cinematic on the sharp scratch proof screen.
