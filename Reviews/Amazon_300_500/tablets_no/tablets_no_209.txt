After reading a number of negative reviews, I was hesitant to buy it but since I could return it if I didn't like it, I decided to give it a try. Short conclusion, I'm keeping it.It is a little slower than I'm used to and the available applications are limited but I'm hoping that will change with time. But this is sooo much more than an e-reader. From the Cruz market I downloaded a Youtube application so I can now watch videos from there. Does the whole internet browsing thing. Only plays MPG4 videos so I downloaded a converter and now I can watch numerous videos (after I convert to MPG4 format). Comes with Borders ebook reader but I downloaded the Kindle app and get books from Amazon since they seem to be a little cheaper than Borders. And I like the Kindle app better. Also have MS Suite so I can open and Edit Word and Excel files. They say PowerPoint will be added soon. Lot's of other goodies too like games, etc you can download too.I know there are some Ipad lovers here giving negative reviews (maybe they are employed by Apple?) and I guess if you have Ipad expectations you will be a little disappointed. But Ipads are $500 and this baby costs me $120. If anything, it's a stepping ground to see how much one will use a tablet device (though this is not advertised as a tablet) and if you love it and use it a lot and want more applications, then jump to the Ipad. Maybe I have low expectations but I'm very pleased with the product and my wife just ordered herself one.The main difficulty I am having now is finding an inexpensive case for it. It comes with a pocket case but I'm looking for a nice leather notebook case. Right now the only one I see if $50, which is hard to swallow when I only paid $120 for the device!
