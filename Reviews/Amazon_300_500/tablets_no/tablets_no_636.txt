I received my Thrive neatly packed an undamaged. I've read that it's a bit thick but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The device seems fairly rugged and well made. After the set up it installed the latest version of the firmware so I haven't had any of the problems as discussed in some of the past reviews. The update didn't cause any problems but I didn't have an files or apps installed. I don't know if would have required a total reset which may be problematic if you already have files installed. I seem to get 7 to 9 hours with the battery while watching netflix or reading books using the kindle app but I do have my screen brightness a bit lower than the default or the automatic setting. The battery charge time seems to be very quick, only about 35 to 40 min for a complete charge. I'm impressed with all the included ports but what really sold me was the removable battery. For that alone it makes the thrive a competitive tablet. I'm not a fan of Apple products since everything must function through itunes but many people don't consider the cost and time replacing something as simple as a battery when buying an apple product or some of the other android tablets. The included android 3.1 makes it easy to run third party apps and things such as keyboards and mice. Although few apps have been created to take advantage, the Thrives nvidia processor makes games and apps explode when it comes to graphics and speed. My only negative with the Thrive is the chrome bezel around the front facing camera. I feel it make the tablet look a bit cheap but it's only my opinion. I also hope they release an update that gives you the ability to turn off the front indicator lights. They can sometimes be too bright and distracting when reading or watching a movie. Overall it seems like most of the bugs have been worked out and I would recommend it.
