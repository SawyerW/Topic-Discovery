When Apple and Steve jobs made the ipad 1 I felt like I did not need one since I thought it was just a big iPod touch. So I waited then all the reviews were saying its good, but it did not have a camera. The ipad 2 is the one to get. Its great to look at, its thin, light, big,comes with 2 cameras,the screen is very beautiful, the colors pop. The sound is loud. But what makes the iPad 2 great is the APPS. Any app from cooking to taking the placement test to college to great games like BAD piggies,BASTION,Sonic the hedgehog, etc the app store has it ALL. You can also put your iPhone apps on it and make them bigger to fit the screen, you lose some resolution but that's nothing.Pros.Great lookingThinBig beautiful screenSoftware is greatAPPS anything you came think of.MoviesMusicFace time10 hour Battery life with wifi on.Cons16gb is not enough, apps are using retina display making some apps and games 2gbs per one.Sound grill is in the back you need to cup your hand on it to aim the sound at you.Get credit card ready, you cant have fun on this thing without purchasing apps.When you compare the ipad 2 with ipad 3 all you get is the higher screen resolution the processor is the same and it has a 1 gig of memory on it,just a bit stronger to handle the screen, other wise there are no differences. You can do ipad 2 vs ipad 3 on youtube and see your self.Ipad 3 also comes with a 5 mp camera but has no flash. The ipad 2 cam sucks but it can record really good vid.At the end the ipad change my life and it will help and change yours.Mark my words the ipad (tablets) in the future will replace laptops in like 5 to 10 years.
