This is my first tablet and I think it's great! I bought the older (Android 4.0 'Ice Cream Sandwich') version because I really wanted to have the HDMI & SD card slots (which the newer Android 4.1 'Jelly Bean' version doesn't have). I read somewhere that this tablet will accept a 128GB SD card, so I bought a 64GB SD card and installed it in the SD card slot (with no problems).  I had to remove the plastic cover that WAS filling the SD card slot.  Once I installed the SD card, the plastic SD card slot cover no longer fits.  The SD card fits all of the way down into the slot, but you can still see the back end of the SD card.  It's not a physical problem, just a visual one (since the card is not hidden behind a silvery cover.  I don't think it's a real problem, especially after I bought a leather cover for the tablet. The Toshiba tablet uses a proprietary Toshiba 115VAC wall plug charger so, if you want to charge the tablet, you will NEED the Toshiba charger.  The tablet came bundled with one charger.  I decided to order a 2nd charger - to have one charger at home and one at work. Although other people wrote that the micro USB port can be used to charge the tablet, I couldn't get it to charge my tablet. I plugged the micro USB cable into my computer, but the tablet never gave any indication that it was charging.  I think that the micro USB port is only for connecting to a computer to TRANSFER DATA. As for the light bleeding (on the screen) that some people have mentioned (as a defect), I have no idea what they are talking about.  This may be my first tablet, but the screen looks just fine to me.  Eventually, I'll figure out what to do with all of the apps, but I'm learning more each day.  By the way, you will really need to have a Google account.  Until I created a Google account and logged on, it seemed like every app that I tried to open wouldn't work, because I kept getting a stupid Google Account Log On screen.  But, now that I'm logged on, everything is working.
