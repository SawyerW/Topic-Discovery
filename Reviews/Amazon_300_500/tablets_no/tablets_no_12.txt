I'm an even bigger fan of Google after buying this Nexus 7 tablet. Love the ease of use, and the customizing ability. I love the new Android O.S. Jellybean 4.2. It's very smooth operating. I'm also a fan of Asus for their excellent build quality of the Nexus 7. It definitely  appears that Google and Asus collaborated very closely on this tablet. I was concerned about the tablet. Because it's made by Asus. And my past experience with their customer service, leaves little to be desired! But, after doing research, I came to realize that the support of this tablet software is all Google. Asus is just the hardware. Since Asus builds quality products in general, this should not be an issue. I was also pleased to learn that Google engineers much of it's Android O.S. in my hometown. Here in Pittsburgh! Love supporting American jobs, especially good paying ones. The screen resolution is great. Which is made with Corning glass. Another U.S. based company A.K.A. Corning, NY! It's also very easy to read. The Nexus 7 connected to my wi-fi effortlessly. And my bluetooth keyboard also works very well with it. Love being able to speak to the Nexus 7 and it finds what I want. And it understands me every time. Surfing the net or reading e-mail is terrific. Also great for Facebook and YouTube. Lots of great apps available, including many games. Would have liked a rear facing camera. But, not a deal breaker! I like all my memories to be saved on my Sony Cyber Shot digital camera anyway. You still can't beat a good digital camera for photos. The tablet is also the perfect size. Fits in your hand perfectly, not too big or small. Making it a great portable mini p.c. I feel this is by far the best value for the money in a tablet. With 32 GB of memory, H.D. screen, Android O.S. and a quad core processor. You can hardly go wrong. And great Google support to boot. Google is committed to constantly improving their Android O.S. A big plus!
