A very nice toy, a helpful tool. if you don't ask for very much and you do not expect so much.I've always problems finding a wifi signal, perhaps it is signal bad quatlity issue. Screen size is nice, you can read easily even writing, brightness control is helpful. I was afraid about battery endurance but I can use my tablet for two or three hours and use 15-20% as I use the lowest bright level. I don't use screen keyboard because have a keyboard case, which is very helpful and discreet.Touching screen has good response; some apps suddenly close with no notice, fortunately nos frequently; only twice it can not go ahead nor behind, stopped completely and had to remove the battery to close device, it happends.Camera it is infront of you so it may be or should be useful for skype or so so, do not know; certantly it is not for picturing any thing around you. File manager it is not easy, and certantly you have to go to website to find a helpful manual to deal with your new product.A major problem is Android market: you CAN NOT USE IT anyway. You can not count with it, it is hardly to find apps and some sites are not completly trustly; Android market is design for phones and had no tool or posibility for tablets. For example, Docs to go, by microsft, you have to pay and preview version it is unhelpful; Olive office it is difficult, uneasy; norton antivirus for mobile, you can find it only in Android market... yahoo mail or hotmail apps are difficult to find and if you need upgrade ... chao chao even in yahoo! site you can not find it. It work very nice with gmail, but I also need other mail sites. Google maps? a gps? Ha.As you do not have apps you should think and evalute carefully if it is what you want, what you need.For me its good as I was finding a device for reading pdf books, check mail and write some notes.As I said, a nice toy.
