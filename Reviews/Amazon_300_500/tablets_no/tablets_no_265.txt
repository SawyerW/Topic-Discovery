We originally wanted to get an iPad -- we wanted portable internet browsing and an e-book reader (ie, Kindle), the kids wanted to play touch screen games, and we wanted to be able to stream YouTube videos. However, we also wanted to be able to video chat (using Skype). My wife also wanted to be able to manage her photos (from camera's SD memory card). We also wanted to be able to access web sites with Flash content. And I wanted to be able to print to any printer (not just the very few iPad AirPrint-enabled printers, which we don't own). And it would be nice to be able to install the full Office suite.This is the only device that meets all of our needs! It's also nice to have the USB connectivity (for DVD drive, direct printers, 3g/4g card, etc.). And we have the "power" button set to put the computer to "sleep" (as opposed to turning off the device), which gives us the "instant on" capability. And we love the included dock's HDMI port, for streaming any video content to our TV!We did note that the iPad has a smoother pinch-zoom effect than the Slate, and the iPad has a cool flip-animation when turning from portrait to landscape (the Slate just switches the view without any nifty animation). But these are mainly cosmetic and totally worth giving up for all the extra capabilities of the Slate!One thing that would be nice is if the Slate had a longer battery life. Seems like it's about half the life of the iPad, but it's not bad -- over twice as long as any laptop that we've ever owned. Based on our casual use profile, it gets us through the day (possibly 2) - no problem as long as one is accustomed to popping it in the dock to charge (before bedtime).Again, it's the best tablet on the market if you need to do more!
