I needed something that I could use for work that was more portable than a laptop.  Specifically, I needed access to my email, certain web pages and the ability to hand-write notes on the screen.  The HP slate was able to do all of this but it was just too small/too thick/and hot.  I own an ipad and love the size of it and how easy it is to use (even my 3 year old can use the ipad).  I just received the HP Slate in the mail and was initially dissappointed in the size.  It is really small.  Much smaller than my ipad but a little larger than my iphone.  It is also thicker and heavier than the ipad.  In addition, it gets really hot fast.  The stylus takes a little bit to get used to and the on-screen keyboard is not easy to use because it is small, especially when compared to the ipad.  On a positive note, the hand-writing recognition technology is the best that I have seen and would be great for taking notes whithout having to type them in later.  On the ipad, the stylus point is the size of the eraser end of a pencil while the HP stylus is like a real pencil point.I guess I was expecting the HP Slate to have a fresh interface that is easy to use.  But what I found is that the HP Slate is just a really small laptop with the same windows7 interface.  That would be fine, but for me, I do not plan on typing up Word documents or Excel spreadsheets on a screen that is a little larger than my iphone.  The screen is just too small.  You would need the portable keyboard to go with it.  It's nice but HP really needs to get creative and develope a fresh new approach on the usability of the tablets instead of just putting windows 7 on a really small laptop.  I think it is clunky and needs some more time in development.  If you're looking for a REALLY small version of your laptop then this might be for you.
