Lets start off with the overall build of the product. The scree is awesome looking but is a finger print magnet. Button placement on the device is weird be they tried to put everything too close to together so if you have big hands this probably isn't for you. THe speakers are placed ok but they sound just right without headphones unlike the archos 101 where is the music is too lou the music sounds terrible.The screen is a bit too sensative for my liking as far as typing goes. I bought this to replace my old mp3 player because i have a bigger tablet (archos 101) for video and internet so typing is a bit of a chore, but using this as a mp3 player is great. I have not problem accessing my music while driving on the freeway. In order to do this place the music player widget on the home screen and nothing else and that will make it a whole lot easier to get the the stuff you bought this for. Im sure the typing would be a little more better with a better keyboard for the applib.Internet is cool for casual surfing and youtube videos though some videos cant be viewed on a mobile device the overall presention of the ones you can watch is great. I can honestly say that it looks great.The music player is great but i already knew my way around it from my archos 101 cause its pretty much the same just smaller. It does have a equlizer to adjust the bass etc.Gaming is decent but something frustrating because the screen is so senseative so you have to push kind of firm to do what you want.So overall it is a great product for music and casual internet surfing (if you either have a stylus or a better keyboard) gaming is ok as long as you not trying to play something to complex (if so then get a bigger version) But is you looking for something along the line of a ipod touch but dont want to pay the price or deal with apples crappy customer service then this is for you.
