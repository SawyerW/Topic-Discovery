I bought mine for $99 at Christmans; 4Meg w 4Meg card and ver 2.2.1I don't want to rehash all the previous reviews so I'll just hit the highlights.For a very cheap entry level android tablet this is not bad.  You can get better like a Nook Color  [ASIN:B004D1OBFW Barnes & Noble NOOK COLOR eBook Reader (WiFi Only)]] (cheaper at BN), or a Kindle Fire Kindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi, but those cost $199.  Worth it if you want beter quality and faster.If you want a real good 7" android version 3.2 tablet then the Samsung Galaxy is the way to go but the price is about $350.  Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus 16GB (Dual Core, Universal Remote, WiFi)If you want an Ipad then you are limited to the 10" screen which I think is too big for my liking and of course it cost $500 and up. Apple iPad 2  Tablet (16GB, Wifi,) NEWEST MODELPROS: Cheap, Kindle Reader Preinstalled, Youtube preisnstalled, Videos work good, Amazon Market place works good, Comes with a protective sleeve and memory card, wifi works good and easy, facebook works but very very slow, hotmail works good, wordsmith and hangman are decent word gamesCons: Slow, Very slow screen movement, No android Marketplace, Cruz market place is useless, many apps like angry birds won't work, I Heart Radio doesn't work, netflix doesn't work, facebook is way slow.I hope this helps a little and to clarify I use and Iphone and I wanted a cheap way to try out the Android operating system.  Because this is such a cheap, minimalistic tablet it is probably not a fair evaluation of the operating system.  I am getting used to it and may upgrade to the Galaxy 7" or the new 7.7"  I wish you could get the Ipad with a 7" screen but that is not an option.  For me, the Iphone screen is too small and Ipad it to large.
