I wanted to get either a netbook or tablet for school. I have been weening myself away from Apple's mobile offerings and getting away from iTunes a bit (lemme burn my videos ferChristsakes!). I had looked at getting a Xoom, a Thrive, a Galaxy Tab 2, and Asus Transformer 303. I even had it narrowed down to a Xoom or the Asus. Then this baby went on sale at $425. It has a solid build without feeling heavy, which was my problem with Asus. The 303 just felt flimsy and plastic like (great tablet otherwise). The Xoom was cool, but is running on last years tech. This tablet met my requirements and then some.The tablet comes loaded with Android 4.0 (ICS). It is a very stock build, and the hardware runs it very smoothly. It has a number of applications on it pre-installed. Normally this irks me, but they do not take up that much room and a number of them are quite useful (ie LogMeIn ignition is included and is a $30 value). You can uninstall a number of them, but the Toshiba apps are a just there. The screen is crisp and clear, but as others have noted there is a glow from the LCD. If this bothers you, move on. It doesn't bother me , it is a slight glow about the size of half a nickel on one side and is only obvious when the screen is black. The charging cable is bulky as others have noted. It does hold enough power for me to use it during six hours of class running Evernote, Quickoffice, and Netflix during lunch. Lastly, the screen takes fingerprints like a kid in a candy store. Get a screen shield or you will be cleaning the screen every time you use it.
