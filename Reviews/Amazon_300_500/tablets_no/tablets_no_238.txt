I've had my WiFi Xoom for just over two weeks now and I love it.  This is my first tablet, and my first Android device. Having had an iPhone for 9 months now I grew accustomed to how OS4 & OS5 both worked. But the Xoom with Android 3.2 straight out of the box was very easy to navigate.  I am already an Amazon Prime member so I purchased Mediabridge - High Speed Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 Feet) and was able to Stream an Amazon HD movie right away onto my LCD 1080p HDTV. The Xoom has 720p definition and looks great on TV or on the Xoom screen. It is comparible to the Ipad2 screen but not as sharp as the IPhone screen.Motorola has already confirmed it will be upgrading the Xooms to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4) a few months after it's official launch so this tablet has a long life ahead of it. I am extremely pleased with the Android platform. Unlike the Ilocked products, it is easy to customize to your liking. New Apps are coming out everyday also.I have not had a chance to check out the blue-tooth capabilities yet but its good to know I can add a blue tooth keyboard and USB mouse if I ever want to. I presume blue tooth printing is another feature I have yet to check into yet but any peripherals I decide to purchase I know won't be as expensive as Apple products.Some websites still get confused with the various Android OS builds and default to a mobile themed platform but with the xoom you can customize it to always display one way or the other, turn flash on or off,etc. Android is how I wish my PC OS would work.  Simple, functional.  This is the beginning of a long friendship!
