You can now get the Flash Player for the Coby 8125.  Install the 1 Mobile Market, then from there, install Flash 11.1.  Now you may watch any videos that require the player.  I purchased a Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse combo from Amazon for about $20, one transmitter for both and they work great, games are much easier.  Also, just get the Amazon app store for all kinds of free apps!Update 7/5/12: A great little tablet for the price. I also bought the 7125 from Amazon, same specifications as the 8125 except only 7 inch screen.  If you want to update any of the apps that you download from Amazon get them from 1 Mobile Market.  You must first uninstall the Amazon version and reinstall the 1 Mobile apps.  This is good except for the Maxthon Browser, I lost all my bookmarks.  However, once you've installed the 1 Mobile app that should not be a problem.Update 7/26/12: Get the Gemini App Manager app from Amazon.  This is a great way to kill all of the apps after you run them and exit, because the apps continue to run in the background.  Also, use it to clear the cache memory.Update 9/27/12:  This tablet just keeps working as well today as it did when I purchased it 5 months ago.  People, this is not an I-Pad.  It's just a fun little gadget.  I've added many great free apps from Amazon.  Games, browsers, financial market programs, Kindle, Amazon MP3 player all run very well on this tablet.Update 10/12/2012:  Don't forget to install an antivirus program.  I got AVAST from Amazon and it updates it's virus definitions regularly.  Kingsoft Office Suite is available for free now, not a trial version.  I have the Hotmail (now Outlook) app from Amazon which works great.  More later...Update 6/9/2013:  Continues to work without problems and stays connected to my wi-fi with out drop outs.  Great with the Kindle app for reading all the free e-books from Amazon.com.
