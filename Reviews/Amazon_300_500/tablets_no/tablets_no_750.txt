I was really looking forward to this product. The reviews that I read were excellent, and I thought that this Tablet would be a good fit for what I want to do. This was going to be used more for business than gaming, or streaming videos and therefore I did not test it. My needs are more towards a portable product to use outside the office.As soon as I received I began playing with it and setting it up for my needs. I noticed the system to be very slow during the initial boot process and thought that it was just the setup that it had to go through. Fully expected that setup would take a little time. Setup took approximately 1 hour. The second boot again was a little slow, again an the same expectation. However subsequent times after that, the boot and the shutdown took forever and a day. Boot takes more than 4 minutes. I have a Toshiba Laptop running Win 7, that 5 years old and it takes 1/2 the time to boot  than the Acer Iconia does.Since I did not require high graphics I thought to lower the shared memory for the graphics to 256k rather than the 384k that comes standard. The BIOS does not allow any changes to the shared graphics memory, thus leaving me with just 1.5 gigs of memory to run my applications. Window 7, as are all MSN OS', are memory intensive and with 1.5 gigs, this thing doesn't move very fast.Before I gave up on this Acer, I went and looked at the performance of this AMD C-50 Processor at "[...] and found out that it was only rated at 452. Compared to most processors that run many times faster than this one.I really regret having to return this Tablet.
