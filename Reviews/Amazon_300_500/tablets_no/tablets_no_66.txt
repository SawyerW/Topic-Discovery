I've had my iPad 2 32Gb WiFi for about 5 months now, and it's probably one of the best purchases I've ever made. Ease of use is above and beyond any computing device I've ever had. Yes it's mostly a "consumption device", but that's about 90% of what I do at home. And for the other 10% (sending email, shopping, etc) the various apps work terrific. I barely use my laptop now, and I've ceased bringing it on vacations with me since my iPad can handle everything I would need to do on the road, and does it for longer.Some examples of how I've used it in the past few months:- Sold/traded in all of my programming reference manuals and bought ePub or Kindle versions of them all. My library went from a couple of hundred pounds of books to something that I can carry around with me at all times in my Timbuk2 bag.- Watched "Prohibition" Ken Burns mini-series on the plane to Key West with my girlfriend (that I easily transferred from my TiVo to my iPad). And while I was in the Keys I was able to browse online for activities and book day trips, find restaurants, etc. while tethered to my Android phone.- Played Scrabble / Words with Friends regularly with friends that live all over the country.- Read the news and check my email on it every morning.- Purchase/download all books I needed for grad school.- Used it for almost all of my Christmas shopping this year.- Introduced my family to my girlfriends family using Facetime.- Streamed music from iCloud/iTunes, SiriusXM and Pandora apps.- Used as a cookbook multiple times.- Watched movie on Netflix while plugged into the TV via HDMI in my hotel room on a business trip.Enough said... the fact that I've barely put the thing down since I've owned it is the best endorsement I can give. =)
