This debate will go on for as long as the debate of  what came first the chicken or the egg but one thing we can  or most of us can agree on is that that they both taste good and they both have a purpose. with that said I have owned the Xoom since the first day it was released its the 4g version the main reason I brought it was for the 4 g connectivity and the SD slot it took me days of comparing the iPad and Xoom before I purchased and the only regret I have is Motorola did not give the support that apple gives the iPad but what a lot of people don't realize is that the both do pretty much the same thing  just in different ways and when you buy a tablet you will never buy more than a few apps that might help your productivity but all the talk of thousands of apps is just not realistic in the two years I've owned my tablet I only brought 5 apps but I surf the web on average 4-5 hours a day and both the iPad or any tablet for that matter can do that pretty much at about the same speed and as for the screen specs yes the iPad is very nice but not enough to justify the price I don't feel like I'm missing nothing when I view my Xoom but I have to add when my Xoom goes to tablet heaven I am going to buy a iPad next and only because I use logic music program and you can't get that on android otherwise I would buy a android tablet and with the money I save buy all the apps I want. I should also add that in 2 years I have only used my cellar connection twice and one of those times was during sandy I thought I would take my tablet out  but what a waste of money for a two year plan 38 dollars a month  and i never used it so think twice about if you will  need a cellular plan or just wifi I just can't see no real benefit that buying one over the other I love my Xoom.
