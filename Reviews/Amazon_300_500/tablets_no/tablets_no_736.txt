I will start by saying the mailing and packaging was great. Very firm and professional packaging.I believe it is a great deal. This is going for $500 with the keyboard.I've used Asus Eee PCs with Intel Atom CPUs. Eee PCs and most netbooks run on windows XP. This Acer Iconia tab W500 runs on windows 7 and is not as slow compared to those Intel Atom netbooks.It is also very responsive. The touch screen is great.It is a plastic finish, but feels very sturdy. No complaints here. When i bought this I was looking for a affordable tablet running windows 7, I did not expect metal parts just to look and feel kooler.It's a 1GHz CPU they say. However, I believe it runs ridiculously smoother then most Intel Atom notebooks because it is a hybrid CPU/GPU processor with 256mb ram. People don't understand the difference in CPU models brings a lot of performance difference. There is a reason why Intel labels their Atom CPUs "Atom". They are very small, use very little energy, create less heat, and R slow. An Intel i5 or i3 CPU at 1.3GHz will out perform a Intel Atom CPU at 1.6GHz any day.The AMD CPU in this Acer iconia w500 tablet just seems to be well designed for this setup.5 Stars because I'm lovin' it and it's $500 from Amazon with free shipping. This machine is Ideal and not slow at all for the price. If your looking for intense gaming and high performance your looking at the wrong place. You should be buying a desktop.Believe me I have been shopping around for a Windows7 tablet/slate for quite a while. Asus has a 12" windows7 tablet/slate running a i5 CPU at 1.33GHz, however it runs for over $1000. I'd rather buy a laptop with $1000.A note: people keep saying windows7 tablets are slow and the accelerometer switch from horizontal to vertical is slow because, due to the weak CPUs they have. It's Not because of the Weak CPUs they carry. It's because windows7 is a full operating system and not optimized for tablets.
