I would recommend the Nook HD to anyone. I had a Nook Color for 3 years and didn't have a single problem with it until the battery charge indicator started to malfunction, which is when I purchased the HD. I'm glad I did, as it's lighter, faster, and has that beautiful HD screen.As an e-reader, the text is crystal clear and pristine. As a tablet, it's quick, easy to navigate, and has a spectacular picture. I find it very user-friendly and intuitive to download books, read, and organize my book "shelves." I also appreciate being able to download books from Project Gutenberg and other free sites and the public library directly onto the Nook using the Wi-Fi feature instead of having to use a USB cord to plug into my computer. You can also rent or buy movies to watch on the spectacular HD screen.I enjoyed the experience of going to a store and seeing the different Nooks that are offered and asking questions from the representatives there. I can't imagine purchasing an e-reader without touching it, feeling it, and testing it out before deciding which one I wanted.  If you're debating between the Simple Touch and the HD, I would recommend the HD: you get a tablet for the price of an e-reader, you don't have to use your computer to "sideload" content from sites other than B&N;, and you get a much crisper and more legible reading screen that you can read in the dark at night.I don't think that I'll ever be without a Nook in the future.  I thought that I was married to actual books, but the Nook really captures the book experience. It's like having an entire library at your disposal in the comfort of your own home. It's also amazing that you can carry a giant, epic 3-inch-thick piece of literature in a slim little e-reader.  If you're hesitating on making this purchase, I say go for it. You won't be disappointed.
