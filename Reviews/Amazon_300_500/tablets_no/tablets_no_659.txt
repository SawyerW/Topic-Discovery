It should be NO STAR but Amazon insists you put a star rating.When I got my Toshiba Thrive Tablet, I was so excited because of the good reviews that I was sure I wouldn't have to return it, so I disposed of the box.  Unfortunately, upon inspection, I discovered that when I opened the cover of the HDMI/USB/Mini USB port, then closed it, it didn't close properly anymore.  It was very loose and ill-fitting.  So I contacted the seller and told them if I could exchange it for another unit, since I really like the tablet.  But without the box, they emailed me that I would have to call the manufacturer to see if Toshiba could help.  In other words, they just pass on all the responsibility to the manufacturer.  This is no help at all!  Shouldn't the seller be the one to take back the product and return it to Toshiba?So I did call Toshiba directly.  But the tech support operator kept putting me on hold, and told me that they could only repair the unit.  But first I would have to register it before he would give me the address of Toshiba where I would have to ship back the unit.  I would then get it back 7-10 days after.  But the problem is, I bought the tablet because I intended to bring it with me to the Philippines, where I will be staying for 4-5 months.  The operator also told me I could not ship it outside the U.S.I also own an Ipad 2, and I can tell you, this is where Apple beats all of them - the after-sales service.  My nephew had a defective Iphone 4, and Apple changed it THREE TIMES, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.Toshiba says on their website that customer satisfaction is very important to them.  Well, I AM ONE VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER!  And I don't think I will every buy another Toshiba product again in the future, nor will I recommend it to anyone.
