For the past year, I have been researching and holding off my purchase of the right kind of portable device that serves my needs.  And this is what I have been looking for--in the order of decreasing importance:(1) Serves as an eBook reader and a note taking device.(2) Has to be able to run some Windows applications, mostly Word, PowerPoint and OneNote and allows for some web surfing.(3) Playing videos, music and games on the side.  The Iconia W500 has met all my needs above, especially my most important one, which is eBook reading and note taking. Incidentally, for that purpose, I have installed Kindle for PC for Amazon eBooks and Bluebeam Revu for reading and commenting on PDFs.  They work very well for me. (Bluebeam Revu is tailored to tablet users more than Adobe Acrobat is. And it registers handwriting so much better, since they have designed (or at least claim to have designed) their software to be pressure sensitive to touch.) Besides, a 10 inch tablet is just about right as a reader and a note taker. 12 inch would be a bit big (and heavy) to hold.  And 5-6 hours of battery life for eBook reading and note taking is acceptable.  It is important to know exactly what you are looking for before giving your take on a product.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be a fair-minded review. If (3) is your most important objective, i. e., if you want to take something on the road to entertain yourself, you are probably better off with an iPad or an Android tablet. Or if you expect the W500 to be a high-performance laptop that can do all sorts of multitasking, i. e., (2) above, then you should pass it up as well.  While there are certainly some things that Acer could have done better with the W500 such as the awkward keyboard dock design and a drive with stingy disk space--an 8-hour battery would be a plus, overall if you have the kind of priorities as I have, the Iconia should fit your bill (for just around $500).  My search has ended with the Iconia--at least for a while
