I purchased this computer as a kind of commuter computer to take between the house and work.  It's certainly small enough to fit in along with a small backpack or messenger bag.  The operating system and tablet functionality is very handy for most situations.  Overall, an outstanding computer for the person on the go!But, as with most things, a few caveats.  First, it comes with Windows 7 Starter installed.  The only issue that I have with that is that there are some functions of the OS that aren't available.  The most noticeable, for me at least, was the fact that you cannot change the desktop background.  I understand that it has this version of Windows installed because the computer's hardware is just above what's needed to run Windows 7, but still an annoyance if nothing else.  The update to Windows 7 Home is about $80, but I don't know yet if the improved features will outweigh the price and possible increased demand on the already taxed CPU resources.  Secondly, the desktop can get rather cluttered if you have more than a half dozen icons on it.  But there are several ways to work around that.  Thirdly, there is no CD drive.  If you fortunate enough to have an external drive that you can use (e.g. DVD burner), this isn't an issue.  There simply isn't room in the case for a CD drive.  It has all of the other usual peripheral ports (USB ports, SD card slot, audio out jack, and a built-in camera).  Finally, the touchscreen functionality is very user-friendly, but is a little difficult to use right near the edges and corners.  For closing maximized windows, for example, it's better to direct the cursor via the mousepad.For me, none of these things was enough to discourage me from getting this fine piece of computing awesomeness!  I highly recommend this notebook!  I think of this as PC's answer to the iPad; similarly priced and better functionality in my opinion.
