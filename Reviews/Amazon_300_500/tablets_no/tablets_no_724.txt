I own a bunch of tablets due to business needs. Archos, Samsung, TouchPads, and these Dells. In fact I have 3 Dell Streak 7s.Pros: Fast dual core processor, full size SDHC slot, price.Cons: Poor screen resolution resulting in lousy blacks, poor viewing angle, proprietary plug, horrible battery life, loses WiFi connections frequently, and heavy. And when did Dell ever stick with a market it couldn't compete well in? Remember the PDA?The reason I use them is simple. The app that we run requires about an hour of use at a time. For the app resolution, these work great and the dual core makes things nice and speedy along with good screen touch sensitivity. Having the Dell name on them in a corporate environment is a plus.The reasons you would NOT want to use them for normal entertainment are paramount. For movie viewing, lousy viewing angle quality and resolution along with horrible battery life. You can get maybe one movie out of them on one charge. For a reader, same issues: so-so screen resolution for reading and somewhat dim in normal light. Way too heavy to hold up and read from, especially when lying on your back. I use my Archos 70 as a reader, much easier to hold for any period of time.In summary, if you want a cheap 7 incher, this is not a horrible choice, but right now there are a lot of options coming available and pricing is bound to keep moving downward. You greatly risk Dell leaving you high and dry as they did to us with the Dell PDAs. I predict Dell is out of the tab market within a year from now, maybe sooner. Do yourself a favor and find a used 7 inch Samsung Tab or even an Archos. You'll be much happier with the battery life and screen, even if it costs you a little more cash.
