I did my homework on the features I wanted on my tablet. I visited the Blackberry site. I found an instruction manual online and I read it. I made  judgments on which reviews are constructive, and which are just plainly absurd. I settled on the Playbook. So, I wasn't disappointed when I got my Playbook in June this year.I took it on my trip in July to the Canadian Rockies. I was pleased that I could check both my personal e-mail on Yahoo and my work e-mail on Outlook. I took pictures using the Playbook (I had the camera on and put in in the pocket of the car door) when I couldn't fire up my Sony Hx9v fast enough to snap pictures of mountain goats, sheep and elks. (Almost took a picture of a black bear crossing the road. Kathy: Look, a bear. Bear: Oh #$%^, humans).I have since been able to side-load some android apps, which now has become a bonus. I am now able to read magazine from our public libraries. All in all I am happy.A side note: Blackberry people, you need to market your products better!Updated on August 25, 2012OK, so I didn't expect to do heavy-duty work on the PB. I did use the Print to Go feature, as well as sending myself word, pdf and PPT docs by email. I am able to work to the fullest extent that PB is capable of. Then, I do back to work and immediate hit the road running. That makes my Mondays are more prepared and pleasant.My Sony Hx9v is my dedicated camera, but I also take "duplicate" pics and videos on my playbook for sharing them with my co-workers. It's more handy and discrete than putting them on my work computer, and the Sony scree is too small anyways.I also take the PB to off site meetings (we have WiFi at all our sites). I bring the PB instead of lugging my labtop to allow access to work e-mail and essential documents in the PB, if case I need to refer to them.August 26 update:I wasn't sure what apps are in the App Store, so I just enter an alphabet in the search box. Then I browse what's available. Hope this helps.
