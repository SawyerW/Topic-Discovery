Let me start off by saying that I purchased this because my Galaxy tablet was stolen and I had to have a replacement and T-Mobile was out of the Galaxy Tablet at the time.  So then and only then did I purchase the Dell Streak 7.  FIrst off, T-Mobile sent me a prepaid card that had to be reactivated; Secondly, the daggone adapter was defective and would not charge after the initial charge.  After T-Mobile found me a store in Houston, no less, that had a car charger, they made arrangements with Dell to send me a new adapter, on July 27, 2011.  It is now August 5 and I still have not received it so I had to purchase an outlet that works with car chargers which will also drain your device AFTER it reaches 100% if you do not remove it from the charger. Thirdly, once you do get it charged to 100%, you can probably read half of a book (I purchased it basically as an e-reader, not for all the other bells and wistles)before the battery drains back down to 35%. So needless to say this product is useless.And I took it to Florida with me for a conference right after purchasing it and I was unable to utilize it because the resort where I stayed had no free wi-fi (imagine that) and was made of concrete and could neither get a signal for cell phones either so in all, this was a useless device to me so I called T-Mobile to utilize my 14-day buyer's remorse to get rid of this gizmo.  Not for just the fact that I could not acces the 3G or wi-fi components of this useless piece of crap, but because the adapter was useless and even the one time I was able to read a book during the most boring parts of the conference I attended, it emitted a loud beep during one of the speaker's speeches indicating low battery drawing attention to me.
