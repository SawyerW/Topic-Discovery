If you like games, ipads and androids, don't buy this. If you are a professional who uses windows and microsoft office solutions, this is incredible. A full fledged PC. Earlier models had poor battery life, however now that the harddrive is solid state flash drive and not one with moving parts, the battery lasts for considerable use. My primary desire was to have a slate that would do great with handwriting recognition. This is amazing, my handwriting is so bad that I can not even read it some days - this slate figures it out extemely well. I could not be more satisfied. PLEASE READ ON FOR UPDATE1/6/13 Update - I have been using this for some time. I still love it. However, there has been one major frustration and it has to do with the internal digitizer and the pen. The digitizer is inside and it is made by N-trig. The only pen I have and only one I have found to be compatible is the manufacturer supplied pen. I have replaced my original pen with another factory pen, I have been certain to keep all drivers updated, and I have optimized all settings and still the problem continues. I will try to describe it but it is a little difficult to describe. Quite often the slate and pen think you are trying to input when you are not. Say you are hovering over the screen with the tip of the pen 2-3 inches away, the slate starts receiving signals from the pen and you can easily click an icon, drag and drop something, highlight something, etc when you do not want to.  It is so bad that I don't even use the pen anymore which means I do not have the handwriting capability that I bought it for. I have yet to find any other pen that works because it has to be a capacitive pen compatible with the N-trig digitizer. It is still an awesome full powered PC and I use it all day 5 days a week for work. I still recommend it, but on the basis of overall and not for the pen or for handwriting recognition.
