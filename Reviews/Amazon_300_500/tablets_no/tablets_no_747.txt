I bought it mainly for the Touch screen, detachable keyboard and a possible Android Port. Looks wise It was OK and with the passable build quality. The Keyboard Dock was not Stable. Once you dock the tablet it would be Top Heavy and feel like it would easily tip over. Also there exists an Android build that you can flash to an External Card and Run as a dual OS system (With Android from SD card and Native Windows on the Hard Disk)I was aware that this would not be a powerhouse. But the Windows 7 was straining to run on this hardware.I noticed that even a simple task as browsing would stress the machine.Then I installed windows 8 on this completely from scratch. That was not a smooth experience either. I don't know if that was because windows 8 or hardware/driver issues.The installation of Android required considerable research and combing forums to get the right set up without messing up the system too much and having an easy dual boot option.I ended up installing ICS on an external SD card and Windows 8 on Hard Disk. I was using a simple Power up sequence to dual boot (Power+windows for Windows; Just power button for Android)Android also had limitations because of the unusual screen size of this tablet (At least for the Android ROM I was running). Not all apps would work well. But Android experience was much better than the Windows 8.All was well until last week, I left the tab untouched for about a fortnight and it would not boot anymore.The blue light would just be on and not even go to the boot screen.Called Acer Cust Service and it looks like it might be related to a power supply issue. They also asked me to bear the shipping charges to them.If it is a defective part, then I feel Acer should bear the shipping charges.Overall, it is not a great product and Acer has some quality issues.
