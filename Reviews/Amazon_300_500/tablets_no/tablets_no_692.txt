I was hesitant to buy a Le Pan tablet because of it being a brand I've never heard of and it running android 2.2 (froyo).  I was a bit worried about it feeling outdated and about some things I had read that you had to fiddle with it to get Netflix working and about launchers not showing up in the android market for some reason.  Another reason I was hesitant is some of the reviews have indicated bad wifi strength and problems getting/staying connected to their wifi.  Lastly I was worried (and still am a bit) about the reviews stating their tablets had freezing/dying problems.Well so far, NONE of these have been issues with my unit.  I updated using the steps on the Le Pan website (lepantab(dot)com).  I logged into the android market and Amazon Appstore without issue.  I haven't found an app yet that won't run.  Netflix works perfectly. My wifi signal (using WPA2 encryption) is great and stays connected. Running froyo hasn't been an issue for me other than looking a bit dated in the menues/notification bar.  I got ADW launcher running as a home replacement so I could fit more icons on one screen (the default looks kinda goofy with the icons so spread out in my opinion).Most of all, the screen is BEAUTIFUL and very responsive/sensitive.  I have had several people ask how much it costs and get a  surpised look when I tell them I got it for such a low price.  The screen and overall build quality does not look "budget" at all.This tablet easily gets a 5/5 so far from me.My only complaints about it so far are 1. the proprietary usb/charging cable.  I hate proprietary connectors and wish this could just have a micro or mini usb port.  2. An upgrade to honeycomb would be nice but I knew about it not getting updated before I ordered mine so I can't complain too much.  So far froyo has been fine.Based on my own experiences, I would definitely recommend this tablet to others.
