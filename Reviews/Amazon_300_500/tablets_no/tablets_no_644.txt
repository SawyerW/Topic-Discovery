I bought this product and kept it for about 5 days.  Here's why I returned it and bought the Asus Transformer, which I think is a much better device.When I got it I was very excited.  However, shortly after playing with it I started having the dreaded not come out of sleep issue.  At first I thought it was the live wallpaper I was using.  I removed it and it locked up less often.  Then Toshiba sent an update and things got so bad that it locked up almost every time it went to sleep. Finally I followed the recommendation that someone on the web had which was don't let the wifi sleep.  That helped but it still locked up every now and then.  After having the issues I started to regret my purchase and other things started to bother me, like the cheap build quality, how thick it was, how dim the screen was and how quick the battery died.  I eventually returned it and bought the Asus Transformer.  All I have to say is I'm extremely happy with my decision.  I love the transformer.  The build quality is way above the Thrive, the screen is way more bright and has better viewing angles. It's thinner and here's the big one, has had no problems at all.  I love it and I just order the keyboard dock as well.  Oh yeah, it lasts way longer too.  Do yourself a favor, if you're looking at the Toshiba then take a pass and get the Transformer.  You won't regret your decision.I do have to give Toshiba credit for trying to work with me though.  They tried resolving the issues I had and eventually said I could return it.  I just couldn't live with myself spending that kind of money on something that didn't work well.  Good luck!
