I used a few tablets since they have become mainstream and I can say that this tablet is a great middle-of-the-road tablet.I've had this tablet for about 4 days now and here is what I have found...The touch interface isn't quite as good as my iPad 3rd Gen, but it is better than most mid-range tablets and as good as some top rated tablets.  CPU speed is a good mid-range also.PROS:+Full 1080P - 9" display that really shows good images (movies and games look great on it)+Access to the Google Play Store (Amazon should take note)+MicroSD slot, up to 64GB card (I will in the near future put a bootable Android version on it)+Easy to copy my eBooks (or other files) from my home computer using ASTRO File ManagerCONS:-No cameras (I wouldn't use it for photos, but video conferencing would have been nice).-No GPS (although if you turn on Google's Location Service it can get pretty close).-Proprietary USB charging port, makes it difficult to always keep it charged because you don't always carry the charging cable with you (and extra charging cables for the NOOK HD+ are expensive).-No sensor for ambient light to allow automatic screen brightness (this bothers me more than I thought it would).-WiFi connections can be flaky sometimes, but if you turn off the NOOK WiFi and turn it back on it seems to clear it up.-Mono speaker, but when stereo matters I am usually using headphones.-NOOK Profiles (up to 6), I thought this would be a PRO but their implementation only seems to give different 'tabletops', each user still uses the same programs and settings (such as the same screen unlock password), so my Jetpack Joyride game is the same as my kids and they keep spending my coins! ... :-/-The screen is a fingerprint magnet (a screen protector should help this).-Can't load apps from 'Unknown Sources,' this is a pain because I have some apps I bought on the Amazon App Store and I can't load them.All-in-all I like it for what I got it for, some of its shortcomings are easily overlooked since I have a phone that can do the cameras and GPS.Worth the $150.
