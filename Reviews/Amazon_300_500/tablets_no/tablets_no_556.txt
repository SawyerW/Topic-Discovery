The link does tell you if you have apps in the internal memory of the tablet to save copy them to external SDHC or on a drive so they can be reinstalled later. The upgrade will erase those apps in internal memory you purchased. If you don't do that you'll have to reload from external site or such. 2. When loading the new firmware make sure you press and hold the (+)VOLUME (VOLUME UP) key not just any where on the volume key as I did.  The tablet went blank when I pressed and held the middle portion of the VOLUME key then pressed and held in the POWER key. FINALLY GOT A PAPER CLIP AND RESET THE TABLET THROUGH THE RESET HOLE.  THE TABLET THEN CAME BACK TO LIFE. Then I was able to upgrade to Android 2.2. 3. The link also said that ADOBE FLASH will not be supported by this update. This is down toward the bottom of page of the link.Noticed that the PDF's I have on the tablet load and page change faster.
