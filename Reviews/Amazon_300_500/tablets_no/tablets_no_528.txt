At first I was completely enthralled with this tab. The size is perfect, the screen is unparallelled, and it seems it can do anything and go anywhere with you. It's very user friendly. I decided it was the best device I had ever owned. I  fell in love.Then it started to hiccup and require apps to be force closed. And then it started to outright choke. Long strings of strange error messages that did not sound minor. I got a little tired of restarting it and waiting for it to boot up (this is not a quick process.)Then there's battery life. If you use it for an hour or two, you are going to get a low battery warning. This doesn't seem like long enough for a tablet to me. Okay, I'll plug it in and use it that way ...Then the scare when it wouldn't go on. Turns out it's just out of battery, but it acts dead. We got past that together.Finally one night it simply refused to boot. Just that logo glowing in the dark. Forever.I'd had it for four months.Samsung said it needed repair and sent me a mailing label. I sadly shipped it off. A week later, they said they got it. And week after that, they said it was on hold for a part.It's been a month now and no one can give me any idea when they might be sending it back. It's as if there is no concern at all about how long it takes to fix it. They got nothing but time at the service center ... la la la. Call back, they suggest. Again.The new Samsung tablet, 7.0 plus, is wifi only and costs twice as much as this one. I am not about to roll the dice with Samsung again.Guess you know what I'm buying next ....
