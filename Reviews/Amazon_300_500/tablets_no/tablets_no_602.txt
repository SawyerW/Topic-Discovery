So I received the computer a month ago and I am finally now able to use it.My touch screen had an issue where the cursor would fly to the bottom corner and minimize everything. It was very frustrating. I spent about 6-8 hours on the phone with dell with them linked in to my computer installing and changing things to no avail. So they sent me a box and it was gone for over a week.I was so excited to get it back so I could finally get to play with it but, within the first 15 min it was doing the same thing again. They had replaced the touch pad by the keyboard not the touch screen. So another very very long phone call to India and another box was sent to me. I was really upset since I had already not been able to use it for almost 2 weeks by the time I received the box and received the computer back. I wanted them to just send me a new one but they told me that was not an option and I don't know why since they did not fix the issue the first time. I was skeptical that they would be able to fix it this time.This time they finally got it right!I was so excited to finally be able to test out the duo. I really enjoy the duo it's nice to be able to switch back and forth from the netbook to the tablet and it transitions smoothly. Now that they replaced my touch screen it works really well and is very responsive. I am looking forward to finding out all the fun things that I can do.I only gave 3 stars due to the fact that I could not really use it for the first month due to glitches, the customer service was good but every time talked to them it seemed to be an all day ordeal. If it had worked straight out the gate I would have probably given it 5 stars.
