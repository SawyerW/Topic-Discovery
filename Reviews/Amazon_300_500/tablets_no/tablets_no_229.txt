I mostly use this as a music player. My previous player is a Cowon D2. The reason I got the Archos tablet is so I can have a "smart music player". This allows me to do lots of things; I listen to a lot of electronic music and these files are much smaller than traditional music files. I can pack them into zip files and this tablet will play them with a third-party app installed. On the D2, I had to convert things to ogg files, which were huge in comparison.  This Archos tablet also functions as a USB hard drive, so you can just plug it in and copy files to it. You DO NOT need to install any third party software to load music on this thing. This is another huge plus, because you can use it on any operating system you want.Battery life is acceptable enough. It doesn't last as long as the D2 does though. Watching videos online REALLY eats the battery fast (a few hours). Honestly I would prefer a device that is twice as thick, where the back is just solid battery and it gives tripple the battery life.I was surprised at the sound quality of this Archos, its pretty good. It can produce good bass/trebble with no clipping. However, it cannot match the ear-shattering volume levels that the D2 can. I usually listen to this thing at about 80%, where as I would not dare turn the D2 up that high.The biggest downside to this device is the touch screen. It is not multitouch. I wanted to play some Doom on the thing, but you can't really do that without multitouch.Even though this is an old device, I got it used for a great deal. Most of the manufacturers are still trying to peddle 8 GB smart-phone sized tablets at prices similar to what this Archos cost when it originally came out. That's why I chose the 16 GB Archos and fitted it with an extra SDHC card for less than half the price.
