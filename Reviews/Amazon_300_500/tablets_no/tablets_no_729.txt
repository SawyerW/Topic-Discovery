If you're looking for an expensive, unreliable laptop with a finicky touch screen, this is the product to get.  If you want a reliable laptop/tablet, STAY AWAY from the Fujitsu TH700.Pros: The touch screen works okay after installing the driver update which came out two years into the product's very short life cycle.Cons: Where to begin:1. This system is not 100% reliable.  Sometimes when booting cold or after a hard shutdown, the laptop will not begin the booting process, but instead blink the three LED's located under the screen in some sort of error mode.  There is no way to fix this, other than to wait and cross your fingers.2. The touchscreen will not work out of sleep mode (maybe there is a driver fix somewhere, but the drivers from fujitsu do nothing to fix this.3.  My biggest problem is the LAN port failing.  I sent it in once after it failed and had it repaired, and it arrived unstable, but the service technician said there was nothing more they could do.  A year later the LAN port is now COMPLETELY USELESS, but Fujitsu offers a $555.00 repair fee for out of warranty devices.Fujitsu customer support was anything but helpful, and one higher up "customer support specialist" mocked me when I explained my case.Basically, the intel LAN driver failed after about a year of operation.  I sent it in and was told the problem was fixed.  Nine months later the same problem occurs, which leads me to believe it is consistently faulty hardware, and not just a lemon.  I called customer support only to be told the device was "wayy out of warranty *chuckle* and there is no way I will ever be able to get it repaired without paying $550.00".  I'm writing this review to let people know about the bad side of Fujitsu products and their customer support services. I can assure anyone who reads this I will never purchase or suggest another Fujitsu product.
