Purchased the A501 32 GB tablet.The item is fine just like it's A500 brethren.The only problem is that it is locked to AT&T; and it ships with an AT&T; card in it.Nowhere on the amazon product page it mentions AT&T.;Needless to say, trying to contact AT&T; for the Network Unlock SIM code - they were less than useless (it seems that they are trying to give a new meaning for useless).Acer support told me that the device should not be unlocked.After spending many hours contacting Amazon, Acer and AT&T;, I am returning this device. I do not want to use it with AT&T; and I see myself forced to return it.I will not return it and ask for a replacement just to see if it comes unlocked.I will save myself the trouble and return it for a refund.I gave it three stars since the product performance is good except that outside the AT&T; network is useless.Oh did I mention that I have been waiting for this particular model for over a month to be released??I am losing faith in Amazon. Although their return service is good. A little foot note on how the device ships with the ATT card in it and being locked will render it useless would have saved me a great deal of frustration.So I am frustrated with a product that is not doing exactly what it is supposed to do.Unlocking websites like gsmarena do not support this product - they cannot provide an unlock code.The AT&T; reps will not unlock the tablet for you.Acer ia clueless about the whole situation and the freaking answering machine that asks for the Serial Number is wasting your time big time and the tech support is clueless.I hope my experience saves you money, time and frustration.Cheers.P.S. I am getting the HP 8460p from Amazon for $200 more. It is a workhorse and comes with a SIM Card slot. UNLOCKED.
