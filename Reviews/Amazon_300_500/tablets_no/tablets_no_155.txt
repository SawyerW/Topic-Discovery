Caution: Ipad does not support Video playlist of any kind (music video/ podcast/ tv shows), means you can not configure to play 10 video clips to play one after another(it works just fine on Iphone) which also means when you are playing video forward button will never work...Got it on first day and usually using it every day, have iphone too, other than most of the usual known issues and features here are some which will help you to make a right decision...Ipad is perfect to watch a video...a video looks way better than any laptop you have...Speakers are low yes its true, I was expecting it to be little louder than iphone but it seems its just marginalFlickr/facebook all works so beautifully, this is a perfect device to show your picture portfolioused Slingplayer (iphone edition) and can say it works awesome with dishtv and slingbox solo, very clear...I use google newsreader for news and it works just fine (i dont like other newspaper apps very little content)Calender is looking good though event detail opens in very small screen which means not using the full screen available to display appointment better(iphone does)...appointment forward feature is not supported (iphone has same issue), any link (say for attending webmeeting) is not supported to click, means you have to copy the link test and open in safari to start webmeeting (iphone supports clicking http links directly) last snooze feature is not supported (iphone does not do it either and i hate iphone for not doing it, not sure how many times i missed a meeting because of that)Jump app is perfect for remote desktop...I would say just superb, I usually attend all my web meeting (ofcourse on flash) with that...audio transfer to IPAD works just fine, use it to access all office documents as wellOutlook mails do not get auto refresh, probably to save battery life (bad move from apple and I hate that)Netflix works superb though crash sometimes if you try to move fingers on screen when movie is playingMoving apps from iphone to ipad is breezeyoutube works very fine though playlist is still not supportedI am not looking to get 3G edition cause dont want to be bound by single carrier and 3g limitation (will buy cradlepoint PHS3000 travel router and use any usb modem with it to create wifi with 4G bandwith, it will save ipad battery life and allows 16 wifi devices, make sure you go for 4G version (hardware rev2 cost around $140))Ibooks/kindle both works very fine no issues here(well i am not a bigtime reader as well)Comics are just superb on IPAD...
