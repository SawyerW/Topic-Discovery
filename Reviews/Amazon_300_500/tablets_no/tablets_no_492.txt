I am writing this review from my HP Touchpad. I bought my husband the IPad 2 for a Christmas present, gave it to him early [1 week early], so it could be up and running for Xmas day. Well it will not print to our network that has an HP 4600dnt LaserJet printer, bummer. I have spent about 3 hours trying to figure out different apps to make it work. Fortunately he is not at this time a hard core tech, not even a small time one and might not really need to print anything, just play games. I have tried to figure out Air Print and it looks like it will only work with newer printers that have the program installed, so just be aware.Lot of money and appears to be better, easier up start products on the market. I think some Apple people are just so use to apple products and just don't know there are other quality, products that operate the same that are maybe half to 3/4's of the cost. It took me an hour just to figure out how to get a desktop on the Ipad. I had to hook up the Ipad to my pc then go to a website to download, I have never had to do that with any other product that wasn't an Apple product.Hopefully this helps someone that is on the fence with an Apple product.Update 12-26-2011. Well I have been every forum everywhere and have got just a load of info and wonderful people with lots of suggestions and man, this apple stuff is tough on compatibility even within it's own community. I have never cared for Apple products and nothing has changed.Thanks to all who have tried to help, just glad this belongs to my husband, who just wants to play games and see his racing forms.
