** Edit January 2014 **About two months ago the tablet dropped face-first onto a concrete floor.  Two huge long cracks on the center, and a sort of "spider-web" impact point crack in one of the corners.  Thought it was a gonner for sure!  After I put it back together (on impact, the back fell off and the battery dropped out), I decided to go ahead and turn it on to see what happens.Amazingly the tablet STILL WORKED!  Even the touch screen!  Other than a bit of an odd feeling when I pass my finger over the cracks on the screen, it works great.I finally got a replacement over Xmas.  Bought myself a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8inch, and the Thrive has been relegated to "backup tablet" when the Galaxy Tab runs out of juice.I still say I would have bought a new Thrive if they had updated it, oh well...*** Original Review below ***I purchased this tablet about a year ago.  At the time I wanted a tablet with a full-size USB and SD Card ports.  So is this tablet bigger than other tablets currently on the market?  You bet.But for that chunky-ness you get a lot of stuff.  Exceptional battery life (and the battery is user replaceable!), full size ports, dual core processor, a fair amount of Toshiba add-on accessories are available for purchase (I got a couple of the HDMI docking bays, as well as a car charger).Also, I abuse the heck out of my electronics, this tablet being no exception.  I use it with no case or screen protector of any kind, and it rattles around in various bags that I carry it around in, but yet it keeps on going strong.  I managed to put a big scrape on the front of it, but it hasn't had an effect on touchscreen at all.  It just keeps going and going.  Currently my favorite case for this is one from Targus, and seems to be designed for big tablets/small laptops, so no banging around any more.My only complaint is that it uses a round connector plug to connect the tablet to an AC power source instead of a micro USB port.  Also, both the home and car chargers for this unit have a big "brick" style transformer part in the middle, making it a pain to carry around.Charging time for this tablet is very fast with one of these chargers however.  Once plugged in, the battery takes about 2 hours to a full charge, and the battery life is great once it is finished.Too bad Toshiba stopped carrying these, as I would have loved to see an updated version.
