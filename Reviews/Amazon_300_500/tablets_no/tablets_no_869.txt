OK I agree with most of these reviews. Its fast, light and aesthetically it looks good. But, like many others, I'm sending mine back due to light bleed.  Lots of it!  If the new one is good (amazon is overnighting it to me) then I will definitely be keeping it and getting rid of my Galaxy Tab 7.7 (great tablet but I wanted a bigger screen and Samsung is too slow in upgrading the O/S).Couple of things worth knowing if you are buying this tablet...- you must format your external SD card as exFAT if you want full write access with 3rd party apps. Thanks to another reviewer for this tip.- battery life is OK, not great. People are claiming 6 - 8 hours depending on use, I'd say that's about right.- external speaker is good, when enhancements are turned on, but not great.  Does the trick for watching vids online but not ideal for enjoying music.Overall as long as I can get one with no (or minimal) light bleed, I will be happy with this tablet.*** update 23-May *****Got replacement tablet from Amazon.  Less light bleed but still there.  It honestly isn't a huge thing but for this kind of money I may give up on it and get the new ASUS or ACER that are coming out in June.  Not sure yet...*** update July 14 ***I returned the 2nd Toshiba and ended up getting a third. I ended up getting the 16gb version, still has some light bleed but nothing major. After checking out the new ACER and it's overheating issue and deciding I didn't want to wait for the new ASUS tf700 (or pay for it)  it came down to Toshiba or the new Google tablet but I didn't want to lose out on expandable storage.  I would have gotten the Toshiba 7.7 (I love the screen)  but the price is ridiculous. In the end, for the price I happy with the Toshiba.
