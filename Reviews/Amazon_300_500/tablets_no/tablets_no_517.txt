I have owned this product for about a month.  On the plus side, it is a nice e-reader with switchable day/night screens which make reading in daylight or dark a pleasant experience.  Battery life is good, I used it extensively on a 14-hour flight and only used half the battery life.  Of course, wifi was turned off in the aircraft, battery life would have been considerably shorter if wifi were on.  Screen is bright and sharp and easy to see. The product comes with a nice carrying case to protect it from damage so you don't need to buy one.  Good for playing simple games like Solitare.  The Kyros was shipped needing a firmware update and there is a nice video on the Coby website showing exactly how to install the update.  Worked for me on the first try.On the negative side, customer support is non-existent.  I emailed a question three weeks ago and haven't received a reply yet.  I tried calling the customer support number and there is no selection for the Kyros.  The touch screen is at times too sensitive and other times not sensitive enough.  Kyros owners have no access to the Android Market, so you can not get the best apps out there, only demo and trial versions and apps that weren't good enough for the Android Market.  I downloaded a demo version of an app and want to purchase the full-featured version but can't because it has to be purchased through the Android Market.  About 2/3 of the apps I have downloaded do not work at all on the Kyros or do not work properly.  At times, I am unable to connect to free wifi services, even when I am sitting within 5 feet of the router.Better than nothing if this is all you can afford but I would recommend saving up until you find a tablet pc that is more than a toy.
