I've had the Toshiba Thrive (8gb version) for about 6 months now and I absolutely love it! The battery life is ridiculous (in a good way!) I can watch a few hours of movies a day and it will last me about 2 days before needing a charge. I love the ports and SD card slot as well (my main reason for purchasing). I just took this on a trip to NY and loaded up movies on an SD card for the plane trip, transferred pictures from my camera's SD card to the internal memory to give me more picture space, and transferred files from one SD card to another using a USB adapter for the 2nd card. Heck, if I wanted to, I could have hooked it up to the hotel TV via HDMI. For those that say the ports are outdated, I just used all of them in one weekend trip, and I wouldn't have been able to do what I needed to do any other way! The battery lasted about a day and a half after my 3 hour plane trip with movies playing via SD the entire time, some WiFi surfing in the hotel room, and transferring my files. I got it charged up again in about an hour. You can't beat that. So if you're going on a trip (for leisure), leave the laptop, you just need the Thrive for anything you need.On a side note, I have a NAS at home with my media stored on it. With the Thrive, I accessed the desktop version of my NAS while waiting in the airport and transferred a movie to my SD card. I can even watch any movie stored on my NAS on my Thrive (when there is WiFi available) from anywhere using the Skifta app.So if you're a media junkie like me and want a lightweight portable computer, the Thrive is just what you need!
