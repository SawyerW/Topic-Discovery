I'm a female techy, so this is in effort to inform those that may not be as savvy as myself. In some ways call my review biased, call me a hypocrite, but whose ever 100% about anything nowadays? Anything Apple is a great investment. I own a new MacBook Pro, I phone 4, iPod and many more. Which makes Apple products and exceptional buy for their quality devices at a steal of a deal where they have a sale. I just wanted to be up to par with technology getting the ipad 2, just to stay ''I own one '', however there are no true differences in my first generation ipad 3G to my second generation non-3G ipad 2. It doesn't have a quality camera like the iphone 4 and still no flesh player. If you want more freedom and full use on ANY site, buy a different branded tablet for your needs like an android. the only obvious changes are 3G on Verizon's network, cameras and new color  (white), the device still remains weighted in ones hand as well as bit slick. It's honestly not enough changes for one to feel the need to upgrade unless money isn't a factor. Apple's lineup changes yearly , so if don't own one yet or are looking to upgrade still, just hang on few more months for the ipad 3. best buy has a buy back program so you could also trade in and apply the value of your pre-owned to purchase of a newer model with more memory/features. still great battery life like anything  Apple, there is no other electronic brand like them. If you invest in the iPad (1 or 2 ), set aside funds to buy a quality protective casing and screen protector because Apple's ''limited'' warranty in deeds limits you, it is NOT ''insurance'' for accidental damage so you should wisely choose a 3rd party warranty like best buys to replace or repair if water damage, glass shattering or worse occurs. there's a warranty out there for everyone that doesn't want to shell out nearly a grand for replacement ipad plus more if you need one jailbreak.
