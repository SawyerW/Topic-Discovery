I think of myself as being pretty tech savvy when it comes to new toys, so it really frustrated me when my new Elocity tablet didn't immediately jump out of the box, acknowledge my awesomeness, and do everything I was thinking it should be able to do based upon its specs. There is definitely a very steep learning curve to the Elocity A7 even if you are used to Android 2.2, because of its lack of 3G/4G support or the Android Market. Fortunately, it happened to be a short, steep learning curve, and I can happily say that we are getting along quite nicely now. While Amazon's app store is more limited than the Android Market, it is WAY better than the stock app store, and I have found most of the apps I want with only one racing type game which seems to have issues. The eReaders are great, and the processor and browser keep pace with everything I have thrown at them so far. Customer service is not the greatest, but that seems to be par for the course these days, and the camera is embarrassing (think along the lines of your first camera phone). Even so, at half the price of the big name brand tablets with many of the same specs it is worth it. The tablet itself is exactly the same size and shape of the Nook Color (in fact I bought a Nook Color cover for mine); however, it is thicker and twice as heavy. Hopefully its added weight is indicative of quality components. Regardless, it is great having an Android tablet that is small enough to be shoved into a large pocket, and large enough to type on even if you have big ol' meat sticks for fingers at a price that the wife will not kill you for.Hopefully this helps.
