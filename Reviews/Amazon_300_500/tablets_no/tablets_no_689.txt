I bought this tablet with high expectations from the many reviews I read regarding a multitude of tablets.  I would agree that this is a great product for around $200.  It is definitely not an iPad, but I would recommend this product to people who prefer the Android system or are on a budget.  I have an Android phone so I figured this would be a fine operating system.  The Le Pan has the real Android market so that is a major plus.  I had trouble connecting the Le Pan to my Wifi and required Tech Support from my Internet company before being able to use the Le Pan where as I do not experience this with my iPod touch device.  I will say that Le Pan provided me with excellent customer service.  They got back to me the same day and called me even though I contacted them via e-mail.  They helped me the best they could and were willing to provide further assistance if the issue had not turned out to be my Internet provider.  I have had the Le Pan only a few days and already it has frozen a few times and the only way I can fix it is by using a bobby pin to reset the tablet.  I find this a little concerning because its only been a few days whereas my iPod software I rarely encounter freezing in years of ownership.  I have also had an issue with some software regarding books not being available because of the Android operating system.  The tablet does ofter excellent speed, a vibrant screen, and a clean overall look almost exactly as the iPad.  I will say the tablet is quite heavier than I expected but I have a feeling that using a stylus will solve some of the strain.  Overall I would say this a good quality product for the price and the customer service gives the Le Pan extra points.  I hope I continue to enjoy my tablet as much as I have since I bought it.Update:  I have now had my Le Pan for a longer time and it has only got better.  It stopped freezing and now works rather well.  I have had no more issues with it since the first few days.
