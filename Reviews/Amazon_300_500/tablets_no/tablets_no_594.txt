This touchpad was a huge disappointment. Graphically, it has severe aliasing problems which makes it look like a cheap electronics toy from 15 years ago.The viewing angle is horribly poor; you need to be directly over the screen to see anything, which makes the glare issue even worse.The display does not rotate to portrait mode, which is exacerbated by the odd aspect ratio at a resolution of 1024 x 600 (it's not an existing film ratio, so what were they aiming for exactly?)On top of that, the unit is unnecessarily thick and the construction very cheap; the back panel for example is a flimsy piece of plastic.User Interface of web browsing is terrible as the url / web toolbar takes up a fourth of the screen space and the only way to hide this is to enter "fullscreen" mode by un-intuitively pressing and holding down on the screen for 5 seconds and then selecting the "fullscreen" icon...The company Tap n' Tap, who wrote the software, has done a horrible job, with most of the user's inputs requiring multiple taps. I think the company knows this and chose their name as joke: Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap....I really wanted to like this. I desperately wanted to like this, because I'm so tired of Apple and the iPad. But I'm so disappointed by this touchpad. The iPad has a very clear branding, a very clear product line. No matter what, you know that iPad 2 is better than iPad 1. And when iPad 3 comes out, you know it will be better than the previous two. Not so with this one. By name, you cannot distinguish between the: "Viewsonic gTablet" and the "ViewSonic ViewPad". Which one is better? Which one came first? Why is one called "tablet" and the other "pad"?Can someone other than Apple come up with a competitive, good-quality touchpad that is part of a consolidated, sensical product line? Please?
