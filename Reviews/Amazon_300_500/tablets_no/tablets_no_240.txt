I technically give this product 4 1/2 stars, but because of the rating system on Amazon 5 will suffice.So the big controversy is should I buy a Motorola Xoom or an Apple iPad? I obviously chose the Xoom and here are my reasons why.For $599 I get better hardware than the similarly priced iPad2 32gb version. For example, a dual core Nvidia Tegra chip which runs at 1ghz vs the A5's 800mhz per core. Superior front and rear camera that can record in HD and has a flash built in as well as digital zoom ( along with a nice toggle for lighting options and video/photo effects ). A higher resolution screen. A built in HDMI out and access to my files stored on the Xoom without having to use extra software ie iTunes. Strong and resilient Gorilla Glass. And the option to use different file formats, namely flac and avi through apps in the marketplace.The Operating System on the Xoom is more of a user interface than iOS is and Honeycomb has been around a month, while iOS is almost at 5. I can switch between different tasks effortlessly on the fly and the browsing is phenomenal compared to Safari on iPad. I've got 5 "deskspaces" that I can customize to my liking and everything feels smooth and natural. The virtual keyboard is very good, but I suggest that you purchase a thumb keyboard...it makes things flow that much better. ( I feel one step closer to the computers used in Minority Report ). Also, Flash support!!!!It does need more apps, and I mean Honeycomb Android specific apps. Although, that's not primarily why I purchased a tablet, it's something the detracts from the whole tablet experience when considering the general consensus.I feel like the Xoom and the iPad may both be tablets but when I think of what I want in a tablet, the Xoom is closer to what I have in mind.For the record I do own an iPad as well. It's good, but I like the Xoom better.
