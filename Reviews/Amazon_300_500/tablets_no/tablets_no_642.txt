I have been using Android devices for three years and have been satisfied with the way the software and the applications continue to advance for this platform. I recently debated over purchasing an iPad II or an Android tablet and found that there were many variations in the latter devices. My phone and a 7" Dell tablet I own both run Android and I have used and grown fond of many of the applications available for Android so I leaned heavily in that direction.A search of available tablets led me to the Toshiba and I was thrilled to find that the tablet not only had the same functionality as many of the other tablet iterations but it came with some thoughtful additions as well. The biggest pluses for the Thrive were the additional ports and the memory card slot that really helped me expand the capabilities of the device. I am able to plug in a memory card for an additional 16GB of storage space and I can swap out with any other memory card of the same format, such as the one from my Dell tablet. I can also plug my 70GB back up drive that is a few years old and swap files in both directions in order to get the content I want on the Thrive.As for the device itself, it has an attractive screen with very nice resolution, plays the media I want to see when I want to see it and has a robust but not exhausting weight that makes me feel like it is a quality item. I chose the 8GB model to keep the investment down while knowing full well I can add a larger memory card later or easily swap out one card for the other without loss of time synching over a cable. I've found the device fun to play games on, easy to browse the web using the Firefox browser application and productive using the installed office software. I even went ahead and tried the printing application that came native to the device; impressive and thrilled with that capability too!While I have not explored every capability of the device, I will say that I am very happy with the purchase and look forward to the excellent service I know it will provide to me.Nicely done, Toshiba, a tablet in MY price range with the functionality I desire!
