I previously wrote a review on this so called tablet. For some reason Amazon did not publish the review. I suspect that Amazon is trying to push this tablet by publishing as many rave reviews as possible and discard as many negative reviews as possible. I wrote in my previous review that purchased this tablet on July 20, 2011. I returned the tablet to Amazon on the same day it arrived after I tinkered with it for a few hours. My experience with it was absolute disappointment. The machine was very slow to start. The touch screen was hardly responsive. I had to tab an icon several times before it function. The screen did not rotate. The software that came with it was useless and it took ages to load. The internet took extremely long time to come on. The keyboard that came with it was useless. The tablet is as heavy if not heavier than a typical netbook. I have a netbook with an Intel Atom processor, which I purchased two years ago. The netbook appeared lighter than this tablet. It is more portable and more practical to use. I could serve the internet much faster on it than on this tablet. I could run several programs on it that I am sure I could not run on this tablet, etc. I completely agree with the reviewer who wrote:"This item should not be listed as a tablet. The best description should be a netbook with detachable touch screen. The tablet is the slowest loading solid state drive I have ever seen. Window 7 is not designed for touch screen use it takes a double punch to activate most icons on the screen. Sure you can change the program, but who wants to go to the trouble, and who wants to delete the bloatware, and update the system just to make it run with some speed. The internet access was so slow it would timeout trying to load apps such as Kindle. This product weighs 3.48 pounds with the keyboard.If you want a tablet to do what a tablet was designed to do, do not waste your money on this product. If you want a bulky, heavy, slow, netbook than be my guest".
