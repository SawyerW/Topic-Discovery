I work at a technical college, instructing research, and let me give you a perspective from watching students use this in class.Amazing !!The device is easy to carry, easy to store, is easy on batteries, is very fast, it had adaptors that allow you to connect to projectors and external devices. The presentation software is stunningly beautiful and sensitivity a pleasure to operate. Students can, for a relatively small fee, have a research tool in their hands.This gem lets students research the worlds online literature, create an e-book shelf with the obvious access to volumes of books within each of their shelves, and create reports from these sources (can attach a keyboard), and present findings to the class via projector or world via the internet. It feels like a self containing research unit.  Can even take, work with, and share images with it.Disadvantages would include the lack of a port to external memory - but although not ideal files can be e-mailed to another system and backed-up this way (there is always a way around). Other in this form have also listed more technical disadvantages - so be sure to roam these. Sure, it will be upgraded in the future but this is nothing new in the computational world as Moore's Law (computer capacity doubles every 18 months) is still in full swing.Ultimately for the price, this is a bargain. It is the way of the future and laptops will probably be leaving us in the future as such devices replace them, perhaps not in the immediate future, but soon. For as little as $5-600 you can place this gem in your bag and be on the go. Don't even require the old "lap-top" carry bag! People would not even know you have it.What a technological hit !!!!! And success !!!!!
