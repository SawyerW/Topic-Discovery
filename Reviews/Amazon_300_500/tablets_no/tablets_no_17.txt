I really wanted to like the Nexus 7.  I'm not an Apple fan because I think their stuff is overpriced.  But I'm disappointed.I like the feel of the Nexus.  The beveled edges and rubber backing make it easy to hold.  The screen looks great.  Sound isn't bad at all.But there are things I don't like.  One problem is that you can't log out of gmail.  This is probably the most noticeable problem with using a smartphone OS for a tablet.  You don't share your phone, but a tablet is something that not every member of a household might have.  It's a perfect thing to leave on a coffee table that anyone can pick up.  While I'm happy to have other people use my tablet to surf the web or check their email, I don't want them having access to my email account or the ability to download apps without a password.  It's an example of Google not seeming to understand why anyone would care about privacy.  There are paid apps that will put a password on other apps, but they all seem to be laughably easy to get around, even accidentally.  Even if they worked well though, this is a problem that shouldn't need an app to solve.The other thing I hate is the battery life, especially on standby.  It seems like this thing always needs to be charged.  I tested it recently: I fully charged it and then left it on standby without touching again.  It was dead in less than 48 hrs.Another problem with the battery is that you can't easily close programs. You have to go through an indirect force closing process.  If I'm going to be on a long trip, I'd like to be able to squeeze every minute out of my battery, but the Nexus makes it hard to do that.Final annoyance: the home button isn't a physical button but a virtual one that's always on.  It's really easy to accidentally brush that button while playing a game.  That gets annoying.I don't hate the Nexus 7.  It's just needs better battery performance and some OS adjustments that recognize the difference between tablets and phones.
