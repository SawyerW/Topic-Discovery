The HP Slate 500 is one of my favorite tablets, in fact for my needs I prefer it to my work iPad that I have used over the past year. In my opinion the best thing about the Slate is that it is a tablet that works like any computer with a Microsoft operating system. I was even able to get mine tuned-up by remote technical support (which isn't possible on most tablets) because it has Windows 7 Professional as its OS.I love the fact that is has a 64GB hard drive giving me plenty of space for my Bible Explorer, Christian Library, Microsoft Office, Photos & basically everything I keep on my lap top (which is much of what I keep on my desk top).I have two wireless printers connected to this little dynamo, which were installed quickly & easily.The HP Slate 500 has 2GB of Ram &  with the Inntel Atom processor I find it at ease running multiple programs on it.It's also great to browse the internet, check & send emails, create documents & I especially like reading my Kindle books on it.The Slate 500 is a surprisingly fast little tablet - no, it's not like a laptop with 8GB of RAM and an Intel i7 processor, but it's pretty impressive for a tablet. The 8.9" screen is bright, clear and reabable in any lighting condition I have encountered. The battery life  (at about 5 hours per charge) is not the greatest, as my net book gives me over 10 hours a charge & my lap top provides me with 8, however it has not been a problem for me, as I've yet to need to be unplugged for that amount of time.The (included) digital pen cursor (runs on one AAAA battery) is a must and the dock is a great aid, with additional USB ports which come in handy.I'm someone who has avoided tablets, because I prefer a traditional keyboard, however the HP Slate 500 is the one tablet that I truly enjoy using, and this is being written over 3 years after the Slate's original release date.
