Been holding out for a good Android tablet that can match iPad2's size, weight, thickness, and elegance.  Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (wow that is a mouthful for a name) has delivered spectacularly.I had the tablet for almost a week now and I don't know how I lived without one before.  The size and thickness is truly amazing, as I compared this with my roommate's shiny new iPad2.  It was just a hair thinner and a hair lighter than the ipad2.  I love the widescreen since I usually watch videos on the pad, and the extra horizontal space is great for apps like Gmail and Pulse where you can have the index on the left and the content on the right without feeling cramped at all.The Honeycomb 3.1 addition of "saving webpages for offline viewing" works amazingly well.  I'm the type that opens 200 tabs on my Firefox and never get to reading them because I get tired of sitting in front of the desktop.  Well, now when I travel or when I'm in bed, I can browse through all the websites I want and just save the ones I don't get to for later reading.I do wish that Android supported Netflix or Hulu, but I don't use those two services that much, so it doesn't affect me.  For my uses, being able to see video reviews on websites (yay Flash) and get the full website experience on a great Google Chrome browser is well worth not having Netflix.  Plus, I can just rip my own DVDs and transfer them onto the tab to watch.  IT plays pretty much every video file I've thrown at it so far.In short, if you are an Android or Google user, this tablet is a no brainer.  If you use Apple products, but want to try something where you can customize the device a lot more, then give it a try.
