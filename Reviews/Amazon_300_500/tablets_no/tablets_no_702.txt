I have had my LePan II for over three months now and have had very little problems. For my purposes, it is a very nice tablet. I check my emails, surf the internet, and have downloaded games and other apps. I wasn't crazy about the volume rocker and downloaded volume in notification from the Play Store. Works great.....no more fiddling with the volume rocker! I have found a couple of games that downloaded fine but didn't load....Temple Run was one of them. Bummer! Not sure if it's the tablet or the app. I also have transferred movies and music from my notebook to the tablet and they play fine. You may have to check around the Play Store for the best video players to play your movies .........some will play one format smoothly but not the other. I have a 32gb micro sd card for storage which really makes enjoying the tablet nice.For the time I've have it, I have had to reset it twice. I never had a wi-fi problem but since the v118 update it sometimes disconnects after being in sleep mode a long time. At first I panicked but now neither of these two things turned out to be a big deal (so far) to me.  I just either re-connected to wi-fi or powered down and restarted. The only thing I'm waiting for now is the HDMI cable to be available and the HDMI option to re-appear back in settings.I know people are concerned about the upgrade to ICS. I'm not familiar with ICS so I don't know how much the upgrade will improve the performance of the LePan II.  For the time being Honeycomb has fulfilled most of my needs.Check out the Le Pan Life Forum for a ton of info on the LePan. Overall, a nice tablet for the money!!
