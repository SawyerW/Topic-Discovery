I did my research before buying this tablet. I bought it because the price was good and I figured if I hated the buyer's regret wouldn't be a high as if I bought an ipad. I have used an ipad before. It was meh. This came available and when I heard it was a hacker's dream I figure I didn't mind trying hacking if I needed to.Out of the box is a disaster I will agree with the 1 star folks on that. However, once you run the update it's a little bit better. I decided to see how long I could maintain just using the stock OS that came with the tablet. I lasted about a week. The lack of Google Market really made getting the apps I wanted difficult. Using the handango was hit or miss; amazon's marketplace app helped some. But this hide and seek method of getting apps and getting them to work got old quickly.So after much YouTube viewing and forum asking, I rooted it and put another rom on there. It was like night and day, suddenly I had Google Market, most apps weren't force-quitting on me. I even switched out to another rom that I like even more than my first rooted attempt. The device runs smoothly; apps that were closing early on stock started working and I enjoy my tablet.Yes, viewing angles can annoy but you just need to tilt it just so and you're fine. The wireless works great. I've tested the wifi from home and at work with no ill effects. There is no gps in this, so google maps only work via your wifi location which is fairly accurate. The video viewing is rather nice, but it is limited to what kind of files you can use. There are speakers that they are not bad as long as your hand isn't over the speaker ports. The camera is meh. I think it's 1.3Mp which takes grainy shots, but I don't plan to use the camera much so it is not an issue for me.Overall if you are willing to tweak your device you will have tons of fun with it. If you leave it in it's natural state, it is probably more work than you may want to spend getting it to do what you want.
