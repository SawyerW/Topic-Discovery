For what price most tablet netbook PCs are running for, this was the most reasonable. I love the portability and convenience of a netbook. I find most of the pre-installed lenovo programs are somewhat useless to me because they do not seem to be a shortcut or easier way to complete a task. however, the lenovo quickstart program is handy, when i have to look up something on the net, i don't have to wait for the system to boot & do the whole start-up process.I installed windows 7 premium and it significantly increased the touch screen function! it seemed to me that 7starter did not incorporate the use of the multitouch function in everyday programs such as a web browser. The touch screen's response is similar to that of an iphone (using the ball of your finger rather than a pinpoint of a stylus) It makes it easier to do things on a netbook (which usually come with a small mousepad) such as copy, drag, drop, scroll, flick, etc.I like the idea i have options with the swivel screen. I can use it as a conventional netbook as well as a tablet. There is an on-screen keyboard available, but for when i have more intensive typing to do, all i have to do is flip the screen up and swivel it around to have access to the keyboard (which has large keys to my surprise.)the processor could use a little more power behind it. just a little. from time to time I experience slight pauses while streaming video, scrolling web pages, and switching between programs (even with power saving settings to the max). My primary needs from this computer are to access internet, check/maintain email & social sites, use the ms office suite, quickbooks -- all on the go. And it does those things. I highly recommend upgrading the windows 7 starter. Other than that, I am pleased with my purchase.
