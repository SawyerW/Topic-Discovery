PLEASE!PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!I AM AN ADROID LOVER AND WHEN I FOUND THIS TABLET I COMPARED ITS SPECS TO OTHER DROID TABLETS AND THE IPAD. I DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT AFTER READING ALL OF THE REVIEWS AND THE SPECS BASED ON THE PRICE. I PURCHASED THIS TABLET IN DECEMBER OF 2011 AND IT WORKED WELL FROM WHAT I COULD SEE AT THE ONSET OF USING IT. THEN AROUND FEBRUARY 2012 THE POWER BUTTON WOULD NOT WORK SO WHEN THE SCREENSAVER CAME ON I WOULD HAVE TO RESET IT. THEN THE RESET BUTTON STOPPED WORKING. I TRIED TO CALL LEPAN SUPPORT AND NEVER WAS ABLE TO REACH ANYONE BESIDES THE VOICEMAIL AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY CALL. I ENDED UP SENDING LEPAN SUPPORT AN EMAIL AND POSTING A COMPLAINT ON MY SUPPORT VIA THE WEBSITE.  THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE CREATING AN RMA NUMBER AND TO SHIP IT BACK TO THEM BUYER COST (AT MY COST ON TOP OF THE INCONVENIENCE). I NEVER GOT A STATUS UPDATE FROM THEM, I ALWAYS HAD TO EMAIL THEM AND THEY SAID 2-3 WEEKS.  I SENT THE TABLET VIA PRIORITY MAIL WITH A SIGNATURE AND I KNOW THEY RECEIVED THE TABLET March 26, 2012 TODAY IS SUNDAY APRIL 22,2012 AND I HAVE YET TO GET AN UPDATE ABOUT THE TABLET! I HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND OR A NEW TABLET. I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING INTO MY LEGAL RIGHTS AS FAR AS GETTING ALL OF MY MONEY BACK INCLUDING THE MONEY FOR SHIPPING AND SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY JUST GO TO APPLE AND BUY A 16GB IPAD2 FOR 399 BECAUSE ATLEAST IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH IT YOU WILL HAVE PROMPT AND COURTEOUS SERVICE AND NOT THIS CIRCUS OF A COMPANY WALKING AWAY WITH ALMOST $300 FOR A KNOCK OFF!IF YOU BUY IT DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED!
