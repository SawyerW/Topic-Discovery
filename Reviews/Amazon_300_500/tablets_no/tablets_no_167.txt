While I and my spouse enjoy this tablet, it definitely isn't for everybody. In fact if I didn't have my computer genius husband around it wouldn't be something I could easily use and I'm constantly on my netbook, Ipod Touch, smart phone, ect. This is because this tablet is glitchy as heck and has a somewhat outdated version of android on it.There's about to be a glut of android tablets on the market. This one has led the way but a lack of updating isn't going to make it user friendly. The built in software is adequate but there are a number of flaws. There are two music players on it, the better of which does not contain a random play/shuffle. The screen calibration never seems to calibrate correctly. The wi-fi is glitchy at best, dropping connection at random. The built in app store is not the default android marketplace but a custom built Archos exclusive which results in a lot of android apps not being available to the Archos tablet. The sleep doesn't function properly on it, either refusing to go to sleep or waking randomly and startlingly, sucking the battery dry. The only real way to conserve the battery is to turn it off. It does not charge from USB.On the positive side there is a good fan user base which can be employed to remove the restriction to get the default android marketplace and put Google apps onto the tablet. The browsers adequate which makes it a good portable internet device. It's solidly built with a nice kick stand. The built in speaker is decent if you want to listen to music without attaching speakers to it, although at louder volume it can be a bit tinny. Video is good quality picture. Played a 480p xvid avi file without difficulty or stuttering.You'll want to download a task/ application killer to close out applications easy if you get this tablet.
