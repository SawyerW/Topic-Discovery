I originally bought the Viewsonic G-Tablet but took it back because it sucked so bad in every way. Then i tried the Archos 101 and it was no better, maybe worse so I sold it on ebay. Then i ordered a Notion Ink Adam and that was a disaster from the beginning. I won't get into the whole adam fiasco too much but after waiting 2 months I got a defective unit, it took another 6 weeks to get my replacement. I was no longer interested in it after almost 4 months so I bought the xoom. I really love Honeycomb and the build quality. Here are a short list of pros and cons for me personally:Pros:-1200x800 resolution, very nice screen-very solid device-Honeycomb-hdmi output-battery life is insane-tegra 2-2 cameras-GPS-Bluetooth-saved $200 by getting the wifi only model-browser is great, very similar to chrome with the tabsCons:-internal storage does not mount usb in ubuntu(main problem for me right now)-screen gets smudged way too easily(ordered screen protector from sgpstore.com, awesome screen protectors)-no full usb 2.0 host(although it can be enabled with a minor hack and an adapter)-sd slot not active yet(update coming soon to enable i hope, would really help with my ubuntu problem)-power/wake button is on the bottom so you have to lift the xoom up every time you want to wake it up(minor)-price tag still too high even for wifi onlyoverall I really like my wifi xoom. I have never owned an ipad so I can't compare it to an ipad like people like to do so often. with all the bad luck I've had with tablets lately I was fully prepared to be returning this within its 14 day return period, if it was too buggy or I was very unhappy with it. I'm happy to say that right now I plan on keeping it and am very happy with it. I would just advise people that are looking to get a tablet to pay the extra money and get a tablet approved by google rather than a budget tablet that you will most likely not be happy with.
