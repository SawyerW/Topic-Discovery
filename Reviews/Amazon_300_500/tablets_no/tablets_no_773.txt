I bought this have had had it for a couple days.  Overall it's a great reader with some extras.  I have a 30 day return policy and I'm still arguing with myself if I want to return this or not.  I would suggest if you are going to buy this buy it from a place that has a 30 day return policy and you can easily get your money backPro'sGood reader (day/night mode)Borders app installed (I am partial to Borders)nice email applicationGood web access(see cons regarding youtube/flash).great touch screen, very responsiveGood customer service via phone and email (sucks I had to call and email)expandable memory up to 32 GB, comes with 4 GB and 8 GB SD cardWireless NI usually get 10-15 hours of battery life split between reading, movies, music, websurfing etc.Plays movies, need to convert them from whatever you have movies as on your PC to MPEG 4Great price for what it does, from my research it's the best under 300.00 thing out there that calls itself a tablet.  However if you want the full PC experience and don't want an IPAD suggest you wait for something other than the Cruz and be willing to fork over more cash.con'sNo 3GNo youtube or flash, even the free flash app doesn't work great, has an add watermarked over the video.  The skyfire (skyfire.com) web browser offers a better video experience but still nothing like Windows.No access to Android MarketCruz market has as many apps as I can count on my handsAndroid 2.0 OS with no intention to upgradeHad to reset it 3 times my first 2 dayNo user manual you can find it online, or download the manual to your tabletCan not get the Kindle app installed for whatever reason. I use Borders however I am writing a reveiw on Amazon so figured Kindle maybe important to some peopleIt's a weird hook up to your PC.  I still have XP and you have to plug in the tablet then on the tablet click a "Mount" button.  The PC does not automatically recognize the device.No accessories yet.
