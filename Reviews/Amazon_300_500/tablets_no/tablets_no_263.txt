After almost 4 weeks with the Xoom, I must admit that I'm quite impressed! Its great for watching movies and TV shows (those functions are not available outside the US, however), books, and of course APPS!!! Whats even better is that I have 10 hours of battery life to enjoy it! The recent ICS update (no other tablet besides the xoom and transformer prime has it as of yet!) was a great improvement for the Xoom, as it is now a lot faster and looks a lot cooler! When I first got it I was concerned about weight due to past reviewers. I was actually surprised to find it so light! My sister has an IPad2 and its barely a quarter of a pound lighter! The Xoom is great for school as there are TONS of note-taking and organization apps on the Android Market available (my favorite is ClassBuddyPro)! There is also a large selection of casual and hard core games too, In fact I just bought MC3 on sale for 0.99! The only thing about the Xoom that I'm dissatisfied with is the amount of apps that are specifically designed for tegra honeycomb/ics tabs. Also, I've heard complaints about not being able to charge with a micro USB cable, and while it may be inconvenient, the charging time is a mere hour! Overall BUY this product (the Xyboard or Xoom 2 is actually slower and more buggy than the original - yet 300 bucks more) today!!!PS: I got the Xoom Protective case as well as the gel one and they work just fine. I also got Targus CleanVu Cleaning Pads for Apple iPad, iPad 2, iPhone, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry Playbook TXA00212US and they are great to remove the fingerprints and dust that is attracted to your tab! Oh, and if you want to expand your media storage you can pick up an Amazon Basics 16gb card for about $15! I also typed the review with Thumb Keyboard - a must have app for writing! I bought the tab through Blu - tek USA and the Xoom came in great condition!
