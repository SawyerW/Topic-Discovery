Okey-dough-key!  Received this product on Friday and had the weekend to fiddle with it.  Before this one I had the Tomtom 730 which the only two things that stuck out negative was the battery life (super bad) and the bulkiness of it (not that bad though).  The size of the 1435tm is compact. I will not leave this in my car when it fits so nicely in my coat pocket even with the suction cup attached! Unfortunately with compact comes a speaker. I must agree with some reviews that when using the bluetooth, it will be a little difficult to hear a caller with music in the car. I don't like the speaker at all but can live with it. I had to lower the radio and even close the window to be satified. The device is slick though!  I like it!  The device will not only get you to your destination but will tell you if it's on the right side or left.  Nice for those places that don't have #'s on them! The suction cup attached to it for placing on the window is easy to mount and sturdy. I was traveling from Queens to Brooklyn on the BQE and noticed that the device was leading me off the hightway and wondered why??  I just followed along and found that if I would have stayed on the highway I would have been stuck in traffic!!  I could see ahead that the traffic was major backed up.  It diverted me through local streets which was fine with me instead of being stuck!  I thought "this is great!"  I still don't know how well this battery holds up and hope its better than the 730go.  The touch screen is simple and it seems that after it gets dark the screen automatically changes to night time.  It happened to mine. This is my immediate review on this product but as Arnold would say, "I'll be BACK!"  BTW:  The most I would pay for this is $110 or less!  That's my unbias oppinion.  PS: So far, I hate Garmin!
