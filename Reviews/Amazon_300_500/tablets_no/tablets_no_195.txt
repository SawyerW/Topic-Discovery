I got my Ideapad today and so far I REALLY like it. ( Windows 7 Home Premium / 1GB RAM / ~230GB hdd)I am careful when flipping the screen from tablet to Netbook but it seems pretty sturdy.  I played with the various VeriTouch/VeriFace tools they have like face recognition and touchpad password to log in.  They both work well however, it's faster to just type in the password on the keyboard IMO.  I had a hard time figuring out which RAM I had in order to upgrade it even after opening up the case to look at what was there. To my surprise, I had DDR3 ( Samsung M471B2873FHS - CH9 which is 1GB 1Rx8 PC3-10600 SODIMM ) After research I ordered CT25664BC1339 Crucial Technologies Memory for ~$25usd ( it is a single 2GB module ). Be careful because some of these Netbooks supposedly have DDR2. You must make sure you get the right one.My primary laptop is a Core2 DUO P8400 with 4GB RAM running 64bit Windows 7 so....... this Netbook is slow to me but.... it's also 25% of the weight and size....which is why I bought it. I don't expect it to have the horsepower but it was respectively responsive with the 1GB RAM so I expect it'll do slightly better once I get 2GB into it and satisfy the need I had for getting a Netbook.I used the touch pad to draw and scribble in the 'Paint' utility and then with the "Lenovo Maplife' program which is like a Google Earth application. It did well with both applications in single touch and multi-touch mode like on an iPhone/iPad so, I'm pretty content with the touchpad capability so far. Again, set realistic expectations, it is an ATOM 455 NOT a Core2Duo...it has some lag but it's not unusably slow.Appearance wise....... it is a VERY sharp unit although the top is a fingerprint magnet and the white keyboard..... ( yea, what were they thinking ) is very eye catching but...I see lots of cleaning in the future.All-in-all..... I like my new toy and will REALLY appreciate using it on short business trips instead of my 6+lb laptop.
