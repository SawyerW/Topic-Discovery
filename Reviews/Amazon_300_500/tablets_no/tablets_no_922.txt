With a 7" format, dual band wifi and built in gps, the Blackberry Playbook is the perfect companion for people on the road. As of this writing, the 64g version is heavily discounted by as much as $450 and considering the quality and rising number of available applications, it is an excellent deal for anyone planning to use a portable tablet.As compared to the others, the Playbook's screen holds up in terms of brightness, crispness of text and smoothness of media playback. Two front facing speakers provide the volume and high fidelity not found in the more expensive units. The QNX OS employs more touch commands and one has to be more aware of this at first but just a few days of constant use will make the user feel at ease as the experience is retained in memory.One should experience the ability to record video at high definition, the screen is just the right size and brightness that allows the viewing of the scenes in real time. Playback is equally as impressive and video files can be easily exported as attachments to e-mail and sent via wi-fi.Though not heavily advertized, the Playbook is capable of communicating in two different frequencies because of its built-in dual band wifi hardware. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out the first time the tablet was turned on for its initial setup. The newer 5ghz band is faster and ideal for media streaming from a wireless network server or storage.Applications are still scarce but new ones are starting to appear and participation of new users could encourage the development and porting of additional softwares. However, it must be emphasized that the Playbook comes with a set of applications that makes the tablet useful as a productivity tool and with the addition of applications  that provide gps navigation, internet access, wireless file management and media playback, the need for additional programs such as games and entertainment becomes secondary.
