I will state that I never intend to purchase an Apple product, ever.  That being said, I looked around for a while before deciding on purchasing the BB tablet.  Besides the Kindle Fire, you won't find another 32gb tablet from a major manufacturer on the market selling for less than $200.  I considered the Fire, but after reading reviews, determined it is more oriented towards media consumption (NetFlix, Kindle, music, that type of stuff).  The PlayBook is more oriented to business/travel, with lots of integrated tools (like conversion app, a scientific calculator, documents to go, etc).  Since I intend on using my PlayBook for "mobile computing" while traveling, it seemed like a better fit.I haven't used my PlayBook exhaustively yet, but I am very impressed by it's long battery life.  I literally took it off charging at 10am today and used it all day to write emails, read magazine articles, Google things, and play chess, yet over 12 hours later still had 60% of my battery.With the site goodereader.com, you can put Android apps on your PlayBook.  This is on top of the BlackBerry "App World".  That means you have access to the most apps of any tablet, since Android has the most and you get BlackBerry's on top of that.The predictive text on the PlayBook is excellent- it greatly speeds up the process of writing things.  I would actually say I am nearly as quick in composing things on the PlayBook as I am by typing on a keyboard.Altogether, the "controls" on the keyboard are fairly intuitive.  They are similar to what the Palm Pre used, and mostly involve "swiping" things.  You can have quite a few things running concurrently, and just cycle through them as is convenient for you.The internet access on the PlayBook is almost exactly the same thing as using a computer.  I can do my Spanish homework using my PlayBook, even though it runs through some special program.  I like how it also gives you the option to read a page as an article, so you don't have to adjust the size of the page to make it fit properly, or worry about inadvertently clicking something on the page.So, I highly recommend the PlayBook.  As a fringe benefit, when the BB 10 comes out, you will be able to sync the PlayBook and it together, to share information.
