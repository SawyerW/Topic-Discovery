I'll try to make this review quick...The good stuff:> I dont't open my laptop nearly as much now that I have the iPad.  I have access to the same files, and can do most of the same things.> Links up perfectly with a bluetooth keyboard.> Instant on.  No waiting to boot up.> The screen size is perfect.  Jobs is correct that anything smaller would be problematic.  I can just read all web sites, emails, etc.  Perfect size.> The touch screen is very accurate, responsive, and smooth.  I can touch a very small link at ht it right 99.9% of the time.> 3G reception is better on my iPad than on my iPhone 3GS.> Kindle books look great.> Tons of apps.  I can write a full proposal, create a spreadsheet, and develop a presentation all in Microsoft Office format.> Pages, Keynote, and Numbers now export to Office-compatible files, so these nice apps make the iPad even more useful.> Free cloud-based file storage via DropBox.> FTP/LAN server access to all my office files via GoodReader.> PDF reading, storage, and mark-up.> Store PDFs in iBooks.> Incredible screen for watching movies.> Battery life is as-advertised.  I get 10 hrs of good use out of each charge.> Wireless printing coming in November!The not so great:> No wireless printing, but that is coming in November 2010!  Still, would be nice to be able to hook up to a USB printer via the camera kit.> Glare is significant, but I bought an anti-glare screen protector.  Problem solved.> Hard to carry around with that open face.  The Apple cover is a nice accessory so you can carry the iPad around like a notebook.> On-screen keyboard is okay, but not for prolonged, heavy typing.> A tad on the heavy side.  I'll bet the next generation will be lighter!> I'm not using my iPhone nearly as much, so it might be going away.  :(
