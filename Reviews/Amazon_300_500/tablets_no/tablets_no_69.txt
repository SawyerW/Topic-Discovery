I bought an Android-run tablet (not from Amazon) a few weeks ago and tried my best to see its good points. I really liked its construction and novel appeal (had ICS) at first and continued to find reasons to improve it thru updates, useful apps, utilities, etc. All throughout I realized that I spent more time researching online for ways to improve  my Android tablet, than the time I was actually enjoying it. There always were issues that had to be remedied and problems that I had to seek  fixes for, the most significant of which was poor battery life and frequent crashes.  I finally got tired of "babying" my Android tablet and returned it promptly in new condition. That same day I bought an Apple Ipad 2 from a bricks-and-mortar store. Then I realized someting funny: that this was the third time I returned an Android device in exchange for an Apple.  First, when I returned an Android smartphone for an Iphone two years back. Second, when I returned an Android multimedia device for an Ipod Touch last Christmas. And now, my new Ipad 2 which replaced the Android. I am enjoying both stability and excellent battery life in my Ipad 2 -- and no more researching for fixes and no more "babying"!  Was buying the Ipad 2 more expensive? In terms of more cash out the pocket, yes; but in the long-run, I know that my Ipad will pay for itself. Now, I am not the brand conscious type and would readily buy a Coby or Emerson if it works better than a Sony or Samsung. Though I run the risk of sounding like a commercial, in this case of getting a tablet, the Ipad 2 won me over the Android simply because .........it's TRIED and TESTED and it's THAT GOOD.
