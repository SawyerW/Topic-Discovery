The first impression I had of this tablet is how solid it felt. Holding it in my hands, it just felt very sturdy and of high build quality. At 7 inches, it remains portable while also providing a big enough screen to read books, browse the web, and watch video. Many reviews complain about the 480 x 800 screen resolution, but to me it more than enough; the text and icons on the screen remain crisp, and there is not much of a noticeable difference between this and the other tablets I tried.I am extremely pleased with the speed of the tablet, which has a Tegra 2 processor. I had around 20 apps open and it remained responsive and fast. The haptic feedback when typing is especially nice. After updating the tablet to Honeycomb 3.2, the interface is much easier to use and navigate. It also looks much cleaner and modern compared to the Android 2.2 with Dell Stage UI look before.The 5.0 megapixel back camera is decent, and the 1.3 megapixel front facing camera is very useful for making video calls. However, the flash on the back camera is terrible. Don't expect this device to replace your camera, though I'm sure most users will not.The biggest issue with this tablet for most users (myself included) is the battery life. For me, it usually lasts about 5-6 hours of moderate use before I need to recharge it. This isn't horrendous, as some have suggested, but it is somewhat disappointing. However, considering this model is wifi only anyways, chances are you will be using it at home, where you can always hook up the charger.Overall, considering the performance, capabilities, and pricing of the Dell Streak 7, I would rate it as a great value. However, this is not a "value" product; it is a solid and more than capable device by itself.
