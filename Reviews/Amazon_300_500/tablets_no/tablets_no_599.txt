The biggest thing you need to know is that this is not supposed to be a laptop so you will not be able to play intense 3d games or have 100 things going on at the same time. It is supposed to be innovative, portable and useful and it does all three for me.I have a laptop and desktop, however I was looking for something to take with me to college and on trips and this serves the purpose well. It is a bit larger than most 10" net books, but that is because it has the swivel screen, which I love btw. I bought a Logitech 10" net book bag and it just fits. A little too snug for my preference, but it will do. I would suggest not buying a case online because it may not fit or fit well.It is powerful enough to surf the web with a few tabs open, watch youtube, play basic games and so on. It does not handle having 10 web tabs open very well though or having a lot of things going on at the same time.The feature I like most about this is the touch screen. I have read in reviews that a lot of people don't use it very much, but with me on the other hand I use it all the time. It is very very very percise and even with a small 10" screen I do not have any trouble navigating web pages. That feature has extremely helped me speed up my web browsing experiences.So far it has proved to be very durable and useful; however that bottom does get a little warm. Overall if you are thinking of spending $400 on a net book I would try to find one of these in a store and try it out. I really enjoy mine and would buy another.
