I have been a Creative Labs fan since I bought my first Zen MP3 player, and I believe they are at it again. Despite my preference for Creative products, I am not afraid to give them a bad review. Fortunately, there is no need for one now.Overall the tablet is responsive to the touch (both fingers and included stylus) and I have had very few issues with any applications which I installed. I really enjoy the flexibility of the tablet.It is great for browsing the web (despite the lack of Flash support), watching videos which are transferred to the device, composing emails, and many other things.Most would say the Ziio fails in the lack of apps available, however; with a Google search and a little persistence I have found quite a few apps including YouTube, Facebook, eBaY, Amazon, and even Angry Birds.The installed Android is only version 2.1 so it is a bit archaic in that sense but Creative has stated that a 2.2 update is in the works and will be released soon. This is where the tablet failed to get the five starsWith an update to 2.2 and (hopefully) access to the Android market, this tablet will rise to 5 STAR status!UPDATE: This tablet has reached five star status! After writing the original review above, not more than a couple weeks later, Creative graced us with an update to Android 2.2. The update included flash support, the Amazon Kindle app, and few other finer graces. Unfortunately there is no access to the Android market, however Amazon has launched their app store and it works wonderfully with the ZIIO. While the Amazon App store is still growing, when combined with simple google searches for apk (android app) files; useful and fun apps are never too hard to find. I am highly pleased and always have my Ziio with me! I promise your purchase will not go unused!
