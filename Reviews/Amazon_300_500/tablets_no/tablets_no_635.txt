I just got Toshiba Thrive 8gb version 2 days ago and I can't stop using and admiring it. No problem with the sleep and wake up mode right from the box, but I updated the software using Service Station Apps from Toshiba anyway. Non issue so far. Screen is amazing, it's fast. Sound very decent for a tablet. Many reviewers commented about the "bulkiness" of Toshiba Thrive, but I rather have a little bulkier and heavier tablet with everything on (USB, HDMI, SD card reader ports) than having separate adapters or dongles which is too much for me and even bulkier actually if we add those things together and not to mention we must purchase them separately. Ones that complaint a lot about the weight and the bulkier Toshiba Thrive should consider about the extra space and off course money on adapters or dongles that must be taken into the consideration and calculation and don't forget those extra gadgets can be lost easily as well.I have shopped around for any other tablets (Ipad2, Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia and Asus Transformer), then I decided that Toshiba Thrive is the chosen one.The best 4 things I like best with Thrive :1. Flash ! I am learning Chinese mandarin and download a lot of MP4 Chinese lessons video files from Chinese TV website that teaches Mandarin for non speakers. The MP4 files play smoothly.2. SD Card reader ! I just snap pictures or videos and take the card out and put into Toshiba Thrive built inSD card reader, no need to bring extra and bulky external reader or adapter like other tablets.3. Replaceable battery and back cover. I love the Green Apple color. Color means stand out from the crowd and being cool and yourself. Replaceable battery is very useful on planes or roads.4. Best bang for the bucks....... no need to spend extra money on adapters, dongles, external ports etc. They're already built in.
