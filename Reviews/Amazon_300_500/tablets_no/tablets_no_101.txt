In April of 2008 I purchased the predecessor to the TX2 ( the TX2000). A couple of months after the warranty expired, I began to have spontaneous reboots and video problems and finally it became unusable.I contacted the HP support desk, via their online chat, and after all trouble shooting was completed, I was informed that the machine would need to be sent in for repair, to the tune of $400. I now have an $1100 dollar brick on my desk.A bit of research found that there are thousands of people in the same boat, with HP laptops that have failed in the same manner. The problem is with the Nvidia graphic processing unit (GPU). It runs so hot that the solder connections between it and the main board fail. My GPU would run over 212 degrees F and the exhaust from the cooling fans was 157 degrees F.Although Nvidia notified HP of the failing GPUs sometime in the later part of 2007 or the early part of 2008, HP continued to sell the defective laptops. Their solution was to issue a BIOS update that ran the cooling fans all of the time, which served to increase the life of the GPU, until the computer was out of warranty.You may be thinking the $400 dollar repair is a fair price to fix the laptop, so what is this guy whining about? Well, they are doing the repairs with the exact same parts that failed in the first place, so the problem is occurring again, just a few months after the repair.In short, be sure to factor the cost of the longest extended warranty into the cost of the computer, because after the 1 year warranty expires you are on your own. HP is not going to stand behind their product, even if they know they are selling defective units.
