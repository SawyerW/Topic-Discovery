I didn't expect this unit to perform as well as it does. It actually plays my HD videos better than my previous Dell laptop with Dual core Intel processors. The sound is also pretty amazing for its size. It easily blows away any of the other tablets or net books in sound!Just for grins, I attached it to my 42" Samsung plasma. The Iconia played full 1080P movies compressed to 720P on both the tablet and the TV simultaneously without a single issue!Don't let the size fool you, this is a real computer, not a tablet toy like some of the others.At this price there's not another tablet more powerful than it at the present time.I linked the tablet to a wireless Motorola S305 Bluetooth headset. The Iconia comes with a Bluetooth suite that allows fast and easy connection.I also linked it to my GPS receiver with ease. It may cost more than the other tablets as a whole, but it offers you complete computing capabilities the others can't give you.Within 10 minutes of firing it up, I had it connected on my network and sharing on my home group. You can print to your shared printer without buying additional software ..no E print crap needed!I was able to link my HD homerun to the w500 through windows media center. I can now watch live OTA hi def broadcast with this unit...very cool!Until I sold my laptop, I had 9 computers in home and being used at one time or another. This little guy does a stellar job for its size when compared to the others here.Some of them are way more powerful, but none of them are as portable.Great job Acer!Update: just added windows 8 to the Acer. Wow once this is officially released it will be tough for anyone to choose an ipad over this thing. It is amazingly faster and touch friendly. I will without a doubt upgrade my w500 to Windows 8 os.
