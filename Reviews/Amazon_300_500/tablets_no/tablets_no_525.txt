I spent a few months researching various tablets before buying this one - on its release date of 11/11.  I've had it for well over a month now, and am still very happy with it.  First, I don't use HDMI so the lack of a port is not an issue for me, and since I don't tether it to my computer I don't mind the cables either. Blue tooth works very well on the Tmobile version.The form factor is very comfortable and the size is great in my hands.  It's easy to put in a pocket or in a purse.  The buttons work very well, and do light up when you tap the screen.  Web over WiFi is very fast, and is a joy to use.  Video playback is of good quality, and the tablet does record decent videos as well.  Multi touch is very precise, and I use both pinch to zoom and double tap which are both responsive.I do have Skyfire web browser installed, and that gives me the ability to have the Tab recognized by websites as a pc - which works well for sites like Amazon and eBay. I also have Docs installed, and can view and edit any word or excel document with ease.  Paired with the Apple wireless keyboard, I can do anything on the tablet that I could do on my laptop. I do not have it paired with a wireless mouse, since I don't see the point. The touchscreen on the tablet works well enough while typing.  I have paired it with a blue tooth headset and have made Skype calls with the tablet as well.  That works great too - but I wouldn't use this as a phone on a regular basis.Games play well on the tablet, and it's functionality can't be beat.  I did check out the iPad in person before buying this tablet, and found it to be too big and too cumbersome.  Not exactly portable,since it's 10 inches, while the Galaxy tablet is very portable.I really can't recommend this product enough.  Sure it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for - and in this case you get a lot.
