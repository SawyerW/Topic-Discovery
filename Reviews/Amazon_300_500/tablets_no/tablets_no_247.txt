I have had the Xoom for about 4 months now, and I will have to say that it has almost completely replaced my laptop.  Since I use my desktop for work and printing, the only other thing that I used my laptop for was browsing, email, and sometimes games...  but I can do all that with my Xoom and don't have to wait for Windows to boot up... arg!  I can put books, apps, games, read the paper, email, and everything else.  It is very fast and easy to use, and I even can tether it to my phone and have internet access any where I want without that silly monthly charge.  The battery life is very good, and I got the car charger so I am never without a way to keep the power up on the unit.The only limitation is with the operating system, which development seems to have stalled... thanks Google for dropping the ball.  Anyway, Tablet apps are on the rise, and I think that over time they will get more plentiful and complex.The think I like the most is that I can carry the Xoom in my purse, and I definitely couldn't do that with my laptop!So if you are going to purchase an android tablet, the Xoom is a very good buy!**UpdateI have had my Xoom for over a year now and I still love it immensely.  I have a Apple Tablet too, but it mostly sits in the case I got for it... havent used it for months...  which tells you which tablet is better!  The quality of this tablet is exceptional, and Motorola keeps the OS updated to the most current version of Android.  The best part is that it is so stable (not so with the Apple tablet, it apps constantly crash...) anyway, for the price you just cannot get better.
