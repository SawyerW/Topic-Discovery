My ipod touch is out of warranty and the headphone jack has broken for the second time (a design flaw makes it easy to loosen it). I've grown increasingly tired with Apple's despotic control over what I can and can't install on my property. I thought it a good time to make the jump to Android but I don't want to buy a tablet. The Archos 43 seems to be an ideal replacement. It updates to the Android 2.2 o/s easily. With some googling you can find the actual Android Marketplace app and open your 43 up to the whole market. The 43 and Android o/s have a bit of a learning curve. It might take a you a bit to find the write combo of apps that get it working like your touch. I do miss the two finger gestures to zoom in on things but that's about it. But once you get used to doing things a different (though not necessarily worse) way, you begin to appreciate how nice it is to just snap in an SD card, drag 'n' drop files without having to pass it through the software version of a Civet cat alimentary canal (itunes), you'll quickly forget a few of the touch's nicer interface elements.A few cons:Battery life seems a bit under powered. But its really easy to turn off the wifi and turn off the screen.The power button is in a really gruesome place.None of the default media players have bookmarking/remember position. But you can get third party media players that do that.The camera/video camera is a bit lame but it's nice to have it and you don't need Steve Jobs to pretend like adding a video camera to an mp3 player is some remarkable innovation.The micros SD slot you need to apply some sharp force to get the card properly seated.Update July 18, 2011The headphone jack is getting loose on this device too. There appears to be no way to get this thing repair under warranty in Canada. I've registered the device with Archos, reported the problem, inquired about warranty repair, and no one ever got back to me.
