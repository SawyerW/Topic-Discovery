This is the third tablet I've purchased, largely on the strength that it's Google certified against the Play store.  I had an Acer Iconia that I wound up giving to my father in law.  I purchased a Nook Tablet and returned it after a week.  This?  It's actually replaced the numerous laptops and Kindles around the domicile as my primary information consumption device.  It's not perfect.  Sometimes Flash buffering is quirky, and there are a number of apps that just plain don't work, usually obscure games I don't care about.  I really miss having Swype, which is apparently incompatible due to the screen form factor.  I think in the end, why I like it so much is because of the form factor.  9.7 inches is just right for holding in one hand while having easy readability and UI spacing, and it's all without Apple's suffocating user experience.  The biggest advantage over the 7" form factor?  PDFs.  I go to a lot of conferences with materials in PDF format, and seven inches is not going to cut it.  I move documents and e-books into my Dropbox on any PC and it opens with zero fuss seconds later.  Try that with iOS.  I've had an iPhone, Android phones, and even a terrible XP tablet at work back in the day.  Using this is a pleasure, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.UPDATE 7/30/2012Upgraded to the official Android 4.0.4 release a couple of weeks ago.  Still have access to the Google Play store, and still pleased as punch.  It runs somewhat faster, battery life lasts a LOT longer, and a number of app issues that existed under Honeycomb have been fixed.  A free Swype analogue is too be had with TouchPal Keyboard.  I've been comparing it to the iPad 2s some folks have at work, and wouldn't trade it for a second.  The advantage of DropBox and its local LAN sync plus custom third party apps over the iOS world really cannot be overstated.
