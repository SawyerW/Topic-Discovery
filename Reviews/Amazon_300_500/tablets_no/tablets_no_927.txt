There's a lot to like about the playbook, and some big drawbacks for a buyer considering taking advantage of their dramatic price drop in 2012. Be careful about reading 2011 reviews, a lot has changed in the tablet market in a short time.PRO1. Wonderful hardware and workmanship. It feels solid and is engineered nicely.2. Tethers to Blackberry phone.  If you have a BBerry phone, you'll enjoy being able to tap into the smaller device's emails, files, and especially its mobile wireless signal for internet on the go.3. Quick and responsive menus and software makes web surfing, email and typing a breeze.4. All this can be yours for a bargain price right now.CON1. Lousy app selection.  The BB app market is pretty close to laughable, and the much vaunted ability to load Andriod apps is very overblown.  Android app selection for Playbook is very limited and requires a decent amount of technical understanding and patience to pull off.2. Uncertain BB future.  It remains unclear whether the company will be around in a year to support the device.  A lot is riding on their delayed new OS for phones and tablets.  You are taking a risk buying one now.3. Multimedia is a pain.  I like lots of music and video choices.  This is where I was particularly disappointed.  There aren't many streaming radio services that work on playbook, though there are some. Crackle, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon video mostly don't work (yes some have found hacks, but don't count on it). Loading music files was also a pain.  With no SD slot, it has to be done via a wired connection, though it does support Windows 'drag and drop'.For me: the bottom line is if you are a die hard Blackberry addict, take a shot at this. Returns with Amazon Prime are easy, the price is low for the features you get, making it worth a try. I like Blackberry, but am not dead set on it. Mine's probably going back for an Andriod tablet.
