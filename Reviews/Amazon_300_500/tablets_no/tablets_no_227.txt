I bought this primarily to replace my old Cowon X5 MP3 player while, at the same time, giving me some internet and email capabilities so I can leave my laptop at home when I'm traveling. I immediately upgraded to FW v2.3.26 after charging the battery so my experience is based on that version.Overall, I've been very happy with the Archos 43. My main complaint is the touchscreen which is not particularly accurate or responsive. I've found that, with practice, it has become more reliable to use but I can't help think what this tablet would have been like with a good capacitive touchscreen such as that used by the iPod Touch... Otherwise, my only other gripes are that the HDMI mode is tricky to use and Google Marketplace (which admittedly is not officially supported) occasionally blacks the screen and the requires a system reboot.Internet access works as well can be expected on a small, touch driven screen. I downloaded the Opera Mini browser but I honestly prefer the bundled one. Email-wise, I changed to K9-Mail and changed to MortPlayer Music for music playback since it handles folder based browsing better. Aside from that, I experimented with Skype and was able to use it for basic audio calls and made sure I got a hold of Angry Birds for a bit of light distraction. I haven't really made use of the video player yet, aside from playing the bundled Big Buck Bunny, but the YouTube plug-in and general Flash based streaming video has worked very well.So, overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and it proved a great distraction during my recent vacation. If I already had a smartphone then I may not have bought this but since I don't have one, I don't want to pay $500+ for an unlocked one of similar specification to the Archos and I don't want to pay the monthly fees for a bundled phone, this was a good purchase.
