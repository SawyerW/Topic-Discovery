Well, Where do I begin? What can I say about the Ipad killer, and as you can see I don't like anything related to apple so this tablet is a breath of fresh air. It's about time a tablet came out that could stand up to the apple craze. Is this tablet stylish...no, is this tablet thin..no. Is this tablet heavy then most...yes, but here's the deal who really cares! Is this tablet functional? (yes it is) Are you locked in a prison with restrictions like most of the other tablets on the market? The answer is NO!!!! What do you expect of course its gonna be a little chunky after all you have full HDMI/USB, Mini USb not to mention the removable battery.  I'm not gonna bore anyone with the specs as most of us know what this tablet has to offer. I will say that I have been through quite a lot of tablets from the Cruz, Archos,Dell, Galaxy and finally after thinking all hope was lost fearing I would have to settle for the next disappointment along came the thrive. There is nothing bad about this tablet in my opinion, of course nothing is perfect and there may be some hiccups every now and then that's to be expected. I'm still getting my feet wet with this tab, but a stranger to the android platform I am not.I love the android platform. I read a lot of reviews on this site and others complain about the screen I see nothing wrong with the way movies or pictures look on the screen I think the screen is just a vibrant as the galaxy and almost as vibrant as the ipad, I guess in this area like any product it's all about personal preference.  On that note I'd just like to say to anyone thinking about buying this tablet dive right in, you wont be disappointed. This tablet is how tablets should have been made in the first place with the user in mind. Toshiba Thrive!! ipad killer!
