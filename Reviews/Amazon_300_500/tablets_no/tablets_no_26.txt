UPDATE as of April 29th, after 4 months of use:This tablet sucks, the so called "faulty mini USB port" is no longer working... I finally got used to the fact that the tablet should be standing still while charging, but in the past weeks, it's even harder to get the right contact, having to use any kind of things to support the tablet in an angle that the usb port makes contact within the tablet.Now it has come to a point where no matter if I get the right contact, the tablet just doesn't charge or do so very slowly, like 3 or 4% of charge in a 24 hour period... This has render the device totally useless, and as I am not in the USA right now, I cannot do anything about the warranty... I must wait to go back...I won't ever buy anything cheap from ASUS again!--------------------------------------------It's an amazing tablet, good screen resolution, powerful, awesome for gaming.The only thing that has concerned me so far is the faulty mini USB port that comes in the Tablet. After a month of normal use, when the tablet is plugged in to either the computer or wall, the slightest move makes the cable move withing the socket and lose the connection, going on and off if you keep moving it.I thought this was a problem of the mini USB- USB cable that comes with the tablet, but I have tried many cables from Nexus and from Blackberry and I figured out it's only a problem of the faulty socket that is not built well enough to hold strongly the mini USB end of the cable inside it.Well, you just have to let it stay still while charging/transferring data, however if you are an avid gamer who plays lots of HD-battery draining games and have to do so with the tablet plugged in, then it's a big deal... other than that, it's an awesome tablet.PD: I bought 2 tablets, one for me and one for my gf, and both have the same issue
