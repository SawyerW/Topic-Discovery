I am very impressed with this tablet.  I had been looking for about a month and decided on this unit because of versatility.  The ability to plop in my phone SIM card (GMS) is a major plus.  Although my phone (Galaxy S) has 1Ghz, so presumably faster, I find no lag in the functionality of this tablet.  I am very impressed with battery life.  When I first got my phone, I freaked when it was out of juice in 12 hours (now lasts 2 days after 2.1 update).  This Viewsonic device is still going on a charge when I first got it Tuesday.  Unplugged at 3pm, heavy use that evening (youtube, etc.), moderate use the next, no use Thursday, and now it is Friday noon and the battery icon is half full!  Actual percentage after going into setup is 39%, but that is not bad.  This thing is essentially a big cell phone, which is fine because I love my Android cell phone.  I think that is how it got certified by Google so it could have Marketplace, where Viewsonic 10 inch (G) does not, or phone features (but it costs less too).  Also, a 7 inch tablet seems bigger than I would think too - plenty of real estate for browsing.  I get great viewing from all angles, so it is a good screen.  Plagued with same issue of all like devices, including laptops: shiny glass covering LCD creates tons of glare and refections.  I will get a screen protector that reduces that like I did for my phone.Con: One thing that prevented 5 stars.  Home page (desktop) does not want to rotate.  It stays in landscape mode.  Most everything else does rotate though, so not sure if it is Viewsonic Launcher or some glitch.  I can live with it though.
