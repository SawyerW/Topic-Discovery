This past Christmas I bought my wife an iPad mini because she lives with her ipod touch and the mini had a larger screen (it is in fact just a large iPod touch).  When we opened gifts, she had bought me one too (I was/am an Android smart phone user).  I spent 18 hours over the course of 3 days trying to get them up and running.  It wasn't me.  Each call was "elevated" to a "senior" Apple tech rep.  One mini would not stay connected to wi fi, and the other would not accept photos from my wife's ipod to the mini.  A trip to the Apple Store (45min one way) didn't resolve either problem. I returned them both...and to their credit, there were no issues with the returns.  The wife is back with her iPod touch and I went out and bought myslef a Nexus 7 (after exhaustive research).  This thing is fast, dependable, versatile, looks great, terrific screen resoltion and a joy to work/play with.  I've had it 2 months and won't look at Apple again due to price....and their constant "updates" that inevitably cause us issues on other devices (iphone and ipod touch).  The cost difference is a no brainer ($199 if you skip Amaon's prices).  The biggest push back I get from family members with the ipad mini is the number of apps available.  Be realistic.  I'm exaggerating but if Apple has 400,000 apps and Android has 300,000 apps, who cares.  Apple is wearing off....and if costs don't come down soon, Android will eat them alive....over time.  This table is FANTASTIC and a GREAT VALUE.  But please note, I bought mine at Office Depot.  Amazon prices for this tablet are highway robbery....and I am an avid Amazon shopper but for this device they are way out of line.  Note:  I checked with Staples, Wal Mart, Office Max, Office Depot, etc.  They all have a 14 day return policy.  So if you're not sure, then buy locally for not only price but convenience...at least for this item.
