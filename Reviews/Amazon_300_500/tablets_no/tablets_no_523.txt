Just want to say that I bought the Samsung Tab outside the US, so it might not be the same as US units.  It is unlocked, and all the functions such Bluetooth are fully operational.  This is not a review by an IT pro, but simply an end-user's initial thoughts after a week of using the machine.I put off buying an iPad because it seemed to be just an oversize iPod without the functionality of a laptop.  I reckon that Samsung has produced exactly the machine that the iPad should have been.  It has all the bells and whistles, including front facing and rear facing cameras, Bluetooth, internet, wireless, GPS, micro-SD slot, etc, etc - oh, and it's a really good cellphone.  The Android 2.2 operating system is terrific and seems to be as intuitive as the Apple OS. I have all sorts of documents loaded on the Tab including Pdf's, Word, jpegs, etc and they all open easily.  The screen is sharp and is easy to read even in sunlight.  The email function is really good, and attachments open without a problem.  I have not tried the video function yet, so I cannot comment on that.  However, the camera is nothing to rave about,as the resolution is pretty grainy, but I didn't buy the Tab to take photos. The virtual keyboard is responsive and easy to use, however the unit is too large to do typing with both hands,and anyway, I plan to get a Bluetooth key board for use in the office.  I have not tried the rear facing camera, but will do so as soon as I can load Skype.  All in all, this seems to be a well-designed, quality built piece of kit.  I think this has raised the bar for Apple, and they had better hussle to get an upgraded iPad to market.
