Like many people here and everywhere, I was absolutely apprehensive about the iPad(or the giant iPod Touch as iPad haters like to call it). But after spending a few days with this device, I can tell you for sure that this is the way a large screen touch input based device should have been done.The Things that i love about the iPad1) The Keyboard is just awesome . Very easy to type even when using one hand.2) iBooks - Simply fantastic , Hopefully, the catalog will expand massively. I prefer this to the kindle when I am indoors because everything in an iBook is in colour.3) iWorks - Fantastic even though you cannot export to Powerpoint or Excel formats. Only Word is supported. Even the lack of "Track Changes" option did not  bother me much.4) Good Battery life5) The ability to import Photos on the go.6) Availability of Netflix App7) You can actually do things efficiently using just an iPad and a internet source.8) Safari for the iPad is a very efficient browser. Obviously, it does not support flash, but then that is price adobe paid for some crime they committed some time back.9) Most of the apps that work on an iTouch/iPhone works on the iPad.10) Does not heat up much after heavy usage.Things that are not available in the iPad when they should have been1) Finder for the iPad2) Network Explorer( so you can drag and drop docs from your other laptops/desktops into your ipad without using iTunes) - I have tonnes of pdf articles/books and other docs in my home server and would have loved to have this functionality)3) Print functionality ( Though this depends on HP , Canon and their ilk)4) bluetooth mouse connectivity5) ability to transfer data (music/files) using the camera connector kit accessory) from a USB drive or SD card drive.6) A Nice Photo Editor( Apple developed).7) I really did not feel the absence of multi tasking, but then I can appreciate controlled multitasking wherein I have control over what apps are allowed to run in the background.Things that are annoying1) iPad is smudge heaven - you dont notice those smudges when it is on, but the moment you press the sleep button/lock screen button , you can see hundreds of smudges.2) The screen is too glossy - I presonally prefer Matte, but we dont have that option anymore.3) Reading in broad daylight when the sun is right over your head is annoying4) Absence of a Finder/Windows Explorer kinda applicationOverall, I feel that there is no show stopper here and that the iPad is actually a good device for the average male/female and for anyone who is not into anything too technical.P.S , I have a verizon mifi and my iPad tethers to the mifi device. I have not experienced any network related issues so far. It seems sturdy and reliable.
