Great product exceeded my expectations and a great leap in the right direction though there is still room for a lot of improvementI will start with the good then move into the bad , I have spent the better part of the last 2 weeks with the iPad and have found it slowly replacing not only my net book but my tv as well it is much more portable then neither of the other too and I can do most every thing I need to do on itYou can sync Your iPad to load up your music from your library if you don't want to buy it from apple it's smaller lighter easier to type on in the dark a d nearly 65% of the applications are free and cost 99 cents for an upgrade to the full version with in app purchases the graphics are amazing no joke some of the games have nearly as good of graphics as the xbox or original ps 1I've watched movies tv listened to music typed documents browsed the Web typed on facebook tweeter and am now typing this review on it the thing is amazing truly I think it is slightly over priced but compared to the competition at the moment it is a lead above all the restNow on to the bad1st and most drawback is NO FLASH software any were ! This means no browsing movies tv show or online games at all period this sets it back a huge amount at least until html5 makes a bigger impact on the web some websites off support for it but still the majority do notIt can get a little heavy after a while this of course is to be expected with a aluminum case you can't have both so I choose a sturdy case against the 1.5 lbs of the tablet which seems light but after 20 minutes of gaming it starts to make a huge differenceA ten hour battery life seems like a lot until you get some graphics heavy games like need for speed on it then it is at the most 4 hours and it can sneak. Up on you quickNo support for Linux this is frustrating for two reasons one apples operating system is based on Linux codes  but they offer no support to run the iPad iPod or iPhone on another Linux system like ubuntu or debian and since I have two ubuntu computers and one windows it makes this a little harder and frustratingAlthough the drawbacks are few but large it is a good start for the next generation of computers and has made a major impact and still appreciate what it does but since there is no sd card slot no USB port and only a proprietary power cord and a non changeablebattery I have to give it only four stars
