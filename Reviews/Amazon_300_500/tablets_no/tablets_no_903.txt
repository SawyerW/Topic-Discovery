I have been looking at tabs for several months but refuse to pay "apple-esque" prices. I missed out on the Touchpad feeding frenzy but happened to catch this one on sale for less than $300 here on Amazon. This is my first android device and I love it, tons of apps and very simple and easy to use. I am very happy with the device so far (2 weeks plus). My first run in with samsung, I tried to register the product, their website kept telling me I had an invalid serial number, I tried doing an online chat with a support rep whose engrish was not so good. She said she was going to transfer the chat to another rep and after 10 minutes, I disconnected. I finally got the product registered by choosing a different model number; GT-P1010CWAXAR. That number is listed nowhere on my device, in or on the box anywhere but apparently, that's what it is. I had quite a bit of difficulty getting samsung's "Kies" program to be able to see my device on the computer and again contacted them. The device driver just would not load in windows 7. Again, the agent transferred me because they know nothing about the device, this time however, someone actually came on in a reasonable amount of time. This person wanted me to find another machine, XP or vista to try it on. When I told him I did not have one he told me he was unable to help me and refereed me to a telephone number. Samsung has NO DRIVER FILES, you have to install their Kies software. I finally did get the driver to load by installing the OLDER version of Kies (2.0.0.11024_34). If not for the runaround, pointless and futile exercise with samsung support, I would have rated this much higher.
