I've had my Archos 7ht for a little over 3 weeks.  The first unit I received wouldn't calibrate although I was able to use it some.  It got worse over the next 48 hours so I asked Amazon for a replacement unit and had it the next morning.If you buy one, do a firmware upgrade from the Archos site after charging the battery and initializing.  It improves the battery life a lot!  As everyone noted, it doesn't have the Google Market app, but I haven't cared yet.  Everything I've wanted to download has been available somewhere on the web.  There are also several other web sites that offer library apps.I downloaded Google docs which works like a charm.  I downloaded Skyfire to get flash capability.  I downloaded Astrid to get a to-do list that syncs with Remember the Milk.The pre-installed apps work very well.  I have about 50 ebooks loaded into Aldiko.  I also have about 20 videos and about 4 gig of music loaded.  On the Archos 7ht user forum I downloaded AppManager and Advanced Task Manager.  ATM also acts as a task killer so there's no reason to have a separate app for that.When you attach the USB cable to your pc, you get a device called Archos 7.  If you also have an installed SD card, you get another device with only a letter identifier.  They work well enough that I never remove the micro SD card.There are times that the touch screen is difficult to use.  I've kept a 3-color ballpoint pen with one ink barrel replaced with a stylus for years.  When I use it to navigate, I get a lot of precision and don't have to press very hard.  I don't use it at all for basic music playing, video watching, ebook reading, etc.  Just on apps that have a lot of data in small areas.There aren't enough business apps available yet, but that's an Android issue, not an Archos one.  I'd love to see an outline note taker, but it just doesn't exist yet.  I'm making do with a Google Docs document.
