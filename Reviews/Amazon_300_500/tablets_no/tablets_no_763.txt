I've had mine for about 6-months now and I honestly can't imagine not having it. I have all the latest gadgets as soon as they come out but actually waited on the iPad a bit since I really thought it was just a big iPod Touch. Well... it kinda is but it's not. It is basically the same software but modified for the much larger screen and much higher resolution. This really is a big deal and changes the way you use it. If you think you're just getting a big iPod Touch, you're right -- but not really and once you use it for a few days you'll completely understand what I mean. It's really amazing how quickly you get used to it, instant on is a given now days, but the 10-hour plus battery life is a bigger benefit than you might realize. The system is very responsive and there is a ton (that's an understatement) of apps available. Sorry to the Android crowd but you really don't want to use the iPad, it will make you feel very very insecure -- at least until Google gets a tablet version of Android out.Right now there isn't anything better in this form factor than the iPad. If you're looking to get a tablet don't get caught up in stats, they mean nothing if the software isn't good -- and right now only the iPad has software that was built from the ground up to work with it and that advantage is huge. Out of the non-critical computer / gadget related items in my house, I use this by far the most. In fact I sold my basically brand new Mac Book Pro 13 shortly after bying the iPad once I realized I completely stopped using the Mac Book. The iPad doesn't do what the Mac Book could do, but it does what it's made to do amazingly well.
