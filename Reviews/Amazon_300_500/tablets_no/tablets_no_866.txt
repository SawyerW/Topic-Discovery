Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 32 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1032 BlackI am a huge Android advocate. I have owned a Droid and Droid 2 phone, they're awesome. I am a software engineer by profession and have developed a handful of android apps. I was evaluating this side by side an ASUS transformer. I do not have buyers remorse as these two were bought for me by my company.This is by far the biggest disappointment in my computer career since Windows ME. From low grade construction materials, an overall buggy revision of 3.1 & terrible quality cameras that are pretty much useless to lack of hardware support and obvious platform gaps.Cons  - Video conferencing. How? Oh wait, you can't or at least with Google Talk, Skype or ? .. what's the point of the front facing camera again?  - Even if you could, the cameras are so dismal that it would be pointless unless you were in perfect light.  - Oh, look, the screen is detachable.. wait, that's not supposed to happen  - The keyboard is laggy  - The power button is annoyingly positioned and hard to find without looking at the tablet (like in the dark)  - When you find it, sometimes it won't wake up out of sleep  - I've had to remove the battery to reboot quite a few timesPros  - You can have fun sticking stuff into the USB port to figure out what is supported! I was actually surprised when a mouse and keyboard worked ++1!  - Great at rebooting ... itself.. randomly  - You get stickers in the box that you can stick on your colleges cars.  - You'll make your co-workers jealous even if they don't know it's a complete PoS*** Update 10/30/2011*** the insults with this thing keep coming. I actually ended up getting the unit warrentied because of the screen. I have had to reset the new one several times to curse horrid lag. On top of this we are still running 3.1.
