Well Sony is always is the at the top of quality and engineering over the years, and this 46HD is everything it should be for the money. I was making the move from regular TV to a HD, spent some time in various Best Buys, which have professional and smart people to inform you whats new, what bad and whats best.I watch more TV now that I am a tad older, 50, and normally watch F1 Racing, MotoGP, Baseball, Football (Cubs/Bears) and some HBO. But my wife enjoys DVD/Blue ray running the Gambit, so we decided it time to enjoy that format on a TV that more realistic for a movie, boy, this baby is the bomb.I got a regular Sony Blue Ray for $150 too, and put the ethernet to my router, and we have Net Flix on demand too, via our Que, and also You Tube and a Style.com (fashion shows/collections), with Hulu coming soon.The set up was a few minutes, the HDMI cords are great as no guessing and tons of wires, and I plugged in my Video/Audio my Denon reciever/amp and have stereo too. The speakers on the TV are very good, why people complain about them I have no idea.I chose LCD over LED as I figure its still has a few generations to go to be better, and the cost is was too much for my needs. I enjoy nice things in life, I own a Triumph Sprint ST motorcycle, and a BMW twin turbo 335i coupe six speed, and love designer clothes from Italy. This TV is a great value purchase. I also got the 4 year warranty.So, the entire package, TV $949, BlueRay $150, 2 HDMI Cables $60, Warranty $120, Ethernet cord $9, tax $140, was $1400. I wanted a TV around $600, but justified the 50% increase on the quality.
