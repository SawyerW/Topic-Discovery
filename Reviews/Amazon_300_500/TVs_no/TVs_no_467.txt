We knew we wanted this TV and just set out to find the best deal we could.  ABC Warehouse and Best Buy were within $50 of each other.  This TV on Amazon was $300 less.  It seemed too good to be true and we were hesitant.  I don't know anyone who has ordered such a large item from Amazon and have heard it's hard to get anyone on the phone from Amazon.  But I found the number if you have questions about electronics.  I called and spoke to a nice and friendly gentleman who answered all my questions about the warranty, delivery and purchasing.  After reading other reviews too and after speaking with this guy I went ahead with the purchase.  I watched the tracking of the TV for a few days and as described, the delivery company called me up to say the TV could be delivered tomorrow to us (Friday) or Monday and gave me a 4 hr window.  So the next day, towards the end of the 4 hr window, but still within it, two professional deliverymen arrived and brought in our TV.  They unpackaged the TV and they even set it up with our new HDMI cable and new HD Directv receiver.  I was told they wouldn't set it up, just plug it in to make sure it worked.  I was very impressed with the ease of purchase, the fast (it came earlier than expected) and easy delivery.  I would recommend buying a large TV from Amazon.  My husband said at one point he thought the sound from the TV had some static but it seems to be an isolated incident.  The TV is awesome and the picture is amazing.  The only downside is that the price is always dropping.  It was like $70 less the day after we ordered the TV, but that's to be expected with electronics!
