Bought this TV a week ago from Sears $719.  Got free home delivery worth $65.  Then a week later price drops to $599, Sears was honest and matched the new price and refunded me the difference of $120.This is my first big TV and I am loving it.  I don't have HD channels so it is just a "big screen" for cable transmission.  But I watched a dozen or so movies and they look great.  At the store I compared the 1080p and 720p side by side from a approx distance of 6 feet or so while they were playing some Blue Ray disc.  I asked the sales person to not tell me which is what and in all honesty I could not tell the difference, but again this could be my inexperience.So far I have been watching DVDs at progressive scan mode which is 480p and I felt a noticeable difference when I hooked my DVD player to the TV using component cables instead of RCA TV out.The speakers are nothing to brag about but delivers crisp sound.  So I have it hooked up to my Altec Lansing speakers directly from my DVD player. One annoying thing so far is the TV has only optical audio out so if you are looking forward to connecting it to your home theater system or any other sound system (that does not have optical audio inputs) then you need to buy and optical to RCA converter which would cost you another $75 and up.For those of you thinking if 42inch is enough? I can say that I have a small living room 15X15 feet and it is just right for my taste, well honestly my wife's taste...I certainly would have liked to get a 50inch plus panel.  But I am not complaining, I watch approx 8-10 feet distance (watching 480p content from DVD) and it looks great.Come Christmas I plan to get a BluRay player and then maybe I will have to sit upfront.  Given the price and quality I am a happy customer and would highly recommend this TV to anyone on a budget.
