I originally ordered my TV at the end of January after researching TVs for roughly 3 months.  I have more faith with the Sony brand than others, so I focused primarily on Sonys.  I began monitoring the prices on Amazon before Thanksgiving, and after visiting SonyStyle, Best Buy, Circuit City...I realized it was worthwhile to purchase on Amazon in regards to price.In regards to Amazon:At the time, TV was listed as $2,299.  Amazons price in the end was $1,446.  Without paying taxes on top of the savings, it saved close to $1,000.  I don't know who in their right mind wouldn't take advantage of Amazon's price.I was worried about the delivery method and if my TV would arrive in excellent condition.  Unfortunately there was minimal damange to the plastic frame in the back.  I called Amazon about the damange, and within 3 minutes on the phone, Amazon had placed an order for a replacement.  It was a simple process and a breath of fresh air compared to the majority of other customer service centers.  Although, the replacement TV had the exact same issue as the original TV delivered.  I recommend anyone that ordered this TV through Amazon to look on the left side panel where the extra HDMI Input is located and make sure there is no damange to the structure.In the end, I spoke with Amazon customer service and ordered a new TV, and they would pick up the original defective TV.  TV arrived today and old TV taken away, upon initial inspection, no visible damage.  Besides the structure damange, Amazon is still the place to go.  I am sure the same issues could have been experienced at any other vendor, as I believe it is just a defective problem with the TV's design. But personal experience with places like Best Buy, etc., returns are complicated and near impossible.I will always recommend Amazon for major purchases, like a TV.In regards to TV:Great features, great size, amazing picture.  I don't think there is a better TV out there for the price paid!
