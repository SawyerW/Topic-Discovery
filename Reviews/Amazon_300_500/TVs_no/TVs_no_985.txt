This Panasonic P50GT30 replaces an older 720p Panasonic Plasma that has been retired to another room.  I wanted a Panasonic plasma based on the performance of my older one over the last 4 years.  After several days with the new 50, I have not been disappointed.The set was beautiful right out of the box, I switched to THX mode for break in and have simply been watching a variety of sources from Direct TV.  Colors, blacks and sharpness are all very impressive.  I will be anxious to see what further tweaking can do for the image.  The integrated wi-fi was very easy to set up and the apps are interesting.  I have not had time to investigate all of them but the one that caught my eye was Picasaweb albums which I use alot.  Now I can view my images on my tv, very cool.I matched this TV with a Panasonic BDT215 3d blu ray player and that too set up on my network without issue.  I am awaiting a pair of 3d glasses from Panasonic and my copy of 3d Avatar to try out.  The glasses see to be in shot supply and are not inexpensive.Bottom line for me is that this was a great purchase.  I compared it with the comparable Samsung plasmas and felt that the Panasonic was a better viewing experience and so far I am pleased with my choice.Update:  Picture quality continues to impress, watching the Lord of the Rings on Blu-Ray was amazing, clarity, color were exceptional.  I also have received my 3d glasses from Panasonic.  they recharge quickly and even when viewing the 2d converted to 3d image, there was still a good sense of depth without any motion blur or headache that I have had with previous versions of 3d.  Looking forward to getting my copy of 3d Avatar to watch.If you are looking for a new plasma, give this one serious consideration.
