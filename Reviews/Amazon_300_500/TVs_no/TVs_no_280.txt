This TV is the dogs bollocks! In the few weeks that I've had this TV I've tested a lot of its features. I've used the HDMI, USB, component, S-video, composite and antenna inputs, all of which produced good images for their respective formats.I like the design because the high gloss black around the screen looks really cool. It's pretty thin and weighs about 60lbs. The fact that the screen swivels on a stationary base is helpful when you're plugging things into the back. The USB, composite and S-video inputs are all on the side so you don't need to move the screen for things that may be only connected temporarily.The coolest thing about this TV is the USB port. I plugged in a flash drive with some digital camera images and was very impressed by how well they appeared on screen. This TV took my 6-megapixel digital camera images and made them look like I was watching HDTV. After using the USB port for pictures and MP3s, I wondered why it didn't also read video files.The TV has an automatic mode that changes the aspect ratio according to what's on screen. This function can be useful when widescreen HD programs switch to full screen commercials. But this can be annoying when a program has a very dark shot with no light on the extreme sides of the screen. But this automatic function can be turned off, so it's no big deal. This also TV has 1:33, widescreen, zoom and superzoom aspect ratios.It also produces pretty good sound. The HDMI inputs sound noticeably better than the (right/left) stereo inputs. I haven't used the digital coaxial output and I don't think many stereos today have a digital coaxial input.This TV displays high def signals as well as any TV I've seen and I'd definitely recommend buying one of these.
