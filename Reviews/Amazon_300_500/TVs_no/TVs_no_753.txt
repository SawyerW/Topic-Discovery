This is my first HDTV, although I spent a lot of time looking at many models and other people's tv's before I bought this one. I originally wanted one that hooked up to the internet, but I settled on this one. Still, I wish this TV had those capabilities.The TV itself was very easy to set up. It came with a pretty easy to read manual with nice pictures. The remote is pretty intuitive - doesn't have a billion buttons like many of them do, but it has all of the buttons you need.I don't have cable TV, so I hooked this up to my Wii to test it out. The Wii only has 480i, so it was no where near taking advantage of the full HD resolution of this TV, but the Wii looked great. I streamed some Netflix movies over the Wii, and they looked excellent. Same with Amazon's streaming service - the picture looked great via the VGA cable off my computer.I recently purchased an Over the Air antenna, which picked up about 17 local channels. A few of them are in HD, and when I saw this, I was simply stunned. This tv displays HD content just as good, if not better than some of the bigger name brand (ie Sony, Samsung, LG) panels out there. It looked simply stunning.Sound is pretty good - not as good as my surround sound, but good for built-in speakers. Certainly some of the better built-in speakers I've heard.One little thing that I like is the Visio logo on the front - it glows orange when the TV is off, and white when the TV is on and/or warming up. I've found this useful compared to other TV's, where you have to guess whether they're on or off.I haven't tired any HDMI devices yet, but that will be next - Blu Ray player is the next thing I'm going to purchase.So, overall, I'm very impressed with the TV. Given the chance to purchase this or another TV again, I would purchase this one. It does everything I need it to, has great quality, and was a very good price.
