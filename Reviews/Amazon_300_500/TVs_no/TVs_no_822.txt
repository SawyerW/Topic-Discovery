I was in the market for upgrading my old Vizio 32" 720p TV from 8 years ago. I always liked the vizio brand with the quality that TV produced so figured I'd upgrade to the latest model Vizio with the smart TV features. After reading many reviews and different forums, I decided with the E550i-B2 and Amazon had a nice deal on it (Only buy it from here if it's sold by Amazon, the 3rd party sellers are $150-200 more.)Everything arrived in prefect condition. The delivery people were pretty good about turning the TV on to make sure everything was working before leaving. The setup on the TV was easy, picture calibration is easy. Netflix works flawlessly on it, no lag or anything weird. I even installed PS3 media server on my computer and the Multimedia app on the TV picks up the media server and I can stream video files straight to the TV from that!The only downside I've had so far is the sound. Because the speakers are behind the TV it sounds a little muffled and just isn't good audio. It's not terrible, but it's not good either. I'll probably invest in a sound bar to go with it. Also that the Amazon app still isn't ready for it yet, not sure why that hasn't been resolved yet.Overall, I think it's a pretty good buy for the price and would recommend it!After a couple of weeks of having the TV, I've settled on these picture settings:Auto Brightness: OFFBacklight: 100Brightness: 50Contrast: 90Color: 55Tint: 0Sharpness: 50Advanced Picture Settings:Color Temp: NormalBlack Detail: MediumActive LED Zones: OnMotion Blur Reduction: OnReduce Signal Noise: OffReduce Block Noise: OffFilm Mode: AutoA big thing to keep off is the Reduce Signal Noise. It makes the picture really bad for HD programming. Like a photoshop paint filter.
