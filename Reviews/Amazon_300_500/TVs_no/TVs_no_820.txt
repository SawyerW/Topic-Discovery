Our old monitor was looking dull and a tad blurry so we ordered this because we have liked Vizio products in the past and the price here on Amazon was almost $100 cheaper than Walmart.The sound quality from the internal speakers is weak in bass, not a problem for us because we use a small set of Bose speakers for sound.Our signal source is an Apple Mac Mini, we feed the Vizio with a 10' HDMI to MiniDisplay Port cable I bought here on Amazon, the picture looks fantastic. Netflix, Amazon TV, iTunes and DVD's look great. The monitor adjusts it's brightness automatically and we're happy with the performance so far, we get up and party in the middle of the night, it's nice that the monitor does not turn on at full brightness for sleepy eyes.The remote control is compact and easy to use.This is my first SMART TV and IMO it's not that smart because the apps are slow, much slower than the Mac Mini we normally use. You push the Netflix button and it takes a while for the set to get it up onscreen, navigating around in Netflix is also slow using the built-in smart TV. Netflix-HD LOOKS amazing on this monitor running through the smart-TV native app, lines are noticeably sharper and less pixelated than the Mac Mini video output on the same HD program. It is nice that the Vizio has the smart apps, it gives us more viewing options, we can have the Mac doing other tasks like compressing video while watching a movie using the built-in Smart TV apps. Generally speaking we prefer the speedy performance of the Mac as a source rather than the built in apps, we consider those to be "included free", but they were not a real consideration in the purchase. Price, picture quality and size were our main buying selection criteria.The trim around the perimeter of the monitor is very compact, I love that, it is not trying to be fancy, instead it's compact and understated in appearance, perfect for our viewing room.Overall we're delighted, no funny noises from the power supply, it was easy to unbox and set up, it's light weight so it's not hard to move. My little bit of griping about the apps being slow is nothing in the grand scheme here, I paid this much for a high quality computer monitor a few years ago, now you get 40 amazing LED inches for a bit less $$, now is a great time to consume TV.
