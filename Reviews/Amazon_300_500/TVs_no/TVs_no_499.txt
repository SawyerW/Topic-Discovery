Receive the stand shipped via UPS.  I somewhat knew to expect it damaged because of reviews I have read about UPS items shipping that are heavy weight.  UPS will not let you open package and see if it is damage.  Package was in decent condition.  After opening up the lower shelf had a crack in it.  the TV shelf was pulled away from the side support on one side.  Might not be only UPS fault but the stand is made of pressed particle board.  I am not going to send back the stand. It is very hard to see damage when viewing.  The crack on lower shelf is hidden by a component and the top shelf connection to the side support is not to noticeable.  I will buy some black paint to and hide the damage.  As to the stand itself usage.  The center glass shelf support does not do a good at holding much weight.  I never did see any specs on weight support for the center shelf.  With my AVR and center speaker on the shelf it sag quite a bit.  I ended up cutting two 4 inch pieces of wood and sprayed paint them black.  I then put them under the glass shelf about a third of the way from the sides. No more center glass shelf sagging.  One of the reasons I bought this stand is that the center shelf was adjustable which is A1.  The WD73740 locks in just fine.  I got the stand a day later after the TV arrive so the TV was on the floor at first.  Really a good stand for usage but I wish it was more quality built to with stand damage in shipping.  The particle board just to cheap.  Really like the stand besides the mention quality.  Would buy again.  Looks great.  Especially like the adjustable center shelf.  Sold by Amazon thru Walts.
