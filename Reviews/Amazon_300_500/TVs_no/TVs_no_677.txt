Well, i bought this item from amazon.com, BUT UPS somehow "lost" my package (The TV). so i ended up getting a refund (Took a day, wasn't to bad). i ended up buying this same Tv on a different site, and i love it. Its perfect for the price, i have actually seen it on some sites for $1900, CRAZY!... but it works perfect... if you're going to play games on it MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT IN GAME MODE, if you don't put it in game mode it sucks!!! but if you do- its perfect! :)Love the tv, Hate UPS.The only things i don't like to much about the tv is. ITS TO THIN FOR ME... All the hookups for game systems & ethernet cable & DVD player all have little converting wires because the tv is too thin for a normal AUX/ Video in... ECT... ITS CRAZY... but it does have 4 HDMI slots and 2 USB slots (enough for me), Its easy to download some movies to an external hard drive or flash drive, plug it into the usb slot, go to your movies folder and play a movie.One thing i should have thought about is a built in wifi card! i thought it had one! or at least came with an adapter. but no... you have to buy that! it does come with an ethernet slot but dang... another frekin wire to stick out from the back huh...  The "Internet tv" (Smart tv) thing, where you can access netflix & many other apps, works fine. but they need a bit of work, (its not a deal breaker). just that its a little laggy- and the netflix app isn't to great, when your watching episodes, and say you want to watch one that you have already watched, you can't select it, then play from beginning, you have to play it & rewind to the beginning.Hmm... 3D... now i'm not sure how it is on other tv's. or how its suppose to be on a tv, but on this tv... its not to great. maybe its the glasses i bought (70 bucks each) or maybe its just how 3D tv's are. If your expecting it to be like in theaters~ well, its not like that at all.I'm happy with the purchase.
