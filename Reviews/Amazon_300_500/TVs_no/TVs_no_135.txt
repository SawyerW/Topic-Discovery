There is no doubt this is a great television for the price.  It is easily worth even $1600 or $1700.  The only downfall with the television is that the beautiful casing is extremely easy to scratch...a.k.a. be careful.The delivery process was rediculous and slow.  I had to track down two different companies that were subcontracted to handle the television on different parts of it's journey.  Long story short, my television was lost in Washington (I live in Wisconsin) where the carrier attempted to deliver my television to a gentleman who ordered a bench!!  When it did finally arrive after more than 3 weeks and countless time spent on the phone...this is where it was maddening......  A man who spoke extemely broken english rang my doorbell.  As he was trying to convince me to sign off on the delivery, his partner was unloading the television from the truck and I watched him slide the televion from the truck straight to the ground where it landed HARD on a corner of the box.  He picked the box up without a care and brought it to my doorstep where he intended to leave it.  I picked it up and carried it in my house.  Mind you, I'm 6' 2" and 220 pounds so these two small, rude men did not intimidate me.  However, I  could not imagine this scenerio if my wife would have taken delivery instead.  These "White Glove Delivery" people followed me in the house and were persistent about me signing off on delivery but I intended to make sure the set worked first.  They sat on my couch as I opened the box, set things up and made sure everything worked as expected (15 minutes).  There is no way these two guys could have hooked up the television as promised by the delivery explanation.
