For the price this is an acceptable TV.  I had read the reviews about the poor viewing angle (they aren't kidding) but I bought it for my wife who watches the TV from the side of the bed, so that is a non-issue.However, I am disappointed that we currently cannot view HD (720P or 1080i) content from Comcast.  When I bought the TV, one of the main reasons was the ability to hook the cable directly to the TV rather than going through the free Comcast digital to analog converter box we had hooked up to the old TV.  What I found is the QAM digital tuner in this TV works as advertised but it doesn't pickup all the channels that came through the converter box.When we had the Comcast converter (model DC50x) hooked to the old TV, we received about 114 channels; all standard def. due to the fact that the converter only passes SD via channel 3 or 4 on the output side.  When I hooked the cable directly to the Coby TV, it picked up only 67 channels (all digital as Comcast has switched to all digital in my area).  The HD channels it picked up (720P and 1080i) looked great; unfortunately most of my wife's favorite channels are not available.  So I had to put the converter box back in-line with the cable and have the TV tuned to SD channel 4.What a disappointment.  I told my wife the new TV would let her view her shows in HD, eliminate the converter box and thick cable that sits on top of the night stand, and she would only need one remote control. Now the only way for her to view HD channels is to rent another HD converter box (much larger box) and to increase our monthly Comcast bill by $10/month.So beware Comcast customers, this TVs digital turner only passes the basic channel set; and a number of the 67 channels are broadcast both in SD and HD so there are effectively <50 channels.
