Using the HDMI input from the Blue Ray player started to produce Red screen after a couple of days of usage.First I thought the the Red screen is produced by the Blue ray player but later I verified the problem is not because of the Blue ray player, it is because of the bad HDMI input circuitry of the TV. I verified that the Samsung PN63C7000 TV is producing the Red colors anytime I switch to HDMI inputs (It has 4 HDMI inputs, all producing same red screen). I was suspecting the 10-foot "high speed HDMI cable" from monoprice causing the discoloration problem. I connected the same cable to the HDMI inputs of my other LED TV and the screen was good. I used 4 ft "high speed HDMI cable" on both TVs, Samsung PN63C7000 TV produced red colors, the other older LED TV produced the normal colors. When I used my Denon receiver to output signals via the HDMI cable to the any one of 4 HDMI inputs of the TV, I get red screen.When the TV is in TV mode or Internet@TV mode (Such as netflix, local network, etc.), it displays the channels correctly without any discoloration. I am not sure what caused the TV to go bad in the first couple of days of usage. It may be result of Blue Ray player overheating excessively and producing out of tolerance signals to the HDMI inputs of the TV thus causing the sensitive TV input circuitry to fail.My PN63C7000 TV suffers from the same Motion Judder issue.I did not notice any buzzing from my TV that some other owners are complaining about.See my review for a Samsung Blue ray player overheating problem here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QP41FG/ref=oss_product8/10/2010 Update: I updated the firmware from 1022 to 1026 using flash memory. Red screen on HDMI video sources diminished a lot but there are still red artifacts rendering the video unacceptable to watch.
