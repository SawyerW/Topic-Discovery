The TV is overall one of the best I've ever seen.  It has great picture and the THX settings provide natural color accuracy.  Many people have mentioned fluctuating blacks with Panasonic plasma TVs, but I have yet to experience this which is most likely due to disabling the auto brightness feature under ECO settings.  The sound from the TVs is as good as it gets from the two smallish speakers found in TVs, but really if your going for a TV like this you should also be looking to get a home theater setup as well.  Eventually I will get a denon or onkyo reciever paired with a 5.1 setup using polk audio monitor series II speakers.  All in all you should be satisfied with this TV.Updated 08/31/2011I recently tested out the DLNA feature and found that it worked great, for the most part.  So far I've tested it with videos stored on my computer, but will eventually set up a always-on DLNA server with external storage connected to my router.  Occasionally, when trying to pull videos from my computer using the menus on the TV it says no DLNA servers could be found.  I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the order in which I turned on the TV and the computer.  For Windows 7, a simple fix is to right-click a video file in Windows Explorer and navigate to the Play To option in the context menu and select Viera GT30.  If the Play To option isn't visible in the right-click context menu then open up windows media player and wait a few seconds (seems to turn on DLNA services). Then, retry using the Play To option.  After doing this once the TV should be able to find the DLNA server.  I believe once I have the always-on DLNA server through my router this issue should disappear.I've recently watched some high definition content on Syfy HD (1080i) and it looked stunning.
