I've had this TV Since April 2010, which is about 2.5 years.  The W model is 120Hz, but has the Bravia Engine 3, like more expensive XBR models.  I liked the CineMotion for some things, but it 'feels' like a rubber screen sometimes.  Never connected via anything but HDMI, and I don't use the speakers (Sat box --> Yamaha AV Amp --> TV.  The Yamaha amp drives my 5.1 surround sound system.My issue started at about 15 months.  It turns out that the Sony warranty was 18 months.  When I turned on the TV, it would show horizontal lines, and a distorted Bravia image.  It made other images look like checkerboard patterns with horizontal lines. If I let it warm up, I could then turn it off/on and it would be fine until I turned it off and it cooled off.  But the warm-up time started getting longer and longer.I did a chat with Sony support, and they had me try a few things.  No change. Upgrade firmware.  No change.  Unplug it for a while... no change.  I sent them pictures of the symptom. So after another chat, they sent a 3rd party service rep(2 weeks).  He brought a board (back of screen at the top), and replaced mine.  It was worse, so he put the original back.  Two weeks later, he came back with two other boards (power supply board and 'control' board?).  No change.  By this time, it was a real fight go get it warmed up.  Two weeks later he brought an entire new panel including another board that he had changed the first time.  Fixed it, and (knock on wood) I've been enjoying it for over a year.  The replacement parts only carry a 3 month warranty, so I'm out of warranty now.Too bad they don't make this model any longer.  But for now, I have an excellent TV!  If I get 4 years out of it, I'll be very happy with the purchase (may add a star).
