We have had this television for 10 days and couldn't be happier with it.  Although more expensive than other options, I believe that the superior picture quality justifies the price. Based on our experience, it also is a very good alternative to plasma or projection in a larger format, the set showed none of the "typical" downsides of LCD panel TVs.HD picture on cable is superb, especially on football.  No residual image on fast motion and no mura detectable on our set.  Blacks are very good. I think the color is the best on any monitor I have seen.  As others have said, I think it is well worth experimenting with different settings as I think most will prefer alternatives to the presets.  On our set, we use "custom" and "warm 2" and have turned up backlight and picture for most input.The blacks are very good.  We have the set in a porch with many windows , and it performs better in there than our prior DLP HD projection TV.  In a dark room at night, with the black bezel, it almost looks like an incredibly vivid picture floating in the air.Standard TV looks surprisingly good given screen size, and standard DVDs look very good.  Menus work well and are relatively easy to find and navigate compared to most products.  If it proves reliable, I think Sony got it all right on this one.  Only complaint is an overly long and slightly clunky remote.Bought from Amazon and the White Glove service worked weill - I was contacted whent the TV reached town (3 days), it was deliverd the following day, and while the truck was an hour past the delivery "window", service was polite and efficient when they got here , they unpacked it and put it on the stand, and waited while I hooked the TV up, made sure it worked and no obvious problems.
