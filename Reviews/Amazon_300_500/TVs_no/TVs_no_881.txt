I bought this TV ($399) with eager anticipation knowing it had a great reputation and glowing reviews for what it was: an entry level plasma with no "smarts", no internet connection, no 3D, but an awesome picture.It really looks a lot bigger in person as I was afraid it would be too small for my living room but it looks great replacing a 32" CRT that served me well but was increasingly the odd man out in a digital world. The bezel on the TV is very thin so almost all of the TV itself is pure digital picture which makes it fill up a room nicely. The TV is not heavy and the remote is easy to use.I immediately set the picture settings according to some other knowledgeable owners that have found the perfect video settings and was FLOORED by the clarity despite it only being a 720p HDTV. Of course I am feeding it pure OTA HD signal (free!) via antenna and have my trusty Roku hooked up via HDMI for HD movies and programming. I also bought a cheap Blu-Ray ($67 Panasonic DMP-BD75)to watch my huge DVD collection and the occasional "wow" Blu-Ray (Avatar) that I would want to own. I streamed Tron Legacy on my Roku as a 720p signal for a test and was very pleased and excited to see the detail on the uniforms, the inky blacks, and the smooth almost glass-like environments glowing in crystal clear glory.Now let me slow down for bit though, this TV is NOT the best plasma that Samsung makes nor is the best money can buy, but for the PRICE there is no equal! Please remember that this TV is perfect for consumers like myself that want quality but without the frills and the latest tech of the month that drives up the price on everything nowadays (3D, Bluetooth, SmartTV, Wi-Fi, Apps, you name it). For the price you can't go wrong, Enjoy!
