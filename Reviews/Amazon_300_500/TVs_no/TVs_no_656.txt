I apologize for posting this on a product page but I think more people should be aware of this issue.I am very disappointed in the deceitful manner amazon.com purports to offer a "TV Low Price Guarantee."On the product page amazon.com states:"TV Low Price GuaranteeWe are working hard to make sure that our prices are the best around, but if you find another site that offers a lower price within 14 days after the date we ship your order, let us know and we will credit your original payment method for the difference. If we lower the price on our own website within 14 days after we ship your order, let us know and we will refund you the difference as well."But then amazon.com has a number of exceptions, which can only be viewed by navigating to several different pages, that make it possible to easily circumvent fulfilling this seemingly straightforward offer.I found a website that offered a lower price for the television I had purchased from amazon.com within a few days of my purchase, and amazon.com's customer "service" representatives twisted the loosely phrased "Terms and Conditions" of the low price guarantee to insure that this lower price would be ineligible.I find this kind of duplicitous selling practice to be reprehensible. I was left with no choice but to cancel my order. I have been a loyal amazon.com customer for about a decade and I have never been so disappointed with amazon.com service as I am in this instance.What amazon.com offers is a low price guarantee "with restrictions." At the very least, this should be noted in the information on the product page, so the customer will be prompted to investigate these restrictions. At the moment, the customer will most likely never discover these restrictions until they make a purchase and find a lower price elsewhere.In the future, I will have to seriously consider whether I am comfortable making purchases from amazon.com, when they have policies that are so misleading.
