Bought this during the under $600/free ship period in late '06.  Was looking to buy a true HD, but the price was very hard to pass up.  Did some research and concluded that ED would work for us considering how much $ we were saving, so we pulled the trigger.  Quick delivery and no problems with the setup/hanging (bought the wal-mart mount as others suggested).Here's my take on the TV:- Picture is great with HD signal.  I didn't know what to expect the HD 1080i signal to look like on an ED monitor, but I would say that if I didn't know it was ED, I'd certainly think it was HD (as long as I didn't get too close).  Colors are bright and crisp, blacks are dark, etc.  All around great experience.  I and my kids are totally addicted to DiscoveryHD now, and March Madness was outstanding...- Picture is better than true HD monitor for SD signal.  I've seen SD Comcast signals on friend's HD monitors, and this one looks a lot better.  Still looks awful when compared to the HD, but the upconvert is a lot less, so the picture looks better.  Same goes for DVDs.- Got a component hookup for my PS2 (yeah, I know I need to move up, but I don't play enough to justify the PS3 purchase right now, and the PS2 meets my needs).  It looks so much better than the RCAs.  Got Gran Turismo 4 (which is 1080i), and it looks magnificent.- Sound is awful, but I intended to hook it to my wired surround sound anyway, so I don't care.Very happy with the purchase.  We may look to get a true HD at some point and hang this one in the bedroom or office, but for now we are very pleased with this as our primary TV.
