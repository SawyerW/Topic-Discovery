Like everyone else, I read lots of reviews online before deciding which tv to purchase.  I ended up choosing this one because of the size, features, and price.  I have had the tv for just about two months and I love it.  I thought the size was going to be a bit big for my room, but I quickly got used to it.  Anything smaller now would seem silly.  I never even went into a big box store because their selection is not as good as Amazon and who wants to pay sales tax.There are only two minor problems I have found, but both can be corrected.  First, I initially had component cables running from my cable box to the tv.  Because of this, I had a faint red and green line continuously traveling up the screen.  I switched to a HDMI cable and the problem disappeared.  The other problem is the sound.  The speakers are in the back of the tv, so if there is a room on the other side of the wall in which the tv is positioned, they can hear everything.  A sound bar would easily fix this problem, but I have not purchased one yet.  As for the sound quality itself, it is perfectly adequate.  I watched Iron Man 2 last night and everything sounded great to me.The remote is easy to use, and I loved how the wireless internet device came with the tv.  I have had no problems with this and the quality of Netflix movies is very good.  They load in less than 10 seconds.  One last nice touch to this tv is the input selection.  The input button on the remote opens a full screen menu that has all selections in front of you.  The inputs with cables connected are highlighted so that it is easy to choose what you want without having to hit the input button many times to scroll one by one.So in summary, this is a great 60" tv.  Just be sure to get HDMI cables for it.
