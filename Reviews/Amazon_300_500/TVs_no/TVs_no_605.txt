GOT IT FROM POWERSELLERNYC IN LESS THEN 2 WEEKS UNDER 2400. TV LOOKED AMAZING RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.AFTER TWO WEEKS OF PLAYING WITH PICTURE SETTINGS AND GETTING HDMI CABLES PICTURE LOOKS SO STUNNING ESPECIALLY 1080I AND 1080P, INTERNET@TV IS A LIL SLUGISH, BUT ALL THE APPS ALSO AVAIL ON PS3 AND ITS MUCH FASTER. NO BUZZING SOUND!!  ONLY IF I MUTE THE TV I CAN HEAR A LIL SOUND.  SOME REVIEWERS COMPLAIN ABOUT TOO MUCH GRAY (JUST CHANGE HDMI BLACK LEVEL TO LOW ON ADVANCED PICTURE SETTINGS!!!) THIS SET BLOWS KUROS BLACKS AWAY!!!!BUTTOM LINE: PICTURE CANT LOOK ANY BETTER WITH RIGHT PIC SETTINGS AND  HDMI SOURCE: PS3, BLUE RAY, COMCAST HD, ETC.THANK YOU SAMSUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATE (06/15/2010) NOW FOR 3D:JUST WATCHED BRAZIL VS KOREA ON ESPN3D, AND I HAVE TO SAY I WAS BLOWN AWAY ON CLOSEUP SHOTS, IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION, AT ONE POINT I JUMPED OUT OF THE COUCH AND TRY TO SCORE THE GOAL WITH MY HEAD (GOOD THING I DIDNT HIT THE TV) :) THE 3D IS AMAZING BUT IT GIVES POPUP 3D ONLY ON CLOSEUP SHOTS,(MAYBE I NEED 1.4 HDMI, EVEN THOU IT SAIS THAT MY CABLE SUPPORTS 3D, OR BETTER HD BOX FROM COMCAST, NOT ALL COMCAST HD BOXES SUPPORT 3D AND MAYBE SOME BETTER THEN OTHERS) DONT GET ME WRONG THE GAME STILL LOOKED PRETTY NICE AND EXCITING!!! THEN I WATCHED BOXING ON HBO HD ONDEMMAND WITH 2D TO 3D CONVERSION, I LOVED IT EVEN THOU ITS NOT A POPUP 3D BUT IT FELT VERY NICE, THE AUDIENCE WAS CLEARLY EXTANDED AND I ENJOYED EVERY SECOND OF THE FIGHT! I THINK MOVIES AND AND SPORTS LIKE BOXING WOULD LOOK REALLY NICE ON 3D HD. BTW ESPN3D IS FREE FROM COMCAST AND ITS 1080I NOT 720P AS REGULAR ESPN HD :) AND IT TAKES LESS THEN 5 MINS TO ACTIVATE IT BY CALLING COMCAST. THE PS3 HAS A NEW UPDATE 3.30 AND THERE IS AN OPTION ON THE VIDEO OUTPUT UNDER SETTINGS TO ENABLE 3D OUTPUT FOR TV IN USE ONLY IF YOU DO IT THROU MANUAL OPTION AND YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY TV SCREEN SIZE (MINE SHOWED 58 INCH BY DEFAULT) BUT THERE IS NO 3D GAMES AS OF NOW YET :( ONE THING I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT THE SCREEN BURN PROTECTION IS GREYED OUT WHEN WATCHING 3D, BECAUSE 3D ONLY AVAIL ON SCREEN FIT, NOT 16:9 AND YOU CANT ACTIVATE PIXEL SHIFT. I DID NOT SEE ANY IR AFTER 2 HOURS BUT I AM STILL WORRIED SINCE IR IS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. I EMAILED SAMSUNG SUPPORT ABOUT THIS AND I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AS NEW INFO AVAIL.
