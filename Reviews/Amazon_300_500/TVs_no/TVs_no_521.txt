This is my first plasma HDTV purchase. The picture quality is fantastic. This is a NeoPDP panel (single pane of glass)The panel thinness is still amazing to me. A screen this big and this thin looks crazy.The sound is surprisingly good... the included speakers are also extremely thin. Not huge bass, but still very good for TV speakers.The wireless feature is nice... especially for those who want a wall mount installation. You still have the option to use an HDMI cable from the separate tuner to the panel, if you like. I am using wireless, but on a stand. The stand has glass shelves. I have the tuner component on a lower shelf. Line of sight between transmitter and receiver, for the wireless, seems critical. This may be since I have the receiver almost directly over the transmitter.The Viera Cast is nice, except I haven't been able to get the Amazon-On-Demand to play anything. It logs in and I can access content... nothing plays. I have contacted both Panasonic and Amazon... twice and have not received a comment from either. You Tube, Picassa, Weather Channel and Bloomberg all work well. Viera Cast could be a very nice feature if they can add more content... Vudu, Hulu, Netflix, etc. would be nice.The THX picture setting option has a yellowish hue... this seems to be inherent in the THX settings that Panasonic is using.ProsPicture qualityTHIN screenConsPrice (although I did get this well below MSRP)Amazon-On-Demand doesn't play (has been corrected by firmware update see below)2/4/10I contacted Panasonic about the inability to stream Amazon VOD content. They were able to replicate the same problem on a TC-P54Z1 at their facility. Panasonic kept me posted via e-mail about their progress with this issue. A few days later, Panasonic tech support issued a firmware update that corrected the problem. Amazon VOD content now streams through Viera Cast. Very good customer support!
