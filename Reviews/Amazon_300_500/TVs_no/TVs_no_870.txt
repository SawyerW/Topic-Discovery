I've owned this TV for almost two years now and it's caused me more frustration than any other item I've owned in my life.Pros:-Decent Picture, when it works.Cons:-"Smart" features cause too many problems.-Black trim pops off on it's own-The picture has a problem with repetitive horizontal lines being displayed, like a building with windows or a picket fence...  If the camera is moving, these move around and don't look right.-DOA remote control that was replaced by Toshiba right after I bought it. (I couldn't even set it up until a new remote was mailed to me taking over a week)-Takes a long time to turn on or power off.-Mine bugs out and the screen turns completely grey.  This started after owning the TV for a few months.  It took several months after that to finally get Toshiba to back order a new screen for a technician to come out and replace.  After them making me wait 3 months to repair my TV, they replaced the screen (the bulk of the cost of the entire TV) and it didn't fix the problem.Luckily, I still have a Square Trade Protection Plan to try to get to help with the repairs/replacement.  I couldn't rely on it while the TV was still in warranty because of the plan policy.  We'll see how this goes...  I'll update in the future, possibly giving kudos to Square Trade.Even after the run around with customer service redirecting me to different representatives and making me repeat my problem over and over, if they replaced my TV instead of making me wait three months for a back ordered part that they were wrong about needing to be replaced, I would have been more satisfied, but as it is, I'll never buy from Toshiba again.  I'd recommend the same to anyone else.
