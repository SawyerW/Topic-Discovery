I was afraid to purchase something this large mail order and held off for a long time waiting on the local prices to drop but in the end the savings were just to great so I took the plunge.  The delivery only took 5 days, coming in 4 days early (yay), and went fairly smoothly (slight mix up about the actual delivery day).  It was handled by Eagle since I purchased this directly from Amazon.  I have HD cable service through Cox.  The HD images are superb, especially sporting events, though all of the cable HD content looks great.  The SD programming looks MUCH better than I expected even when it is zoomed to fit the screen.  Do not use what you see in stores as a reference because their video feeds must be terrible.  I was worried that SD programming would be unwatchable but it is not a problem.  I also don't see any banding or cloudiness issues I have seen the videophiles complain about.  Personally I think they are being hyper-critical when looking for faults.  This set has great black levels when adjusted properly.  The default settings are way too bright, but a little searching online will find good setup defaults to use for the best possible performance.  The Aquos 42D64U is a great value in terms of features and performance.  The picture and sound are excellent and it has a nice set of tweakable items to play with.  The design of the TV is classy and looks nice sitting in the room.  I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone.  Actually I have already made another sale for Sharp because my best friends father just ordered one based on our praise.  I am very pleased with my purchase and you will be too.  Don't forget to purchase a couple of budget HDMI cables to go with it.  You will want them for the easiet and cleanest connections you have ever seen.  You can order them from Amazon for less than 10 bucks.
