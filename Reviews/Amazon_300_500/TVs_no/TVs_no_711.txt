I have had this TV for two days and so far I am beyond pleased.  I already returned a 46" Samsung and a 46" Phillips LED-LCD for lack of color and picture quality.  The Samsung was alright and the Phillips was abysmal.  I LOVE this TV, it has a very crisp picture and clarity second to none.  I personally love the Vibrant preset with a few minor adjustments, as it is most like the bright and colorful plasmas out there without the worry of glare or burn in.  If you have been looking around for a great LCD at an amazing deal you can't go wrong with this one!  I bought the TV in "like new" condition from amazon deals and must say it truly was like new(still had the product registration card) and I saved $220 off the new price.  What a deal!! Highly recommend Amazon, LG and Amazon Wharehouse Deals for all who read this.  Also, the Standard setting is the most "natural" looking if that's what you are into, I just feel like the Vibrant has more pop and crisper whites.....No lack of video adjustment options to make it your own too.*UPDATE* 4/6/11: If you like the bright/crisp picture of a Plasma try these setting.
