I generally agree with the reviews already here.  This 46" HDTV replaced a 20-year old 21" CRT TV so needless to say I was a bit overwhelmed with the viewing experience after I got it up and running.  (Unlike a previous reviewer, the delivery service Amazon used refused to deliver the TV past my garage door.)  The assembly/wiring instructions provided with the TV were relatively straightforward.  The only agonizing aspect of the setup was when it was searching for channels when the TV is first powered up; it took about 15 minutes.  I've had it for about a week now and am immensely pleased with the product.  It took a while to get used to watching a screen this large in my family room.  I was planning on purchasing a smaller screen size, but I went with the guidelines with the product description on Amazon for 12 feet viewing distance.  The HD channels available through my cable service (which provided an HDMI cable for me) look fantastic.  The DVDs I've played look fantastic as well; I have it hooked up through the yellow Video 2 port (which from what I am told is the worst way to configure my DVD player which does support 1080p).  Nevertheless, like I said it still looks great.  I can't really evaluate the sound quality as I have the TV set up through my home theater system.  When I have had the volume on the TV on, it didn't seem all that special.  The TV seemed a bit pricey overall and only modestly less expensive to purchase from Amazon than from the sony.com website, but I think my investment overall was a worthy one.  The Eco-friendly features were just icing on the cake as I always try and shop for energy-saving products.  (And yes, I own a hybrid car too!)  I would definitely recommend this TV.
