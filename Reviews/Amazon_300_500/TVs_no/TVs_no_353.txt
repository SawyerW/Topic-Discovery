My wife and I had been looking into switching from our antiquated CRT to an LCD/plasma HD flatscreen for around a year now. We did countless hours of research and price comparisons, as well as visits to brick and mortars like Fry's to see what these sets were all about. In the end, the Samsung 650 stood head and shoulders above the rest: price, it being an LCD, the 50K:1 contrast ration, 120 Hz refresh rate, and its visual aesthetic (the red beveling) were our main reasons for choosing this particular set.We purchased the set on a Saturday. On Sunday we received notification that it had shipped via courier (CEVA, I believe). By Tuesday the set had arrived at the closest major airport, and CEVA called and emailed to arrange delivery. The only hiccup was that they initially delivered a day before they were supposed to, but we rescheduled with little fanfare. Once it arrived, we unwrapped the packaging and had it up and running within 30 minutes, without even reading the manual. Pretty amazing, really. I would recommend getting some cheap HDMI cables (Premium Gold Series 6ft / 2m Hdmi 1.3 Certified Cable for Ps3, Blu-ray) via Amazon unless you want to spend $50+ at a box store like Target. Also consider some sort of mounting system (Sanus VMPL50B Universal Flat Panel TV Wall Mount Bracket, Black). And if you're going to receive digital signals for free via antenna, get an HD-capable one on here.As a post-script, after we purchased our set the price decreased; I wrote Amazon to this effect and within 15 minutes of my email I received a credit for the price difference to my account. Overall, I'm incredibly satisfied by the purchase of this high-ticket item; the other reviewers seem to feel the same. The picture, sound, and visual appeal of this LCD is beyond my (high) expectations. The set is also surprisingly lightweight (we have the 46" size).
