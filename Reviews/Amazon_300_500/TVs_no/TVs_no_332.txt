For starters, the set was delivered by Eagle USA. Some people have reported bad experiences with them. For me, everything went perfectly.I've only had a couple hours to play with the TV, and then only with daytime fare. (Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Eagle showed up at 7:00 am just like they said they would.) (Note to any retailers who deliver and set up HDTVs at the customer's home: You should do this job in late afternoon so the customer's first viewing experience is during prime time.) The TV is currently hooked directly to the cable, so the only HD content I can get right now is the network broadcast stations in New York. Only one is broadcasting in 1080i, and the picture is remarkable. All the hype you've heard about HD providing a 3D kind of effect is true.Now the bad news. The other broadcast stations are broadcasting what they call HDTV at 720p. The picture is actually worse than SD. I think they're taking an SD signal and encoding it at 720p. The result is crystal clear compression artifacts. I blame that on the broadcaster, not the TV. The TV actually does a very good job of enhancing SD content, but when a digital signal comes in, they probably assume (naively) that the people at the source knew what they were doing.I can highly recommend this TV for its quality, features, etc. But it's only as good as the signal that goes into it. Make sure you know what you're going to be able to watch. Just because something comes over the air as HDTV doesn't mean it was HDTV all the way back to the camera. Upsampling a low quality signal to HDTV makes things even worse. And when something is called "digital", watch out. That's going to be 480i, and it could be so compressed that it will look like a third generation videotape in EP mode.
