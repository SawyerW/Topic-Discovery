I purchased a Syntax LT30HV nearly 10 years ago for approximately $1,300.  It's been used regularly for the past 10 years with no issues at all.  This is an early LCD TV that was modeled after the top-ranked Sharp Aquos models of the same vintage (about 2003-2004).  The speakers are detachable and any other stereo speakers may be directly connected to this TV in their place.  The 720p image is extremely sharp as noted by other reviewers.  The image driven from a laptop or computer via the DVI port is equally sharp.  Just amazing, really.  Standard definition channels are hit or miss, but are generally acceptable.Comparing 10 year old flat-panel TVs to new ones, is interesting.  The Syntax feels like a tank, very well made and very heavy, while new TV's feel flimsy and light.  Of course, new ones are a fraction of the cost (about one tenth), the picture is higher resolution and multiple HDMI ports are available.  Just the Syntax carton is a work of art, a double box design mad from high-quality cardboard.I had a Roku 2 XS hooked up to it for a while using just the analog inputs and it looked fine.  On a whim, I purchased an HDMI to DVI adapter via eBay for $2 and connected the Roku's HDMI output to the Syntax DVI with the adapter.  Wow!  A nice crisp 720p image.  Sound does not travel over DVI, so I also hooked up an audio cable between the Roku's analog out and the audio in on the Syntax.  Success!  The Roku apparently (and thankfully) outputs simultaneously via both the analog and HDMI ports.The worst thing that I can report is that via the remote, source switching is overly complicated.Wrapping up, this had been a really nice TV and it will continue to be used in a guest bedroom.
