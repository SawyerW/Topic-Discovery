After years and years of suffering with a smaller screen, I finally splurged and went out and bought one of these bad boys.  I was not disappointed at all!!I did a ton of research on the web and then went and looked at the ones I liked at the local "Best Buy".  I even brought in my favorite DVD to see how the different models looked in a familiar show.  For the price, this was the one I went home and bought online at Amazon.Why in the world would anyone want to lug a piece of equipment like this anywhere when you can have it delivered for free from Amazon!!  My delivery was perfect, but I understand there needs to be a little flexibility when you have to ship this stuff by a heavy weight carrier.  I love the fact they bring it in and let me inspect the TV for damage.The sound is pretty decent. I don't even feel the need to fire up the sound system for daily TV viewing any more:).The picture is outstanding. I never noticed how much stuff gets purposely blurred out in TV shows before now.  Thing like license plates, a protruding nipple, that bloody scene on ABC. It is amazing some of the stuff they blurred out in shows that I never even noticed before getting this TV.The number of connectors is satisfactory.  A network connection would be that extra nice touch.  With all the HDMI stuff coming out now days, a 3rd one of those would be handy eventually as well. The USB connection for possible updates was a huge relief to see.  I think I might even be able to play some picture from it, but I haven't given that a try yet.Overall, a very solid buy after having it almost 6 month!
