First off, I am moving into new house so I had about 3 months to decide what HDTV I was going to move on. Of course I was between LCD/LED Full Array and edge lit. I was waiting for the Sony 909 to come out until I made my decision. I looked at the Samsung's 8000/9000 etc. I wasn't big on 3D but if it had, so be it. No Doubt, the Samsung 9000 is an awesome set for 2D but 3D, no so much and for the price tag WOW. I also looked at Shard/Toshiba/LG all had good points but not the TOTAL PACKAGE. Then came along the Panasonic vt25 PLASMA. I have never been a real big plasma guy, but because of the reviews I decided to take a look at it. Great picture, No Doubt, but the design was such a disappointed. I am hanging this HDTV on my wall and the wife would not want this thick huge set hanging on the wall. So I was convince Samsung LED or Sony 909 when it cam out was the direction that I was going to go. Then I happened upon Samsung pnc 8000, Holy crap.....Awesome 2D....Awesome 3d and as thin as a LED/LCD and OMG CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. I got it from Electronic Expo for 1700.00 with 3D starter kit. The reviews on this set are awesome...one negative thing that I read was about a Buzzing sound from the set. I hear absolutely no buzzing sound, it might be due to the plug change on the set. The plug is huge so caution when running it through walls. Watching Dave Matthew's/Tim Reynolds Bluray is unbelievable almost moving. 3D is just as good if not better then the Panasonic VT25. Black levels, 2D to 3D conversion bla, Bla, Bla. THIS is the set stop looking.  Buy it. With the savings I brought another TV for the Bed room Samsung 5 seriesAwesome Set.I would pay twice as much for it.
