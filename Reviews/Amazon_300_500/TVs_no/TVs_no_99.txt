I've had this TV for about a month and I'm quite impressed with the image quality running from a HD source.  The problem is that if you don't have a HD source like cable (Direct TV) or a DVD with HDMI or SVideo connected to it.... then you'll get the normal video source which can be a let down if your video signal is not OK.  The main issue here is that there's people that still think that because this TV is HDTV capable, that then it'll improve the image source one already has and this is definitelly not the case. And here's where buyers should be carefull since the electronic shops which carry HDTV units have them hooked up to HD TV signals and that's when people get convinced that they need one of these. Now if you're going to hook it up to a Home Theater then this is a very good choice for the value and the features given.If you happen to own an Xbox 360 (which I hopefully will one day, now I've got the first Xbox), then the image should be impressive.  I've already hooked this unit to my Xbox and a Toshiba RD-XS52 DVD Player/Recorder and with something like this you definitely take advantage of the features the n3260w has. The  RD-XS52 comes with HDMI cable and setting of up to 1080p resolution and with it, you really start to notice the difference between a good video signal and a poor one.The n3260w's colors are very crisp though you need to do some tweaking like other reviewers have explained and the menu for the TV is not the best one out there, I'm still having trouble with the PiP.These cons put aside.... this unit is definitely worth the money and should be wall mounted since it really looks nice that way.  The wall mount kit is a very solid one and I would say it guarantees your TV won't fall of the wall if it is mouted correctly due to the materials from which it has been made.I would've given the TV a 5 star review but I'm still working on the PiP configuration and have struggled with the menu but other than that I definitely recommend this purchase.
