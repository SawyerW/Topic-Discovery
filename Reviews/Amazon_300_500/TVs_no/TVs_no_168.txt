Ordered the TV on October 2 - had it delivered on the 12th - could have had it delivered a day or so earlier, but I was golfing...Eagle service was excellent.  I contacted them as soon as I saw on the Amazon tracking system that the TV was on its way to San Diego from Reno and set up the delivery. Eagle also sent me a letter which arrived on the day the set was delivered.  The delivery guy was ontime, courteous and helpful.  He gave me enough time to verify that the set was not damaged and would at least power up without serious screen problems.  He took the packing box.  When I got the set fully hooked up to the cable DVR box, it was apparent that the picture quality was substandard.  I called Samsung and talked to a very knowledgeable CSR who finally was able to determine that my cable company was not delivering an HD signal.  A call to Time Warner solved the problem...turns out that my DVR (which I had installed a couple of months earlier) was not set to pass through HD signals...a quick checking of a couple of boxes in the Motorola MOXI HDTV setup screen instantly brought in a crystal clear high definition picture.Surprisingly, the Samsung 3251D manual says (in small print) "If you watch a still image or the 4:3 mode for a long time (over 2 hours), an image may be burned into the screen.  View the 16:9 mode as much as possible."  Haven't heard that one before in regard to LCD screens.If you register your purchase with Samsung (by mail or web), you get a three month warranty extension.Back to the TV, I can't believe that Consumer Reports, in their November electronics issue, ranked the 3251D 8th in a group of fifteen 32 inch LCD TVs.  I looked at the Sony, Panasonic, and Sharp models they rated higher, and bought the Samsung.As an aside, I also got the el cheapo Zenith Silver Sensor HDTV antenna ($20 from Amazon) and to my amazement, it pulls in all the San Diego HD stations from 35 miles away.
