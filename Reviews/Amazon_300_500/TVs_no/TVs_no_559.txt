Great TV!!! We saw a 8000 model in BestBuy and were looking to buy that. I did some research and in the end settled with this 7000 model. I feel the picture is just the same and also I saved $400 by going with this.We checked out the Sony also, but feel that the Samsung had a superior picture. The picture is absolutely amazing, both with BluRay and also HD TV stations. The picture is extremely clear and adds depth to the picture. Once you put the glasses on it adds a fun 3d experience. Although currently there are limited 3d movies titles available. I believe a lot more will be released later in 2011. Also be aware that the glasses are currently $150 each!We got a great deal. Along with the TV we received a free 3d BluRay player and Shrek starter kit (x2 glasses and Shrek 1, 2, 3 and 4).Be aware that this 50" is plasma, whereas the other sizes are LCD. Plasma actually offers a slightly better picture quality to LCD with deeper blacks; but it is not good for video games. You could experience the image being burnt in with excessive playing. If you want to play video games on this TV, I would recommend one of the other sizes which is LCD.As with most TV's the speakers on the TV are not up to par. I would recommend that you add some kind of sound system. I went with a Pioneer 920 receiver, with BIC America DV62si speakers with a BIC America center speaker and F12 subwoofer. All can be had on Amazon for about $700 with free shipping. The sound is amazing and matches the picture. It really gives you the full "theater" experience.I also recommend the square trade extended warranty. It is pretty reasonably priced and protects your purchase. I find modern day electronics don't last that long and it is a nice piece of mind to have the warranty.
