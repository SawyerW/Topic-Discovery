I couldn't be more pleased with this television.  The contrast that this set offers both with its 50000:1 ratio and its screen technology is phenomenal (the 530 and lesser models do not provide the same "pop" because they lack 1 or both of these two factors).  Seen side by side in the stores there is no comparison in the blackness of the blacks this set delivers(at least in its/my price range).This brings me to my second point - value.  Purchased from Amazon (just before Thanksgiving)for $1500/no tax/free shipping/24 months interest free, this set is cheaper than the lesser but ever popular and well rated 550 model in stores and only $200 more than it online.  The $200 is well worth the increased contrast obtained from the 650, in my opinion.  No problems with the free CEVA shipping offered by Amazon.  They even allowed me to pick up the set at their local distribution office (ok, I was excited to get it).In addition, if that weren't a great enough value - I got a Samsung 1500 Blue Ray player for $198 with $200 instant rebate on Amazon when I purchased them together.  I've been smiling everytime I see these players for $199 in "Doorbuster" Christmas sales.  Incidentally, if you are new to the HD game like I was, please note that the difference in the quality of picture you achieve from HD programing vs. Blu-ray if astounding.  Do yourself a favor and invest in a Blu-ray player.  As one reviewer I came across in my research said, the picture on the 650 (especially using blu-ray) looks like you're looking out a window.  It's that good.My only other suggestion is to invest in (at least a cheap) Harmony remote, like the 550 ($50 on sale).  You will not regret the incredible ease of use and simplicity it provides by allowing you to switch back and forth between dvd and tv watching without scrolling through menus to change the input, which can become cumbersome.
