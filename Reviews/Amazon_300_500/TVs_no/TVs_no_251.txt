When I was shopping for a new HDTV this spring, I did a search of everything I wanted in one. The 62U popped up right away because it has everything. And it all works fantastic too. The built in ATSC tuner is stunning! I had a digitalstream external tuner for my last TV and it was very touchy. I had to readjust the antennae all the time. Not so with the 62U. There's still the occassional adjustment, but for the most part everything comes in beautifully all the time.Let me get to the problems with this set. Aquos are notorious for banding, both horizontal and vertical. Mine has it too, but it is pretty subtle. You only notice it vaguely on occassion and if you turn down the brightness a tad and maybe turn up the contrast a skoshe it's gone. It's not a big deal on my set, but it may be worse on others so you should be aware of it.Also the contrast could be better. The 62U comes with a feature you can turn on that automatically adjusts the picture to suit the ambiant light. That's nice, but it darknes the picture down. You may decide to keep this feature on all the time anyway because the darknening gets rid of the gray black areas. This is only in large dark areas so if you're watching Batman Begins for example it may become more obvious.Overall this set has an extraordinary picture, the built-in speakers are good and the features are very helpful. The digital noise feature is amazing by the way. Again it's a compromise sometimes because it can give a weird strobe effect at times, but it does what it says and eliminates all but the heaviest grain/noise.This set makes everything look as good as it possibly can, very highly recommended.
