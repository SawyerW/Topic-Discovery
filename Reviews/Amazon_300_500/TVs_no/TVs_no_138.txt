I have had this TV for about two weeks, but I still can't stop saying "Wow" when I enter my living room. This is my first HDTV and I live in a comparatively small apartment, and I think this Samsung is the perfect choice for someone in my situation (especially with the drop in prices in the last year or so).I ordered th TV from Amazon - delivery was ok, TV arrived 2-3 days before scheduled. TV worked right out of the box - I had already bought the necessary cables - HDMI and audio to connect to my home theater system, and a male-to-male cable to use the TV as a monitor for my laptop. As I am not watching a lot of TV, I bought this TV mainly for watching movies on my Home Theater and all I can say is "WOW". The combination of the awesome picture (great resolution and colors) with the deep surround sound makes this an experience I did not even hope for. Just make sure that you have the right Home Theater to complement this TV. As for TV channels - really good picture, but I don't have any Hi-def channels, so I can't say anything there.TV itself has everything you need - two HDMI inputs, monitor input, PC input, USB port, etc. Set up was easy - actually it is all automated, so just turn the TV on and it gets started. Manual was pretty easy to follow, remote was ok - my Home Theater is also Samsung, so they are pretty similar and interchangeable.The TV also looks great when switched off - no other brand comes even closer to Samsung in design and this TV has maybe the best design ever - black "piano" finish, not so boxy as the other sets out there.Overall, great TV with the right add-ons - namely cables and surround system.
