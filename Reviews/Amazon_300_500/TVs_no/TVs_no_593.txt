I've had the plasma for a little more than a month and a half now.Overally I'm very pleased with it. I'm a freak when it comes to image quality, and while this screen was my second choice after the Panasonic series, my wife got the last word as the design of the Samsung was much better (come on Panasonic, design isn't that hard!).Overall the image quality is great, and there is a vast range of settings to play with in order to get the image you really want to. It's also pretty easy to switch between modes, and for people who use different sources (bluray, TV, DVD, video games) it helps a lot.Likewise, I live in a very bright flat in LA and this plasma is definitely one of the best I've seen in a bright room.I unfortunately can't comment on the 3D quality since I don't use it yet thanks to amazingly poor quality of this generation's 3D glasses.However, there is one drawback which makes it impossible for me to fully love it. The TV produces a pretty loud buzz depending on the brightness of the image. This is something Samsung do disclose on their website, and that is usually inherent to plasma screens, however this is my 3rd plasma and this one is definitely louder, to the point that you WILL notice it whenever there is a quiet scene in a movie (especially if your TV is mounted on the wall as it reflects the buzz from the back of the TV). Thankfully 95% of the time it's ok, but if, like me, you like your sound to be pure and have invested in a good sound system, it's really annoying every now and then to get sound pollution from your screen.It's not a total deal breaker, but had I known that when I made my choice I'd have probably fought a little more for the Panasonic.And now one piece of advice: the other thing I don't like about it is the smoothing of the image. Quite frankly this isn't just for Samsung, as in general I've never seen it working great on any TV, but these smooth modes add an incredible amount of artefacts in some fast moving scenes (like for instance the flying sequences in Avatar), and it seems that TV manufacturers still haven't cracked how to get this mode to work the way it should.So if I may make a recommendation to anyone considering to buy this screen, MAKE SURE YOU SET UP YOUR BLURAY PLAYER TO 24p frame rate, and activate the "cinema smooth" mode on this TV (I think it even triggers it automatically when your source is outputting 24p). It simply ensures the TV works normally on 24 frames per second, like a movie does, and gets rid of all the judder in a much more natural way than the standard smooth mode of the TV.
