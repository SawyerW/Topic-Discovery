Just got this TV last week.  Overall the experience with Amazon and their shipping company was great.  TV was delivered inside the house and unpackaged.  From order to arrival, it was only 3 business days!The TV is well constructed as you would expect from Samsung.  The sound is great, the picture even greater.  Why buy anything else than a Samsung!  I have 2 of them now, the other a DLP.If you're considering a smallish LCD for a bedroom (like me), and thought about going the cheap route with D.R., Vizio, Olevia, etc., don't.  When you compare the features and picture and sound quality of these brands to the Samsung, it's worth the extra $200-$250 to get top quality.Setup was a breeze.  Nice side panel "touch" controls and a good remote.  Tons of connections in the back.  Very light weight. The stand is nice looking and functional, if maybe a bit loose, but once screwed in, no issues.Feature-wise it allows you to control about everything to customize the picture to your taste.  For a bedroom, an LCD screen is quite bright, but you're able to dim the backlight and the brightness to dim the image down to a more viewable picture that doesn't light up the whole room...without reducing image quality.  All the HDTV channels look beautiful, especially sports and HDT.  I have it hooked up via Comp Video, since my current cable box doesn't have HDMI.  I can't imagine much improvement through going HDMI, other than less cable clutter.  SDTV channels, while side-barred, are not bad either.  Maybe a bit better than my DLP, but it's close.Overall, if you're considering an LCD TV with 720p/1080i definition (I see no need to go with 1080p on this screen size,  Also-- NO ONE is broadcasting in 1080p and you couldn't tell the difference anyway at this screen size), this is the one to buy.  For less than $800, it's a great deal.  You will not be disappointed.
