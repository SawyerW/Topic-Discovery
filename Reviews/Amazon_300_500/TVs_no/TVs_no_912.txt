So you want to but a Panasonic Plasma.  You have three decisions to make:  Which Model, Where to buy, and When to Buy.  Here let me help you.We have both a ST30 and a GT30 in our home.  In our master bedroom there was a space built into the wall that would not allow anything larger than a 46" and we could not get a GT30 in a size less than 50" so we put a 46" ST30 in the bedroom.  Later a 55" GT30 went into  a small home theater room.  As such I feel I am in a good position to help you choose. Given that the 55" GT30 is $200.00 more than the ST30 it is a no brainer.  Buy the GT30.  The GT is way better looking and is thinner.  The THX video calibration is another plus but alone is not worth the price difference.  Both sets have great picture.  I would not call the ST30 ugly but it styling is bland and dated.  If you do not care at all what the set looks like or are strapped for cash the ST30 is your set.  If you care even a little about looks get the GT30.Where to buy... Amazon.  I bought our GT30 at Amazon in February of 2012 for $1,399.00.  Almost two weeks later Best Buy Dropped their price on the same set to $1,299.00.  Amazon then followed suit.  One E-mail to Amazon and a few hours later they credited me the $100.00 difference.  Of course if I bought the thing at "Best" Buy I would have had to pay sales tax and either schlep (carry) the thing home (it would never fit in my car) or pay extra to have it delivered.  Amazon delivered the product in 4 business days ( I scheduled it delivery on-line for a time that worked for me.. I could have had it sooner) for free.  Price Guarantee, Free Delivery, Price Guarantee, Liberal Returns and Amazon Customer Service makes it worth paying more to buy on Amazon.. but on this set I did not have to.When to buy:  O.K. on this one I can't give you much advice.  The GT50 is the replacement to the GT30 and VT50 is the replacement to the VT30. Both of these will be out in a matter of 4 to 12 weeks.  Do you want the 2011 model at an insane closeout price or do you want to pay $500.00 to $800.00 more for a slightly thinner, slightly better looking, TV with slightly better picture.  Reviews and previews of 2012 TVs can be found on CNET.  To me $1,299.00 for a 55" THX certified 3d Panasonic is too good a deal to pass up.  If you want the newest coolest set on the block, perhaps you would be better off waiting.
