I am not new to HDTV and have a critical eye when I look at the details.  I am very confident in saying that you will not be disappointed if you purchase this LED.  I'm so glad that I didn't settle for an LCD when it cost so little more to upgrade to this LED.  The picture quality is TRULY incredible.  If you're considering buying a 46" LCD, stop and take a look at this and look at it again after you consider other options.  You, like me, can have LED quality now at a fraction of the price you would pay to upgrade within another manufacturer's line.  I know four different households of friends and family with recently purchased LCD's and LED's (all of whom paid more than I did for this Samsung LED).  The fact that all of these households (men and women) agree that my Samsung has better picture quality and sound than what they have.  Note that some of them have added speakers as I intend to do, but I don't think this add-on will be pressing for me since I can hear it fine but want to hear it at its best at some point.  It's probably important to note that my friends and family's purchases were all within the past three to six months and none of them were new to HDTV.  I'm telling it to you accurately when I say that each of these households is sorry that they didn't see this set in a home before their purchases.What we may believe to be superior picture quality in a store and how we see them in our homes can be quite different.  Mine is better in my home than it was in the store.  It is truly exceptional!  I hope this is helpful to someone having difficulty making a decision.Ann
