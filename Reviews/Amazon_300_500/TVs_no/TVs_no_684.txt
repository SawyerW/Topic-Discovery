I saw this TV model in stores, and really was impressed with the picture quality.I got on Amazon and was even more impressed with the price it was available at.I'm now extremely pleased with my purchase.  What an upgrade from a 27" 4:3 CRT television, even though I considered that CRT to be really good quality in the picture department.  I'm using this TV in a room that gets a lot of daylight via a large patio door.  Glare is not an issue, and so much better than with the old CRT.Sound is pretty good through the built in speakers, although I spend most of the time watching with the sound run through a separate sound system.The Internet "widgets" are just fluff to me, and I haven't used them.  My other equipment already support Netflix and Pandora, which are the two things I ever want to use via my home theater. But I really don't feel like I paid extra for them being on the TV, as other TV's without them, but with comparable reviews to this model, were not significantly different in price.I like to fiddle with settings, and have to say one thing I wish was better is documentation about all the picture settings available on this TV.  There are many settings if you care to dig into them, but the manual does not explain all of them very well.  There are also some settings that aren't always available (visible, but grayed out in the menu), but no explanation as to why is given in the manual.  But there is a "Picture Wizard" tool built in to the TV, which got the picture pretty close to what I wanted, and I was able to get it the rest of the way on my own.Overall, I don't think one can go wrong with this television.  For the price point, I think it's a winner.
