I ordered this TV and it was shipped through Eagle shipping. I tracked the shipping as it went from Cincinnati, Columbus, and then to DFW. Eagle called my house on Thursday to schedule a delivery on Friday by 1:00 pm. At noon, Eagle called to find out how I liked my TV. Only problem is they never delivered it.Now Eagle claims it was never shipped by Amazon. Don't ask me what Eagle was tracking in their system. Why does a company call my house to schedule delivery of a shipment that they never even had? And why was this non shipment going from place to place. It appears they never contacted Amazon to report the problem either.Dealing with Amazon has been a mess. I called them 15 minutes after Eagle claimed to not have the TV. This was on saturday. They told me they would ship me out a replacement on Monday with 2 day shipping so I would get it Wednesday. I called on Monday to verify this and twice got connected to Amazon-India support. They suggested I wait until the orginally scheduled delivery date to make sure I wasn't actually going to get the phantom TV. They claimed to have contacted the "hardline" department electronically and let them know of my situation. I asked to speak to that department but they claimed there were no phones there.So I call back on tuesday to make sure the TV was coming. Of course they have no replacement shipping out to me. The support person was actually helpful and finally got another TV shipped but the estimated time of arrival is longer than the first phantom TV.So I got to spend a friday waiting for a non delivery. I got to make multiple phone calls to Eagle shipping and Amazon. I got lied to by Amazon about expediting my replacement TV. I had to follow up with Amazon everystep of the way to make things happen.Doubt I will be buying another big ticket item from them. Will not recommend them to others. And this is even before I get my TV.
