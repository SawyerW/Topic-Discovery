I bought this TV 2.5 years ago and I was quite happy with the price and the TV for quite a while. I have not applied a firmware update to it yet.The only long standing issue that I haven't been able to resolve is that for a dark scene on the TV, the TV will dim so much that I can't see the details of what is going on. This happens in dark and well lit rooms. I've tried messing with the settings and turning up the backlight and brightness, but it hasn't really helped.The picture is clear and crisp and the blacks appear quite deep. I got it mounted up on the wall with no problems and the side ports are really helpful. But trying to access the rear ports while it is mounted is a major pain.My largest problem started only 2 weeks ago. I've been using my PS3 via HDMI for 6+ months with no real issues. Sometimes it seems a bit slow for the TV to recognize HDMI input from any source, but it generally worked. But now I've had my HDMI 1 and HDMI 2 ports completely fail. I want to attach DirecTV and the PS3, so I need 2 working ports. But now I've found that I only have a single HDMI port that works. I haven't used the ports all that much and the TV hasn't undergone any real traumas, so I'm not sure what the issue is other than just poor build quality.I'm currently in the market for a new 60" 3D LED TV and these issues with Sony quality have me quite worried. I've more or less picked out a KDL60NX* but I'm having second thoughts now. I didn't order a 5 year extended warranty with this TV (didn't know that it was available or it was not available), but I guess that I will need to purchase one for my new TV.
