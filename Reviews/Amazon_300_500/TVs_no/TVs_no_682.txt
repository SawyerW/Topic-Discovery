Wanted/needed a new TV...but could only fit a 42" in the space I had.  I previously had a Dynex 32" 720.  After looking over all the Black Friday ads, I decided to go with Amazon's deal on the LG.  I did find some better deals on similar sized TV's, but the reviews and specs for this TV were great, and I didn't want to buy another TV in 2-3 years, so I went with a name brand.I got the TV for $700 and of course free shipping and no tax! It was delivered after about 10 days from a local business.When looking for a TV, I have also been considering upgrading my Tivo (i have a series 2) as well as upgrading to HD cable (i use comcast).  After looking at the picture of this TV, I decided to just save my money.  The picture is great! It is bright and clear.  There aren't any white spots in the corners. I have noticed the "soap opera" effect a little, but, that doesn't bother me.  Again, I had a Dynex with no HD.  I'm sure it would be amazing with HD cable, but I'm more than satisfied with my SD cable on this LG.We did get a Netflix subscription for Christmas, so I think I'll purchase the wireless adapter.  Also, I do have an Xbox 360 that I play on this TV.  It's hooked up with an HDMI cable and looks fantastic...no blurring or anything like that.It's amazing the quality that you can get for Tv's these days.  My neighbor spent over $3000 on his tv that's the same size (he bought it several years ago).Again, the TV is beautiful, picture is great even on just SD.  Perhaps some day I will have some extra cash to put towards HD, but until than, I am more than pleased with my purchase through Amazon.
