This is a great all around TV that I am very pleased with. Pitch black dark, excellent color reproduction and saturation, handles HDTV broadcasts, Blu-ray, and standard def broadcasts all well, and a good remote. It is also an energy star TV and the EPA website rates it at 155 watts when on and 0.5 watts in standby.The Sharp has all the features you would expect on the remote including some very advanced ones. They are all laid out well. The main buttons you will use are input, AV mode, view mode (dot by dot, stretching, etc.), and menu. Menu lets you set the different values for AV mode as well as accessing more advanced features like color hue. AV mode is the Sharp way to optimize viewing of movies, games, PC input, sports, etc. The only downside I have found so far on the TV is that I do not really like the standard and movie settings. I easily created a combination of settings on the user option that works for me for both TV broadcasts and movies. The game mode works excellent with my PS3 and it automatically goes into game mode when I select the PS3 in input and then back to whatever mode I had it on when I select my cable broadcast input. It also comes up with some handy and unobtrusive 30 minute time stamps for when you started using the PS3 input.I especially like the very decent picture with stations still broadcasting in standard definition and the fact that it is Energy Star. Besides the fact that the standard and movie settings did not work particularly well for the room I have it in, the sound is also just so-so. But I have it hooked up to a sound system so that is moot. I would also like to mention the Sharp website and the owner's manual both say that this is a 4ms TV not 6ms you see in the description. At any rate I am very pleased with the sharp, crisp picture, easy to use remote, easy to access picture options, and versatility going from HD to standard to PS3 to movies to sports.
