I was in the market for a 65 inch tv and as such I did extensive research and read many product reviews. Most of the reviews for this tv were good, and although I noticed that customers continually reiterated the fluctuation brightness issue, I did not see this as a warning sign since many of these reviews were from last year or the year before. This was a horrible mistake.Within hours of arriving, my tv started acting up and showing the tell-tale brightness fade. So I looked deeper into the issue online and saw that it could be fixed by an A-board replacement, which seemed to only take 20 minutes and should be free since I just purchased the tv.Mistake number two was calling Panasonic about the issue. The guy on the other end of the phone lied to me about my tv being a "lemon" even after I confronted him with the known issue and told him that since my TV was produced in November of 2011, this should not still be an issue. I told him I read the reviews, and that I only wanted an A-board replacement since it would be difficult to return the tv. He recommended I replace the tv through Amazon as I was still under the return warranty, and surely the unit I got was just faulty. I foolishly returned the tv. Amazon was awesome, and sent me a replacement for free. I just received the replacement hours ago, and again the product is acting up. I am returning this tv, getting another brand, and never buying panasonic again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV. Until they fix the brightness issue, this is like throwing cash down the drain. I gave this product two stars simply because it is one star better than products that may physically harm you after purchase.
