UPDATE 4/21/2014The Amazon app is finally working.  Changed stars to 4 because we love everything about this TV.Dinging it one star over the mishandling of the problem with the non-working Amazon app by both Vizio and Amazon.Review was previously entitled:CAUTION: 2014 model AMAZON APP UNAVAILABLE as of 3/14/2014UPDATE: 3/30/2014Ongoing issue.  See forum discussion "Amazon Instant Video app wont load of vizio" (sic)http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20video%20on%20demand/ref=cm_cd_pg_oldest?_encoding=UTF8&authToken;=&cdForum;=Fx3EQAX98ED5WQ3&cdPage;=1&cdSort;=newest&cdThread;=Tx12ES76FR1SBJPWe don't have cable, so I bought this mainly to watch Amazon Instant Video and Netflix.  Although the Amazon app is installed AND THERE IS A DEDICATED AMAZON BUTTON ON THE REMOTE, when you try to load the app, it comes up with a message from Amazon saying 'unavailable'. Some back and forth with Amazon support and apparently the story is that Vizio shipped it with an app that wasn't working properly.  Couldn't get any further information on when the update was expected.  So it's one of those "we aware of the problem and are working on it".  I used to work in tech support.  I know that line all too well.So if you are planning to buy this TV and use the Amazon app, DON'T.  I will post an update if they ever get around to updating the app.I originally gave it four stars because it is a nice TV, clear picture, good sound.  I have changed it to one star because this problem is widespread and Vizio and Amazon are pointing fingers at each other over with no resolution in sight.Instead of going through the hassle of returning it and getting a more expensive Samsung with a working Amazon app, I decided to keep it and get a Roku box.  Highly recommended.  These little things rock!UPDATE: previous purchasers mention that their Amazon app works fine.  I did notice before I bought this that earlier reviews mention that their Amazon app was working. Who knows what's going on with Amazon and Vizio.Here's what I am getting. An Amazon message comes up on the Vizio's screen saying "The Amazon Instant Video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application".  Then Amazon support runs me through the standard reset, then checks and tells me of a known issue with the 2014 model (please note) and that he's checked with development and they have no firm date for the update.UPDATE: 3/23/2014A commented reports hearing this from Vizio:"She told me that there is a compliance issue with the FCC due to a Closed Captioning standard in the app, and the app is being re-worked to comply, and should be updated and available within a few weeks."I was aware of the CC issue with Amazon and smart TVs but had also read ongoing posts on the boards about how the fix was being promised shortly.  Some of these posts are several years old.  Must be an issue with each new model. We shall see.
