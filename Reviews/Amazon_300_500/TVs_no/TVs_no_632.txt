I first saw this model TV at a friend's house over the summer.  He had the 50" model, and I was amazed because I had never seen a picture so clear.  I recently decided to purchase this model, but became somewhat concerned when I read all of the people complaining about "light leakage".  I installed this TV last week and all I can say is WOW.  I had a three year old 40" 1080 Hitachi plasma and comparing the picture and the sound from the new to the old television is like night and day.  It is like I'm there live with whatever we are watching...The picture is fantastic.I'm not a television critic or anything, but I consider myself a bit particular...I want good quality, but I'm not willing to pay a crazy (a couple of thousand for a TV seems crazy to me) amount of money for it.  My opinion is that I haven't seen a better picture quality on any television ever, and I paid under $1k for mine. I have no idea what some of the reviewers are talking about when they mention "light leakage".  There is no flaw whatsoever that I can find.  Of course, I'm not using this in a completely dark theater room or anything and I'm not really looking for a flaw with it.  I'm just watching it and am amazed at the clarity.  I've got a surround sound system, but the sound coming from the TV itself is much better than my old set and probably would be perfectly acceptable for most.I purchased one of the used-good condition models and I didn't have any problems at all.  All of the stuff including the TV was packaged as new.I would have liked to have had netflix, etc. available on the TV, but since I already have all of that stuff through my Blu-Ray player, I chose not to spend more money and duplicate it.  Probably would have been more convienent to have it through the television but I didn't think that it was worth the extra money.All in all, I'm more than happy with this purchase.
