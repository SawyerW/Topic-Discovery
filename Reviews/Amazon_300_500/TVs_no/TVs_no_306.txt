Research and past expereince lead me to this TV. My rating before the line appeared would have been 5 Stars. I couldn't beleieve my eyes after ordering this TV, it was on the front cover of Consumer Reports. Made me feel real good about my decission. Most beautiful picture and TV out there in my opinion.However, after only 2 weeks of viewing my wife noticed a Red Dotted Line running straight down the middle of the screen. Could be this line was there all along and only noticed while viewing landscape scenes on the screen with blue skies. When viewing a busy picture or one with multiple colors my red line is not even noticable.I emailed the factory to report the problem and was given a service company in my area. I called them, they called the factory with my description of the problem. I was called back by the service company that this was a problem Sony has had with this model and will replace the Panel (screen) as soon as it arrives. Bought end on December 07, now February 10. The repair rep is due here tomorrow. MY only hope is the replacement screen is a NEW one and NOT a factory reconditioned.Sony is a good company and I expect this will be handled properly and quickly. Although I have had to hold off bragging about my hot new Sony Flat panel because of this problem.I would still recommend Sony products, as this may just be an isolated incident.FYI - for the record, just before Super Bowl I went out to purchase another Flat Screen 42" for upstairs. I normally would have bought a Sony, but this time, I decided NOT to put my eggs in one basket. I purchased a Samsung 40" over the Sony just to save money and to avoid the possiblilty of this issue coming back to haunt me again.
