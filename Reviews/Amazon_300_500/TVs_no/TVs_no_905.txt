Looking for a tv can be a long and tedious process. You want to make the right choice.  You pour over reviews and develop a list of pros and cons.  Atleast I did.  It is easy to get bogged down the nitty gritty.  You can go on forums and read all the pros and cons written by well meaning people, if not a tad geeky.  They may point out things that you would never catch in the 1000 years. Fluctuating black levels?  Oh NO!  But, don't let that scare you from taking the plunge.  First off I worried about the shipping.  My goodness, how are they going to shipped this delicate tv from Japan to the Midwest?  I never bought anything this costly and this big.  What do I do if it is damaged, yadda yadda yadda.  Well it came in perfect condition, not a scratch on the box.  Always a good sign.  Well I will save you all the boring details but the delivery and set up went way beyond my expectations.  Totally satisfied.  I have no regrets about the process of buying/shipping through Amazon.  The TV is amazing.  The 3d is worth every penny.  I watched the NBA Finals last night through DTV and ESPN3d.  The clarity was unbelievable!  I looked at Samsung and LG and I think Panasonic is just a pinch better made and has a better picture overall.  I glad I bought it and I would buy it again.  I just wish it could play AVI files through Viera Link.  The 3d works great even at a distance of 16 feet from the TV.  Don't let the 3d scare you that is is just a fad, yeah it's early, but its coming and Panasonic delivers 3d in true HD.  Something that you will want.  100,000 hours will give you 11 years at 24/7 tv on or 22 years at 12 hours a day. I have no connection to Amazon or Panasonic.
