I wrote a glowing review on my Panasonic 65 INCH Plasma S2 TV.  5 months later, it blew out big time, and Panasonic was unable to get parts to fix it in a reasonable time.  I replaced it with this 3d Plasma from Samsung.First, the picture on 2d is clearer, sharper, and richer in color and blacks than the S2 which makes me happy.  The 3d is spectacular.  I tried the 2d to 3d conversion found in the menu.  It actually did convert regular HD TV programs to 3d.  It's not quite as good as made for 3d movies and programs but good never the less.This is much more complex TV the Panny S2.  There are quite a few apps, and updates through the ethernet connected feature is easy and fast. There are 4 HDMI inputs compared to 3 for the Panasonic.  It's about 40 pounds lighter, and the screen is about an inch thick compared to the 3 inch Panasonic.I had one problem connecting my 3d Blu Ray player (Samsung C6900).  I don't have a 3d capable receiver, but it does have HDMI inputs and output.  So I connected by HDMI directly to the TV to preserve the 3d capability, and connected to the amp with an optical connection.  The Video was fine.  The audio came out as pcm 2 channel.  I researched the the problem and scanned the Manual.  I didn't find any information that helped.  I called Samsung, and they had no clue.  They elevated it to a higher tier, but never called me back.This Blu ray player when first connected initalizes fast and easy to the TV.  There is no menu button.  I solved my audio problem myself by simply noticing a settings icon appeared on the lower right screen. That opened numerous menus including audio.  By selecting the audio out to optical, I got my 5.1 sound!  It doesn't seems to be able to play 7.1, but I'm still working on it. I guess it was my fault for not knowing that, but I could find nothing in the manual.I love this TV even more than the Panasonic.  I'm still learning it's capabilities, but so far it was a great exchange.
