tv is great, good picture, can't beat this tv for the (...) from a club store, trying to find a surround bar for under 200 that will enable me to hear the voices above the sound in movies for its in a large bathroom and running the jetted tub its hard to hear what people say without turning it up real loud, right now i have a computer speaker system hooked up to the headphone jack, i cut the two little speakers off of that system and added two good speakers, but still cannot control adjusting the voices to be heard over the background music like on my living room surround sound, not sure if this tv will work with a 5.1 surround bar or not, tried working with the equalizer inside the tv menu but no difference, i have hd cable, hdmi cables looked great, but had to hook up component cables because i have a toshiba dvd recorder and the hd box keeps giving me that dreaded copyright message you have to turn off when you change channels on the box, of course not the tvs fault, the cable boxes fault, so if you can find this tv for a great price its worth it, for my brother has a samsung and my parents have a 47 in phillips and the samsungs may have a little bit better of a color but not much, im glad i saved the money and bought this phillips, if anybody can help with a recommended surround bar to help hear the voices better please comment, i would love to hear someone that has this tv and the same problem how you fixed it, remember this is in a large bathroom so i just want a soundbar, not a surround sound system, don't hesitate on this tv, although you probably will be hard pressed to get this tv for one grand again, buy it if you can, the remote is just fine for me, i don't understand the big fuss, its not pretty but i have no problems with it, good luck
