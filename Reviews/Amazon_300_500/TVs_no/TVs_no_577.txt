Unbelievable TV.  Great picture, watching football and baseball games right now is great.  The colors jump right out at you.  Blu Ray movies look incredible.  The 3d is pretty neat, but it wasn't my main reason for purchasing the TV.  You may have to fiddle with the setting to your liking.  I thought the picture looked great right out of the box, I only cancelled the motion blur thing.  It created this funky (kinda cool) effect where it almost made the picture look somewhat 3d with odd panning and scaling.  I have a 360 and PS3.  I had to go back and play older games because the TV brings it all to life with incredible clarity and detail.As for the delivery.  HORRIBLE.  They scheduled the delivery between 9:00 a.m  to 2:00 p.m.  At 3:30 no one showed up and I called the courier.  They were like "Oh, ummm, yeah, we were busy, uh, you should get your TV at about 5:00."  I said "Hey, thanks for no heads up letting me know you were going to be this late."  Well, the driver showed up at 5:00.....by himself.  He said he couldn't get the tv into the house alone so I needed to help him bring it up the stairs.  I helped him carry it up the stairs, he unpacked it and started to set it up and didn't know how to put it together.  He spent the whole time cussing under his breath and telling me how tired he was.  I just plugged in the TV to make sure it worked and sent him along his way, being pretty upset.  I wouldn't have been so angry if I had bought a toaster or vacuum cleaner, but when you drop a couple of grand on a product and they treat you like garbage, that stinks.So all, in all, great TV, horrible delivery.  I would probably think twice before purchasing a large item from Amazon ever again.
