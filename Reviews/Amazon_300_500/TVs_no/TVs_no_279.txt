I purchased this TV new at a local department store in June 2008, just a few weeks before Syntax-Brillian (the parent company) filed for bankruptcy.  It was my first HDTV and I was so excited that it costed under $500.  It was easy to hook up but the TV's menu is very quirky.  Instead of showing you a list of your options, a small wheel appears in the corner of the screen.  There is also no "stretch" option under the Video menu. The channel search was also very slow during its first attempt, I ended up entering all of my channels manually.  After having the TV for a few weeks I let it automatically add available channels and it ended up finding channels I didn't know I even have with my cable package, including some in HD.  All I can say about the HD picture is WOW!  The picture is the best part about this TV and it is absolutely stunning.I'm not sure if it's a problem with my particular TV or if everyone else has the same issue but while watching digital programming on this TV the audio will sometimes go in and out.  On some channels it doesn't do it at all, while on others it will do it constantly, and others only sporadically.  This is VERY annoying and it makes me want to throw the remote through the TV every time it happens.  No other HDTV in my home does this.  There is also a problem with the single HDMI port.  When I turn on my DVD player, the speakers static and a green line blinks on the TV.  After anywhere between a couple of seconds to about ten seconds, it finally stops and the DVD displays normally.  I do not have this problem with my Xbox 360, but while playing a game the bottom section of the screen will flicker about every ten minutes or so.  I have switched out the HDMI cable but it's always the same thing.I love my Olevia TV but its quirks make it unbearable sometimes.  The price on bigger name TVs has come way down since Syntax-Brillian went belly up so I would suggest buying one only if you can get it really cheap.
