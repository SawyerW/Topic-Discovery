Five Stars *****:  TVFive Stars *****:  Service, Price, Delivery (from Amazon)I have several inexpensive LED TVs that are OK (as expected for the price) but still didn't expect a high-end LED to compare to the old cathod ray tube monster TVs or even Plasma as far as brightness.  I had my expections lowered and ready but had to replace my main TV.Well, this Samsung is absolutely awesome and worth every penny.  Cost was very reasonable especially when you look at the specifications (e.g., 4,000,000:1 contrast ratio) vs. Sams Club or CostCo great deal TVs at maybe $100 - $200 less!I'm not a big TV watcher at all but I think I'm going to marry this thing (my wife's OK with that I guess).Seriously, the picture is bright and crystal clear in bright and dark rooms. The sound is really good and I don't use my monster sound system much anymore.  Programming and controls are easy and very intuitive.  Analog channels and old black and white movies look great and very clear.  Go to an HD channel or movie and you'll be blown away.Service and price from Amazon were excellent.  Ordered it late Monday night and it was at my door by 11:00 AM Thursday - FREE SHIPPING.T shopped this very hard off and on for about a month online and at the local retail and this price at the time was by far the best especially considering the shipping and solid service.  It seems there's a number of shady online retailer selling refurbished TVs as new - who needs that aggravaion.By the way, per direct communications with Samsung - ALL of their LED TVs are sidelit NOT backlit.  I thought this might make a difference but believe me, it does not in this case.  So, don't get too caught up in some of the jargon.  This is a sidelit TV with better picture quality than alot of backlit array TVs.Enjoy!
