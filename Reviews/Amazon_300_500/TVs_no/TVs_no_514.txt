After purchasing a Sharp Aquos 42" LCD last year, and spending quite a bit of time doing research to find that particular set, I found myself wanting a smaller HDTV that I could easily put in my car and take with me when I travel to and from my work location.  I wasn't really looking for an LED, just wanting to find something cheap with a decent picture.  Then I saw this set from Sharp, and with the price, it seemed too good to pass up.  Compared to my 42" Aquos LCD I would say that this one is really nice, but I still feel like my 42" is better.  One of the top reasons is the sound quality on this set doesn't seem up to par.  I keep my volume at 19 when viewing, but there is a noticeable difference between this one and my other set.  If you're going to hook it up to a home theater system, I suppose this wouldn't really matter.  Of the 4 HDMI inputs, I have been unable to get HDMI Input #5 to work.  It has a ton of features so you can tweak to perfection.  The auto-contrast function seemed to make the picture too dark, but once turning it off, the picture is just what I want.  I love the remote, the button layout is about as close to perfect for me, very intuitive - the backlighting on the remote could be improved.  One function I really like about this set, is that its Menu options are Input specific (i.e. if I am using the HDMI port, it doesn't show Channel/Cable options, just options that relate to the HDMI).  The set is very light, easy to move.  All in all, I really like this LED TV, and for the low price - I love it.  Another great product from Sharp.
