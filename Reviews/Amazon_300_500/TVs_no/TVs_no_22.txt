Got the LCD Set (30 inch) at the beginning of March 2005 after reading all the feedback on here. Was happy with it, I don't have a DVI enabled HD cable box from TW New York so use the ypbpr connection and thats fine - HD channels look great but not stunning - regular channels are okay but it seems that they carry to much red and the controls on the set don't fine tune it out enough. I have a DVD and the quality was just as good as the HD channels through the component cables.Then the problems started - A flash to a blue screen for 3-4 seconds when their was a large influx of bright light (usually white) and back to normal. Tech support were good and sent a part (new tuner box) with in the week of telling them about this problem.While waiting for the part I noticed that one speaker was not working and contacted tech support again, but this time it has taken 3 weeks for the part to arrive even though they kept telling (after 4 calls to customer support and 2 from them) me it would be here with in the week.Part finally arrives and we organize for a technician to come and replace the broken/dud parts - this is done today May 2 2005  but the speakers don't work. So its back onto customer support.First guy Miguel (one of these people who completely rubs you up the wrong way from the start - and its not the first time I have had the misfortune of speaking with him) - tells me its this and that and we will send another part etc...etc. I told him I wouldn't be happy with that and that the part they have just replaced is defective - I hung up to calm down.Second guy Chris - I tell him exactly the same as the chief muppet above and first thing he said was "I'll organize customer support to replace the LCD Set with a new one", simple as that, no ifs or buts,I'll give them a chance with a new set and see how it goes but after that its refund time. I think this set looks good on paper and for the price but from what I've seen written about it on other forums their seems to be to many little problems to make it a really good 5 star product.ProsPrice, Set looks great, excellent cable connection set up choices, no waiting for customer support to answer the phone.ConsPicture quality isn't the best (to much red), sound is a bit tinny and not enough bass, some at customer support need a good slap for being rude.
