This is a very nice looking television -- thin and stylish. And it is an excellent value. Most importantly, we have found no issues what so ever with picture quality. In fact, over the air (DTV) HD programming looks phenomenal. It blows away the Directv HD quality.The first time you turn on the wizard makes it easy to get the television setup. Which is good. The TV's menu covers a lot of ground. You could spend a couple hours poking around at the various settings. Speaking of settings: one of the first things we ended up doing is turn off the dynamic contrast. For our tastes, it added way too much contrast, making many shows look like they were shot with a cheesy camcorder.We found an unexpected (and cool) feature when we plugged an Ethernet cable into the television: It automatically found the shares on our home NAS. This allows us to access the movie files (.mpg's) stored on the network and play them directly through the TV. You can also view pictures and play audio.Now the un-good parts (none of which are show stoppers)1. The built-in speakers are tinny and hard to listen to. When the entire television is only 1 inch thick, you shouldn't expect top-notch speakers. The upshot is that external speakers are almost a requirement.2. After 1 month, a stress fracture appeared in the corner of the bezel. It is cosmetic, but irritating since it is a new TV. We contacted Samsung about this only to find out that it is not covered by the warranty. From their site: "Physical damage (such as scratches or cracks) is not covered by your Samsung warranty. You will be charged for both parts and labor. We recommend you get an estimate of the cost before you proceed with the replacement." We're not going to pay to have a manufacturing defect repaired. It will server as a constant reminder of their sucky warranty.All said, we are pleased with this television and would absolutely purchase another.
