"I will rate this product on three parameters:1. How you use the product: From the outer looks at a first glance you may not like that much. As compared to other makers and even other lower model from Sony, this one looks much dull. I like the grill design of even the lower model 32L4000. Glossy touch on the outer frame adds a little shine to the frame, other wise it would have been the worst look-feel compared to the latest models of Sony LCD.I like the remote a lot. Allways feel like holding it, its so light and sleak, it works a little slower though, but thats not any problem.2. Things that are great about it: Good clear and sharp image. Good 1080P LCD for a decent price.First attahed this tv to my upconvertible dvd player with component cable. This setting gave good image quality, but nothing that i was expecting from a LCD. Then i replaced component with HDMI. This gave 1080i and i could see good improvement in the picture quality. I believe with blu ray player and blue ray disk with HDMI cable, the pictures should be excellent.3. Things that aren't so great about it: Poor looks. Brightness decreases when dark scene comes. It looks like you are watching a scene, and some one came and reduced the brightness for no reason and then in 2 to 3 seconds, again increased the brightness. Its really annoying. Many a times i have seen ghost images too. I complained Sony and it looks like these 2 problems are with most of the S5100 series of any size. They have a software upgrade released on 04/28, one can download it too, and they are sending that via mail. I have to see once it comes and that corrects these issues or not.Over all I would suggest you to buy from Sony but not at least this 32S5100 series.Accessories I Recommend: Blu ray player, HDMI cable"
