This tv was bought for a wall installation in a family room. The wall is opposite full length windows, and the room is quite bright during the day. The entrance into the room goes past the tv wall, making a thin profile advantageous.After comparing available sets in the 46-47 inch range, we settled on this Samsung. Amazon prime delivery was prompt. Set up was quite simple. The menus are intuitive. Sources are a DirecTV HD DVR and a Gen 1 Apple TV. Picture is overall excellent with good colors and surprisingly deep blacks (point of reference is the Pioneer Kuro plasma set downstairs...blacks are deeper on the plasma, but not as much as I would have expected). The edge lighting of the LEDs is perceptible, but I don't find it bothersome...the price of thinness, I guess.Speaking of the price of thinness, the viewing angle is unsurprisingly not quite as good as a plasma. However, the picture is still excellent from the vantage point of the one chair that is about 50 degrees off angle. At that point there is some minor color washout, but not enough to be bothersome for the casual viewing that we do in this location.I don't use the included remote,  I use the satellite box remote to control things. I have been pleasantly surprised by the speakers, which are quite adequate. For real home theater experience a sound bar or surround system would be better, but for casual watching the speakers are quite adequate, Both in volume and sound quality. I have been very impressed with the lack of screen glare, even on sunny winter days. There is no noticeable glare on this set, in lighting conditions that I would describe as difficult.I would not recommend this tv as a main home theater set, due to the slightly limited viewing angles and edge lit LED appearance. However, for a family room or other situation where a thin profile is advantageous, this set is an excellent option.
