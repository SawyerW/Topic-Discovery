I can't say enough about the Samsung 5053 or Amazon.com.  I think that this TV is simply the best choice in the 50" plasma range.  Sure you could squeeze a little more detail in blacks with the Pioneer, but the extra $800 you're going to spend just isn't worth it.  I also really enjoy pixel shift and whitewash (burn in features)  I think pixel shift really helps to reduce direct line burn ins, and the whitewash does a great job of removing anything that is left behind (I've seen some burn-in left behind from xbox360 as well as anamorphic programming.)  I was very impressed by this model's ability to handle SD programming.  I have my motorola 6400 box from Comcast set to stretch SD 4:3 programming into 16:9, and the Samsung displays it very well.  So long as you are at the proper viewing distance it looks just fine, no quality loss over a standard CRT.  This whole experience of finally buying and HDTV has been great, and my only problems are with the programming available.  We all know that it will be a while before there are a bunch of HD channels available, but until then I just hope that movies stop being released in anamorphic widescreen.  Before the TV came in I DVR'd 4 star wars movies in HD, only to be disappointed to find out that George Lucas apparently thinks that there is a reason to record in anamorphic widescreen.  For those of you who don't know what it is, its a different aspect ratio which will leave you with black bars on the top and bottom of your screen.  Very, very annoying, especially when the plasma is in the break-in period and more susceptible to burn in of the lines.  Anyways that's my little rant on anamorphic programming, but bottom line is this TV is great, I couldn't possibly be more satisfied.  This is clearly the best time to buy plasma to get your use out of it before SED displays become available.
