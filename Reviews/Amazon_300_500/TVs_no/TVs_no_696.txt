This is a great LED LCD TV for under six hundred.  Has all the specs I was looking for - 37", LED, 120Hz, 3 million contrast ratio at a low price!  Solid construction, all metal (stand and backside) except for the bezel which is a glossy plastic.  Picture is vibrant, clear and colorful with a variety of picture adjustments available to suit your personal tastes.  My video source is HD 1080 from ATT U-verse.  "WOW" is the family reaction to the outstanding picture...looks almost 3D.  It has a very thorough "picture wizard" to guide you to your desired video settings...just remember to go back and change the video from "standard" to your personal saved settings from the wizard! I ordered new and received new - why risk any problems with a used?  Shipping was quick. fast and free - ground UPS, no issues. I've read the forum discussions about the cheaper panel...mine is one of them with a "D" in the serial number.  It is true that there is loss of color vibrance as you look off center...maybe at 30 degrees off center.  If you always look dead on towards the screen, you'll be fine...but if you have a group of people gathering around the tv, those on the sides will notice the difference.  Think of your set up, placement and viewing angles before your purchase to see if the "D" panel makes a difference to you.UPDATE:  Found the same TV at the same price at Costco!  AND they had the better "W" screen in stock.  I went ahead and got it.  Now that I've viewed both the "D" and the "W", there is a noticeable difference with the viewing angles.  The "W" screen is seamless with no color degradation whereas with the "D", I could sit at 30 degrees off center and just lean left to right and see the change in color.The return process to Amazon was easy...didn't have to call or speak to anyone...just clicked "return item" and followed the on-screen prompts which generated a free UPS shipping label...just dropped it off at the UPS store and got a receipt with a tracking number.
