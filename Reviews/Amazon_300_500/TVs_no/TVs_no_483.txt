For the most part I am quite satisfied with my new TV. The first one delivered did not work out of the box but Amazon was quick to ship me a second one with no questions or delays.  5 Stars for Amazon.The TV picture is quite amazing in most ways; in a few situations when the screen is mostly dark it seems to have a problem with small areas that require being light brighter than the very dark surroundings.  The glow of a candle lit dinner for example will not be as bright as it would on a normal TV.  But other than that issue the picture is very good and all that I expected.The widgets work well but so far I have not used them to any great extent, it is much faster to switch to the weather channel for quick up date on the weather than to activate the weather widget for example.  The technology side of me finds the ability to be internet connected appealing but the reality is not too much usefulness so far.The built in library is also a fun detail not sure how much use it will get but again a good start to an interesting feature that could add value.I also purchased a Samsung Theatre and it is also connected to the internet I find the Netflix real time/streaming movies and the streaming music of Pandora to be a very useful feature and I also find that normal DVDs do look so much better on the blue ray player as it converts the image to almost blue ray quality.  I purchased the wireless dongle and it works fine but I also would expect a TV with a list price of almost $4000 not to have to have a wireless adaptor purchased separately!Over all I am quite satisfied with both the TV and Home Theatre, I have only had them a month or so, and time will tell if reliability will prove my purchase a good long time buy.
