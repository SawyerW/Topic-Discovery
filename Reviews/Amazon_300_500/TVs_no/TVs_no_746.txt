I bought a couple of these last year, figuring, at just $5, let's see how good an Amazon branded cable could be.  I recently got some cheaper cables from NewEgg, which were extremely thin, flimsy things with hollow, plastic-shelled connectors, and I didn't feel like they would survive a lot of handling, so I got these, hoping they would be tougher.  They are.  The cable itself in nearly a full 1/4" thick, and the connectors are nice solid injection molded units.  Aside from the brand name, these look and feel like other, more expensive cables, like RocketFish, Monster, etc., but at a fraction of those prices.These days, if you're spending more than about $5 for an HDMI cables, you're getting ripped off.  However, many of those cheap cables look and feel cheap as well; the insulation is hard and plastic-like, the connector housings are hollow sounding and the connectors themselves are sometimes loose.  These cables, while being a good thickness, are still quite flexible, about on par with the much more expensive Monster cables I have, and they do not look or feel cheap in any way.These do support 3D, as that was the first thing I tested with them.  The insulator isn't a shiny smooth coating and thus doesn't snag or cling onto other cables as readily as some other shinier cables would, which makes working with these a bit easier.I also bought some Twisted Veins cables through Amazon, and gave those five stars as well.  They're actually cheaper than these ( I bought a set of four for a total of $8), but for the qualities that matter, these are about the same.  As I mentioned earlier, these are at the upper range of what you should pay for HDMI cables, and you're getting a pretty good deal here.
