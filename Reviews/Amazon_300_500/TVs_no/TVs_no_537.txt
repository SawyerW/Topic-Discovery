Hookup is easy, picture is fine, no blurs in movement, sound satisfacory for normal TV (although you'd need a home-theater system for movies).That said, there are other features which are annoying as the devil. It takes almost a minute after pushing the "on" button before there is anything on the screen, and then a "Sony" logo appears which stays on-screen for almost another minute, during which time you cannot select a channel. Once there is finally a picture on the screen, three black bars appear, each about 2" wide, which stretch all the way across the top of the screen. The top bar contans information on the program name, the network and the cable channel; the second bar contains a program description (if there is one, or a note if there isn't); the final bar contains the NTSC channel. These three bars, which cut off the heads of anyone appearing on screen, stay on the screen for almost another minute. The same delay with the bars occurs every time you change the channel.The remote is not good, but I've seen worse. The "jump" button doesn't always work; it often skips channels. And then, of course, even though you might have wanted to check the other channel for just a moment, there is that delay before the black bars go away and you can actually see a full picture on the screen. There is a circular selection knob (similar to cell-phones), and you must push on right-left-top-bottom to move the cursor, then push the center to make your selection. You must either have small fingers or a stylus to use it.The on-screen menu is a disaster! You must step through several subordinate menus to make even minor changes. It is not at all intuitive or user-friendly.The bottom line is that although the picture is OK once you actually get one on the screen, I would not have bought this set if I had known about these annoyances.  I have other sets in the house which do not exhibit any of the Sony's faults. I'll never buy another Sony.
