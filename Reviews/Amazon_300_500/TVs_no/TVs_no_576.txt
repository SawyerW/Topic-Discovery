Super Sammy....nuff said!!! Wow what a TV. I was back an forth between this and the Panny TC-P50VT25, but I got a really good deal on the Sammy with Bluray player and all 4 Shrek movies. Let me tell you I am not disappointed. In, I am very very very happy I got this TV.Looks - beautiful silver finish with clear edges for bezel.Picture Quality - wow, wow, wow!!! I got the Spears and Munsil calibration Bluray disk and now the Sammy shows why it is one of the best plasma TV ever made thus far. There are settings for every detail. I don't think there is a real need for aPro setting menu for professional as you can virtually control everything.The clarity, color, blacks and contrast are excellent!!! You will be amazed atthe picture.Sound - very good just for TV speakers indeed although I plan to get a surround setup soon.3D - wow it is very good. The Shrek moves look awesome in 3D. I have not had any crosstalk that some mention. I was able to watch the Sony golf tournament in 3D and it was awesome!!! Lakers in 3D was incredible too. I can't wait for The Masters now.I really like the remote as well. Sturdy, lighting and good feel in my hand.I have my settings below. Let me know if they help you or if you have some others. Again this was the done with the Spears and Munsil Bluray (reviewed this as well).Mode - CAL-DAYCell Light - 15-17 (12 at Cal-NIGHT )depending on how much light get in the  room, I use 16 when sunny and 17 when sunny with snow, 15 on cloudy  dayBrightness - 58 (56 for CAL-NIGHT)Contrast - 88Color - 50Sharpness - 40 (I used 40 although calibration directed me to 0 actually)Tint - 50/50AdvancedBlack Tone - DarkerDynamic Contrast - MediumGamma - 0Color Space - NativeEdge Enhancement - ONPicture OptionsColor Tone - CoolSize - 16:9HDMI Black Level - Normalother settings are AUTO or OFFMy CAL-NIGHT settings are the same except noted above for cell light and brightnessBAM SUPER SAMMY!!!
