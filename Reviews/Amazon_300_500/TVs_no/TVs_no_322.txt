I researched the 81 and 71 series for as long as they had been announced (~ 6 months, since CES show).  I got all hopped up about the "100k" contrast ratio on the 81 series due completely to the new "LED" backlighting.  Well, at AVS forums, one guy bought both, and concluded that it only mattered when the screen was totally black (like the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen when watching a wide screen formatted movie, or a fade scene), and then only a little.  The general conclusion seemed to point to the 71 series being the sleeper hit so far this year (dunno about the xbr5, but some reports put this one right with it), and that the 81 series wasn't worth the extra grand or more.Too late for me, because I rushed into BB to pay up front for an 81 series tv as soon as the store had the sku in their system (4 weeks before they even showed up).  Yeah, I got to use a 12% off good customer coupon, but in the end I could have had a 52" 71 series instead of a 46" 81 series (especially seeing how heavily discounted they are now on Amazon).  The anti-motion options in the 81 are only available in "movie" mode, and are buried in the menus, and only has an on/off option, versus the 71's easy to navigate 3 level options for the anti-motion feature.The reviews point to the colors and picture appearing just about the same between the 2 tv's when the screen or a large portion of it wasn't all black.  Other than that....get this one.  It is worth the premium over the 61 or 65 series.  As long as you can live with a glossy / semi-glossy screen (versus the xbr4/5's matte screens), you won't be sorry.  As for me, I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and be one of those turkeys who uses the 30 day guarantee to return the TV and get a 71 series...it is a lot of money not to be totally satisfied with the purchase.  Best of luck.
