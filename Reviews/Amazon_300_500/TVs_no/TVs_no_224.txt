This TV is BONKERS! I'm not a technically sound person when it comes to the latest in electronics, but I'll try to make this reasonably understandable.Picture: The picture on this set is GREAT. The cable installer hooked up the HD box and I immediately requested to see Discovery Channel in HD. He flipped the channel over to a program about exotic snakes, the snake being profiled was the Black Mamba and seriously, the beauty of this creature was brought out to the fullest by the picture of this television. You could see the texture on each scale as is slithered by, it was awesome. Standard television programs take a dip for sure in quality and watchability, this I was told would happen with any set, and after seeing Discovery HD I can see why. I bought a $60 upconverting DVD player along with the television and I must say the picture looks fantastic, as adverstised I would say (much better than standard, not quite HD).Sound: I've read online that the audio quality is not that great on this and other Samsung sets, I have yet to notice this drawback. When I first plugged the set in I noticed that the sound quality was loud, but not as sharp or fine tuned to my liking. This was not a hard problem to fix, even for someone like me with little or no prior HDTV experience. I pressed menu, then Sound, and then tweaked the EQ to my liking, matter settled. My apartment is not small, I'd say it's a good sized living room area, the sound is really strong. Perhaps the sound issues come with more of a spacious viewing area?Gaming: My friend game over to play Gears of War with me, his response after a 15 minute online session, "You're TV is amazing dude. I can't believe how good this picture looks. I'm jealous man."5 stars in the 720p catagory.
