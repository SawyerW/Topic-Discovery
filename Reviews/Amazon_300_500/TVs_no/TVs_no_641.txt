I have owned this TV for about 6 months now.  When I bought it, I bought a Samsung Blue Ray player with it at the same time.  The two products communicate well together, so I can use the TV remote primarily.  Netflix streams in amazingly well through the Blue Ray player, so it has become my primary source of entertainment. The HD content on Netflix looks great on the TV.  "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" streams in at HD quality and it looked incredible!What I like:-It is thin, and with the specific wall mount, it sits right against the wall.-It doesn't use much energy.  It has had little to no effect on my electric bill.  I upgraded from a really small TV and was expecting an increased cost, but the bill has only gone down.  You will need to play with the display setting in order to see the savings though.-The picture is amazing.  The color and black levels are great.-Versatility: HDMI, Component RCA, VGA, and USB port all work great.  The USB media player works well, but some videos formats don't work.  Check the owner's manual to find out what formats work.Dislikes:-There is a lot of glare.  It falls between a matte finished LCD and a glass finished Plasma TV.-The premium cost.-The "Anyconnect" technology between the two Samsung devices can be annoying.  It is sometimes finicky and the Blue Ray player freezes occasionally because of it.-The "Settings" interface can be confusing.  It can be difficult to find specific settings, so make sure the owner's manual is readily available for referencing.-You will need to develop a cable management system to keep the wall looking clean.-Due to the slim nature of the TV, all my other equipment looks gigantic now.Overall, I love the TV and would recommend it to anyone.  My living room feels much larger now because it is not being taken up by a TV and cabinet anymore.  Buy a regular LCD though if you don't need or care for the slim nature of the TV (you will save a few hundred dollars for equal quality equipment).
