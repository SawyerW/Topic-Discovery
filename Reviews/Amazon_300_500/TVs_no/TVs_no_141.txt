Like your doing right now I read every review for these TV's.  I'm a pretty good researcher when it comes to this type of item and I might say that I was on the money with this item too.  (thats my horn you hear). Seriously the picture is better than I would have thought. The most amazing thing is when I installed this to my antenna, the HD picture I get is unbelievble. I have a standard antenna in my attic, with a signal booster in line. Nothing I had was for HD. My signal was acceptable before, and when you look at the  channels in regular mode they are still acceptable.  A friend was over and he had to look at the hookup because he didn't believe I had it only hooked up to the antenna. The pundants say you must have a HD antenna, I can't imagine the picture could get any better than it is now.  My wife and I watched some DVD's we have and it was like seeing a whole new movie because of the definition.I have a Mitsubishi large screen 50 inch projection tv with Direct TV.  The picture on this Samsung is heads and shoulders above the Mitsubishi even when its on the satellite.I will agree with the people on here about the sound. It could be better, but if you play with the equalizer you can get it pretty good.The only problem was with the infomation supplied from amazon and the actual shipping. It arrived when they said it would , but in the meantime every person I emailed from amazon  had a different answer and that my TV was being shipped to a different city. It was aggravating, but it arrived OK.More importantally, pay attention to the selling price on Amazon after you buy. As it goes down which it has twice for me since 11-1. You notify Amazon that you've noticed this , they will credit your credit card the difference.
