I purchased my television through Amazon's Warehouse Deals division. I purchase a lot of my electronics through them because they discount things an insane amount for having chips, scrapes or markings on them. When I read that this TV was for sale for under $500 due to a back-side defect, I ordered it right away. After all, who looks at the BACK of a TV?Well, I received the TV and found that there was no defect at all... until I started assembling it. You see, the screen was absolutely perfect - still in the plastic, not a scratch or mark on it - and the bezel was in perfect condition. The problem was with the STAND: one of the tiny little plastic pieces on the stand had chipped off, which made the stand relatively unstable. Well, since the other "stability chip" (the plastic piece that inserts itself into the back of the TV, effectively created the bond between TV and stand) was still intact and the TV required screws to mount it anyway, I decided to take a bit of a risk (for now) and mount it.It worked. Now I'm viewing a gorgeous, 40" LED TV with pristine picture and okay speakers (seriously, don't complain - this TV is so thin, about 1.5" at most, you can't complain about not having awesome HD speakers). I'm still worried about the stand... by the way, I didn't even receive enough screws to fully mount the stand to the back of the TV either. I got 5 out of 10 screws. Ordering a new stand and the screws through Samsung costs around $40, but I'm going to try local stores for screws and I'm ordering the stand through a different vendor for cheaper.All in all, the television is exactly what I'd hoped it would be, and since I knew I was getting a small defect, I wasn't surprised when I found the stand was a little busted. Still, I couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture and excellent features of this television. This is a must-buy product.
