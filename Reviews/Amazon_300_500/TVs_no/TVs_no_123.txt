After a year and a half of price watching and comparison, I purchased this plasma from Amazon for $1149.  What a deal.  Eagle shipped and set up in my house within 7 days of completing the order.  I use satellite for my HDTV and recently purchased a UHF amplified antenna for local channels.  I was shocked at the quality of the over the air broadcast.  It is actually equal to the satellite.  The picture is flawless and i don't get any buzzing that some of the other reviewers complained about.  This is the best TV I have ever seen!  Even the channels that don't broadcast in HD look great!  I tried cable HD but canceled and went with satellite when I saw the difference at a friends house.  No comparison.  I recommend setting all of the video to 50.  The vivid setting is just not realistic.  You can move the brightness and contrast up to 60 in a darker room.  Any higher and you do get some pixelation in some darker scenes.  I run my video through the 2 HDMI connections and my audio through my surround sound receiver.  I tried the internal speakers just to get an idea of the quality of sound and it was fine.  Can't really compare to a good 7.1 system though.  The plasmas in the big department stores don't do these screens justice.  With an up converting  1080i DVD player that I also purchased through Amazon, I am totally satisfied.  They say these plasmas will last far longer that the old tube tv's.  I hope so.  The only thing I would change about this Plasma is the gloss black frame.  It looks great until you turn on a light or get sun in the background.  If it was matte finish there wouldn't be any glare at all from the side of the picture but in a dark room that wouldn't matter anyway.  I really can't say enough about this plasma.  Best purchase I ever made.
