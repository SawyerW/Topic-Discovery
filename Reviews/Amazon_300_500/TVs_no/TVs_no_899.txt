I usually do not write reviews. Because I am just too lazy. However writing a review for this tv is worth the effort. I've been through samsung d6400 Samsung UN40D6400 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED HDTV (Black) and sharp aquos 3d Sharp Quattron LC40LE835U 40-Inch 1080p 3D LED LCD TV -Black (both 2011 models). But ended up returning both to Amazon due to severe crosstalk in 3d. Trust me, I tried all the settings to calibrate 3D on these sets but the crosstalk just didn't go away. Finally I thought of giving this tv a try. Let me remind you that up until this point, i almost gave up hope for a proper 3D on an LCD screen. However this tv proved me completely wrong. Its not the sleekest tv out there or neither does it has all the extra bells and whistles in the tv settings. However it does a few things and it does it right.The IPS panel with 240hz refresh rate made me a believer in LCD 3D technology. If you need a LCD panel that does the 3D right, then look no further. The only downside is that Panasonic, doesn't offer any screen size bigger than 37inches in their LCD 3d lineup. Which is a downer, however personally to me, I would pick a 37 inch over 40 any day if it does what its suppose to do.Viera connect is a breeze, and this is the only tv among the other two that i've used so far to offer youtube with account management. Did I mention the horrible light leaks I found on both samsung and Sharp? I am not trying to be a Panasonic fanboy here. Sharp and Samsung are both respectable brands but I sincerely believe that Panasonic is a bit underrated when it comes to tv's.Finally, five stars to Amazon for their excellent customer service. I will shop at Amazon, again and again!
