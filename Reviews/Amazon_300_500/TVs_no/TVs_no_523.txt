AOC L22H998 22-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVI've had this set for a week & bought it to replace a 3 yr old Westinghouse 19" LCD set that went up. I use it in the bedroom & have gotten used to the rectangular shape & the 5 second screensaver when the set is first turned on. There is a toggle switch on the back that can be switched off so you don't have to live w/the tiny, amber-colored connection glow. The picture is nice for a 1080 of this size-It has full, 4:3 & movie scale settings that you can set while you watch instead of moving thru a menu. You can also zoom in while watching wide-screen DVDs. Depending on the channel you're watching, the HD can distort on the movie scale setting. There is a Stereo setting for audio however it sounds a bit tinny & not full sound-even w/the surround sound setting turned off.The manual is printed in English, Spanish & French & The English is written well. It has excellent hook-up illustrations & full explanations of remote receiver functions.The remote is easy to use & has a Electronic Program Guide, list & favorite channel functions along with a sleep & closed caption function. Menu functions allow you to set picture/audio quality, time & channel locks. The remote is not infra-red so it is useless to me as I use a HDMI hook-up to the cable box. I can/t pair the tv to my cable remote to control the volume or turn the tv off/on w/o the tv remote. The manual does state that the EPG & list functions are only accessible thru the DTV setting which is disappointing as I cannot access the closed caption setting either.I've decided to return this set as I don't want to use 2 remotes & am researching other brands.
