After reading reviews about the GT30 I was convinced of two things, the first is that it was the best tv on the market outside of the VT30 and the second was that there was a chance I could be having to deal with floating blacks or buzzing issues with the TV.First let me say that the first part is true, it is the finest display I have ever seen. It does SD, HD, 3D and everything in between. The colors are perfect and warm. It's not too dark in a bright room, and the black levels are phenomenal. You could play almost any movie on this tv and it would be an enjoyable experience. THX mode out of the box and the TV looks great. So far I haven't adjusted or calibrated it at all.As far as the other issues go, I haven't seen any floating blacks or gamma shift issues. I watched Sucker Punch last night and the screens were nice and dark. I watched the bars at the bottom of the screen and they never changed color, brightness only shifted when it was appropriate. Secondly I haven't heard any buzzing from the unit at all. I've been trying to keep brightness and contrast down for the first 100 hours to break it in gently, but as of yet I haven't heard the tv make a sound that I didn't ask it too.Sound is a bit of an issue at this point, it's not great, but it's not horrible either. Most people who would pay for this tv would probably shell out for a surround sound system as well.Internet options for this tv are pretty good as well. Viera Cast has some interesting options, I haven't really explored everything yet, but I was pleased that the tv came packed with a wireless adapter.I am so pleased with this purchase. Amazon's 24 month financing is great if you are considering it. I got this tv with glasses and avatar for a massive discount over anything I've seen the big box stores do, so if you are considering it watch for specials (this was the second time they ran the free glasses promotion, I'm positive there will be a third).
