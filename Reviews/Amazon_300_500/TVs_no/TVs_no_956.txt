Before you purchase ANY Panasonic flat panel TV, do an internet search for "Panasonic Blinking Red Light".  I purchased a 46" Panasonic Plasma TV about 2 years ago.  I LOVED it!  It was the best picture and sound I had experienced in a flat panel TV.  I loved it so much, I bought a 32" Panasonic LCD TV last year for our bedroom.  That one, I didn't love so much.  Picture is not as good and sound is much worse.  But, back to the point of this review.About 3 months ago, the plasma TV started with an issue of the TV not turning on, but the red LED beside the power button flashing 10 times, pause, then repeating, whenever I turned the TV off, then back on within 30 minutes.  If it was off for over 30 minutes, no problem.  As the weeks passed, this got worse, with me having to disconnect the power cord, wait 30 minutes, then try again.  Then it got worse again, with me having to disconnect all cables (power, HDMI, video, etc.), wait 30 minutes and try again.  Finally, this week, nothing will revive it from the dreaded red blinking light.Research shows this is caused by one, or more, of about 5 circuit boards involved in the power management of the TV.  Repairs (of course it is out of warranty) will cost $500-$700.The worse part is, these boards were used on many different models and sizes of Panasonic TVs and this has continued to occur on newer models.  Panasonic should be ashamed of themselves for letting this continue.  Of course, they will do NOTHING for you out of warranty.  Class action lawsuits have been discussed, but as far as I know, none have been initiated.DO NOT BUY A PANASONIC FLAT PANEL TV OF ANY KIND!!!!!!!  You have been warned!  If you do, don't be surprised if it only lasts 18-24 months before you get the red blinking light.Do your research.  You will be convinced!!!!
