I was completely frustrated with this tv and Toshiba.  We wanted to wall mount the tv, but could not remove the pedestal/neck.  I called Toshiba because there are no instructions to remove the neck and they were no help whatsoever.  I was told repeatedly to remove 4 screws from the bottom and then hung up on twice.  These are the instructions in the manual to remove the base of the stand or rectangular part, not the neck, the cylindrical thing that sticks out at the bottom of the tv.The third guy told me to call their service centre in our city.  I called them and they told me I would have to pay for a service technician to make a house call.  Why should I have to pay for a service call?  How can they advertise this tv as wall-mountable and not supply instructions as to how to get the neck off.One of the other reviewers on this site helped me out and wrote how to do it.  I can't tell you how much I appreciated his help.  It was a simple matter of removing 3 screws above the neck and pulling firmly on the neck.  Seems simple, but the neck is quite firmly held in the tv and you really have to tug.  Who knew?As far as the tv is concerned, the picture is okay, the sound is a bit tinny and can't be turned up enough and there is no headphone jack to add speakers, it's nice to have the dvd player, but you cannot hook up an external hard drive and watch stored shows.  It only displays photos - no video.  This is our first flatscreen and I am not too pleased with the choices of the picture ratio.  Either you can set it so that there is a border around or on either side of the whole picture or you can get the picture to fill the whole screen, but it is either cropped or stretched and distorted.  Not Toshiba's fault of course.
