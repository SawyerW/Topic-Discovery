Ok I noticed alot of people that review tv's don't really know what there talking about and haven't done alot of research. I previously owned a 56" 720p Toshiba (which took me 3 months to decide on buying) and I needed to get something smaller due to space and also desperately wanted something to show off the 1080p capabilities of the ps3. I thought about purchasing a Sony XBR, Samsung, Lg, Sharp, and JVC. Putting the important factor of value aside even, this TV blows everything out of the water with the exception of the Sony's which it competes with very very well. I have watched all sets side by side repeatedly as well as analyzed all tech specs before deciding to buy this and it was well worth it. First off the people that say 1080p is not noticeable on a 42" screen are utterly insane-flat out. In my guest room I have a 42" 720p Sony and this resolution blows that out of the water. If you are sitting within 10 feet YOU WILL notice a big difference! I cannot place an emphasis on this enough and do not understand why people can think any different on this issue. Also, if like me you were worried about the new 120hz technology making its way into LCD's and whether or not its worth it..... well im very fimiliar with TV's and have a perfectionist eye for errors in picture and I realized that compared to older LCD models or ones that just plain out aren't good, 120hz is very superior for motion scenes. HOWEVER in comparison to this TV and other new, good spec LCD's THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE! Motion scenes look absolutely perfect on this and I actually noticed 120hz models sometimes suffering from a 3 picture effect where a moving football actually looked like 3 footballs.-So in conclusion this TV is unbelievable... well worth any price you can get it for and definately the best value for under $2k. I picked mine up at circuit city and convinced the guy to give it to me for $1300 with a 3 year warranty.... not bad at all!
