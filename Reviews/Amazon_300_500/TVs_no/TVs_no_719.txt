I like the last guy bought this LG at Fry's. In the store it looked like the most bang for the buck, when I got home setup was simple wall mounting was a breeze since its so slim and light the picture looks great in blue ray and cable HD however when I went to play my PS3 there was one issue that concerned me. When the PS3 screen goes black light bleeds through the edges most severely with the energy saving settings turned off. That is my my only complaint with this set,and I'm still contemplating if it's a big enough issue to return the set.the internet apps work well with a ethernet cable the set is wi fi ready the adpater is $70.00 one my favorite ability's this set has is the detail in witch you can adjust the picture setting's things like black level adjustment and even skin color adjustment's the sound is even pretty good considering the speakers got to be tiny cause the unit is so slim like a 1/4 inch on the frame edge maybe and inch in the middle. the apps are limited to yahoo, youtube,netflix and acouple other movie sites only so far.I have a XBOX360 as well and its never looked so good I've had several different lcd's before this upgrade to led and it makes alot of difference I still have the same issue when the screen goes totally black i may contact LG about it cause it comes with a 1 year manufactures warranty with the energy saving settings on max the light issue is hardly noticeable but it's still there none the less other then that kinda major issue this set would get 5 stars from me so I gotta give it a very worthy 4. Update 7-4-10 I've had this LG almost 2 months now i could'nt return it over the "clouding or blooming" after comparing it against other major brand edge lit LED sets all of them have this issue. So I've kept it now I got a new issue though were the set shuts it self off outta the blue even with the sleeptimer off .I've read some blogging about it and it seem's it may be a power supply issue I will contact LG about it and update this when I hear more.
