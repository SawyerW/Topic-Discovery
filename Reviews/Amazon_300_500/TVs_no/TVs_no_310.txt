Other reviewers have covered the technical stuff, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet.Pros: Outstanding picture quality in all modes, easy to use.Cons: Some screen glare, widgets not very useful.I've been very happy with the various presets and keep it in one of the THX modes most of the time.To give you some perspective, I've been in the video production business my entire career (30+ years)and the picture watching through my HD cable box is crystal clear.  I've watched 1 Blu-Ray movie and was very impressed.  I've watched football and there were zero artifacts during fast motion.  The screen is a large piece of glass so there will be some glare, as is true with any polished surface.  There is only slight flashlighting I've noticed when changing inputs but never during any programming, including really dark night scenes from the Blu-Ray.The audio is as good as the 32" standard TV this replaced.  There are different modes and settings, but it is not going to sound like a 500 watt system.  Keep your expectations realistic.The widgets as of this review include weather, finance, a few games and others ... too many to list but as far as I'm concerned, they don't add much value.  There are NetFlix apps like VUDU and YouTube which work very well. These are worth paying some extra.  When I hooked up the Internet through an ethernet LAN cable, it automatically checked for updates...pretty cool.Aesthetically, the set is good looking and construction seems solid.  All the inputs are located in one place on the back panel ... no front or side inputs.  There are cable guides so you can semi-hide the wiring.  This works pretty well.In summary, I'm very happy with the picture quality, which is why I got this model.  If you don't see any updates to this review, nothing has changed with further use.
