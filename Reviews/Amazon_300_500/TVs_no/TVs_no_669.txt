I have had the television for only a week, but I spent quite a bit of time doing a market survey for a television with the best picture before I purchased this one.  Samsung displays seem to be the best out there right now and the clarity of this television is stunning.  When watching Animal Planet, our cat is convinced that the animals on screen are real. I can well understand her reaction, as the picture is really that good.  The 3D capability works very well with the BCD-C6900 Samsung Blu-Ray player we purchased with the set. The 3D effect is good, but I'll have to reserve judgment on that until more 3D content becomes available.Other pluses; the set is very thin and works well with cabinets that have power lifts (we replaced a 25 yr old entertainment center with a cabinet with a power lift that conceals the TV when not in use.)The Internet capability is good, but needs more applications.  If you get the BD-C6900 Blu-Ray player, it has a built-in wireless link that works with the TV.  If you don't buy the Blu-Ray player, then you have to buy a separate Samsung wireless dongle/stick. I think that capability should be built into the set.The only con I have so far is the back lit Samsung label that is built into the frame of the television.  It goes off when the television is powered down, but while it is playing it is lit.  I really don't need that light on and find it distracting in low-light conditions.  I hope Samsung will make a future firmware upgrade that will give you the option to turn it off. (BTW, upgrading the software is simple.  Just download the file off the Samsung site to a USB memory stick and plug the USB into the TV, then select software upgrade).A pricey, but outstanding TV.  If you want the best, get this one.
