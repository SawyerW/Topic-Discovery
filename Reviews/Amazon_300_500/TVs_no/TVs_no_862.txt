I've had this TV for about a week now, and my initial impression is as follows:It is perfect as a secondary TV, either for a bedroom (where I use it), or for an office. I have found it to be exactly as advertised on Amazon, with no obvious defects or surprises. I have noticed none of the negative things stated in other reviews on this site.There are a couple of things I particularly like about this set. First, it has more than sufficient input and output capabilities, especially since you no longer need an external DVD player (note however, that the internal player is for DVD's only, not Blu-ray discs). Additionally, the on board speakers for this set are of quite good quality, and more than sufficient for a secondary TV. Assembly literally took me one minute (and the aid of only a screw driver), and the initial setup is as easy as following a few on screen prompts.On a personal note, I have learned over the years to take online reviews and ratings with a grain of salt. I've found that the majority of negative ratings come from either the buyers lack of technical knowledge, or the buyer not using the product for it's intended use. If your looking for a theater quality TV, with ear shattering audio, internet apps, and the ability to watch your entire home movie collection on 10 different kinds of discs, this is not the TV for you. If, on the other hand, your looking for a basic HDTV, with a functional on board DVD player to reduce clutter, and the ability to hook up your streaming device, TOSHIBA HAS PRODUCED A VIABLE CHOICE!!!Revised on 1-10-2012:After a little over a month of use, this TV went completely out today. Absolutely no warning, it just failed to even turn on. Other reviews mentioned a power supply issue, and I now believe them to be correct. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV!!!! On a positive note, Amazon paid the shipping for me to return it, no questions asked. I'll be sticking to LG, which I've always had good luck with in the past.
