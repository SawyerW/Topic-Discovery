I just got the 32XBR450 yesterday (2/9/02) and I absolutely love it.  I wasn't intending on buying this TV when I went shopping but once I saw the picture and other features compared to the "regular" flat screen TV's I had to have it.  The picture's incredible, the colors are perfect and the skin tones are right on the money.  I havent hooked it up to a home theater system yet but the TV audio on its own is wonderful.  I connected a DVD player that has the progressive scan feature (only works with HDTV TV's) and I used the component video cable connection.  All I can say about the picture quality while watching a DVD is WOW!!!!  It's crystal clear.  It was just like being in a movie theater except that my recliner is much more comfortable and the picture was actually better.  The picture-in-picture feature is better than any I've seen.  It's called Twin-View and instead of a small box in the corner of the screen it comes up in a split screen so both channels take up half the screen.  Then you can resize either one you want and as one gets bigger the other gets smaller.  You can also use the picture-in-picture mode while viewing a DVD, VHS, video game system or any other input you have hooked up.  There are also plenty of in-put jacks (6) so you can hook up just about anything you want.  Overall it's just the best TV I've seen.  The ONLY reason I didnt give it 5-stars is because of the price.  I paid the same price thats advertised here but I got the stand included.  Oh ya and it's HDTV (ready) so when all broadcasts go over to HDTV in a few years you'll be all set.  If you can pay the price then go out and get this TV NOW!!!
