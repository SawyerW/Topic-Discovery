Got this TV last week and found the 3D Blu ray were in the low end(suggestion do not buy the package). If you have a 3D receiver it is okay to buy the package but if not just buy the 800 series of Samsung. The BDT 100 DVD player has only one HDMI, 1 optical output, no coax(better than optical output)and no 7.1 output. It seems that HD Audio can only only be output through HDMI but not through digital output. Hence, if  the there are no two HDMI and you do not have a 3D receiver (or create a budget for yourself for 3D receiver) your only option is using the HDMI of the BDT 100 player going to your 3D TV and no more HDMI output for a "handshake" to your old receiver. Its heartache but its a reality. At this time is it Panasonic concern or the promoter(sales/marketing) concern? I do not know why they did not put in the package the BDT 300 for 3K TV? Probably it is a question of integrity as compare to only few hundred dollars. If you opt for the BDT 300 it seems the price have change from $299 to 349. For only 150 dollars more opt for the OPPO 93 a high end player, a good reputation and customer service, quality components, better chip processor, and maintain their value.For the Panasonic VT 25 still  under scrutinity in terms of what CNET was commenting. So far so good. I have three TV at home 2 Panasonic, 1 OU models and now the VT 25 58 inch TV of panasonic. The other TV is an XBR model by Sony. There is no perfect TV  but in this package of Panasonic or Bestbuy it seems that if you are buying 58 inch or 65 inch and giving you a player low end, it just like your buying a first class seat and being serve with economy food. In this economy who will buy a 3K thousand TV? Suggestion they should put more option on the table like if you opt for the 3K VT 25 then you get also the high end player or the better player. It seems the promotion was rush? Will update this review about 58 inch VT25 of panasonic. Happy shopping and viewing.
