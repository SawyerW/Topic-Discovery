When my old Samsung Dlp started to fail on me I knew I wanted to get another Samsung since I had enjoyed it for six long years. While looking through the Samsung selection and found this one. I thought I was almost too good to be true, only $800 for 51' 3D tv. After reading user reviews and other reviews online I decided it was the right choice and ordered it, and i was not only not disappointed , I was still shocked I got all this tv for $800.  First off I went from a 42' to a 51', so the size imcrease was great right off the bat. Now for the actual picture, it only gets better. The colors are bright and vivid amd it does blacks very well. The color contrast is excellent and the colors really pop. As for the refresh rate, I cant see any pixelation or artifacts when fast motion happens in an action movie or sports game. I found this especially impressive since i was looking for some and couldn't find any.  Being a self admitted gadget dork I was very excited for the 3D, but had no idea what expect, especially being a "entry level" 3D tv. The first thing I watched on my tv was Despicable Me in 3D, and it was absolutely eye candy. The 3D effects were great and not at all gimmicky. Right off the bat I wasnin love. Since 3D television is a relatively new technology there are currently only 2 3D channels. There is however several movies available on HBO on demand which is very nice. I also own a PS3 which not only plays 3D blu-rays, but also has 3D games! My nerdgasm is complete!  All in all this is a fantastic TV and is an unbelievable deal at this price point.
