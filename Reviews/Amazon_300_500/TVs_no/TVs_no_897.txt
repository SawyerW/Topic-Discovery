2nd month of owning this TV and have been very happy. By no means is this the best option out there, but I might say it's the best at this price.First debate was accepting 720p over a 1080p model. Ultimately I decided 720 was fine, I sit about 10 ft away so odds are I wouldn't notice the difference, plus I just couldn't afford a 3d 1080p model. I suggest measuring viewing distances for your own home to make the same decision.This model lacks Smart TV options, I personally use a Logitech Revue and there are several other devices out there like Roku and Apple TV, so I personally did not see this as being too important. But I highly recommend internet connectivity being built in or through a set top box, great feature.3D features I have found to be very cool, many of my current games work great in 3D mode, plus Time Warner has several 3D films for free on demand. 3D Blu Rays are costly and require a 3D player though, but you can rent them through several services for around $6.99. 2d to 3d conversion is a nice improvement too. This is not a must have feature and I only use it occasionally, but I do enjoy it. Also the glasses sync easily, about as heavy as normal sunglasses, and I have not experience any issues with eyestrain or headaches. Tried both models of glasses, 3100's are the way to go.Calibration of some sort is needed, I ran a WOW calibration disc on my own and find the picture quality to be stunning and may consider professional calibration down the road. Though whites do not seem to be as bright as my prior LCD and it has slightly more glare, but for me these are fairly small trade offs for nicer colors and improved motion.Again I acknowledge their are better TV's, but at this price, normal picture quality is excellent and an occasional 3D movie/game is fun.
