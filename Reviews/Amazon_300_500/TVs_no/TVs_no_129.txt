I ordered this tv from Amazon on Wednesday morning, and it arrived on Friday using only the free Amazon standard shipping option.  I had been agonizing for several weeks about upgrading my television viewing.  This was a major purchase for me and I spent hours on the web looking at reviews for LCD and Plasma televisions and suffered from major electronics confusion.  Plasma looked good, but I worried about the "burn" problem with plasma screens.  LCD didn't have these problems but offered "trail problems" with motion.  What size to get??  I had a 20 inch Toshiba bought 4 years ago.  I thought that the 32 inch size would be overkill for me, but after looking at the available plasma and LCD televisions at local retailers, I found that the 37 inch and 40 inch televisions were not only wider, but SIGNIFICANTLY larger in the vertical dimension of the larger sets.  This made the 32 inch sets not very attractive to me.Now the thing that finally sold me on Samsungs product was the DNIE technology which effictively solves the trail problem on LCD television sets, at least in my opinion.  I just don't think that you can go wrong with a set like this.  It has completely blown my mind in the last hour.  I have seen detail that never existed on any previous set that I have owned, or watched for that matter.  The colors are absolutely wonderful, so vibrant and rich, they are a joy to view.The set was easy to set up, and I am still learning about it, but I am convinced that each day will bring a little more joy from this technological marvelAmazon "ROCKS", price, delivery speed, and ease of purchase are 10 out of 10 on the scale for this great televison.UPS did a great job of getting me the tv very very quickly, and got it up the steps to my front door with zero defects or damage.  I am a happy camper.
