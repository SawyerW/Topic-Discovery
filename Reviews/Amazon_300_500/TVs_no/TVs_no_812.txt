I bought this vizio tv after thoroughly looking online for the best picture for my limited budget. After seeing the difference in person between a standard led tv and this full array led tv, I was sold. Gaming on this tv looks amazingly smooth, bright, and crystal clear. Didn't need to adjust any of the picture settings either, the gaming setting gives me a picture quality that I feel is more than sufficient. The only gripe I have against this tv is that the stand is flimsier than older vizio models that I've seen and when I turn the tv (which I do frequently) I'm afraid that it's eventually going to wear out and break. If you're looking for a great quality picture without spending a lot of money, I highly recommend this tv.UPDATE:I've had the tv for almost a month now and I'm still just as happy with it as I was the first day I got it. There is a light indicator on the tv to let you know that the tv is on, it's disabled by default but I enabled it in the TVs settings. As far as gaming lag goes, I've had the picture set to gaming mode and haven't noticed any at all. I've been playing call of duty ghost on the ps4 on this tv a lot, and it's performed beyond my expectations. Also I read a review that states that the smart feature is slow to start up  this is both true and false. The tv doesn't maintain a constant connection to the internet, when you turn the tv off, the internet connection is off. I've noticed that if I try accessing one of the apps such as netflix immediately after I turned the tv on, it takes a while for it to connect. If I turn the tv on, wait a few seconds for it to connect to my router and then try accessing netflix, the app starts very quickly.
