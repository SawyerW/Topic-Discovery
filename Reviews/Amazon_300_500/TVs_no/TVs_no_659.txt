The picture quality on this TV is incredible.  The color response that the LED brings is better than any Plasma or LCD that I compared this TV to.  The full 240 hz is a plus as well.  It gives the picture an ultra-realistic feel, almost as though you're looking through a window.  The 240 hz, does however, give you the "soap opera" effect.  The settings menu will allow you to adjust the "Auto Motion Plus" to minimize this effect.The 3D looks ok, but the glasses are expensive, and I barely use it.  Watching a football game in 3D is cool, but mostly gimmicky.  It makes everything appear to have depth, but the players by no means appear to be in my living room.  The best description I can give is that it's like watching the game in a diarama.The internet apps are ok as well.  I've got AT&T; DSL with a 3 MBPS connection.  The Netflix app looks good, except that it takes a few minutes to buffer so that you get a smooth and uninterupted picture.  I've had better results using my PS3 to watch Netflix.Pros: Outstanding picture quality.  The color response and 240 hz refresh rate are incredible.  The TV itself looks good, it's fairly light and VERY thin.  Wall mounting it is pretty easy. 4 HDMIs, a VGA, component, and AV connector are really nice.  There are also 2 USB ports and an ethernet in to use the internet.  The remote is nice and easy to use without being overly cluttered.  The iPhone remote app is nice as well.Cons: The streaming apps could be smoother, but this may be a function of my internet connection vs the TV.  There are a multitude of settings to make the picture look really great, but they can be overwhelming.  The 3D is gimmicky at best.Overall, I love my Samsung and highly recommend it!
