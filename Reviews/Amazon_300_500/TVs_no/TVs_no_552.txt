I've done countless hours of research for TV's, and it seems that everything changes with each year of new products coming out.  What I've come to realize is that it is very hard to compare models from brand to brand or even within the same brand.  What you have to do is figure out what type of inputs you need and what type of setting your TV will be in and go from there.With that being said, I have a well lit room with lots of windows and an open area with viewing from straight on and from both sides.  Each viewing seat is about 10-12 feet from the TV, and it is mounted to a wall (5 feet from bottom of TV to floor).  All of my components go through a receiver and surround sound system, so I don't use the built in TV speakers.  I've had this TV for over a year now.  The picture has been great, and it works perfectly with all of my components.  I've had absolutely no problems with the TV so far in regards to pixels going out or changes in tint, sharpness, or clarity.  Blu-Rays, video games, and HD channels with Direct TV all look great.I would recommend this TV if it is even still available to purchase.  I'm sure it would be much cheaper now than when I bought it.  If not, you can't go wrong with the Bravia TV's.  Just make sure you look at the number and types of inputs you need before purchasing.  There are usually 3-4 different models within the same size range that are the same TV except for inputs and other internet/wifi related add-ons.  For a main living room TV, that stuff might be important, but for a bedroom TV, you may not need all that stuff.
