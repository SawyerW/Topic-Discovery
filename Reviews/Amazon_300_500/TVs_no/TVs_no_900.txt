I purchased this TV in early July 2011 and was extremely satisfied with all the pertinent technical aspects concerning picture quality, ease of use, remote control, etc.The all metal stand was great too, easy on and easy off, with simple attachment to the bottom of the LCD panel - not to the back of the LCD panel via 4 or more screws like some manufacturers (e.g., LG which uses only a plastic retention bracket that screws directly into the back of the screen and results in an extremely, wobbly, unstable stand especially when swiveling. Removal of such a stand - once attached - also can be problematic when one or more of the screws cannot be easily removed.).One of the few things that I didn't like about this TV was the WIFI implementation. I would have preferred truly integrated WIFI like Toshiba sets have; I don't care much for WIFI dongles (WIFI added as an afterthought) that unnecessarily and permanently tie up one USB port and also give the manufacturer another optional item to sell you. Nevertheless, the WIFI throughput was very good - no complaints.However, I did end up returning this TV to Amazon for 2 reasons:1) The surprising overall thinness of these new LED-LCD TVs meant that I was able to fit a notably larger set in the same space and this is what happened. I decided to get a 47" TV instead. It's a tight fit, but it fits. It's too bad that this same Panasonic TV isn't available in a larger size. At the moment 37" is as big as it gets or I might have stayed with Panasonic.2) Also, my father who is in his 80s apparently has some problems viewing active 3D televisions and I decided to go the other route of passive 3D to resolve the issue of bothersome flickering that he was experiencing (only noticeable after viewing the TV for longer periods of time).What I have ultimately ended up with is a  47" Toshiba passive 3D LED-LCD TV 240Hz with integrated WIFI (no dongle) also purchased from Amazon.com.
