All in all this is a great TV and for the money I think it is one of the best things going.PROS:Picture: This TV has an excellent picture.  When I upgraded my cable to HD cable I noticed an even better picture.  I sit about 12 feet from the TV and, even when I'm watching a non-HD signal, any pixelization that you get goes unnoticed. So way to go on the picture, Samsung.Inputs:  A ton of inputs.  Two HDMI, PC input, coax, etc.  I use Comcast and both cable boxes that I have from them only have a DVI output, so you need to get a DVI-HDMI cable to view HD signals.CONS:Sound:  The sound is sub-par.  I guess it's safe to assume that anyone in the market for a higher-end TV is going to also have a home theater receiver for sound.  In my case, I don't like to mess with my home theatre receiver for watching "regular" TV (the news, etc) so I use the TV's built-in speakers.  When watching something deep bass tones (i.e., music, explosions, or someone with a deep voice) the speakers make a muffled "farting" noise as if they are blown.  (sorry, can't think of a better way to describe it).A firmware bug?:  There seems to be a bug with the firmware of the TV that when you switch sources, say, from TV to HDMI to watch a DVD the video will switch but the audio will not.  Most of the time you will loose sound all together, but on more than one occasion I have switched to the HDMI source and I see the movie but still hear what I was watching on TV.  Cycling through the source selection a second time will fix it.Again, all-in-all this is a great TV and would definately recommend it.
