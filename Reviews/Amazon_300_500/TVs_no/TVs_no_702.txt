As a frequent buyer of TV's I end up upgrading TV's more often than the normal consumer. As such I try to give each TV time prior to judging. I have been a fan of LG (LCD)in the past (see other TV reviews). This is my first LG LED TV. And while the picture quality is good, its not sharp. I expect sharper more vibrant images in LED tv's and by far this TV seems to be more LCD than LED. The panel is ultra-thin in keeping up with Samsung... but by far the picture quality and brightness weren't to be found. So reasons to buy an LED TV - Reduced Energy Consumption, Sharper images, and brightness... Unfortunately, this TV scored on one - in terms of energy efficiency. But in terms of picture sharpness and image brightness - this TV just did not deliver. Blacks are a more like dark gray and the colors not so vibrant when comparing to a Samsung. As for price, this TV right now is $599 which is about $150 less than a 40" Samsung. But I must say that I would strongly recommend that you spend the extra $150 and pick up the Samsung UN40C6300. Its as comparable (spec wise) as this unit but 3" larger. As far as "halo-ing" I was unable to see any from a direct view perspective (straight on). I was however, able to see color uniformity issues (especially with blacks) when I was of angle. So is this TV impressive? By no means is it. What is it good for? Well for thise on a tight budget and want the latest LED technology, this will fit the need. But if picture quality is something you crave go Samsung. If you are avoiding Samsung just get an LG LCD. Their LCD's are superb and I'm sure you can get better picture from their LCD's - but you sill sacrifice unit-depth as LG LCD's are thicker than their LED'sYou certainly get what you pay for in this unit. 3 Stars out of 5 for its bargain basement price.
