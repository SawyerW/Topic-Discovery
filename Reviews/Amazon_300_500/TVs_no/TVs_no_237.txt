I have a HP Pavilion m9000t desktop and am using the Samsung LNT3253H as a combination television / PC monitor. It sits on the back edge of my desk and allows me to kick back in my chair and view the screen while operating the mouse on the return part of my desk. I trade stocks for a living and this is the absolute best combination of equipment I've been able to come up with.The LNT3253H and LNT3242H both have picture-in-picture, so I can watch realtime streaming quotes from Scottrade on the lower left part of the screen (max 20 stocks to a board, no limit on boards), realtime chart on the upper part of the screen and also watch and listen to the talking heads on CNBC on the lower right corner of the screen.This has to be the ultimate set-up for stock traders. I paid for the PC and the TV in just a couple of days of trading.I gave the Samsung 4 out of 5 stars because of a slightly annoying glitch in the sound accompanied by a little video squiggly every so often. I've ordered the same HP setup for my wife (also a trader) but we will be using a Sony KDL32M3000 for her monitor, hoping that it will not have the glitch in it. By the way, there is no glitch in the PC portion of the feed, only in the television part of the feed. We have two other TV's hooked up to the same cable line into the house and they don't squiggle, so I'm pretty sure it's the Samsung's fault. I'll report back on the performance of her HP/Sony combination.Well, here is is a few months later and we have the wife's trading room set up with a Sony KDL3200M. It doesn't have the glitch in it that the Samsung has, but it isn't as clear as the Samsung. I've tried every resolution available on the PC and just cannot get picture quality like the Samsung has. All other things equal, I'll take the Samsung even with the occasional glitch over the Sony.
