Unless you have around a $1,000 to throw away - AVOID THIS TV.  I was amazed with the picture quality for the 3 months I had it with very limited use.  It looked almost 3D.  I did notice from the get-go it made some crackling noises but I assumed it was some of the internal components heating and cooling.  Then one day it inexplicably shut itself off and came back on.  The next day when I shut it off, it started making some God awful clicking noise and that's all it did.  No picture, no sound.  Apparently this is a VERY common problem (check the internet).  I know it must be a common problem because when I called Samsung, they didn't even bother trying to run me through some of those ridiculous troubleshooting techniques that many retailers do, like "Is it plugged in?"  I'm now playing phone tag with the repair guy.  I'm sick to my stomach over this experience.  Fortunately, it's still under warranty but I'm afraid I have a ticking time bomb.*UPDATE*A Samsung tech came out for a service appointment.  They call to give you a 2-hour window THE MORNING OF THE APPOINTMENT.  Fortunately, my window was 5-7pm so I didn't have to take a day off from work.  A very friendly tech arrived around 6:30 and was gone before 7.  No muss, no fuss.  He removed the back of the tv and replaced 2 major components.  I was actually surprised by how little pieces go into a tv.  You could tell the tech has made this repair about a million times and could do it in his sleep.  Hopefully this is a once and done issue.  I've changed my review from 1 star to 2.  If the tv holds up and actually keeps working, I'd have no hesitation bumping it up to a 4+.
