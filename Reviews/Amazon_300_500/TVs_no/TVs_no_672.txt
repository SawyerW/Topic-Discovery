This tv could not be any better. But then again the 9000series(not wall mountable)is the bigger better choice and a viewing masterpiece of color, depth and true picture quality. Tv this good should be framed. Yes and the c8000 is just that framed, it has an awesome frame very thin brushed stainless with clear tasteful glaze over the stainless that sits flush sank down into... What is this? This is not that normal crappy touch of color you typically see on a very good portion of monitors and some lcd tvs, this is the use of acrylic at its best, this is a great product, i really enjoy the samsung c8000 cant wait to hang it on my wall, i have lots of ideas to hide the wires, i am a tv installer semi professional, been doin' it for years, and this is very easy to install tv, might require two people "if elderly" un-boxing and setup first time in order not to damage very expensive tv, i personally recomend using samsung wall mount kit, or cheaper versions, specific for this tv, also i like to use 1/4"(zip toggles) not ordinary toggles for bolting mounts to wall, dont much like to use any other type of mounting method for drywall, repeat, zip toggles, check em' out. 8000series = awesome tv. samsung hit right on the button with this one, love at last. unless something happens to it, i would hate to have been one of those people who recieved a lousy product and had to return a few bumbling times later you finally got the one you can settle with. fortunatly mine arrived safe and sound, had it a few months now, havent had to clean it, it stays clean right out the box. What a eyegasm this tv is. One of samsung best products. Makes my ugly wall look surprisingly more ugly, but the tv makes my house nearly ready for cribs.
