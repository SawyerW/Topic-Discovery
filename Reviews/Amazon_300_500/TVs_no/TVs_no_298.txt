Had it for three weeks and love it.Spend the extra few bucks and buy this TV! You will not regret it.The other reviewers have covered the technical ground so I will tell you how it plays on factory settings, set to standard setting on HD programming.On HDTV cable, baseball, football, car racing etc fantastic!On nature shows and movies fantastic!On none-HD tv channels it does very good indeed, much better than the older sets, especially when you set it to vibrant setting. Old movies are really very good in this mode.So whats not to like on this set, nothing! Its the best TV I have watched since my dad and mom bought our first set in 1947 and thats a long time ago! Hard to beleive they finally got it right after 60 years, I would like to see Howdie Doody on this set!FOLLOWUP:Here it is 3 years later, I have had a good voltage surge protector from day one.  This cheap little device may have protected this TV against a lot of the problem ones in these reviews, pehaps not, maybe just got the luck of the draw. However my inlaws have had their bigscreen go out because of voltage spikes twice to the tune of mucho money.I have recently gotten a Sony BlueRay DVD player and it works amazing well the best picture I have ever seen on any TV at 1080HD 24bit. Also have an old HD DVD player that up converted to 480i DVD's to 1080i and that is HD quality also, the latter being as good as my cable HD signals.I still think this is one great TV, and from what I gather they are still in demand even after Sony has ended it's production. So if you can find one set it up properly with protection, it would not hurt to buy the extended warrentee even though I did not. Enjoy!
