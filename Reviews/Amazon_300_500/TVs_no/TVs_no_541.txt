I would highly recommend this TV to people like me, that want the great Sony quality in picture, but don't care to have a more expensive model, with bells and whistles you won't use. I primarily watch TV (non-HD variety), watch DVD's, play PlayStation 3 games and use for BluRays, until I decide on which model Sony BluRay Player/ DVD Up-Scale capabilities. The picture is AWESOME, multiple settings, quite user-friendly, and for the HD format, it is unbelievably crisp and sharp. As with most HDTV's, expect to get an external sound system, the one built-in is not horrible, but by no means is on par with picture. Has the neat Bravia Sync technology, that makes it easier to use all you Sony Bravia Sync compatible items with, ie. PS3, Sony BluRay Players, etc. Did a lot of homework on specs, and this is the one I came down to when it was dollars versus specs, totally worth the money. Again, it doesn't have as many of the newer bells and whistles, but, if you want the basics with great features, then I would say this model, or the 42" if you want larger, should be in your final three. Also, the power problem that I've seen in other reviews is no longer relevant, as long as you don't get one of the ones off the line first, they have corrected that glitch, I spoke with their customer service (because similar issue is why I was having to get a new TV). Hope this was helpful.PROS: Solid Sony quality/ reliability, good basic features without being overly complicated, very user friendly if you have other Sony hardware spectacular connectivity feature, and others I'm sure I have yet to utilize.CONS: Not much other than built-in speakers, not as advanced as some of the newer models, while having the standard specs on par with most other HDTV's of equal/more expensive models, which could also be a PRO
