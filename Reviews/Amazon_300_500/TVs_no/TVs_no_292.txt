I've had this television since November of last year and I can honestly say it's the best investment for anyone who is looking for a Hi-Def tv and doesn't know where to start. I'm going to break down the unit so novice buyers can be aware of what to expect from this televisionPanel (Television or Display):This is the bread and butter of this unit.  Before you turn it on you will marvel at the unit's ultra slim design and the piano black finish.  A glorious picture quality with blacks levels that rival the most expensive units.  The vibrant colors jump and the details are nothing short of amazing.  I'd also recommend using a Home Theater calibration disc to get the best picture that suits you.  If you are viewing this in SD then you are doing this unit and yourself a dis-service.  This unit begs to be hooked up to a high definition source. Any gaming system, Blu-Ray, HD Satellite or HD Cable.  Make an investment and you'll understand then.  Oh yes replace the remote ASAP. As a side note, I've had HD Cable and HD Satellite.  The banding issues do exist but are so minute that it really wasn't a drawback.  It also seem less apparent on the HD Satellite then the HD Cable this was using the same HDMI port and cable, while watching the same programs.Speakers:The speakers on this television are just plain weak.  But given the size of the unit what can you expect.  I'd highly recommend to anyone if it is feasible then by all means bypass the speakers and get yourself a surround sound system that supports HDMI and 5.1 Dolby digital after all is said and done this is the unit to beat for 1080p LCD's.(update) after 3 years of quality service this unit went belly up.  Not totally just a line on the right side.So the extended warranty kicked in and I found a suitable replacement. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B5LB2C/ref=s9_bbs_gw_d2_ir03?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_r=0DXB874WV16EYV1Q7B1A&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=470938631&pf;_rd_i=507846
