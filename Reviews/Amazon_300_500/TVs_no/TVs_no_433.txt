when my (favorite) 35 inch panasonic crt blew out after 9 years of faithful service, i freaked out. i was not prepared to jump into this new digital hdtv age and totally upgrade my entertainment center. i have a household full of crt tv's, standard cable, and 300+ standard dvds... not to mention a ton of videotapes.i had to find a television that would show my standard cable/video library at it's best advantage.a lot of people i know are not exactly wild about paying for all new hdtv set-ups. after talking to many friends who've bought 1080p tv's (and then hooked up their existing standard dvd players/cable to these sets and hate the result...but REFUSE to spend any more money),  and then doing some research, i figured a 720p set would be best for me.a standard tv image/signal, blown up from 480p to 720p (2 and a half times) will show much less distortion than an image blown up from 480p to 1080p (6 times).i went with this panny because for me they make the BEST televisions, and i'm not disappointed...from arcoss the room the picture quality for standard cable is quite good. the colors are nice and glowing. and the audio is great. the menus & remote control are simple and easy to operate.i also went with a samsung upconverting dvd player (bought here at amazon) and let me tell you, the quality of my standard dvds is PHENOMENAL!! using the player, the 1:33:1 image on my dvds is closer to 1:37:1. an 'anamorphic' widescreen dvd (formatted for 16:9 screens, just about most dvds nowdays) looks SPECTACULAR, filling out the whole screen without any distortion or stretching of the image.my dvd's have NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD, thanx to this set, and that was my greatest worry...i'm just soooo pleased with this purchase.
