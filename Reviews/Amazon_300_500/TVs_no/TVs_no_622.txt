When you look at it, isn't the goal of buying a new TV picture quality.  Well, the Samsung doesn't fail in that category.  Probably the best picture I've seen anywhere.  I wish I could say the same for the balance of the features.Internet Connectivity:  The Samsung was very particular about connecting to the internet.  I had one connection that was tested on a laptop that worked fine not be able to deliver an IP address using DHCP to the set.Internet Apps:  Save your money here and go get an Apple TV for $99!  The Netflix app didn't work out of the box and the other apps were less than stellar.  Not worth the money.Check your ports:  We started with the cable box and a DVD player and everything connected fine.  But when we connected to HDMI port 3, no device would work on the connection.  HDMI 4 worked fine and everything was running but it will mean a service call.  (we'll let you know how that went later).More ports:  Another thing about the ports mounted on the side, make sure you get a 28AWG based HDMI cable to connect otherwise it will be difficult to hide the cables behind the set AND it feels like the ports would be susceptible to breaking if you tried to force the cables to bend.Software update:  Did contact tech support about the HDMI port issue.  They sent an update file which by the way wasn't available through software update on the TV.  Seems that we should be able to rely on the software update for ANY issues otherwise what's the point.3D:  Haven't had a chance to get to 3D yet, will give you an update when we get there.Sound:  The sound quality and capabilities are fairly good.  Sitting 10 feet away the quality of the sound is clear and plenty loud.  Always a concern especially on the really thin LED TV's.Overall the core functions of the TV have satisfied but you may want to reconsider paying for all of those other options and features.
