Let me start with the good part of the review, the TV is great and looks awesome.  Got a brand new blu ray player with it as well and the picture and sound are GREAT.Now the bad portion of the review.  I ordered the TV and as with all items you get from Amazon there is an estimate on when the item will be delivered.  As it got closer to the date I began tracking the item to see for sure when I'd receive it.  Long story short it made it to my city in time to be delivered "on time", but the delivery company (Home Direct) used a local agency that held the TV for 3 days without making any attempt to contact me about delivering the TV.  So I had to make contact with them and on this initial phone call they wouldn't schedule a delivery time with me, the person I was talking with insisted that someone who wasn't there would have to call me back later.  That call never came so I called back the next day.  I received no apology, nothing, it was not until I threatened calling Home Direct that they were accommodating.  After that I finally got my TV, about 3 days after they received it.Now, at this point I've taken the TV out of the box and set it up but now it's broken.  I would love to say it was damaged in shipping and lay the blame on the delivery agency but it was an internal issue.  Within 24 hours of getting the TV I called Samsung and had to schedule a tech to come out.  That soonest appointment was over a week after my call.  The tech came out, fixed the TV in no time, and now I can watch it.  It was under warranty so I didn't have to pay for the tech coming out but all of this was just a HUGE pain.Like I said earlier, I love the TV now but getting it was awful.
