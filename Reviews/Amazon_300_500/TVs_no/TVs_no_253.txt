I bought this television exclusively for my PS3 and to watch Blu-Ray and HD-DVD movies on, so I can't comment on how it looks on standard or high definition programming. But for my uses it looks great. My PS3 games look amazing. I'm in the middle of a baseball season on MLB'07 The Show, and it looks so real that it's scary. I was going to go with a 720p set, because a majority of the games being made now are being made at that resolution. I tried a few 720p sets. I tried a few Samsungs and I also tried an Olevia. The Olevia looked good, but there was no depth behind the color. Of course the Samsung looked great with plenty of deep, vibrant colors, but the games just didn't look as good as I thought they should. This television delivers deep, vivid colors with crystal clear clarity. Blu-Ray movies and HD-DVD movies also look great. I was hesitant about spending this much money for what amounts to a gaming monitor, but hey, you only live once right? I'm still a plasma man at heart, I have a Panasonic plasma in my den that I receive my high definition programming over. Plasma has always been my preference, because I think the colors are deeper than LCD and of course the black levels are much deeper. I'm waiting for the 1080p plasma's to come down in price over the next year, and that'll be my next purchase. I think for gaming LCD's are a better choice. The picture is much brighter and no burn-in issues. So if you're thinking about buying this television, go ahead and do it, it would be a wise decision. The price alone makes it a smart buy. Of course 1080p at anything under 42" is overkill because you have to sit so close to the screen to reap the benefits, but it works for me because I'm sitting close to the screen when I game or watch a movie. I hope this review has been helpful.
