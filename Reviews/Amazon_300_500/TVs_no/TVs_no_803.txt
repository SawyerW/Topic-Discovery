The Coby 2326 is a good entry level HDTV. It comes with basic inputs for cable/antenna, PC/SVGA 15 pin w/ stereo audio, component video, s-video and 1 HDMI post. There is no input for media card nor USB, this Coby will NOT work as a 23" digital photo frame as ships (for this feature perhaps connect a Roku 2 or similar device, mount the roku to the rear to camouflage from view.)Setup was a breeze and very intuitive. From opening the box, inspecting the unit, attaching the base, connecting the cables and scanning for channels, this model was fully functional within 10 minutes.The video quality is reasonable; the audio quality is acceptable. According to the energy label this device costs an average $6.72 in energy consumption based upon an average use of 5 hours per day at $0.11 per kilowatt hour at an estimated 61.09 kWh. Similar 21"-23" units run $4 - $13. According to the literature, this unit draws a max of 40 watts, includes ATSC/NTSC/QAM tv tuners, has v-chip parental control, is closed-caption for the hearing impaired and offers electronic program guide support.Included in the package:23" Coby LED 1080p HDTV w/remote and 2 AAA batteries6' Composite cable (red, white, yellow)Power cord (standard "computer" power cord)Stand (easy to put on and remove, thumb screw is included in the hollow base that is also removable.)This HDTV is SUPER SLIM and LIGHTWEIGHT! I generally mount the tv to the wall  (VESA 75mm x 75mm) but even someone very weak will be able to setup this HDTV or move it for cleaning. According to the box the overall dimensions of the HDTV itself is 22.6" wide by 14.5" tall (with a depth of maybe an inch) and with the base attached the overall dimension is 16.1" tall with a depth of 6.7". It also states extended backlight life expectancy is 20,000 hours.Caution: verify the return policy of the seller before ordering and inspect the box before accepting delivery. This HDTV needs another piece of foam between the HDTV and the box. Mine arrived with the box badly damaged, thankfully the HDTV arrived ok but really could have used an extra piece of foam to prevent damage to the unit during shipping.Coby Customer Service is 877-302-2629 (US) and 855-542-8917 (Canada)
