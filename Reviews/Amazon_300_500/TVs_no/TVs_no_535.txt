I have to say, I really like this TV.  My previous LCD was a Samsung 32" 720p - and this set blows it away in almost every aspect.  I think I paid around $550 for the Samsung a little over a year ago, so I jumped at the chance to upgrade to the EX400.Pros:  The ambient light sensor works terrific.-  4 HDMI inputs!  Plug away my friends.-  Bravia Sync feature works great with my Sony home theater system.-  PS3 games have never looked better.  I played Killzone 2 right after I setup the TV and my jaw was open for about 10 minutes straight.-  It only has a 60Hz refresh rate, but I've yet to see any blur while watching sports.-  DVD's look fairly crisp as well, considering I have a cheap DVD up-converter.-  It's a Sony!  I'm sure some ppl have had bad experiences with Sony, but I've had nothing but luck.  To each his own I guess.Cons:  The remote is junk.  It looks cheap and it isn't very functional.-  The grey panel on the front.  I had a bigger problem with the online picture of the set than I do in person.  It doesn't look THAT bad - but it still throws off the continuity of the black perimeter.  Strange call by Sony.-  Calibration is frustrating.  There are so many different picture settings you'll probably struggle to find the perfect setup.  I used the DVD THX Optimizer (found it on one of my Star Wars movies) and it helped a lot.  (I posted them on [...])-  If you're using an antenna instead of cable/satellite you'll find that channel surfing is a bit slow.  This is kind of a nitpick, but the channels take a little longer to load on this set.-  No swivel?  I knew this set didn't have it before I bought it - but it would still be nice.For around $600 you can have full 1080p AND a 40" screen.  Great TV - great deal.
