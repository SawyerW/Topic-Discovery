I researched many different HDTV for several months before making my purchase. I switched from LED to Plasma due to many good reviews on the new generation of plasma and the lower price. The choice was down to Panasonic & Samsung and I selected Samsung for their super thin high-tech design look, although a bit worry on many reviews that say there was a buzzing sound. When my Samsung PN50C8000 arrived, I am so pleased with the quality and after several weeks of enjoyment, I can happily confirm there is absolutely no buzzing sound on mine. The speakers are fairly good but you will definitely want a home system for watching movies. My only regret is that I should have ordered the 58" plasma since the quality is so impressive and the picture is amazingly clear with life-like smooth pictures, much better than the LCD & LED that makes the picture look sharp & clear but flat. It looks so much like the picture you would expect in a movie theater!!! Even a boring talk show is now enjoyable to watch, I can see all those wrinkles on the talk show hosts. I also save a lot of money and got the free blu-ray player with the 3D start up package. I can not praise myself enough for buying this TV and everyone who have seen it agreed. Don't waste your money on LCD & LED and invest into a new 3D home system & a wireless lan adapter to enjoy this TV to its max, you need to get the newer 1.4v hdmi cables in order to enjoy the 3D feature. My nest TV will definitely be a Samsung Plasma again.Oh, and yes the 600Hz is better for 3D. When this TV set is off, it looks very elegant in the living room. I added LED light at the back of the TV stand and it is absolutely beautiful to look at during movie time at night with all the other lights off.Update on January 2011: It has been over 6 months now since I purchased this TV and it is still perfect with no buzz!
