I am simply editing the review I gave two weeks after purchasing.  I will not go so far as to say this is a POS, but I'm not happy any longer.  This is whyOne reason why I bought this tv is due to the screen being semi-matte not full gloss.  That is good.I've had the tv for exactly one year now.The lcd panel went bad because a gray line appeared accross half the screen.  All Sony techs knew it was a bad panel.  I tried and pleaded my case ant took it to higher levels in hopes of Sony standing behind their name and giving me a new one.  "No that is not our warantee policy." Sony was however timely and professional in sending their repair tech out to fix it, but COME ON 8 months and my tv went bad?The sound is not the clearest either.NOW the MOST important thing...........the PICTUREUpon further study and hands-on comparing with other tvs in homes  I give the overall picture 3 1/2 star.  It is all about the blacks,darks and grays and shadows.  Amazing how poor this Bravia is when looking at a show in 1080i/720p at scenery where it can be dark.  The blending of colors and shadows on say a wall is very poor.  I'm sure the tv having an 8 bit color process vs the 10 bit doesnt help either.I do like the ability to control over 20 settings allowing good tweaking.  I'm happy with the number of inputs.  I will say the 60 vs 120 Hz is a big difference.  The 240 vs 120 I can't tell.  The motionflow I don't see too much benefit.  I leave it on standardBottom line if you want a good picture you cannot beat a quality plasmaIf you want an LCD get a Samsung
