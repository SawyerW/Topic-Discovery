Edit: No problem with the 3D. It was the cheap after market glasses I bought.  Panasonic glasses work flawlessly.Original review: So far, so good.  The TV has been up and running for about a week and a half.  I'm treating it gently during its break-in period, so I haven't really messed with color or brightness settings so far.  I'm not a real videophile, so I don't know much about deeply evaluating how true the colors are or how easy the set is to calibrate. I have it on the THX setting right now, and I like the way it looks. But there is plenty of customization possible with the picture and about everything else I could imagine wanting to tweak.The only problem I've had is with the 3D feature, and then only once in a while. I haven't watched a whole lot of 3D yet, but the problem I ran into had to do with maintaining the sync with the glasses.  I'm using aftermarket glasses, so I can't comment on whether this would be a problem with the Panasonic branded glasses. The problem comes during very bright scenes, specifically (in my case) the death scene in the last Harry Potter movie.  The TV, being a plasma, emits a great deal of IR light, especially during very bright scenes. This seems to overwhelm the receiver on the glasses and cause them to lose their sync with the IR signal from the 3D transmitter on the TV.  I solved the problem the same way many Samsung plasma users have had to, by covering most of the receiver area on the glasses with black electrical tape. This worked on all four of my pairs of glasses, but it required me adjusting the tape a few times to find just the right amount of sensor to leave exposed. I haven't read much about this happening with Panasonic plasmas, so it might be a problem with my specific set, but the workaround cost me 53 cents and worked very well, so I'm not too concerned.Overall, I'm thrilled with the picture quality and have no real complaints at all about the TV. If that changes, I will update my review.
