I purchased TV from Costco because it was cheap.  I had read the reviews before hand but I thought I would try it out since Costco has a forgiving return policy.Overall I am dissatisfied with the product.  The picture is nice given you are on an HD channel-- if you're not using, the normal zoom will give you a smaller picture.  The distortion from using the "wide" setting is somewhat acceptable.  Viewing angle isn't bad but there is a noticeable difference especially if you get too low.As others have mentioned there are definitely some sound problems.  I should mention I am using standard cable (coax cable directly into the TV no cable box), so you might not have these problems with a cable box.  The volume equalization from truVolume is garbage; it doesn't even work-- the commercials are still way louder than the main program.  Like the other user the "HD" stations are much softer than the normalAnother beef I have with the TV is the channel searching.  The 50 some "digital" stations it found are blank channels with no picture or are not even available.  And the digital channels are not even numbered helpfully.  ie) the HD channel for 8 is 83-8 or 7 is 116-1.  There's no real way for me to figure this out except to channel up through each channel and figure out what it is manually and then add skips to those channels in the channel set up.Also connecting it up to a computer can be problematic.  It can only accept up to 768 px which resticts my computer to only a 800x600 output (not wide screen aspect ratio).  This is more a computer problem but it's something to consider if you were planning on playing video from your computer.In my opinion this TV is a waste of time and money especially if you don't have a cable box or HD subscription.
