Sorry for the unoriginal title, but I honestly can't think of a better way to describe this TV.  I am 18, and this will end up going to college with me, so it is a perfect dorm size.  I am using it primarily for my Playstation 3, and with HDMI cables and 5.1 surround sound, let me tell you, I am in heaven.  Picture quality is amazing, not as good as some larger TV's but they have a size and resolution advantage (1080p versus 720p)  Going from SD to HD with my PS3 games is like night to day.  Also, I never knew DVD's could look so amazing.  I only have one Blu Ray disc, and as expected, great picture quality.  One small issue I noticed was that in certain situations there is a bit of a flicker, but I am sure this has nothing to do with the TV itself, but more LCD as a technology.  Also I noticed some strange effects on very dark scenes but this was fixed by lowering the backlight brightness.The fit and finish of this set is top notch.  It has a glossy black surface that catches the light and looks stunning.  (Especially since it matches the my PS3 =)  The plugs on the back of the TV are really stuck on there, no loose fittings here.  Unfortunately there is no DVI port, but a DVI>HDMI converter should cover you for your computer monitor needs.  The Menu is easy to navigate and helpful.  The remote is great, I love the way it fits in my hand, however it is a bit long, may need to shift your hand around to get some of the buttons, but unless you are very very lazy this should be a nonissue.Overall I am very satisfied, and feel that this TV was well worth my money.  It is a pleasure to look at and a pleasure to use.  The only gripes I have are that the power cord is a bit too short, and the case will show dust and smudges like nobody's business.
