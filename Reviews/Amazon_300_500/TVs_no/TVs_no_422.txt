I absolutely love this thing... not everyone has room or a budget for something 30"+ 40"++ or lives somewhere with vaulted ceilings. At this size, it's perfect for a bedroom or small den. Love the look-- the piano black is lovely and matches other Sony products if you happen to have them (a small theater system and Playstation 3, in my case). While shopping around, I realized that a 1080p would be overkill for a smaller area and were much costlier, and this is a great choice if you care about product brand when making larger purchases while still getting all the features you'd expect out of fancier models of others. Are you paying a little more for the name? Likely, but that can be important for a lot of people, too.Upgrading to a full HD television service is not in the works for me right now and I mostly purchased this for Blu-Ray and the Playstation 3, but normal cable still looks great and this Bravia series has an absolutely great screen display on 'wide zoom' to where you can get a full-screen image without strange stretching and you can still even read the tickers on news or sports channels.Critiques? The sound is somewhat disappointing with iffy bass and muddled clarity, which could get to movie fans. A few things can be frustrating such as channel change time and its dimming feature... sometimes it almost feels like you have to go through a few too many menus, as well. I think the dimming is great the majority of the time, but it outsmarts itself by readjusting because the TV changes the nearby ambient itself with a white picture! These confusions could be troublesome to the non technologically-inclined who just want to turn something on and channel-hop, which is the only reason I can't give a 5/5. Still, there's no reason I wouldn't highly recommend it.
