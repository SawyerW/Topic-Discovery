We bought this television after a great deal of research Superbowl weekend.  We came home the Friday night of Memorial Day weekend to find the television would no longer come on (only 4 mths after purchase).  We called Philips and they told us the name of a repair person, who was not available until after the holiday.  We called and realized the repair person was over an HOUR away and would not come.  Called Philips back, they "escalated" our call and told us it would be 24/48 hours before anyone could get back with us that they did not have any one closer.  Two days later, a representative calls and says there is a certified Philips repair technician twenty minutes away and to call them.  We do, and after speaking with someone two different times, get an appointment to come the next morning.  They literally come in and take the television.  It is now July 10th, and I am staring at a blank wall!  The repair company does not call us, we have had to call them repeatedly, and finally had to call Philips to get them to call back. They claimed they ordered one part, and that did not work and they were ordering another part.  Then a week later we went through the same calling ordeal to find out, that new part was defective and they were ordering a new one "that day".  It has been another week, so we called on Wednesday, Philips said to give them until Friday and if we had not heard from them by then, to call back.  We called back yesterday and Philips said, "They are so sorry it is taking so long.  The repair company is doing the best they can and Philips is trying to get the parts to them as quickly as possible."  If we do not hear anything by Tuesday or Wednesday, we are suppose to call back.  We are so frustrated and would NEVER have bought this television if we had known the problems we would not only have with it, but with simply having it repaired!  DO NOT BUY THIS TELEVISION!
