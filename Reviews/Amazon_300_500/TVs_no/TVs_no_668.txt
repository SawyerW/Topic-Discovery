I spent months researching LED-lit LCDs before purchasing the Samsung UN46C8000. In the final days, I was trying to choose between the 7000 and 8000 models -- the online forums that I found indicated that the 8000 had somewhat better picture quality, but at Amazon the 8000 was priced $500 more than the 7000, a price difference that I couldn't really justify paying for. (To be specific, the Amazon prices at the time were $1400 for the 7000, and $1900 for the 8000; either TV came bundled with blu-ray player and 3D starter kit).I was vacillating between the two. What finally tipped me over the edge to purchasing was finding the UN46C8000 at my local brick-and-mortar Best Buy, bundled with the blu-ray player, starter 3D kit, and in addition, a Samsung-compatible wireless Wi-Fi stick -- all for $1600, several hundred dollars less than at Amazon, even accounting for sales tax. I was shocked. This was (and still is, at the time that I write this) a much better deal than at Amazon. Having purchased from Amazon for years, this is the first time I've seen Best Buy offer a better price than Amazon on any item, especially a big-ticket item.So I bought the 8000 on the spot at Best Buy, brought it home and set it up myself (I prefer to set up my own devices), hooked up the blu-ray player, put on one of the Shrek 3D discs from the starter kit, and wow -- my gf and I, both of us, literally could not stop watching. We dropped everything we were doing to gape at the amazing imagery, and ended up watching the whole movie. If there were any problems with ghosting or flashlighting or non-aligned 3D images or whatnot, they were invisible to us. We were stunned at the detail, the quality of the 3D, the smooth motion and flawless colors. The TV loftily exceeded our expectations, and our expectations were already pretty high going in.This is an incredible TV. I highly recommend it. At $1600 with the bundle, I am very happy with the purchase.One final note. If you do buy this (or any) TV at Best Buy, be careful if you want to purchase cables. I needed a 16-foot HDMI cable to connect the TV in one room to a desktop computer in another room. Best Buy was selling such a cable for almost $200, but I skipped that and instead drove a few miles to MicroCenter, where I bought an equivalent cable for $20. Yes, $20 vs $200 for a cable that is exactly the same in all respects but name brand (and the $20 cable works beautifully in my setup). So: watch out for cabling markup.
