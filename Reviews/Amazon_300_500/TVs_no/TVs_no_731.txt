I bought this TV at my local BestBuy and it lasted for just over a month and then the plasma picture display died.  There was a loud noise like a "pop" sound and the picture was gone.  I paid just a little more than what Amazon.com is selling it for.  According to Best Buy this TV has been problematic with every one sold being returned to them.  So the problem is across the board.  The real problem comes in if the TV decides to die after the first 30 days as Best Buy will not refund you.  You will have to go through the "repair process" where they send a "repairman"(?) to fix your tv.  Good luck with that!  These "repairmen" don't seem to know what they are doing.  Anywho, after replacing every circuit board in the TV, it's still dead.  So what's next I have no clue.  All I know is I got ripped off buying this TV.  Never again will I buy a tv made by Samsung and never again will I trust a plasma display by any manufacturer.  Everyone's told me to spend the extra it will cost to get an LED LCD as they are supposed to last at least a couple of years.Honestly even with that, I don't feel it's a good investment to spend $4000 to $5000 on a 2 year working TV.  I've heard so much good things about DLP's by Mitsubishi.  The picture quality may not be as good as an LED-LCD tv but I've heard they last a real long time with only requiring a replacement bulb every 1 to 2 years ($100 or less for a bulb).  So I think the next TV I get will be a DLP by Mitsubishi.  Even then I'm going to do a lot of research first and I won't be one of those who is one of the first buyers.  I will only feel comfortable buying a make/model that's been out for awhile and has no big problems associated with it.I'd advise everyone to do the same.
