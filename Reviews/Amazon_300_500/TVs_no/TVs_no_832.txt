I have purchased 3 LCD televisions in the past 6 months, two for my own home and one as a gift for a family member. Of the 3, this SONY Bravia delivers the best picture and performance for the price, which says a lot considering that the other 2 are a Samsung 40 inch 1080p and an LG 42 inch 1080p, both of which are higher resolution.This SONY puts out a fine picture, with good blacks and enough contrast so that you can clearly see the action that takes place in dark scenes. I like its matte screen, which doesn't reflect a lot of room light and is also good when we watch it in bed with the lights out. The set was easy to set up and it has a decent remote with clearly labeled buttons.One of its big pluses is that it interfaces smoothly with our cable remote, which we have to use to control the set when its hooked up to our cable box (which is always). We have another television, a Samsung, that refuses to work well with the cable remote and this is a big headache. This SONY, on the other hand, operates very well with the cable remote. One click turns both the cable box and the television set on or off, plus adjusts audio and changes channels. So simple!I was hesitant about getting a 720p because I worried that the picture would not be crisp, but I figured that since this one was intended as a secondary TV for the bedroom it wouldn't matter that much. It turns out that I needn't have worried, as I can't tell the difference between this picture and the picture that comes out of our (supposedly) better Samsung. And the price for this unit is excellent.Overall, a great set for a great price. Terrific value!
