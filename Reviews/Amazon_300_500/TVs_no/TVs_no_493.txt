I found a good deal on this beast around Black Friday. It does a fine job as a computer display with a few idiosyncrasies. Ideally, I would think you'd want to use the hdmi input as it is a digital input, however Vizio in their vast wisdom has denied us the ability to adjust all the settings necessary to stretch the desktop to fit the screen V-Size is disabled. You can adjust H and V position and H-Size and almost make it fit the screen, just a small black band at the top (or bottom, I suppose) of the screen. I felt that was a trivial concern since the overall size of the display was so immense. But a couple of days later I was puttering around in some spare parts and came across a dvi to rgb converter plug that had come with some video card or other (previously I was using a dvi to hdmi cable). Long story short I hooked up the connector to a cable I had laying around and to the TV and lo and behold a full-screen image and crisper than that of the hdmi. Now in my world rgb is an analog input and dvi/hdmi is a digital output/input, so I can't imagine how the got a 1080p signal over rgb looking so good, and I know that they can't send hdcp over that rgb but I'll take a nice sharp picture anytime. I still have the monitor hooked up on another input for hdmi so I can play blu-ray at full rez, or so I hope... I haven't tried it yet. But overall a fine TV with plenty of inputs, despite its lack of dvi or display port. And the panel looks good, I'm moving from a 24" benq that did hi-def and this looks as good color wise. Game playing is just fine. I've never used a screen refresh rate higher than 60hz anyway so unless someone is doing something seriously wrong or you have some kind of vision defect I'd say this is a great value. BTW, I'm sitting maybe two feet away from it, so I couldn't miss any artifacts/dead pixels/ghosting.
