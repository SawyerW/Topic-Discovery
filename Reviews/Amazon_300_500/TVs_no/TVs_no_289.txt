This is my first LCD TV purchase and I spent dozens of hours checking them out online at Amazon, Circuit City and Consumer Reports.  I even went to Best Buy and looked at them all side-by-side.  I wanted something a little larger but had to compromise with my wife for one that would fit in the armoire (fancy french word for T.V. cabinet).It arrived on New Year's Eve but we had to go out so I couldn't set it up.  On New Year's Day I set it up so I could watch the Bowl Games.  It only took me about 20 minutes to take it out of the box and hook it up.  I add already gone to the cable company and picked up a HD DVR with HDMI cables so I was ready to go. I turned it on and the picture was perfect.  I didn't need to do any calibration or adjustments - just perfection.The only problem was there was no sound.  I called Sharp and amazingly they answered right away on New Year's Day! They told me to unplug everything and wait an hour.  If that didn't solve the problem then they would have to send a tech.  I waited an hour, hooked it back up and . . . no sound. Just when I was going to give up I figured out I had to set the audio output on the cable box to HDMI output. I now had sound.That leads to my only complaint.  The sound is not very good.  That doesn't matter much to me because I hooked it up to my surround sound.All-in-all I am extremely happy with the picture and I have tinkered with it some now.  My cable output is only 1080i but it is still a beautiful picture.  I have watched some movies through my new Toshiba HD DVD player (1080p) and they were great.For the price I payed I don't think I could have done any better.
