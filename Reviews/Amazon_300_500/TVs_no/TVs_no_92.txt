So, let me first say that i was so fired up for my tv to arrive.  I read every single review and apart from some people saying the sound sucked  was pretty pleased.  I'm not one of those people that's crazy about their home theater systems anyways so it not being HD and possibly having poor sound was okay by me.  The first tv came and as the delivery guys unwrapped it they revealed a completey smashed screen even though the box appeared fine.  I was bummed and they said to write amazon and request a replacement.  I did, and amazon was very quick with processing my request, the second tv just arrived about an hour ago.  The box was completely torn apart in one of the corners so I was already nervous.  The tv looked undamaged and the guy was in a hurry to leave so i signed the paper and then hooked it up.  I only remember reading about a humming sound in one of the reviews but it's very bad in my tv.  As soon as I plugged in the audio cable the humming started and it gets louder as you turn the tv up, very distracting.  Every time I changed channels flashes of static come on the screen which is not because of the cable box because it doesn't do it on any other of my tvs i hooked it up to.  I looked at the back of the tv and there is a dent.  I don't know if it's because of damage or just a sucky tv but either way i'm getting a refund and feel like i've wasted a month on this ordeal.  Please take my advice, I know it's a good deal, but you do get what you pay for.  There's just no telling what goes on during the delivery.  I'm gonna go to a store and get a better brand name and pick it up myself.  If you do buy I hope you have better luck than me.
