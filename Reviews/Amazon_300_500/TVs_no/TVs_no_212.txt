I love this TV.  It took me about a month of looking around before I settled on this TV.  Honestly it came down to this TV and the Sony Bravia KDL-40V3000 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV both of which I feel are excellent choices.  After looking at them in stores and reading a lot of reviews I decided on the Samsung because it has more inputs, is HDMI 1.3 compatible, and cost less.  I have a lot of Samsung products and they are all top quality products.The Picture is just superb.  I have it hooked up with HDMI 2M (6 Feet) Super High Resolution Cable by DVI Gear which work wonderfully.  SDTV thru my digital cable box is acceptible depending on what you are watching.  It was actually better than what I expected after reading reviews that it was "just unwatchable".  It is a little grainy, but acceptable for a LCD TV.  What can you expect mixing new technology with old analog signals?  HDTV on the other hand is incredible.  Watching NCAA tournament games just blows me away.  It's like you're there; very clear, true colors, and almost no motion blur.  My PS3 is also a totally new experience.  Graphics are great. I can see individual blades of grass in my Tiger Woods 07 game.  Sometimes I forget it's just a video game and it's output at 720p.  Craziness!  Blu-ray movies are also just as wonderful.Sound is acceptible and I would say bordering on good.  You can definately hear it.  It's not quiet or hallow as others have described it.  It's not surround sound or anything like that, but you can get by with it if you want.  I have mine hooked up to a 5.1 surround sound system so I don't listen to the TV's sound often only when the little one is watching some DVD's so sound is really a none issue for me.Overall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this TV again.  It's an excellent choice and the price on Amazon is the best anywhere.  Feel confident that you made the right choice.
