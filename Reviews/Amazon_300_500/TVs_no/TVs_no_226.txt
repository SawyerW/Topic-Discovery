Just got it today and was a snap to hook up. Plug in the cables and turn on and you have a picture, how easy is that. I haven't even purchased the expensive cables yet. I plugged in S-video and audio cables and it is still amazing. Will probably wait till fall to get the HDTV sat. All the connection ports lets you connect directly to the TV and just search for the source of video and not have to "daisy" all your connections from your dvd player, vcr, sat. receiver, and tv. DVDs are wonderful and the color just pops! The tv is bigger than you think. Once you get it out of the box you say, "Man I'm glad I didn't go bigger." The sound is great even with red/white audio cables.  I would highly recommend. So far, again just 1st day, no problems with the sound ... keeping my fingers crossed. I saved about $450 buying it here, plus free shipping which is another story.Only disappointment was the delivery (Cincinnati, OH to Columbus, OH where it sat for 5 days which caused a problems since I was going to be out of town and finally to Memphis, TN. If you look at a map, you can tell that was a waste of gas (go up to go down through Cincinnati, again). Was to get White Glove Delivery. The driver refused to take the tv out of the box until my wife insisted so she can at least check it for damage (I was not at home, but at work) and refuse to test to see if the tv worked, or to take the box as stated by Amazon's White Glove Service. He said that was not the delivery type he provided. Kinda snippy about it all. Will have to ask them about that, but the tv looked and works fine.
