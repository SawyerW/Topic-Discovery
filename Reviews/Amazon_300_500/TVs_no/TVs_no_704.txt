Amazon sent the "D" (VA panel) not "W" (IPS) panel, so I sent it back. After seeing only the "D" in stock for the 37 inch at Best Buy I purchased via Amazon the 42 inch of the 5400 series, hoping less Panel Lottery in the 5400 series, but I declined to accept the "D" that was sent to me. Google LG and Panel Lottery for more about the Panel Lottery. Better to purchase in Best Buy or another store, seeing for yourself on the box whether it is the superior IPS Panel.All the display models for 5300 & 5400 at Best Buy and at Sears looked great, and Internet research indicates most people love these TVs, if they get the right panel. So, I've given it 4 stars, not to reduce the overall rating of the product if it has the IPS panel. I did see only "W" in stock for the 32 inch in both 5300 & 5400 at Best Buy so at leasst in that size, there are IPS panels available, but I'd like a bigger size.Edit: IPS (In Plane Switching) panels are better, for viewing angle, and other reasons. Panasonic 37 inch ads & sets proclaim that it has a IPS panel, but it has a glossy screen. I want the matter screen that LG provides due to the light in my place. Unfortunately, the Best Buys that I've seen or telephoned only have the "VA" (Vertical Array, marked on LG boxes as "D")for the 37 inch in 5300 series. I telephoned a Best Buy today about the 42 inch 5400 series, and after checking the boxes, the staffer told me they have only the "D" Nothing on the Internet indicates to me that the 42 inch of the 5500 series has anything other than the IPS panel, so I ordered that today from Amazon and hope it will work out. Professional reviewers don't think the "local dimming" on the 5500 series improves anything, but it can be turned off. The 5500 series cost more at $1100 (today's approximate discount price) but all the individual people who comment on sites like Amazon seem to love it.
