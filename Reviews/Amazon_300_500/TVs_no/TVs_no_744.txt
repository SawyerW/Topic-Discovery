When I first started replacing the tube-type TV's in my home with HD, I was taken in with the sales people telling me about "gold plated contacts" and higher transmission rates.  Fortunately, it didn't sound quite right, so I took a little time to look into it.  The short answer is, with a couple of minor notable exceptions, HDMI is digital; you're getting 0's and 1's, not what you used to get with an antennae.  If you get a good picture with a $6.00 HDMI cable, the picture won't be any better with a $60.00 one.  If you have your cable provider come in to do any kind of new connections and they provide an HDMI cable (mine did), it most definitely isn't with a $40 gold plated brand name with assorted bells and whistles one.The exceptions are with cables that run inside a wall, and that's a building code issue that has to do with shielding, not data transmission.  The other possible exception (note the term "possible") is on longer cable runs (30' or more) where impedance might (note the term "might") be an issue.I bought two of these Amazon Basics ver. 1.4 (ethernet capable) cables for my brand new (2012 model) 46", 240 hz, 3D, WiFi TV and for my brand new WiFi Blu-Ray player.  Regardless of what the salesperson tries to tell you, all signals come to the TV 60 hertz.  The 120 or 240 hz conversion happens inside the TV, once the 0's and 1's get there.  3D is also just 0's and 1's.  It all happens inside the TV, not as a result of the HDMI cable.  The TV and the Blu-Ray work fine.  Including shipping, I paid less for these 2 cables than what 1 would have cost at the retailer I bought the TV from.Amazon, is by the way, shipping these in cardboard boxes now, not the PIA plastic clamshells.  If you spend more than what these are selling for, you're wasting your money.
