I did a lot of research before buying this Samsung LED HDTV from Amazon.  In fact I had already decided to buy from BestBuy but when I saw the price on Amazon I ordered in online and with two day delivery it was here in time for my installer to put it on my wall.  My consultant/installer wanted me to buy an LCD (back-lit vs. edge-lit) but when he finished putting in my sound system and fired up the entire system he said he was stunned and amazed at the quality of picture and said that my choice of TVs was better than his recommendation!Mine is hanging in a alcove space in the wall of entertainment center cabinets in our living room and my issue with my older DLP TV was the reflections coming from my wall of windows to the side and back of our seating area.  With the tilting wall mount and the incredible brightness of this TV the glare is not an issue any longer.  The TV automatically updated its firmware once connected to the internet and with my Harmony 900 remote my wife can now easily operate all my components: DirecTV DVR, Apple TV, Ipod, the free BluRay DVD I got with this TV, and the Wii without written instructions or a phone call to me when the grandkids want to watch a DVD.The other thing that was great and had caused me a lot of anxiety in the past with Amazon was their delivery vendor here in the DFW area.  I had quit buying from Amazon for a year because of this but when I saw that Amazon jettisoned its old shipping company and my TV was to be delivered by Pilot Freight Services that sealed the deal.  Pilot called to schedule the delivery and again when in route, and they were very professional when it arrived and placed the box in my living room for the installer to unpack.I highly recommend this TV and I noticed yesterday that BestBuy had already jacked the price back up after the Super Bowl, while it is still much lower on Amazon.
