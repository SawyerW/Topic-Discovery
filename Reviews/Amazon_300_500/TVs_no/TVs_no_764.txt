I won't knock the stars on the account of Vieracast, but I will tell you this:  This is one heck of a TV.  I am using the full HDMI 1.4 feature set as well (ARC).  It supports a single HDMI cable to your receiver for audio, allowing all of your devices that connect to your TV to pump audio through the TV back to your receiver.  What a cable saver! (Make sure your receiver supports ARC - Audio Return Channel).  This does take up an HDMI slot, but you have a ton.The 3D has been flat out amazing, no cross talk issues.  I am not a fan of the heavy battery-equipped glasses and plan on purchasing the newer models at some point.  You should note that when viewing 3D the glasses result in a tint (like looking through sun glasses), so you have to up the brightness when watching.  I select one of the built-in choices: vibrant.  This raises the brightness of the image to the point that you are not aware of the sunglasses effect.Vieracast, and basically all of Panasonic's menu systems are a little on the confusing side.  I love the features the offer but their interface is a little slow and cumbersome.  Netflix (once you get out of vieracast into it) is great.VieraLink allows you to control natively any panasonic device connected over HDMI (as long as it also is a vieralink device).  For me this includes my receiver and bluray player, so I just use the single TV Remote.The Remote is quite nice and has a backlight.  The one ding on the remote is that the more frequent buttons I tend to use are very low, making it uncomfortable.  I mostly use my tivo remote, and I assume most of you will use your own DVR box remote as the main remote anyway.RECOMMENDED: Best TV I have owned.
