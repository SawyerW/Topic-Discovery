I received this HDTV as an Xmas gift to replace a 5 year old Sanyo tube-based HDTV that was going nutty (green tint to the picture suddenly).Pros:* The blur motion control, Bravia Sync, and input switching are great.* The menus for calibration of the picture (if you have a THX calibration disk) are simply very easy.* Watching Blu-Ray movies or playing PS-3 games on this are awe inspiring- incredible details, rich blacks, no motion glitches.* Hooking a Nintendo Wii up to this TV via component cable was a nice surprise too in terms of picture quality and motion tracking.* So many inputs, you will be hard pressed to fill them up.Cons:* The sound of the TV speakers requires you to have a separate receiver/speaker array system. The speakers are rather tinny sounding with no bass.* The quality of this HDTV, like most on the market, requires that you learn how to calibrate the TV to THX or another standard. Otherwise, you are not getting all the quality that the TV is capable of.* The HDMI input does not communicate well with the current Verizon FiOS Motorola HD QIP 71001 set top box. The picture flickers intermittently, goes to green screen, or goes to black depending upon the channel selected. Switching the set top box to feed this Sony using component cables solves the issue, but it is disappointing that neither Sony, Motorola, nor Verizon want to take ownership of this HDMI problem.Overall, the picture quality of this TV blew away other 120 Hz LCD HDTV's both priced at this level & even $1,000 more. To get a better picture, if you know how to calibrate an HDTV, you would have to spend several thousand dollars more. Even then, the amount you will spend versus perceptible picture quality improvement is not really worth the bang for the buck IMHO. I would recommend this TV with the above 3 caveats.
