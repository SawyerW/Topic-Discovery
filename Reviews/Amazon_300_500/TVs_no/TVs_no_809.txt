I upgraded from an old Westinghouse 42" 720p to this TV and couldn't be happier.  I was torn between this and a Sony Bravia 40", but feel I have made the right choice.  I had my doubts as it didn't have a lot of reviews and one noted some issues that seemed somewhat bothersome.  I haven't noticed any of these issues luckily.Upgrading from a much older LCD to a new LED back-lit LCD obviously has improvements.  As I just got this TV a few days ago, I haven't been able to fully test out the 1080p resolution, but the difference is easily noticeable between the TVs running cable at 720p/1080i.  From what I did try in 1080p looked far improved.The Apps work well aside from netflix freezing once and forcing the TV to restart, but I use it a lot and rarely have any problems.  I don't have much to compare it to as this is the only TV I've used that has any applications, but it is more than enough for me.  There is still room for improvement, but as it upgraded the firmware the first day I had it, I feel it shouldn't have any problems advancing.Overall a great product.  Fair priced and good performance.  I feel most people won't regret this purchase, but suggest seeing the TVs in action to pick what's right for them.I will edit this review if there are any problems.UPDATEThis TV does "reset" quite often.  And also there is an issue with the smart dimming.  If there is a screen with a lot of black for an extended period of time (for me it was GTAIV's pause screen) it will shut off the screen.  Luckily all you have to do is turn off smart dimming.  As for the constant resets, I am currently looking into it.  Dropped to 4 stars.  The resets are tolerable, just annoying.UPDATE 2The resets no longer seem to be occurring.  It might have been fixed, I'll update again if it seems to start happening again.  But for now back up to 5 stars.
