I bought this unit mainly for watching HD channels like ESPN HD. It had arrived just before Major League's playoff began. Sport programs like playoff and NFL in HD are super amazing. I can't go back to 4:3 pictures.Time Warner Cable in my area provides HD subscribers with free HBO channels, one of which is in HD. Viewing movies in HD is also superb.The HD set-top-box is connected to the TV with a component cable. The TV does not have a DVI input (but has two HDMI inputs).This unit has some cool features (maybe other products have similar ones) such as "dynamic picture" which adjusts picture settings automatically based on the ambient lightings. You can also manually choose, say, "movie" which is less vivid than other settings and good for watching movies in a dark room.Please note this if you often use closed caption. As long as the set-top-box is connected via component, you may not be able to use TV's closed caption feature. I won't blame the TV of this because as I did research online, I've found that there is no specification on closed caption signal transfer over component. So it may be that the set-top-box doesn't send out the closed caption signals over component. Or it may be that the TV doesn't receive the CC signals on component. A workaround for this is to have the set-top-box insert the caption by itself, whose font is less clean than the TV's (but legible, of course).Overall, this TV is a great buy for this quality and relatively affordable price and highly recommended. Be informed that Sharp is the leading company in HDTV in Japan. I would say Sharp's HDTVs are more popular than Sony's. My parents in Japan have a 37" Sharp HDTV, which is of incredible quality. And my 32" in the US doesn't disappoint me.
