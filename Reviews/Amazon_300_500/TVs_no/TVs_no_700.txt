I've previously added comments to other reviews on this HDTV, but I'll now be writing my own review in stages -- adding comments as I setup the unit & learn its features. So, here goes:1. Reading/following the written instructions for stand assembly and attachment will seriously slow-down most folks --  the actual process is quite simple: There are 3 parts to the stand, and 2 bags containing 4 screws each (long set & short set). Attach the aluminum plate to the base using the 4 long screws, then slide the plastic cover over the aluminum plate before attaching the assembled base to the back of the TV with the 4 remaining short screws. If any of the screws seem difficult to tighten, then STOP & reposition the associated parts until all the screws turn smoothly in their intended sockets. At each assembly step, leave the screws slightly loose until all 4 screws are installed; this will permit repositioning if needed, to get all the screws properly threaded into place. Then, tighten the screws fully so that there's no detectable looseness or wobble in the stand. Now, you're ready to place the TV upright. As a final check on your assembly, make sure that the TV rotates smoothly on its base.One of the small details that made a BIG difference for me in choosing this unit, is the matte screen. I'll be using this TV in an area that's generally well-lit and I can already see that the screen is free of annoying reflections.(I shall return)OK, back after less-than 1 week, to report that my TV is being returned to Amazon due to a screen defect (getting increasingly washed-out~too bright in 2 corners). No, this is NOT what I meant, when I previously said: "I shall return." I'll have to pick another model, as Amazon is sold-out & aren't expecting any more at this time -- Very sad! Really want/need matte screen -- any suggestions?
