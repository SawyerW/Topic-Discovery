I, like many other, spent significant time researching LCD televisions. C-NET and others advised the Sony over the Samsung. I have seen both in action at the homes of friends and my eye viewed the Samsung as every bit as good in picture quality if not better than the Sony. So the decision was made on the Samsung based on features and price, anywhere from $200 to $500 cheaper based on my research. The next decision was whether to risk making such a high dollar purchase online, Amazons price being $400 to $600 less than the brick and mortar stores. After reading many reviews here on Amazon, I decided to pull the trigger and order from Amazon. It was an EXCELLENT CHOICE. The set was ordered on a Friday morning, and arrived via EGL on Amazons super saver free freight rate on Tuesday. Three business days or five calendar days. The set beat my satellite installer so I wasn't expecting much from the picture as I pulled it out of the box. I set it up to make sure it was functioning, and as expected the standard def channels were fuzzy. For kicks I connected my cheap Radio Shack rabbit ears into the antenna connection, and went searching for over the air high definition. What I found was that all the networks carried digital channels as did the fringe channels. I am getting Fox, NBC,CBS, CW, and the MY CHANNEL stations in either 480p or 720p. I also get a PBS HD signal in 1080i. When the networks broadcast their hi-def signals they all come in in either 720p or 1080i. All this on a cheap ten dollar Radio Shack rabbit ears antenna. I have a friend who bought a DLP projection, something I was looking at, and he only receives a 480p signal. Samsung obviously got it right with their built in HD tuner. Samsung got it right with their picture as well. Have had none of the picture issues C-NET talks about. Blacks are definately black, whites are very white, no ghosts, no shadows and no picture lag. I highly recommend this set.
