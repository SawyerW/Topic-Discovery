I first bought this TV from Amazon after seeing it at a local electronic store (B&M;).Once the tv arrived I set it up and tweaked the settings that I found online from a reputable forum.The picture quality was OK, not great.I decided to do a little bit more research as to why my TV set looked different than the local store's TV.I later discovered this was a "CN01" type panel I had vs. a SQ01 panel from the local store. What did this all mean?Well, it explained why the TV picture quality of my TV was terrible and the picture quality in the local store was vastly better.The "auto-motion" was jerky on my tv and even had shadowing and images that would stay on the screen.For example, if someone was walking on TV that had black hair, the head would bouncing up and down while they were walking would stay at the top of the "bounce" while the were coming down.After further research on he type of panels, I found out that the panel I had, "CN01" was manufactured by Chi Mei Optoelectronics which is not samsung but a third party, hence the bad quality.This is a chart that may be useful for some people (thank you AVS forums!)  * A = AU Optronics (AUO) A-MVA  * B = Chi Lin Technology (CLT)  * C = Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO)  * I = LG Display IPS (LGD)  * P = Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT)  * S = Samsung S-PVA (S-LCD)  * H = Samsung S-PVA (3D)  * Q = IPS Alpha Technology LTD (Hitachi & Panasonic) IPS Alpha/IPS ProAMAZON was great in dealing with the return and refunded my money very quickly. Amazon's customer service is top-notch.It looks like Samsung is using a "panel lottery." So it's up in the air on what you get.
