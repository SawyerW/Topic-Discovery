We had two LCDs out of the box and hooked up at home.  It's a long story, but we ended up taking both of them back for different issues, one of which turned out to be a bad cable.  CC was so great to take them back and we hadn't considered a plasma because of the glare issue.  Well, I started reading about this Samsung plasma and how that had implemented some sort of anti glare system.  We went back and I realized how much more vivid the colors are on this TV than an LCD.  Plus, I thought the picture on this new model was quite a bit better than any other plasma models on the floor.  We got it home and running and after having the other two LCDs to compare with, this thing ROCKS!!!!!  Even in our bright room, the glare is not a problem for us.  There is definitely more glare than an LCD, but it is so much better.  There is this blurry thing that happens with motion on an LCD.  And, I had read about it, but people were saying it's not so much of an issue anymore with recent models.  I don't buy that after experiencing both kinds of TVs, the plasma is so much more clear with fast motion, and there is so much more depth to the colors.  I'm extremely happy.The only issue I have is with the sound.  It's terrible.  The sound was much better on the LCDs I had here at home.  I have external speakers, so the sound quality is not important to me, but if you care even a little bit about the sound quality, I would consider buying even some low-end bookshelf speakers.  Anything will sound better than the speakers built in to this thing.  The speakers on my 5 year old 27" tube TV were better.  I still gave it 5 stars, even with this sound issue because if you're in the market for this type of TV, you'll likely have some sort of surround setup and the speakers won't matter.  Buy this TV for the picture and the price.Go see for yourself.... the depth of color and clarity are unmatched in my opinion.
