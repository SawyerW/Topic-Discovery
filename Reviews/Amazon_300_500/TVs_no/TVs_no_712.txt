This certainly isn't the best TV out there, but for the price it is a nice value that will deliver a quality picture for those looking for a budget TV.  I owned a 47" LD520, and I thought that the picture was blurry on that TV.  The 42" has performed much better than it's larger counterpart, at least in my experience.  The picture does need some calibration out of the box.  If you buy, or own, a basic HDTV calibration blu-ray (I use AVE essentials), then you can get the TV to look pretty good, even without a professional calibration.  You won't find many TV's with ISF calibration settings in this price range, and it made it really easy to get the TV to demonstrate good clarity and color reproduction.  Granted, blacks on this TV are not as good as my plasma, but I didn't buy this TV to be a showpiece of electronics, either.  I use the TV for gaming, and I haven't had problems with motion blur or ghosting.For those considering plasma or LCD, I own both, and I can tell you that both formats have their pluses and minuses.  Plasmas have a sharper picture, better color reproduction, less motion blur, and deeper blacks in comparison to LCD/LED.  LCD/LED use less energy, run cooler, and have no burn-in or image retention issues in comparison to plamsa. There are exceptions, but this generally is the way the two formats compare.  I personally use LCD for gaming and plasma for everything else, so I don't have to worry about burn-in of static images when gaming.Anyway, long story short, my experience with the TV has been positive up to this point.  Since this model is no longer in production (or shortly will not be in production), it's a nice time to pick it up at a discounted price, in comparison to the new 2011 models.
