I've had this TV for three weeks now and I'm very happy with it.  I went with the small end of the HDTV line because I have a moderately sized apartment and didn't want the set to dominate my living room.  The 32" screen is a nice, modest size and the picture quality is great.  Going for 1080p rather than 720p might be overkill at this size, but it's nice to know I have the sharpest image money can buy and it'll make a stunning second monitor for my computer.I'm glad that they put a matte finish on the glass so that there's much less glare than on my old standard TV.  The border is shiny piano black but I haven't been troubled by reflections or fingerprints.  I also haven't noticed any problems with uneven backlighting or bad pixels.  When watching non-widescreen programs the set will let you choose from black sidebars, stretch, or zoom.  I wish it were smart enough to automatically zoom in on letterboxed low-definition shows but it's easy enough to switch manually.I was surpised at the diversity of input ports: multiple stereo audio jacks, component, composite, S-video, cable, and HDMI.  The set will let you rename the inputs on-screen and disable inputs that you don't use.I'm very pleased with the speakers.  The sound quality is quite good and, unlike many sets, the volume covers the entire range from very quiet to blasting with fine control.  My old set went from "not quite loud enough" to "annoying loud" with a single press of the volume button.  I know that many people hook up external sound systems these days but for my purpose I'm glad to have good built-in speakers.The remote control is perplexingly big.  The buttons are small and widely spaced.  There's also a flip-open compartment with four small buttons inside.  Why they didn't just put those buttons on the surface is beyond me.
