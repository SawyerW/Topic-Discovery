I have had my tv for 4 weeks now and I must say I still get impressed by it's picture. Today I watched Train spotting on standard dvd via my Sony bdps550 and I was amazed how good it made the 480I look. It looked almost like a blu ray. The picture was perfect it had that film texture perfect brightness. This led is so good because it uses white led light it does not have a blue tinted light like so many lcd /led panels;call edge led. You see if  you have a blue led it will tint your white color and it will offset all the other colors.  So when you go out and look at a big tv wall compare the white colors on this set to others. You will notice other sets make the skies way too blue and peoples face look off color and on outside footage you lose the golden glow of the sun.  The other great thing about this set is the part that also makes it expensive; it is the back lit led. It allows sections of the panel to have no light which gives you great black levels " it makes a dark movie like Batman" look great and you don't lose detail in the surround parts which may need to be lighter.  The hd off the air antenna looks great and leaves you wowed and the remote is so cool too it has a power key on the underside so you can use your index finger to power the set. Now you don't have to make your way to the top of the remote to turn it off.  Lastly the 3d part. You may not care about 3d but you will like it when you see it. Remember this led has  the best picture you can buy so 3d is just an extra feature. ps if its outside the budget checkout the kdl55hx800/810 it's also good. One more thing always use monster cable and monster power. good luck I hope this helped
