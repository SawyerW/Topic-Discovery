I bought this product in November. We watched it only in the evenings for about two hours of movie viewing. Then, in April, we stopped watching the evening movies. In May, we were going to resume them. Now wouldn't you think a TV set sitting there resting all that time would be only too eager to provide you with a little TV time when you tried to turn it on again? Well, guess what, folks? It died. It rolled over dead on the spot. Kaput.Okay, so we have a manufacturer's warranty. We haul it to the local repair shop, they fix it, and the manufacturer pays the tab, right? WRONG! The guarantee requires that we ship it to the factory! What? They tell us to ship it back in the original box and packing, if we still have it. Okay, pack rat that I am, I HAD saved it. Just in case. They do have very fine print somewhere that says if it is damaged in transit, such damage is just our bad luck. But, hey, they tell me to use the original packing, so I figure all that hard-as-steel Styrofoam encapsulating the TV set like a mummy is impervious to shippers dropping, stomping on, or tossing boxes around. WRONG.I get an email with attached photos that the bezel (Must be French: the frame), is cracked and will not be repaired. They send photos of the box. Guess I'm half blind, because the box looks fine to me, both front and back. So they send me back the damaged TV, which I sent to them following their shipping instructions, and I am told to take it up with UPS. SURE!Am I a happy camper? Not on your life.A TV should last longer than five months. It shouldn't have to be shipped back to the factory for repairs. It should be repaired locally.End of story. Reason for only one star.
