I belong to a consumer panel online which award you points for transmitting consumer purchases each week. I needed a TV for my bedroom and thought that this one looked great and would workout. I used over 168,000 points for this beautiful piece of "CRAP". After taking it out of the box, I discovered that there was no power cord in the box. Due to the fact that I had waited more than 30 days to report this Coby refused to send me a power cord. I contacted the NCP group and they were able to get me a power cord, it took a while but I did get one, eventually.The TV is the worst product that I've even purchased from anywhere in "America". It states on the box that it was made in "CHINA" yet another reason not to buy this brand... Cheap... Cheap... Cheap, everything about it is cheap. The remote control is a piece of worthless plastic that functions sometimes and sometimes not. You have to scan for channels every other day unless you have an outside antenna, which I don't, but I purchased an antenna inline booster with a bidirectional capability. Even with that it's ability to locate channels when scanning is awful.I can't believe that this company is still in business due to it's poor customer service and the people who work their, extremely lackadaisicalness in their attempt to assist customers. It's like they know that nothing is going to happen if they give you lousy service. The sound goes off at will and you must turn the TV off and back on to get the sound back. I'm going to purchase me another TV for my bedroom and I assure you that it won't be by "COBY". This is why companies in "AMERICA" need to bring back manufacturing of TV's back to America.
