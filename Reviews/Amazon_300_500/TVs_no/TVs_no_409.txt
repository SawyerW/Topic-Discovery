At least for now this TV seems like the low price leader among new 2009 52" sets.  I am very happy with my purchase after 2 weeks of ownership.  I am watching it without any custom tweaking at all and blu-ray looks great, and ATSC digital broadcast reception via a RCA ANT1500 Large Multi-Directional Digital Flat Passive Antenna (White) is excellent too.I bought this sight unseen because the price was right and it seemed to have the important stuff and not the frills, which was just what I wanted.  Also previous models of the Aquos line got decent reviews.This is my first large LCD so I don't have much to compare with.  The features seem to be just a somewhat more mature version of last years features which is great if you don't want the dubious advantages (and expense) of things like 240hz mode, LED backlighting or ultra-thin screen.The built-in sound is decent with hidden, downward pointing speakers and I use it for live TV (ie News and Sports) but for movies I have it connected to an AV surround amp.Looks great mounted on the wall (nicer than on the stand).Pros:  - 10-bit screen  - non-glare screen  I have it next to large window and although you can certainly see the light reflected, it is a kind of matte look not a sharp reflection.  And the brightness of the screen can overcome whatever reflection there is except in dark scenes.  - 120hz mode  I really don't see a lot of difference so I tend to leave things in the regular movie mode, even for baseball  - good response time  subjective, nothing to compare  - good black  subjective, nothing to compare - plenty of connections - can custom label the on-screen menu inputs  well, it's important to me :)Cons: - no PIP  I don't care - no DLNA/Internet connectivity  I'm connected to a MediaPC so this would be redundant except for firmware upgrades which have to be done via a USB port (not sure if end user can do that) - the USB port is good only for service, not, for example, loading home pictures - again with a MediaPC it's not needed.The delivery via Amazon/CEVA was by a couple of very nice guys who brought it in, unpacked it, put it on the stand (which I later removed) and turned it on, which was exactly what I wanted and expected.  No dead pixels.  15 month warranty (12 month plus 3 more for registering online) which I hope I don't have to use.
