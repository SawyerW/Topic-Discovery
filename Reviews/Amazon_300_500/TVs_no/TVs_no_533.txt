To put this review in perspective, I got this TV for $699 plus $40 shipping.  At this price, the value is exceptional.1.  For a ~$700 TV, the picture is excellent.  The clarity and colors are excellent.  On certain movies, there is a 3-D effect which never ceases to amaze me.  It's not the Avatar type of 3-D, but a more modest but still impressive 3-D/motion effect.  I have seen the new LED TVs and they are noticeably richer in color intensity but they are also at least twice the price.  I also wasn't able to adjust the color settings in the store so the comparison is not complete.  I have my TV set to Sport or Vivid and the color intensity is closer to an LED TV.  So maybe stores are not quite comparing apples to apples when demonstrating TV's next to each other.2.  As mentioned by other reviews, the RCA audio outputs do not work when the HDMI cable inputs are used.  This is annoying and poor design/manufacturing decision.3.  The built in speakers are some of the worst I have heard on an expensive TV.  Most 27" tube TV's have better sound than this one.4.  The key saving sound feature that stopped me from returning the TV because of sound, was the headphone jack.  I connected a good quality powered computer speakers w/woofer system into the headphone jack and now the sound is excellent for everyday use and I don't have to mess with my separate stereo component system.5.  Used as a computer monitor, the quality of the picture is excellent and works well with my Dell computer. When the HDMI outputs of my computer are used, there is a very noticeable overscan where icons on the extreme edge of the desktop screen are almost completely cut off.6.  Overall, the picture is so excellent, I am finding myself watching older movies again in HD.  It's like watching a different movie and I am catching detail I have missed even in theaters.
