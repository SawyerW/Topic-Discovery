I am not a television expert by an means except for having watched it too much for too many years. That being said, this TV has a great picture, more connections than you could ask for and super sound. (Point of fact: it replaced a 32" conventional tv that was 10 years old.) Right now, I am watching the NCAA tourney and I can tell you which players are sweating and how much. I got this at Sears for $899 but the next day, I noticed that HHGreg had it for $100 cheaper. Sears matched the price and knocked of another $10. I chose this set above all the others because of the three years' interest free financing (cost under $25/month). They all seemed the same (LCD/plasma) to me and all of the pictures were great. I was able to take it home in a car. (Sears also had a free install deal on this so if it were wall mounted, that would have been a deal. However, it's on a stand so set up was no problem. Note: install does not equal delivery they were not going to deliver it for free.)I never buy anything when it is new, I'm always the one who buys the lawnmower that you brought back to Home Depot. In this case, buying new was a great idea. You will not be disappointed with this set. Some reviews I have read say the remote is skimpy. True; you will probably use the cable/dish one anyway or buy a replacement. The picture is why you bought the set anyway.Warranty: Sears wanted to sell me a 3 year for $300. I was able to locate a place on line that sells them for $150 for 5 years.Long winded but in a nutshell, if you are looking for a great deal on a great tv, this will fit the bill quite nicely and deserves a look.
