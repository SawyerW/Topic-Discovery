If you haven't taken out insurance for this model, do so ...now.The TV has served me well, gaming is nice, picture quality is ok (you'll need to fiddle with the settings through), sound is average...Very little Bass.Then the annoying things.1. When you hit the button to change sources you are taken through loads of options that are not active. For the life of me I can't understand why I need to see the DTV source and the TV source. It should only show you the sources connected to the TV but this set has a mind of its own.2. Power Up. There's an annoying white/blueish light that comes on at the bottom of the unit. Its very distracting and has not aesthetic appeal whatsoever. In face it looks as if the light from the LCD crystals are leaking through a fault.3. From the time you press the power on button to the time you actually get a picture, you could make a cup of tea. Heaven forbid that you accidentally hit power off in the middle of some interesting news story...by the time the TV boots up again, the story is over.4. Remote layout. For some reason Samsung have decided that you will always access its proprietary buttons. Why they couldnt hide the sync buttons is a mystery to me. They only work if you have a samsung dvd player.5. Game Mode. This does nothing to improve the picture, sound or look and feel of the games.6. Movie mode. Someone should tell Samsung that Movies are no longer recoreded in Sepia. Its just horrible.Even though its good for the money, once you had it in my home there were just too many things I was not happy with.Then after all that the damn thing died on me!When I turn the power on, I can hear the customary click and instead of the expected secondary click and picture...it just keeps clicking and turning itself off. I checked online forums and it appears to be a problem with samsung TV's. There's a class action lawsuit in America since the problem only
