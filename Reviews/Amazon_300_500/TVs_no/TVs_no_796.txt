Don't be cheap like me. I regret it now. A television is supposed to last you and your family many years of good memories....therefore, skip this television. It turns on, PS3 to HDMI connects, and the TV works but the overall quality is just bad.The blacks on this television is horrible. During scenes where there is darkness and light, like a movie character or a videogame character is in a dungeon with no light, it's hard to see unless you shoot up the brightness, but once the scene reaches a place with light, it's too bright. So an easier way to think of it is: the black doesn't balance well with color. The black is just too black.Another issue is the lights on the corners of the screen. The lights are used to light up the screen, but on the corner's they are very bright and it dims as is it nears the center. The corner of the screen should not be brighter than the rest of the screen. It's annoying to look at.Another issue is the sound. It sounds like a baby lion trying to roar like his father. The TV has a weak sound and when volume is turned up, there's a muffled sound to it, like the volume is too powerful for the TV's built in stereo to handle. The TV can't handle it's own sound limit and I never turn it up past 55 percent of the way. Standard definition televisions have better sound.Blu Ray and DVDs don't seem much different on this TV. Once we switched to a Samsung, the difference between Blu Ray and DVDs was crazy!! It seemed like you were the cameraman watching the actors in front of you....Our standard definition TV has lasted us 15 years and it's still running great. This Coby LED TV lasted us 2 years before we gave it to a local thrift store. The quality is so bad that I don't feel like watching anything or playing videogames on it. Spend some more and get a better quality television. I was being cheap and thought all LED TV's would be good, but I was wrong. Don't make the same choice I did by getting this TV.
