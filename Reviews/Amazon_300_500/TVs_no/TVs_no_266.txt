I just bought the unit and it is very good. I may write a longer review later but for now here is what I know:About a week ago I bought a Panasonic PZ77U because I thought, "Hey, it's a 1080p plasma, the price is ok, it has anti-glare". However, I wasn't really very happy with the picture, I don't like the shiny bezel, and it's too wide because they put the speakers on the ends. I have the two sets side by side and I'm doing a fair evaluation (Samsung 1080i vs. Panasonic 1080p). To my eyes, the Samsung has a brighter, more vivid picture. Additionally, it does SD better which is very important to me. I thought the PZ77 did good on SD but the 4254 does better. PZ77 does have much better speakers though. I will be doing more comparison for the next couple of days but my current thinking is that the Panasonic is going back.1080p on a 42" plasma might look slightly better when using a HD-DVD, but all other sources including HD TV programming, SD programming, and SD upconverted DVD's look as good or better on this 1080i set. In my non-techno non-videophile opinion.If you can buy it from Amazon, do so without hesitation. Up where I live in Canada I had to buy it from a big store because Amazon doesn't ship here for these bigger ticket items.Updated: Dec. 2007. I returned this unit because I did not find the glare acceptable. I ended up with a Sony LCD instead and I am much happier. If the glare doesn't bother you, and if you are not going to ever worry about the possibility of burn-in then go for it! For me however, I am much more at peace with my LCD TV. Best of luck.
