We received our first Mitsubishi LT-46265 Unison TV earlier in the spring this year.  It had a bad digital board right out of the box and had to be returned.  An exchange for an identical set was initiated and we have had that TV since early May. After putting the set through a full setup procedure, the image produced is quite stunning.  Sound is good, but not as good as from our 35" Mitsubishi CRT set that we replaced after some 15 years of problem-free service. An issue we had with the current set was over-scanning in which about 20% of the available image is beyond the frame of the screen. The issue turned out to be semantics: "full" vs. "standard." This nomenclature confused even the company's customer service folks.  Use "full" if you want to see "all" of the picture.Some facts buyers should consider: 1) The angle of view for this set is only about 10 degrees to either side of the viewing axis.  If you and your wife will be watching TV from the same couch and in line with the center axis of the screen, great.  If you expect others to sit farther to the side, they will see a more washed out, cloudy, contrast-less, image.  2)The surround sound does work, and works pretty well.  Don't compare it to your 5.1 or 7.1 system in your home theater, however.  It's a gimmick; use it and enjoy it as a gimmick.  3) The probability of receiving a Mitsubishi set with problems right out of the box is high.  You'd be better off buying a Sony, Sharp, Samsung or Panasonic model with similar specifications. However, in doing so, you may not enjoy the better picture provided by Mitsubishi, properly set up.  Over the years, we have had a very good experience with Mitsubishi TVs and bought this one with that experience guiding our decision.  I'm not sure I'd do that again. But, if you have lot's of patience and can setup the set properly, you will be rewarded with a better than average viewing experience.
