Odds are, if you are looking at reviews for this television, you've got one and you're having problems with it.This happened to me, and after looking on the web, it looks like a number of bugs have been reported:1) The screen flashes blue, then goes black, but you can still hear audio. If you turn the unit off, the blue "standby" light still illuminates, but if you turn it on again, the screen is dead, or lights for a while and then goes dead.2) The TV goes dead: no sound, no picture, no standby3) Flickering of colors, etc.In my case, after 30 months of use, I got the first problem, where it would flicker and then go to a black screen, first when using a PS3 via DVI, and later with HDTV cable through the component cables. Needless to say, this was disappointing after paying 1.3k in November 2004. Up until this point, the picture and sound had been reliable and good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.It turns out that the root cause for issue (1) is the Darfon 144 LCD inverter, which generates power to light up the backlight. A number of manufacturers use this part and had the same bug. Based on research at yahoo groups, where there is a list called syntax_lcd, you can fix this by either (a) getting a new inverter board for a couple hundred, (b) removing and re-soldering the transformers to the board to fix bad solders, or (c) replacing a couple specific transistors that are testing poorly.Items 2 and 3 above are driven by a complete or partial failure of the power module. There are also other issues driven by a failure of the motherboard. The yahoo group forum does a good job listing and addressing the problems if you read through a couple hundred comments, you'll find your issue, as well as a few others.The group chats include a number of folks had luck with fixes for all three, and I plan to go down that path in a few weeks. Hopefully it will eke another couple of years of life out of the set, but this might be a good excuse to upgrade to a larger 1080p set.
