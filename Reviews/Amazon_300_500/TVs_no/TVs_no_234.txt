I purchased this tv about a month ago, after researching it and last year's model for over a year.  I hesitated because I was waiting for more HD channels.  I also waited for the price point of $800, and then after reading more great reviews I decided to take the plunge. I'm using it in my bedroom, which it is perfect for. The picture was the best I've seen, bar none, but I was worried about the audio drop out problem, (see below in discussion forum).  However, Samsung seems to have  corrected this with the latest firmware.My experience with Amazon and the ordering process was flawless.  I ordered on a Monday, got an email 2 days later telling me Eagle would be contacting me for an appt. for delivery, they called on that Friday and delivered the next Monday.  The guy came when expected, plugged it in, all looked good, and I spent the next few hours going through the remote and fine tuning things.  i had bought an RCA OTA antenna ($49) for local HD free channels, but it only picked up one channel, so I returned it and bought a Phillips antenna at Walmart for $24, and it picks up all locals! Just auto program the channels for OTA. I don't have HDMI cable or HD through Directv yet, but plan to when the HD dvr drops a little in price.  In the meantime I checked my manufacture date, which was July 2007, and the firmware in my tv was 1012, the April update, so I contacted Samsung for the 1020 firmware, took 2 calls, but it was finally delivered, and easy to install.  This way I'll be ready for HDMI and HD dvr when I decide to order, with no audio drop out problems.  Rest assured, this tv is great, the colors and true to life images with my OTA antenna are breathtaking!  Other channels through my Tivo look ok. It's well worth the price and delivery, (which I worried about), was flawless.  I think my next purchase will be a 46" Samsung for my den.
