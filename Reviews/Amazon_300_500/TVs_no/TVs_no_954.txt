I could not have been happier with this TV and with Amazon.  Product showed up on time and in good condition with adequate packaging.  The picture is amazing, and one thing I like is that these TVs do not have that 'fake' picture look to them like some of the new LEDs.  Sound quality is adequate for cable television, but you need surround sound to appreciate the full effect with movies.My warning is with the screen.  We had a 42" previous version of this TV that survived all sorts of abuse.  However, this unit cracked the plasma inside the glass screen on the first hit by a light plastic toy.  This was certainly our fault, but when we submitted to Panasonic they were unwilling to help in any way outside of warranty claims.  Since this was not covered by warranty, our only option was local Panasonic Service Centers.  We spoke with two in our area, and their price for a new plasma screen (without any mark up or labor for install) was actually higher than our new TV from Amazon.  Panasonic has repairs priced higher than new TVs and they do not provide any swap/refurbish options.  This was very disappointing.I now have a beautiful TV that will not turn on because there is a fail-safe feature in the unit that does not allow power to the screen if it is cracked.  It costs more to repair the TV so I might as well throw the whole thing in the dumpster.I still use and love my 42" Viera.  I am not sure if the glass got weaker or it is simply a product of physics with a bigger screen.  But I warn you if you have kids; take some time to research units with a strong face.  Maybe Gorilla Glass (iPad screen) will start making products for Panasonic!
