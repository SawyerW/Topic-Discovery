I have this TV now for about 1 month and am so far pleased with the purchase.  This TV replaced a 42" plasma EDTV.  This TV went into a bedroom with a 8 foot viewing distance.  I would reccommend a larger set if your distance is greater than 8 feet.  When I first got the TV home I mounted it to the provided TV Stand, but then ordered on Amazon a $30 tilting wall mount for it.  This TV without the stand is very lightweight.  I did match this with a Sony Blu Ray Player, and SOny 5.1 HDMI 1000 watt sound system.  Note that when matching to other Sony products the other products are instantly recognized by the TV.  For example, when I turn the TV on and then insert a disk in the Blu Ray player on the TV the mode is automatically switched to BD to view the movie.  Note that 2 HDMI inputs are on the side of the unit, and 2 in the back.  I also connected an XBox 360 to the TV and been having great performance with it.  Note that the non-illuminated remote is a little un-intuitive/ergonomic to use.  The mute button is very small, and I also have problems with the black dial you need to use for menu program operations. Also note that the TV sound is not very loud, but, since I am using a thousand watt sound system I can get the missing volume any time I want.  The high definition viewing (720 I/P, 1080 I/P) is very good.  Standard definition is problematic when viewing standard TV stations.  Colors sometimes can be blotchy, and overall a little out of focus.  But you can't blame that on the TV because when you switch to the HD TV Station and it's crystal clear!  I experimented placing this TV in my living room but opted for a larger 47" lcd tv there instead.  That is why I suggest not using it where your distance is greater than 8 feet.  For the price, and my needs this TV was a great choice.
