I had been looking for a while to upgrade my first generation HD TV.  I had finally settled on 2 TVs.  The first was the Sony XBR 55 HX929.  This is a LED/LCD model.  It was a 940 htz refresh rate.  The second was the Panasonic 55" GT30 plasma.In the years gone back, Plasma tvs were given a bad rap, but the picture quality has always been great.So, what convinced me to get the Panasonic was the THX certification.  It is only available on this model.  I had read the early reviews of this model that had the image flicker and was hesitant to purchase the Panasonic.  Then I read the the later production run (Nov 2011) had solved this issue.Also, one of the other reason, was the price.  the Sony XBR though a great TV was $2900 bucks.  Amazon had the Panasonic on sale for about $1350, plus not sales tax and free shipping.Once it arrived, it was easy going.  I had purchase a TV stand (VAS 50" 3-in-1 console [XL50-5GB]) from a local retailer after not liking what I saw on Amazon.  Once set on the stand, I plug in a hard wire cat5 cable and updated the firmware in now time.Another reason for this TV, there were 4 HDMI inputs.  With Cable, Media Player and a PS3, I have a spare HDMI input to use for my computer or other devices.In order to test drive the TV, I select Blade Runner.  The black (and there are a lot in this movie) were nice a dark.  Crisp images and no motion blur.  As with most Plasma TV, the is a glare issue if there is too much light.  I have a lot of windows in my TV room and don't seem to notice it even with daylight coming in the room.  I guess I'm lucky as my Den is on the east side of the house..  no afternoon sunlight.I do not use the TV speakers, but have a 5.1 system, so I can't rate the TV speakers.I have to give this a 5 star review.
