I love this Samsung TV! Great TV. Great picture and great sound. I bought it from Amazon.com on June 18, 2011 and received it on June 23, 2011. It works great. The remote control is easy to use. It changes channels very fast. It only takes 1 second to change channels.  I have no problem with glare. I watched TV during the daytime and nighttime and I see no glare. I was always worried about glare but I see no glare. Let me say my #1 choice was a Sony but it was too expensive for my budget and it was also a smaller 40 inch TV. Panasonic was my second choice because I already own a 32" Panasonic standard tube TV. Samsung was my third choice and cheapest price of the three brands. But I am very happy with my purchase. I always wanted a 42 inch TV and the Samsung TV is 1 inch bigger. I got FREE shipping from Amazon.com. Amazon.com Pilot services delivered the TV and set up the TV in 10 minutes. The sound is great. I usually watch regular TV shows with volume set at 20 volume level and I hear clear sound. I have my regular DVD player connected to the TV using an HDMI cable and the DVD picture and sound is amazing. I use a 5.1 surround sound system to watch DVD movies. I use the TV speakers to watch old classic TV series on DVD. The TV has bright beautiful colors if you set the picture control to DYNAMIC MODE. Turn off the SRS surround sound on TV and set sound mode to MOVIE MODE for loudest volume sound from TV speakers. The Samsung customer service is very friendly. They helped me connect my DVD player using an HDMI cable to the TV set. You will not regret your purchase. I didn't.
