Beauty - I bought the Wega off Craigslist for $300 in 2008.  We were not in the HD upgrade market, we just needed a TV since our 27" Sony Trinitron took on a little lightning.  Being a huge fan of Sony's TVs from years past I was only searching the terms "Sony TV".  I didn't even know the Wega was widescreen or HD until I went to the sellers house to see it. He was watching the World Series in HD. He was actually pretty upset that I had money and a truck with me, and he was going to have listen to the rest of the game on the radio.  I think if it weren't for his wife being there I would have left with no TV.I didn't have any HD content to dazzle my wife with at home so I put on a Pixar DVD, Monsters Inc. Even with the signal fed through S-Video, we were both blown away by the improved detail in picture quality. You could actually count Sully's hairs if you were half insane or Rain Man.  But they were all there, all 4,987,653 of them.Since it was HD (1080i), we (my wife) didn't have an excuse to not have a BluRay player anymore, so we (I) decided to get a Sony BluRay to move us into the new era of our life (on the couch).  BluRays look spectacular! We still only get SD from our satellite system, but even that looks fantastic.  This past Christmas (2011) we added an xBox to our family and I'm still blown away by the picture quality.  Baring any more lightning, I expect to have the Wega for many more years.Beast - The Wega weighs slightly less than my house.  I often wonder if the slathering of good reviews of these TVs are written by people (like me) who don't want to come to terms with the fact that someday they will have to move this thing again.  I am holding out hope that when it finally dies, it just turns to dust and we can sweep it up and sprinkle it over the garden and grow some HD vegetables in the next season.
