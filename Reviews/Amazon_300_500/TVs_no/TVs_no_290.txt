Compared to Samsung 1080p with tons of reviews and which I returned simply because of lack of picture formats this TV rocks.In short, Samsung provide you with great and bright LCD panels but with zero technology. so a letterbox directtv movie on a 32 inch Samsung will be actually 22" viewing area on the screen. Try to use the picture formats such as wide and zoom and you get blurry and distorted picture which is to me impossible to view. This is were Sharp step up with it's technology. Picture formats are all viewable so you can super stretch a 4:3 picture without almost any distortion. The only con is lack of brightness (450 nits compare to 500-550 in other popular LCDs) but the blacks are superior. You can increase the brightness by playing with the contrast to full but then it is not like the Samsung whites but less eye soaring. I found that the Samsung brightness is great but after a while watching it sores on your eyes and the Sharp auto dimming feature is great for movies and it is fully controlled by the user.Aside to that, this TV is probably the thinnest and idle for hanging on the wall. The connections on the back are extremely well thought after for wall hanging. It seems that what people complaint about in the previous models in series 62U is now fully addressed in the 64U.I am perfectionist and recommend this TV. Most of my comparisons were for regular directtv broadcast.HDTV and DVDs shows naturally prefect. The colors are well defined as oppose to Samsung and you have tons of options to program it to your taste. Sound from these little speakers is the best comparing to not a few LCDs I had. Very well done!It needed 2-3 days to break-in and some customization. It is professional TV for professional users but very user friendly and within no time anybody can easily program the brightness, contrast, color and other cool features to its liking. This TV is also ready for the future and I find the 46" great size and very well balanced.
