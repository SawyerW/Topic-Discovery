CONSPIRACY!  Are all HDTV's required to have crappy, tinny sound like a full-treble, no-bass radio to get consumers to buy surround sound systems for it?  Probably.I bought this TV in particular because aside from the low price which impressed me very much, it had a deal-breaker for me; speedy remote control.Despite the vast advances in technology these days, TV technology seems to be backtracking, as a 10 year old Philips Magnavox POS TV I've had for ten years has superior quality sound to this TV, and has a faster-responding remote to most TV's these days.I could not handle a TV that takes 3-5 seconds just loading every damn channel, and so I picked this one because the response time is often times only 1 second maximum.  So the biggest value here comes in fast remote respond time.It is indeed HD and it's small with a large screen, so considering the price it is, it's a good value.My only complaints aside from the sound is that it appears to have some difficulty regarding some widescreening and HD compatibility:- There are only two widescreen options: fullscreen and widescreen (or panoramic, which does almost nothing).  As such, it seems completely incapable of adjusting itself for watching a widescreen DVD by zooming the picture in on top of the black bars, and you can either watch the image stretched out needlessly with gigantic black bars on top or bottom, or watch a super small image with FOUR black bars---two on the sides as well.I hope this was just an issue with my DVD player and not something that affects all DVD players with pan n scan abilities.  It didn't have this problem when watching a DVD on my Xbox360.- There's only one row of HD compatible wires.  Anyone who knows how to plug in an HD device into the TV knows that aside from SD's yellow-white-red wire configuration, the HD equivalent has green-red-blue added on to the white and red for audio.  This TV only has one row of them for use, so I can only have one HD device plugged into the TV at one time.  This isn't a big deal.
