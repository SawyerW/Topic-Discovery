I have to tell you that I got this on black Friday deal for ($78) for use as Monitor as I have my 98" for TV and Movies .. well LOVE IT , I use HDMI cable in place of the analog VGA where the quality is much lower , I calibrated the TV and set down also the SCAN and -11 for sharpens and it is excellent , the view angle is better as my 17" laptop screen , the vertical angle not but anyway I sit in the front of it hanging on a 14" arm straight into my face for best visual effect , I spend some time today to figure the best hdmi setting for PC but finally got the max quality from that , I love the no glare mat screen surface what is very good, no issues with LED back light , I was lucky o get good deal and working correctly device . THis TV use ZORAN technology for the HD as I see the name of the TV as ZORAN and not Coby , I tried to watch some high quality HD fragments and everything was crispy and beautiful , the sound is not the theater quality but that is small TV and I did not expected or cared about as much as I have my 5.1 sound system , however the TV receiver the image and sound via hdmi it can be set apart in your PC setting .. for this price it is GREAT !! and I can't biatching about anything else, a lot of reviews bellow are for the small TV that use different technology and resolution that this one , and even for the $149 it is still a good deal , it is also VERY light unexpected great feature , si I give it 5 stars , for the price, for the next day delivery, for the perfect image performance exactly what I was looking for in a Monitor .P.S I also tried the VGA cable with excellent result on full 1080p resolution even better as the HDMI cable ( surprised ) however the manual said it deliver high range via VGA what was hard to believe after I tried out . The response was much faster and clear .March /29/2013 it still working wonderful as in first day , really glad I got it !
