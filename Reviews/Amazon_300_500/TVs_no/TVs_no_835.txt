I actually own the 40 inch version of this TV and it's exactly the same only 6 inches smaller so I think that qualifies me to offset some of the silly 1 star reviews here.Here is my review for the Sony KDL-40BX42.I just replaced a 32 inch Toshiba with this 40 inch Sony KDLBX420 and I am on cloud nine. After a little calibration (the factory settings on TV's are always lousy) it looks amazing. I have it hooked up to my PS3 via HDMI and it's like I'm in a movie theater when watching Blu-Rays. I have my Xbox 360 hooked up to the other HDMI and it is just as awesome. Sound from the speakers is just okay, but lets face it, you want a proper sound system. But this one is average for built in speakers on an LCD. I do not get hung up on the 60hz thing. I have played many hours worth of games and watched many hours worth of movies and have not had an issue with motion blur. Films are shot in such a way that there is some normal blur during panning shots anyway. To me, 120hz makes things look too video like instead of film. During really dark scenes you'll notice a tiny backlight bleed in the four corners if you are in a dark room. This is not a malfunction but an inherent flaw in LCD technology and pretty much all brands suffer from it to some degree, from Panasonic, to Samsung. to Toshiba, to LG. Just do a search online for the "flashlight effect" You'll see it's an issue on many TV's and many brands. And again, it is only really a slight problem during really dark scenes and on an all black screen. One thing you can do to alleviate this is to turn down the backlight. especially in a dark room. Before I got this Sony I bought the Samsung LND550 and was not happy with the picture. It was slightly on the fuzzy side and color accuracy left something to be desired. Not so with the Sony KDLbx420. The picture is incredible. The other day I watched "The Aviator" on blu-ray and there is a scene where there are many colored balloons and party streamers etc. I was simply blown away by the colors. Just eye poppingly good. You cannot go wrong with this TV. Most of the one star reviewers here either got a lemon, or had unrealistic expectations. I for one love mine and I think you will too.My calibration settings for a dim to dark roomPicture mode: StandardBacklight: 2Picture(contrast): 94Brightness: 52Color: 48Tint: 0Sharpness: MinColor Temperature: Warm 1Noise reduction: offCineMotion: AutoAdvancedDynamic Contrast: offBlack Correcter: offGamma: 0Clear White: offLive Color: offWhite balance:L Default settings.This will not work for everyone but it looks great to me.
