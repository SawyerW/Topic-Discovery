I have been researching 3d plasmas for about 3 months. This has to be the best picture quality I have ever seen. I was debating between 3 3d plasmas. Panasonic v25, samsung pn50c7000 or 8000. Even the 7000 got an excellent rating on cnet. what kept it from getting a perfect rating is featured on the 8000. I consider myself a serious videophile and this one does not disapoint. The main diffrence between to 7000 and 8000 is fine tuing of color. and motion judder canceller. This tv has a 2,000,000 to 1 higher contrast ratio. For the price compared to the panasonic it is far better. More apps, and on par picture quality. I have this TV calibrated providing a incredible picture. these settings are below. Do not hesitate to buy this TV. Here is also a review that should help with choices.
