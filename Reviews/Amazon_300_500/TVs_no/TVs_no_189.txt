This is the best HDTV for the price I have ever seen.I get great over the air reception, I have a older DDS system and the 480i picture still looks very good, 480p off our DVD looks very good also.1080p OTA is so 3-D looking at times it's almost weird to watch.The sound is unreal the way it can make sound seem like it is to the sides and behind you.Crisp bright clean colors and pure black backgrounds really impressed all that have seen it.On bright days with the room filled with sun the picture is amazingly still great looking.The no glare screen works very good in a bright sun filled room with no reflections.**1080p Full HD Display**Definition: With Full HD, there's no need to scale down a 1080 signal.
