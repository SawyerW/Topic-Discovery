I did a lot of research on 40 inch LCDs and was down to this one and the Sony Sony Bravia XBR KDL-40XBR4 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV and decided to go with the Samsung because it was cheaper and offered similar features.  I have been very pleased with the TV it has a really nice picture.  The form factor of this TV makes it very easy to mount on the wall.  It has been interesting monitoring the price of this TV, on amazon it fluctuated $300 in 2 months, so my advice is watch the amazon prices they seem to be seasonal.The only complaint I really had was how long it took to get the TV, not the shipping, but the time until the shipping.  It was shipped with the white glove service, they were excelent, showed up when they said they would and unboxed the TV and waited until I checked it out.After getting the TV I started the process of hooking things up, the only real issue I had was my mac-mini, Samsung doesn't seem to like the resolution over a standard VGA cable.  So I went round the local big box stores looking for cables, they wanted $60 for a simple DVI to HGMI cable, what a ripoff, I eventually ordered the cable off Amazon and got it in a couple of days for $15.  Got one for the video Cables To Go - 40320 - 2M (6.5ft) Velocity HDMI to DVI Digital Video Cable (Blue) and one for the audio Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6FT).  This turned my mac-mini into a great media PC on this TV.I haven't had to do any of the tuning of the TV like in other reviews, but I haven't watched any sports on it yet.  Waiting for college football in the fall.
