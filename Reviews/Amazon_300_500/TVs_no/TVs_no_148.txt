I'm not a TV or game nut.  I use Phillips rabbit ears and watch what I need from local stations.  I had to buy a new tv cause the old CRT one quit.  I got the 2641d partly based on an Amazon reviewer's good luck on an air antenna.I wanted a light tv cause I live on the gulf coast(evacuating). That said, I started looking for an LCD, built in dual NTSC/ATSC tuners, PC monitor capable.  The 2641d has them all and is light weight.When I set it up, I just plugged it in and clicked on all the local channels I knew of.  Some were OK and some snowy/bad. This made me buy another bigger(more expensive) antenna--It worked no better than Walmart's Phillips so I returned it.I figured I'd have to live with what I had, but one night I was playing with the auto set up and let it go through the channels and wow!Don't know what I did?, but now I get two or three signals from each channel, analog, HD, 480, weather and such.  ex: ch 5 is CBS analog; move up to 5-1 and same program but HD, 5-2 is weather, and 5-3 is 480/720.On my PBS channel I get 4 different programs. 42,42-1,42-2,42-3. One is HD others are clear as can be too.  Forgive me if most of you already know about this, but I told you I'm not a TV watcher and this feature blew me out.  The 3000:1 contrast ratio is one of highest too.Lesson is: read the manual and let the tv select the programs through the auto mode.  Best thing is that either the digital station is great or it won't pick it up.  I live nearly 40 miles from the broadcast antennas.This TV works great on air antenna signals.  Price was reasonable and picture is amazing.  Can't imagine seeing it on satellite or cable.  Now I'm playing with the favorites, PIP(PC+tv--not multi tv channels), and other stuff. Highly reccomend it.
