I'm a TV nut who decided to purchase all three technologies, LCD, LED (full backlit) and plasma. My Samsung LED 8500 was rated by CNET as having the best picture and blacks equal to or surpassing the Pioneer Kuro. I'm not exaggerating when I say the blacks are the same color of the TV frame. The Samsung full back lit LED has blacks that are simply unparalleled. So why do I rate this Panasonic so highly. Unlike my Samsung LCD and LED the TV does everything well. My setup places people at about 45 degree angle which made blacks appear slightly grayish on the LCD or LED. Also the LED suffers from something I call the Smokey effect, when objects moved too quickly its as if they leave a smoke trail behind them. I have not seen any problem with fast moving objects on the Panasonic plasma's and I have two of them. I have to mention that when I bought this Panny I got one built in April 2011 and it suffered from fluctuating brightness, which was resolved when I got the one built in November 2011. The stainless steel belt around the frame gives the TV an expensive look and matches perfectly with my TV stand. I'm not crazy about the apps so hooking it up to a PS3 was a joy because the TV remote controls the PS3, don't ask me why it just does. The 3D also works great and I was able to get Panny 3 gen glasses cheaply. If the Panny VT wasn't so expensive I would have gone there but Amazon's sub $900 price for a set of this quality made it a no brainer. My only advice is to make sure you check the TV out before the delivery people leave I received two which were damaged.  Enjoy, this is a beautiful TV and has plenty of space for accessories, 4 HDMI, 3 USB, WIFI, PC inputs, digital audio, SD card and a THX color setting.
