I purchased this TV after being robbed. I had a Samsung 46" LCD before, so I figured I'd upgrade to the LED. It was delivered via freight, so you have to take some time for that (kudos to the freight company--I called to let them know I was tight on time and they were there immediately). Overall, I am very pleased with the TV.Pros:*Bright, deep and rich color*Internet apps.  I haven't played with this a whole lot, but through one of the pre-installed was able to get a free movie rental.  1080p streaming over the internet.  Awesome.*Multitudes of configuration options.  You can get lost in all the menu options.  This is great if you're the person that likes to tinker and customize.  I haven't changed the default settings on mine a whole lot, just haven't had the time.*Ease of installation.  I was at home by myself when it was delivered.  Within half an hour I had it setup and workingCons:*Speaker quality.  Don't expect a whole lot from the stock speaker system.  It's only 1.1" thick, so getting a speaker that will sound great in there just won't happen. Get yourself a sound bar or a surround sound system.*Some scenes can get choppy. Because of the 120 Hz or the processing going on, when someone moves their head you sometimes get a few choppy frames.  Maybe this is my TV service, but it sticks out.Other thoughts:*Out of the box settings look like every HD channel is a soap opera.  I know this can be changed through the settings, but after watching it a while, you get used to it and definitely makes for a clearer, sharper, crisper picture.*I could do without the clear bevel. Not sure what purpose it serves.*Not a huge fan of the stand.Overall, I love Samsung TVs and would purchase another one.  Super quality, great price, fantastic options.
