While the number of sources for 1080p/i content are pretty low for my area, this tv looks incredible!  Compared directly with other sets right next to it in the store (bb), this picture just POPPED.  I'm not an A/V expert, but I do know when I've seen a shoddy LCD picture.Was going to go plasma, but the weight, burn-in, etc. and the lack of sets with a PC input, 3 HDMI, USB, made me look for this Samsung unit... And I've had it for a week and couldn't be happier!  Even using cheesy svideo on a non-upconvert dvd player is great, PS2 is great... Haven't tried a BlueRay or HDDVD player yet, but I'm sure it would beat my hd cable.Some who have reviewed this tv also reported problems with HDMI, which I haven't seen yet... But there are apparently firmware and/or hardware replacements available from Samsung themselves; so they are aware of a problem.  (Apparently very rare screen misses show up, or something, I can't really figure out what the problem ACTUALLY is...)  But you might want to check into it if you're overly paranoid.The only thing I'd wish for so far is a toslink optical and coaxial input TO the tv so that the tv can be the main switch for all my other A/V gear here, since it so nicely has a toslink OUT which would by perfect to hook to my sound system.  If this had toslink and coax in, then I could cycle through all my A/V gear by just tapping the "Source" button on the tv's remote.Oh well.  At least my receiver has all the bells and whistles; that would have just been a nice extra. :-)  Maybe someday I'll be all HDMI.Anyway, this set kicks but and livens up the living room in my house.  And my fiance even likes it enough to not get mad at me for dropping the $$$, so that's pretty good, too!
