I have an 20+ year old rooftop antenna which I never used once I got satellite TV.  Using an old coaxial cable (the same ones we use for cable TV), I hooked up this TV to my old rooftop antenna.  This TV has a coaxial cable input for this purpose.After attaching coaxial cable and running a channel search function on TV, I got several crisp, clear, free local HD channels (including all the major networks).  A decoder box was NOT necesssary (I'm assuming TV has a built in HD tuner).  No special "high tech" antenna was necessary.  No special "high tech" cables were necessary. I live approx 40 miles south of Chicago and I am able to get all the major networks (sometimes can't get signal for Channel 2 CBS, which is historically a problem in my area).This TV replaced a 27 inch RCA which I had for several years.  The TV does a nice job with my standard definition satellite signal (my satellite is a digital signal, but NOT a high definition signal).  I attached my satellite decoder box to TV using the s-video input on back of TV.  I also attached my old DVD player using component video inputs on back of TV.  I'm amazed how my standard definition satellite and an old DVD player look so much better on this TV (both in color and clarity).The picture on this TV does get slightly "stretched" when watching satellite TV (picture stretches to fill all 4 corners).  This "stretching" can be altered with different types of settings to fit your taste.  Or, you can undue the "stretching" all together and watch it with a square picture.  Whatever you like....it's not a problem with this TV.Considering the price, the picture is very nice.  I use in "retail mode" like others suggested (less energy efficient).  Also use "vivid" picture mode, which I think gives the nicest picture and best color.Sound quality is good considering small speakers (sound is comparable to my old 27" RCA).  Sound is just fine for a large bedroom.
