I purchase this TV from the Exchange on base at Camp Lejeune. At the time it was one of the newest models and was $1100. I compared it to several other TVs they had on sale and finally took this thing home. It was easy to set up and easy to use. The picture was great and games played nicely on it.The problem came about 6 months later when the NO INPUT burned into the screen. I tried to white it out by hooking the TV up to the PC and leaving a white screen on and a black one for several hours a day. This did reduce the image but never rid the set of it.Now here it is almost 4 years later and the TV is still working. The picture is still great when watching movies and playing games. However, it is starting to 'hold' images. You will see your HUD from games still on the screen when you go back to the menu or you will see NETFLIX still on the screen as your movie starts. This doesn't bother me so much b/c it doesn't last long.The HDMI ports will decide on their own to stop working. I will turn the tv on and then the PS3/360/PC and will hear the sound out of the stereo system but nothing on the screen. It is an easy fix to just hold down the power button on the TV to reset the HDMIs and it is back to normal.When all is said and done I just expect more out of my $1100, for that matter $500. I shouldn't have to reset the TV or deal with a burned image. Next time I am going to go with a name brand and probably the model from the year before so I can read a years worth of reviews.All in all get this TV if you can find it for under $400 otherwise there are too many bargain TVs now to waste your money on this.
