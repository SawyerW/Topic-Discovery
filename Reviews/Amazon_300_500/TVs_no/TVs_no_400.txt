It took less than 12 hours to convince my wife that we needed this new 42" LG 120Hz TV.  I talked & talked about it to her, then brought her in to Best Buy to see it and she said "yea, let's get it".  Right now at BB it comes with an XBOX360 and Geek Squad service (meh) all for 1299! That's an unbelievable price, especially with 3 yr 0% financing.We came home and took our 30" CRT Sony HDTV (720p / 1080i) TV down and put up the new LG.  The image quality is OUT OF THIS WORLD! We watched an episode of the Office on our U-Verse DVR with the TruMotion turned on.  It looked like we were watching 1080p instead of 1080i.  The depth and clarity during movement was so realistic it felt like we were there in Scranton PA.We also tried to watch some select scenes from The Dark Knight and immediately I paused it and turned on the 24p (Cinema mode) and turned OFF the TruMotion per the suggestion of everyone here.  It made a world of difference, the opening scene where the masked robbers are zip lining onto the roof involves a zoom into the Chicago skyline.  With TruMotion on it was jittery and jumpy on the vertical lines.  Once it was off it was 100% perfect. I then hooked up my new XBOX360 directly into the component in on the back and again, flawless picture.The red, metallic border on the sides and top of the TV was a VERY nice touch and my wife loved it. The control buttons on the right side of the TV are touch sensors.  If you put your finger over the volume up area (without pushing) it turns up the volume. That was a feature I wasn't even aware of when we purchased it.Overall, this is an excellent 1080p TV and right now one of the best for the price. I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing it, but you will if you pass it by.
