Well this Plasma has been so far so great!  The picture in 1080i is like cable modem compared to dial up.  You simply don't want to go back to the past.  I've read some reviews stating that soon after the 1yr MFG warranty was up so went their screen.  Well why buy an expensive TV without an extended warranty? Some people say it's a waste of money, not me, and some of the other reviewers probably wish they weren't so stubborn with the money they spent, spend an extra $300 or so and get the warranty. Like having a car without insurance.  This TV was purchased at CC for around $1300 (floor model) but was listed for $1799, they threw in a $300 surge protector and took of another $100.  So for that price the extended warranty was purchased, if it were $3000 then I would be afraid to plug it in without the extended warranty.  Now the sound I have no idea of, a samsung 5 disc DVD 5.1 surround sound was bought with it, just couldn't imagine watching a 50" plasma without surround sound.  As far as burn ins and pixels, I thought I had a burn in.  AMC was burned in the picture when I turned the TV off, but when I turned the TV back on for a few minutes, turned back off, it was gone.  I guess it just had to warm up.  If you want to see and hear something amazing, try Discovery HD!  Oh don't buy an expensive HDMI (Munster) Cable.  Go online and buy one for $10, not $100 at the store!  So for some of you who payed $3000, ouch!  TV, Samsung DVD 5 disc 5.1 (HDMI) Monster Power HTS1600 surge protector, nice matching 3 shelf stand, and two HDMI cables (online purchase) totaled $3200.
