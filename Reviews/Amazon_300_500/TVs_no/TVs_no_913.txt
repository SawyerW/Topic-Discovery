I purchased my Panasonic GT30 55 inch TV from Amazon in late Nov. 2011-(Nov. 2011 build date).  It was delivered as promised and was set up by delivery team from a company called CEVA. They were very professional and were in and out in no time.Unfortunately, the screen flickers and the sound goes off for a second or two.  Sometimes this happens every 20 minutes or so and sometimes a lot more frequently. Its amazing what you miss in dialogue during that short of a period of time.  Well I called Panasonic" Viera customer service dept.and after trying a few adjustments, which did not work, he said there were updates to the programming that MIGHT help.  Since the TV is not connected to a network I had to be hard wired to my wireless router in order to get the updates that Might help.  Well, my TV is no where near my router, so I would have to either move the TV or find a very, very long cable.  I decided against trying either because no one else has reported this problem in a review that I could find, its sounds more like a internal defect to me and since the TV has a Nov. 2011 build date, what kind of update can there be that Might fix my problem in such a short period of time since it has been built.  Also, when did it become the consumers job to fix defective products?TV is being picked up today Dec. 22nd 2011 and a new one delivered by Pilot, which is NOT the same company that delivered it in the first place. I am a little leary of today's events because of previous bad experiences by reviewers with Pilot.  I will update this review once new TV is received and tested.
