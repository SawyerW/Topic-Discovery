We ordered from Amazon, and all went well (they'll even refund the price difference if it drops within 30 days from delivery).  We have it wall-mounted and hooked up to my husband's old Onkyo surround sound system, which sounds great!  We received it in mid-Sept 2006 and a month later started noticing a buzzing that would get louder as the TV warmed up.  It doesn't bother me much but drives my husband nuts.  You can hear it until you turn the sound up to the mid-20s.  I called customer service and the guy was less than helpful.  Said a buzzing was normal and if the noise level of 18-20 covered it, there was no defect.  And any salesperson or web site should notify customers that this TV has a buzz. (yeah, right!)He said he would send out a service guy, but if no "defect" was discovered, we would have to pay the guy's fee.  He couldn't tell us how much it was, just that it was pretty expensive. (This is not my idea of impressive customer service attitude).  We asked to have the service guy call before he came out.  He called 2 days later and said he thought some fan would have to be replaced since he had been doing a lot of those repairs.  After he showed up, he examined the TV and said he could tell there was a factory defect in which the back panels had not been properly welded together and that's what caused the buzz.  So we're getting a new TV under warranty.  I'll let you know if the buzz disappears. Persistence is definitely required in making lots of phone calls to make sure the replacement is approved and delivered.  Some customer service reps were a lot more helpful than others.  Overall, we really love the TV and hope we can get rid of the buzz soon (as opposed to a low hum from the cooling fan, which is a separate thing and not at all a problem).
