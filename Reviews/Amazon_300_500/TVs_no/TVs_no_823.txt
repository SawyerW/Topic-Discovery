UPDATE: I would give the tv a 5 stars, warranty service a zero, drops my rating to a 2, one day old tv, while watching American Idol The TV made a loud pop sound and the screen went purple then said no signalI called Vizio Tech, spoke to a nice woman who had me try several things for her to trouble shoot the problem, she determined a board blew.She said I need a new tv, would be very simply, email them copy of receipt with model & serial and they would send me new tv out within 2 daysI did that ,then had to call them for the next step to get new tv, spoke to another woman who would take care of the new tv, she said I would have to send them my new tv ,they would repair my tv and send  back in a couple weeks, I laughed at her and hung up, I had over 3 hours dealing with Vizio.To make a long story short, Vizio warranty service sucks to deal with ,Amazon is awesome to deal with, I contacted Amazon informed them of the problem, they are sending me a new tv today also sent me a  UPS tag to send old one back to them.
