I waited 2 months before writing a review in case something was wrong with the TV. I bought this TV at $1299 and found it to be a very good deal through Amazon. Shipping was free so I can't complain, I received the TV in 6 days and in great condition. This TV was selling for $1599 at Circuit City and $1699 at Best Buy so I got a really good deal.This is an amazing LCD TV. The picture is crisp, the sound quality is good, (I don't have a home theatre system so that helps) and having 3 hdmi ports is a plus. I have it hooked up to Time Warner HD cable box and the HD channels looks awesome. This TV is 1080P and my cable channels are in 1080i, the picture in 1080i is very sweet. A lot of my friends come over just to watch the football and basketball games. There is a picture setting for sports and the screen looks really bright and again, picture quality is amazing, especially watching football. I do recommend using hdmi cables, because that really brings out the best in picture and sound. I've had this TV for 2 months now, no problems so far. The TV itself is beatiful with a nice glossy finish. The speakers are in a strip form going across the bottom of the screen, and sound quality again is very good. The TV also swivels so you can see it better at an angle. It does take about 8 seconds to start up, its a bit heavy, and I found the remote control to be a bit big, but its a nice universal remote.I play my Nintendo Wii on it, there is a game mode, and I also have it hooked up to a Toshiba HD-A30 (just purchased 2 weeks ago) and the picture in 1080p/24 mode is the best. I watch Transformers at all picture settings in enhanced mode and the result blew me away. You cannot go wrong with this model. Take advantage of the prices at Amazon.com because you'll be paying less than the retailers by the hundreds. Also, no tax in most states, and free shipping, the retailers will still charge you for shipping.
