For the price I paid for this TV, nothing can beat it. This was the best deal I could find for an LED TV back in February 2010. It is lightweight, uses next to nothing for power, and has 4 HDMI ports. Yes it also has an ethernet connection and I did hook it up just to see how it worked. It seems like more of a gimmick than anything really useful for me. Give me Netflix or full web browser then it becomes more useful.I updated the firmware since I've had this TV as well and had no issues with the update. The latest firmware "improves performance on some digital and analog channels as well as improving performance of 1080i/720p signals input via HDMI" according to Sharp's website. I personally haven't noticed a difference so all I can say is it didn't screw anything up.I have used the USB port to look at pictures. It works fine, nothing more to really say about that. Once you hit the power button the power LED light will come on letting you know that you have indeed hit the button. The blue chevron shaped light on the front can be disabled in the menus if you really don't like having it on.The remote has a light button on it but it only illuminates the POWER SAVING, VOL, CH, MUTE, MENU, and FREEZE buttons. One irritating thing about the remote is that some of the buttons are hidden under a cover that flips over at the bottom of the remote.**Update 18 Feb 2011**I've had this TV for about a year now and I have had no issues with it. Since setting it up, I haven't used the Ethernet port since playing around with the feature. It is now set up in my new house and mounted on an entertainment center instead of using the stand. It's more than light enough to easily swing it back and forth depending on where I am in the room. Obviously technology has advanced and there are much slimmer LED backlit TV's out there but if you can find this one cheap, I see no reason not to buy it.
