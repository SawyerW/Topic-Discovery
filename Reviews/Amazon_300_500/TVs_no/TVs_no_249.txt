I bought this TV a year ago (November 2007).  I have yet to be over at somebody's house and think, "wow, that TV looks better than mine."  And that's saying a lot, because I'm the guy that friends, neighbors and relatives ask for home theatre advice.I bought Sharp on the advice of a master repairman who told me that Sharp has never delved into plasma TVs.  All their research & development $$$ has been devoted to LCD.  And he, a guy who repairs all manner of TV, projector & audio equipment, said Sharp is very easy to deal with regarding warranty issues and parts availablity.The colors are sharp, the motion does not blur, and I haven't seen any banding.  I have an upscaling DVD and it looks excellent, especially with a well-shot movie like "Children of Men".  Still waiting for the perfect Blu-ray player to come out, but I have borrowed one and it looked noticeably better.Only two small cons (not big enough to reduce this to a 4* review):1) The DVI-I input only accepts up to a 1600x1200 analog resolution.  This means if your laptop has a VGA output, like mine, and you set it to 1920x1080, the TV can't display it.  However, using the same input's digital side, with my wife's laptop that has a DVI output, I can send the TV its native resolution with no problem.  And wow, does that look crisp.2)  There is not a direct access button to any input.  To switch inputs you have to scroll through them or select from a list.  This makes it impossible to program a macro thoroughly on my receiver's universal remote.All in all, I'd buy this one again.  As a matter of fact, I am suggesting it to a relative who wants to move up from her rear-projection TV this month.Update 1/19/11:  Still looks as good as the day I got it.  Have had two different Samsung Blu-Ray players hooked up to it, and.... wow.
