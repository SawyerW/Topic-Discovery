After 3 years, this TV is dying. There are pink dots all over the screen and it takes several clicking sounds before it comes on. There are enough complaints on the internet regarding pink dots and clicking sound with Samsung TVs. Apparently this is due to bad quality capacitors used in power supply module. A TV should last more than 10 years without repairs. Period.===============================Owned it for a month now. No problems so far. Got it from Amazon. Delivery was good and on time. Didn't see any scratches on the TV or the box. Looks like they handled it properly.Pros: After one month of use there is not much to complain about. Over-the-air HD is absolutely stunning. Colors are brilliant. I didn't test any other HD source. Digital SD is better than analog SD. SD on this TV is much better than my old tube TV Sony trinitron. DVDs with a regular progressive scan player are stunning too. Color reproduction is very good. I don't think for a 40" LCD an up-converting DVD player is needed. TV looks sleek and very modern. I didn't see any clouding or banding issues even with movies like the illusionist. Black levels are very good. There is no glare/reflection with this model (4065/66 had plenty of glare just like a plasma TV) so it makes it easy to watch even with plenty of ambient light. This is the biggest reason I went with LCD. PC via VGA looks great. Netflix online looked better than digital SD. USB input to play MP3 and watch JPEGS is a bonus. Side input is well recessed so the wires are not visible when using it. Low power consumption. Tons of input options with 3 HDMI input.Cons: Too many options to adjust picture. I have most of them turned off and just play with contrast, brightness, color, sharpness and backlight. Even after a month I keep adjusting the picture for various inputs. Audio from PC could not be played directly on the TV. I think the audio amp in the TV is weak. Had to listen via home theater system. Audio quality as such is average. This TV does not have auto fill mode for different formats. This is painful to keep changing the picture size manually while flipping through channels. Shiny (piano finish) cabinet is very reflective (but looks beautiful) and can be annoying sometimes. This TV is a dust magnet. Screen is fragile as with any LCD without a glass panel.
