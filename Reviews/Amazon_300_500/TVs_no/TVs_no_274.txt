Samson. You do realize that this television has a 1 year limited warranty on defects. Westinghouse will repair it for free provided you registered the tv  when you bought it and you have your reciept.This television is great. I've not been happier with any purchase of a television. The only downside is that standard cable looks grainy but thats to be expected with an HDTV. It has a standard tuner for standard cable/airwave broadcast but the television was designed for HD so its an acceptable trade off. I don't use a cable box in my room where this tv is  and it picks up a ton of channels, standard and digital. HD is absolutely incredible on this set. I am finding details in movies that i've never seen before on a SDTV. I.E. dust flakes, powder dust flying in the air when people put on medical gloves, stuff like that. I have to say that the only real thing I don't like is that the bass and treble controls don't go through when you're using the external audio but it still sounds good.The other day my sound went out on the tv for the external audio. I was a bit concerned but I just unplugged the TV for about a minute and plugged it back in and it works fine. If you're planning on doing a firmware update, make sure that your USB flash drive is compatible with the tv. I tried to do it but the tv didn't even see the drive.All in all i would recommend this tv to anyone who wants a lower priced 32" LCD TV thats packed full of features. This definately won't break the bank for the quality and performance you get. I paid $499 for this TV from Best Buy online and even at its full price now, its worth it.
