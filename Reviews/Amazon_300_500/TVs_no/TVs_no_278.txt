I have had the 232v for 6 months and it's a great television. I paid $550 at CC.  I use it mostly to watch movies and play PS3.  With standard cable it looks pretty crappy, but I have yet to find an HD set that looks as good as an old CRT playing standard 480i TV.  Using the PS3 on it the detail is perfect.  I play Call of Duty 4, NCAA 08 and some others and they all look awesome.Blu Ray and standard widescreen movies using the PS3 are better than movie theater quality.  If you use a standard 480i or maybe even 480p DVD player I don't think it will look as good, but it will be better than a tube.  I don't care too much for the remote or the menu.  The menu is overdone, like they tried to make it too neat.  It's a scrolling menu type thing and it's annoying, but I'm not playing with the menu too often so it's not a constant bother.  If you get an HD cable box the remote won't matter either, so I don't care about that.  This is my third HD television and I have a Sony 50" LCD projection, a 42" Pioneer Plasma and this set.  The picture quality is great and I like not having to worry about my bulb dying or burn in.  Stupid salesmen will tell you about blurring and how this set is substandard... they're trying to get you to spend money.  Remember, if this is your first HDTV, no matter what you buy, it will 10 times better than anything you have.  When comparing sets on the floor at the store it's a little tricky.  The sets are never configured correctly and they're set at very bright levels.There are a few high end TVs that look better than this TV, but the picture quality is negligible for the money.  I own two other TVs with beautiful brand names on them and this set is just as good with less hassle.-Bob
