I have had this plasma monitor for almost a week and absolutely love it! The picture is really amazing. It looks great with regular cable channels, DVD's as well as the ps2. Everything looks great! I highly suggest this monitor to anyone, especially for the price. I am given this a 4 star because of the mount that came with the tv as a "package" deal at checkout. The mount that amazon suggest in the package deal 22" To 49" Universal Flat Wall Mountwould not work for me. I ended up at walmart a day after getting the monitor, and I was buying another mount. I would suggest the mount at walmart for $88. It is very very sturdy and fit perfectly! Another problem I ran into is that the wall studs were 24inches apart and not 16 like most load bearing walls. That caused the mount that amazon sent to not work as it was 19inches wide and obviously would not work for 24inch studs. I did not return the original mount, instead sold it to a friend who bought a smaller flat panel that would work with this mount. Other then the mount problem, everything else was great. Oh, and I have not tried the speakers on the monitor at all, as I have a surround sound system that I connected instead. Keep in mind this is ONLY A MONITOR and you will need a tuner of some sort. I have a dvd recorder with tuner and several inputs, I simply ran my component plugs to the monitor and that was it.Grab this monitor while you can at this price and you wont be disappointed one bit!I am posting some pictures also. The pictures do not do the screen justice as it was hard to take a picture of the screen without getting a glare or flash, etc.
