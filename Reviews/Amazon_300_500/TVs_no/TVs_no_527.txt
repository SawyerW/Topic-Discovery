We bought this when our old 27" Sony died after 10+ years of service.  THis is our first flatscreen, and I have to say that I'm very pleased, overall.  HD broadcasts through Dishnet look fantastic, as does streaming content from Netflix.  DVDs look great, depending on the quality of the source material, of course.  There are plenty of options for adjusting the picture, but in general the basic default settings are very good, I just change the temperature to "warm", and it suits my tastes perfectly.The only downfall of this tv is the sound.  It's not a huge issue - it sounds fine, and actually is easier to hear than our old Sony (dialog and quiet moments, etc), however I find the tone settings to be a bit lacking.  There's not much bass response, and overall changing the bass & treble settings has an effect, but it's not super-dramatic.  The remote has a button to switch between various sound options quickly, which is nice.  THis tv is also very LOUD - we have the volume anywhere between 1-12, tops, depending on what we're doing (videogames are usually at about 1 or 2) - and I think the volume goes up to 70.So, to really get good/great sound, you need to hook this up to some external source - a stereo, surround sound unit, soundbar, etc, which I plan to do.  So overall I'd give the tv a 4.5, because the sound is an issue, but it's not a deal breaker by any means.  It's "good enough", but it would've been nice if it was better.UPDATE - NOVEMBER 2011:  So we just upgraded our satellite with direct tv (1080i, old setup was max 720p), and got an upscaling dvd player because our old standard dvd player broke.  NOW I can really see what this tv can do, and the picture is truly spectacular.  Any programming in HD looks just jaw-droppingly fantastic.  Another nice thing about his tv is that the matte finish of he screen deals with glare very well. It's rarely an issue.  So, 18 months later, it's still chugging along and I'm happer than ever with this tv.
