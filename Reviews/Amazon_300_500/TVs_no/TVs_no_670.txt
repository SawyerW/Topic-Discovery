I love this TV.Here are a few things I think you should know about purchasing one of these though. I was a little worried about purchasing this TV because of some of the reviews on Amazon, but most of them had to do with how the TV was shipped. You can fix that easy with (sorry Amazon I still love you) BestBuy. They will in fact price match with Amazon. I have taken advantage of this multiple times. Shipping worries solved. By the way. I did in fact purchase mine over Amazon and they delivered it with zero problems.A few of the connectors on the back require a dongle that come in the box. I'm not a fan of dongles and generally speaking I think dongles are a result of lack of engineering, but with a TV this thin I'll let it slide.Buy a wall mount. They ship a shoe string and some screws you can attach it too the wall with but seriously. Protect your investment and mount it up rock solid. Plus mounting the TV and having it free floating makes it look bigger. If you have small children a wall mount is an absolute must. Don't over think it just get one. You love your kid, you'll love this TV, do the right thing.If you don't have a sound system start planning for one. The TV sound is ok, but you can easily find yourself maxing out the volume just to get over a treadmill or something like like that.The "online" services are pretty much a joke. Just hook your computer/laptop up to it, but all they hype with the "online" services is just a gimmick.Make sure you have HD services with your cable TV. The picture without it is noticeable poor.All and all 2 thumbs up. I could probably write more, but nobody is paying me ;-)
