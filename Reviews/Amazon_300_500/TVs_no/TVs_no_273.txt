Review Westinghouse SK-32H240S 32" LCD HDTV HDMI PIPGreat job Westinghouse! Excellent picture for a 720 (1080s are better but much more$$).Has 2 HDM inputs!! DO NOT buy a TV with fewer than two HDMI inputs. Later you will inevitably end up with at least a DVD & Satellite if not other HDMI devices. One great feature is that one of the HDMI inputs has a separate analog audio input. Normally, the HDMI carries its own audio, but if you run a Dolby 5.1 amp with center channel, you can run the center channel directly to the TV as your center channel with the HDMI analog audio input!! The TV has excellent speakers with great Bass & Treble controls and two 10watt amps.All the cords run down the sides of the back of the TV so they do not get smashed against the wall. This means you can purchase a $20 HDMI cable from Belkin @ WalMart instead of an $80 HDMI MonsterCable at BestBuy. Furthermore, the side access makes it easy to access your hookups while the TV is against the wall.The TV does have PIP (Picture in Picture) which is not always present on entry level HD TVs. Unfortunately, it seems that only the VGA (PC input) works as a second source for PIP. By the way, the VGA looks phenomenal with your PC. Run the VGA at 1280x768 or whatever has closest proportions to 16:9. I hookup my notebook computer and let my digital pictures play on the TV on my wall... just gorgeous. Also, work on your PC while using a small PIP window to watch TV (but you will not be able to use the HDMI in PIP so will need to use alternate inputs on the TV to accomplish this).This TV has a Great remote control to boot.In summary: Compared to other TVs in the same price range:1) Better Picture2) More inputs/outputs3) More features4) Better remoteEXCELLENT PURCHASE!!
