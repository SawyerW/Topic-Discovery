I ordered the Samsung PN50C7000 with the free Starter kit and 3D Blu Ray player and I have to say It's perfect for me. It took a while to get the glasses to test the 3D but once they came, we were impressed of how well it played in 3D. You will see many people complaining for stupid things. Many don't like the "3D TVs" simply because they don't have one or can't afford to get one. Do your own research and choose the one you think it's best for you.The TV has a great picture. When you first turn it on you might notice a very low buzzing sound if you put your ear next to it. I haven't noticed the sound since the first day. It does produces some heat but only at the top of the TV, just like anything that consumes electricity. The 3D movie Monsters V Aliens looked very nice and so far my family and friends have been impressed. I mounted my TV on the wall and I have all the wires hidden, the cable box and blu ray are in a closet in the wall behind the TV (using an IR Repeater).The glasses feel fine and comfortable. If you don't like the feel of them, you can easily sell them online and buy the rechargeable ones for a few bucks more. I bought plenty of batteries online (a lot cheaper) so I don't need to worry about running out of batteries.The 3D Blu Ray is one of the best I've seen. It comes with built in Wifi and has the same features that the TV has without the need to connect any Ethernet wires. When you turn the Blu Ray on, it also turns the tv on. The remote is just like the TV remote with a few different buttons.If you have a PS3, you can download free 3D demos and try them out.
