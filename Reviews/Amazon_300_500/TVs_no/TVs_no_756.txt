I love the picture on this TV. I've never seen so many colors reproduced before. Yeah, it's only a 42" screen but for the price, I haven't seen another TV in its class with a brighter, sharper, more colorful picture. We don't have HDTV satellite service so we watch TV in standard def and the picture is so-so. But with high-def dvds this thing shines. I don't own a blue-ray player but I don't see how the picture could be any sharper. We can see the texture on castle walls and trees we never saw before. And the colors just pop out at you from the screen. A great test dvd is Finding Nemo. On this TV, we watch the film and gaze in awe at the colors and the sharpness of the picture.The picture and sound are totally customizable. You can choose from factory presets or make up your own settings. I created my own picture settings for watching movies since I wasn't totally happy with the movie preset.The weak part is the sound. SRS TruSurround HD audio? Not from these thin speakers. I bought a separate surround sound system and combined with this TV, it's like I'm in a movie theatre. There are times I wish I had a 50"-60" screen, but it wouldn't be worth it if the picture wasn't this good.What I also really like about this set is the oval "wings" on each side. The set isn't your plain rectangular design you see everywhere. The unique design of the TV frame sets it apart from the others.There are people who claim that Vizio uses remanufactured parts in their TVs and that's why the prices are so cheap. I don't know about that. What I know is that Vizio sells a lot of TVs because the quality matches the higher priced brands. OK, the black on this TV may not be as black as another brand, but I'll put its color palette up against any brand any day. Not sure how much longer Vizio will be selling this TV model so if you're looking for a bargain on a great-looking TV, buy this one.
