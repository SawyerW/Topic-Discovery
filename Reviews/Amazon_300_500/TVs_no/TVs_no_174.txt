First of all, let me confirm that this is a great TV. There are plenty on the market at low prices but you will get what you pay for. With 4000:1 contrast ratio, the blacks and whites on this Samsung are vibrant as well as all the colors in between. I'm waiting for my Direct TV to be installed with the HD package...then it will really shine. Currently on regular cable and picture is very good but not exceptional. DVD's really look great. Worth the extra cost over those price point LCD TV's...and still saved close to $300 over Circuit City.Now, about Eagle Global Logistics.....I ordered on Dec. 4th...shipped from Reno on the 6th and arrived at local EGL terminal (3 miles from my house) on the 9th. Wasn't delivered until the 14th (tracking info from Amazon had the 15th to the 19th as predicted delivery dates)but that was OK. I was under the impression from other reviews that EGL would unpack, help setup and confirm that TV was OK before leaving. My delivery guys told me that this was NOT in Amazon contract...simply inside delivery, unpack and take box/trash PLUS they are not supposed to be at delivery site more then 5 minutes. I had prepared my entertainment center, viewed manual online (so I was prepared to quickly assemble base) and had set plugged in and on cable in a few minutes...confirming all was OK before signing manifest. Terminal allows customer pick-ups but once manifest is signed, it's your problem if set is defective. Be prepared to move quickly when EGL delivers or they may not stick around long enough to let you check out set. Otherwise I'm quick pleased with 10 days from order date to delivery. The price was great, free shipping, no tax.....can it be any better then that!!
