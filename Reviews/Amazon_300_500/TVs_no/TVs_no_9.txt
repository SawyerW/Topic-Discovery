I just got this tv 15 days ago and was perfect up until today and it decided to make a slight pop noise and the screen turned black and then the power light started flashing red and now it wont turn back on. I unplugged it and all the cables and an hour later tried again and still the same thing, just a blinking red light. So I decide to call Toshiba and they dont even have 24x7 support. It was only 7:30pm and there normal hours are 8am - 7pm. Thats pretty bad when a multi billion dollar company cant even have 24x7 support. I am not the only person I see in these reviews that got the same kind of lemon. If Amazons return policy would except this back I would return it in a second. If it cant even work for a month thats pretty bad.UPDATE!!!!!!IT IS NOW 7 WEEKS LATER AND THE REPAIR SHOP DOING THE WARRANTY SERVICE STILL HAS MY TV. THEY HAVE ORDERED MULTIPLE PARTS AND STILL CAN'T FIX IT. I COMPLAINED TO TOSHIBA MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE LAST 3 WEEKS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE I AM RECIECING AND THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HAVE TALKED TO 3 SUPERVISORS AND THEY ALL SAY I JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO FIX IT AND ALSO THEY WILL NOT OVERNIGHT PARTS TO HELP GET IT FIXED FASTER. THEY SAY THERE SHIPPING/PARTS DEPARTMENT ISNT CAPABLE OF OVERNIGHTING PARTS.TOSHIBA WILL NOT JUST REPLACE THE TV EITHER THEY SAID IT HAS TO BE REPAIRED.THE ONLY COMPENSATION TOSHIBA IS EVEN OFFERING ME IS A 3 MONTH EXTENDED WARRANTY. WHICH THEY SHOULD GIVE ME BY DEFAULT JUST BECAUSE THE REPAIR IS TAKING SO LONG.I WILL NEVER BUY FROM TOSHIBA AGAIN AND I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING OF THIS SIZE AND PRICE OFF THE NET EVER AGAIN.SPEND THE FEW DOLLARS MORE AND BUY IT LOCALLY SO YOU CAN AT LEAST TAKE IT BACK.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT IS NOW OVER 10 WEEKS LATER AND THE REPAIR SHOP STILL HAS NOT FIXED IT AFTER ORDERING OVER 8 DIFFERENT PARTS. TOSHIBA STILL REFUSES TO SEND ME A NEW REPLACEMENT. NOW AMAZON IS SAYING THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME EITHER. DONT BUY NOTHING FROM TOSHIBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!########## ANOTHER UPDATE TO THE OTHER UPDATE ############It is now 3 months later. I still do not have my TV back from the repair shop. The Repair shop named J Rudy Associates in Pittsburgh Pa USA is the ones that have my TV and still are unable to fix it. Toshiba is STILL unwilling to do anything besides make me keep waiting for the TV Repair shop. Amazon WONT do nothing unless Toshiba sends them a Fax'd Paper saying they arent going to fix it. So no matter how I look at it I just spent all this money to be RIPPED OFF!@#@$@*^#%&$!@!
