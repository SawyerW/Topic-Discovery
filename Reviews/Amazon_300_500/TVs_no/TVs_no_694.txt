I had VERY high hopes for this TV...i bought it from Amazon and the first TV was shipped with prime (UPS delivered) and the box top was opened when I received the unit. It appeared it had been a return, as the inside styrofoam was somewhat broken up...but this review is about the TV, not the delivery service. Picture Quality was not good, and I realized I had a received non-IPS panel (check the AVS forum on it or google "le5300 panel lottery")...it turns out that LG uses both IPS and non-IPS panels in their models below 42". Now I've seen people on here get the IPS panel in this 37LE5300...but I wasn't so lucky. The large, white sticker on the box read 37LE5300-ASUDxxx...which means the unit was a non-IPS model. Had the sticker read ASUWxxx...it would have been an IPS panel...which is a top of the line screen. I returned the TV (amazon customer service was top-notch) and they overnighted me a replacement unit.Turns out the replacement unit was another AUSDxxx model and we refused the delivery...I don't want a crappy version of an amazing TV, that's not what I paid my money for. I'm very pleased with Amazon's amazing customer service though, but I'm extremely disappointed with LG and the way they conduct business. It's a crapshoot if you order online, I realize that now, but you couldn't beat the price at $699.00 with free two day shipping. Now the TV is at $[...] but it doesn't make sense for me to buy it, knowing I've already lost the panel lottery TWICE. I'm really disappointed with my experience, but I know Amazon is not to blame here, just the TV and their company. I'm happy for those customers who received the IPS panel, because they actually got what they were supposed to be paying for.
