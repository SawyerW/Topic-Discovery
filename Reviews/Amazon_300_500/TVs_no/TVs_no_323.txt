i do very much like this set. i think it has the best picture of any lcd out right now and i do mean compared to the sony xbr4/5, toshiba regza cinema series and the sharp aqueous models. for the money it cannot be touched and in absolute terms only a pioneer kuro is going to give a better image.if you are a moive watcher like i am then beware of using this set with bd and hd dvd players at 1080p/24. the resulting image is pretty, but frame drops and a slow-motion like effect aare very common. you will need to run at 1080i/p/60 to get a smooth image. the reason is that this set is actually 1080p/30 and the translation of the differeing frame rates is poorly implemented. many people do not know about this b/c they are using 60 field based sources and think everything is fine. i have tried the following on 3 different sets and the negative effects mentioned above happen every time. here's how to duplicate this issue:set the TV however you want (amp on or off makes no difference)set the hd dvd player or bd player to 1080p/24use an hdmi cableput in a movie that is 1080p/24 (pretty much all of them)turn on the player and tv and play the movie.you will see stutter, frame drops and slow motion on and off. sometimes it's REALLY, REALLY bad, other times it'll last for 2 seconds.aside from this warning, i do recommend the set because it's got an excellent picture, is well built and should offer years of great use. i suspect samsung will fix the issues i mentioned above if enough people call them.update: i called samsung and a level 3 (the highest level) tech said they know about the issue i described and are wokingon a firmwre fix. when it will arrive he coul not say, but he said it will arrive for sure.a great set and one i recommend.
