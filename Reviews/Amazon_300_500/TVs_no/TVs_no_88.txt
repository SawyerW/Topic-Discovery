This 50" plasma is really great.  I'll bust some myths:  The sales people @ B3$T B^Y said you MUST get HD channels because the regular channels will "burn up" your screen with all the static and bad signal (yea right).  Actually, the regular channels didn't look that bad.  Of course when you get to the real HD channel you won't want to leave them- they look great.  The built in HD receiver also allows me to see a bunch of SD and HD channels I don't actually pay for.I play games ALL the time and I haven't caused any burn-in in the last year.  If you keep it on a news channel, then turn TV off, then turn it on the next day- you WILL see some remnant of the previous day's video for a few seconds- but it quickly goes away.They also said you must buy the expensive component cables and HDMI cable for the DVD upconverter.  These are for true videophiles. It is hard to tell the difference unless you REALLY look. And if you look THAT close you will notice the 1 or 2 dead pixels you get and you'll just get made.My TV has 1 dead pixel and it bummed me out, but you really can't notice it- unless you look for it.Since this thing costs $3000+ definitely get the extended warranty for peace of mind. It sure helped me, after 11 months- my Zenith went "pop" and is now dead.  I assume it is the power source or light box- don't know yet- but they are replacing it.The store no longer carries Zenith, so I assume we will get an LG: 50PC3D (basically the same tv). Other than it breaking, I've been very happy.  I did a lot of research before buying this tv and never heard any problems about this, so it may be isolated.
