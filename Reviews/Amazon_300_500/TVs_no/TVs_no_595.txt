This was the most expensive item I purchased on Amazon and I was afraid of shipping damage.  Well, no worries there as the shippers are just as great as Amazon!  Register the product on Samsung's site and get 3 more months of warranty (as with many of their products).This TV replaces a 5-year old 42" 60hz Sony LCD rear projection that was still running great.  I just wanted something more up to date and 3D capable.  Well...to go from my older 60hz TV to 600hz in this plasma made my eyes pop out of my head when I first turned on a BluRay movie!  The clarity is unbelievable as well as the depth given to the video.  Normal cable (from comcast) is also excellent on the HD channels and very good on the normal SD channels.  The speakers are pretty good considering they are placed on the back of the TV (I guess it bounces the sound off the wall for increased effect).  I do have a Samsung surround sound system for the movies and is recognized by the TV for easy control.One of my hesitations from purchasing this unit (compared to the more expensive LED 8000 series) was that some people have reported in the reviews a buzzing or humming sound from the set. I can tell you I hear none (I even temporarily put the mute on to see if there was a noticeable sound).  The user book describes this sound as normal and does state that if your brightness is set too high the humming sound will get louder.  My brightness is set at 45 and I hear none what so ever.With the bundled 3D player and glasses this makes for one excellent entertainment system (even more so with a surround sound system).Another great feature are the updates.  Keep the TV connected to the internet and it will always be up to date with the latest firmware/software so that it functions at its best.I am very pleased with this TV.
