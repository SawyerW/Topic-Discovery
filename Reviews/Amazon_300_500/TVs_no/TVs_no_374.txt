My experience with this set started of rocky. The first set I received was dead right out of the box (bad power supply). **I did not order my set from Amazon.**After waiting a week, on pins and needles, for my replacement I can say it was well worth it. The picture is flawless. I am using the Dish Network ViP722 connected with HDMI. I have noticed no "sparkles" or artifacts of any kind. My locals received with an over the air anntena are flawless as well. As a note, I an using the ViP722 OTA input, and not the TV's tuner. SD channels look good as well.My SD DVD player displays well on the TV, but I have noticed some distortion on letters and words during opening and ending credits on some movies. I am positive that is due to the limitations of my DVD player, so I have an upconverting DVD player on order. BluRay is out of my current price point. I did connect my PC to the TV using the VGA connection, played a DVD, and sat in awe so I know that new life will be given to my DVD collection. I also played a level of Crysis and that was an awesome experience. I told my wife that I had found my new PC monitor, but she kindly asked me to put the computer back in the other room :(I can not evaluate the TV's speakers because I have an audio receiver running my sound, but I am using the Tosslink audio out connection to my audio receiver and that works flawlessly.The TV's menu is set up nicely, and the aspect and picture options are easily changed with the press of a button on the remote without having to access the menu.I'll end my review by saying this---Awesome TV!
