Great picture, but there's a potential problem depending on your application.This is the 3rd Panasonic Plasma TV I have purchased (first two were great) so I expected a similar user interface. I guess I should have read the fine print. Instead of the infrared controller that works directly with the TV monitor there is a wireless remote control that communicates with a separate tuner. The tuner is the size of a DVD player. The only way to operate and control the TV monitor is with the tuner plugged in. If you try to connect a DVD player or receiver directly to the TV you get an error message, "No Tuner !". The remote only works with the tuner connected. Through trial I found that a Panasonic will work directly with the unit but there is no remote control and no way to adjust the picture.There is a wireless option where the tuner will transmit the signals to a receiver on the TV. Unfornunately like all wireless connections the result is not very hi-fi and the link can pick up interferrence and cause interferrence with other electronics. Plus, it doesn't work through walls.If you have a separate room/closet to house your electronics then obviously the tuner will have to housed there. Now you have the problem (as I encountered) that the wireless remote doesn't work (same problem as with the wireless link).The outrigger speakers have poor sound quality and look funky. 54" Plasma 1080PIf you are able to locate the tuner near the TV, don't mind the extra cables and are not planning to use a high end receiver (separate amp and speakers), then no major problems. Mounting the unit on the wall means cables hanging down the wall.Panasonic have made a major error by not providing a standard interface option.If you are looking for a plasma monitor for your high end home theatre, then this unit is not for you.
