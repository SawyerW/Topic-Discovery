I purchased this LCD TV a couple of months ago on sale and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I downsized from a 27" standard tube TV to the 20" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old "big black box" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20" TV can be had for less than other 15" or even 13" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.
