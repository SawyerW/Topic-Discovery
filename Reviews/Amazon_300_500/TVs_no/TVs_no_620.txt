As just an average tv person, not into gaming, just want to watch it for tv or movies, we have been VERY happy with this SAMSUNG LED Hi Def TV.  Bought this back before Christmas & agonized over all the selections available. Understand this, we were watching on an old Mitsubishi 55" projection tv, circa 1995! Finally decided to join the 21st century - but were overwhelmed with all the makers, models, options, choices.  Went to brick & mortar stores to physically look, and of almost all the makes displayed, Samsung impressed us the most for clarity, definition, movement not being blurred, and the color was the most realistic - blues were blue, reds - red, etc. The whites were almost blindingly white.  Couldn't beat the price online, we saved over $150 over the best sales prices from some of the so called "our price won't be beat" stores, this was after Thanksgiving prices.  And there was no sales tax AND free shipping - Sears wanted to charge us $70 to deliver on top of a higher price overall.  The TV came in just a few days, delivered in pristine shape, by UPS. I was a little concerned about setting it up - we have Direct TV, living out in the country without cable. We didn't have HD set up, so we had to get that done by Direct TV.  This Samsung TV was a breeze to set UP, we had it hooked up in just a few minutes, watching incredible tv then and there.  Couldn't have been easier.  I don't understand folks who claim they have to go online & download things, unless it's for gaming? This is now June, we are STILL very very happy with this tv.  We have ZERO complaints. But, we don't do video games - so I can't speak to that.  If you want the just about the best tv for just that, with the best color & clarity and a great price - I urge you to seriously consider Samsung.
