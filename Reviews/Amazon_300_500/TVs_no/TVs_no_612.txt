Times have changed! My tv was delivered by ups and i was able to carry a tv no problem onto the table. Um... wow! not too long ago there was no way you could. I have a big plasma tv in the bedroom and wanted to change my old old tv in living room. I decided i wanted a smaller tv there so it is not all about a tv. Something i can watch from the kitchen while i cook. Prices where higher then i thought for tv's now a days and i wanted to get a good picture. I learned about all the specs and this one had it all except not the fastest motion rating.120 hz which is fine. I could not tell the difference in the store from 120 to 240 at all!, so i saved money there. Samsung is known to make the best lcd tvs and they just look so beautiful too. Perfect. It was easy to set up but takes two people to assemble. One thing i find is it takes a while to start when you press power. The picture is great and better then my plasma most of the times but i have noticed when you watch scenes where it is shot in low lighting... like a night scene or if it is a really old movie.... the blacks are way too black and you loose all detail. I played around with the settings and nothing helps. I was surprised as all you read about is make sure there is a lot of blacks in the tv you buy.. i think it is over kill and mids need to be in there. I chose the 40 inch as it was the best deal for your money. I could have chosen the 46 but the price sky rocketed for that. Oh and there was a deal on at the time where if you bought the tv you would get a free blue ray dvd and wifi adapter. Awesome as now i can stream netflix and such. Another thing i found was that at first when i saw how small my 40 inch was (i thought it was going to be bigger) i kinda panicked and cursed to myself i should have gotten the 46 inch. But when you turn the tv on, somehow the picture looks a lot bigger! So it was actually perfect. Anyways i think the Samsungs are the best tv's out there and you will not go wrong.
