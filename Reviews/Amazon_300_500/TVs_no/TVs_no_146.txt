We researched and dithered and hemmed and hawed and finally made the commitment and bought the TV and it's wonderful. Since our old TV died because I virtually never turned it off, I have had to force myself to create new viewing habits, such as setting the timer if I'm feeling just the least bit sleepy.  Evidently there is a danger of 'burn in' when you are watching something that is not being broadcast in HD, (which means that the picture doesn't extend to both sides of the screen), so if you are watching a regular show (read not HD) and you fall asleep, you might find yourself waking up hours later with the TV on and those black bars on either side of the screen becoming a more permanent fixture.The TV was virtually plug and play - although you can adjust color, etc, we haven't had to, even on the bright blue menu of Direct TV.  Though it can be hung on the wall, we don't have ours set up that way, but we are still enjoying the convenience of the side video inputs.The only 'negative' part of the entire searching, shopping, enjoying HD experience was the week long variance between when Amazon said we would probably receive delivery and when we actually did receive it.  It took a little over 2 weeks to go from ordering it to getting it and it was ironic that I bought our new HD dvd player on the day that Amazon had initially  said that we would receive the TV and the dvd player still came 2 days before the TV did.The sound that comes from the built in speakers is quite adequate, and we didn't even bother with synchronizing our home theater system with the new satellite box and TV for the first 2 weeks that we had the TV - and it was only because I did miss hearing things from the home theater speakers behind the couch that it even became an issue.All in all, a great buy and probably the most TV you can get for that kind of money.
