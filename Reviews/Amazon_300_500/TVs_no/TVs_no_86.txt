Today I Googled my Zenith Plasma TV, model Z50PX2D for reviews. I was amazed at how many other people had the same experience that I have had with this TV. It was a great TV until about two days after the one year warranty expired. It's funny how Circuit City (were I bought the TV) had kept contacting us about getting an extended warranty. I kept declining, my thinking being, I spent $3,000.00 on a TV, I should be good for 10-20 years. Stupid!!! Two days after the one year warranty, we lost all picture on this TV, nothing but a black screen with audio. This was preceded by red sparkles being visible on black screens and sometimes during actual viewing of a picture. I called LG and at first they said too bad, the warranty was for one year. I was mad! I decided to try again a couple of days later and call them again. This time LG said, no, my warranty was for two years and they would replace this TV with a new one of the same model. This was unusual to me, seeing how they changed answers on their policy, on the second call I made to them. I asked them if our warranty would start over with the new TV and they said "no", we would be under our original one year warranty. I asked them if we could get a full refund and they said "no". I asked if they were aware of an ongoing problem with this model of TV and they said "no". I told them that I have bought TVs at pawn shops that have lasted 10 times as long as this one did.  The person who I was talking to at LG, laughed. He must have thought that this was funny. I for one, do not think this is funny. $3,000.00 is a lot of money too me and I can't believe that there has not been a recall on this model. Will the second TV do the same thing? If so, I have spent this money on a two year TV and LG will have a large problem on their hands - ME!
