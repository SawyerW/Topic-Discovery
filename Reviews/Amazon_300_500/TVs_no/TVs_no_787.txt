This is being used in my sons room where it serves as both a television and a computer monitor.Pros:-Very affordable. (I picked it up for $160.00 including shipping) It was comparable in price to other LED CPU monitors by Veiwsonic, but this is the only one has a HDTV tuner built in.-It has a great picture. HDTV looks great, as does Blue Ray, and it can display up to 1920 x 1080 from my PC. Viewing angle is 170 degrees, as are most LED TVs-Easily wall mountable. This TV is very light and reasonably thin. The product description says that it is 4 inches thick, but that is for the removable base. The TV itself is only about 1.75 inches.-Digital audio output. It has both stereo RCA (read and white), and digital toslink (fiber optic) audio outputs with TruSurround HD. This a great feature if you are planning to use a stereo speaker system or surround sound, instead of the TV speakers. Which leads me to the cons...Cons:- The TV speakers sound awful. If you are looking for a TV that will not be part of a sound system, then this would not be a good choice.- There is an annoying delay when changing channels from HD to regular, but I guess that's typical. It makes "surfing" a chore.Other thoughts:I only removed one star for the poor sound quality because I never use the TV speakers on any of my TVs. To me TV speakers never sound great (though these may be the worst I've ever heard).Considering that this serves as both a high quality LED CPU monitor and a small, thin LED HDTV, I would say this is a great buy. Just be sure to have other options for sound. We are using a Logistics 2.1 speaker system that I picked up for around $25. If you are looking for a LED TV that has high quality speakers you will need to spend a lot more than $160.ps if you use a speaker system that uses the 1/8" stereo plug, (aka headphone jack) you will need an adapter that converts to RCA. There's one for sale on Amazon for around $2
