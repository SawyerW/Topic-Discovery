I bought this TV around Thanksgiving and it looked like a steal for the price. Everything was fine until I started seeing some issues with how NetFlix worked with the HD quality movies. Fearing it to be my Cable connection, I switched to Qwest. No luck. So I started reading reviews and noticed the complain about the clouding issue and it was exactly my problem. So then I started reading more and found that AUS"D" that I had was a VA panel and might be the reason for this. I called LG and they confirmed that I have a VA panel eventhough they claim in their Knowledgebase that anything above 32" uses IPS panel. So sent it back and got the new one exchanged hoping I get lucky this time. Turned out to be a VA panel too. Thought I would keep it , but then I started noticing quite distinctly the black becoming grey when I move from the edge of the sofa to the center. Looking at some reviewers here, I noticed that COSTCO had some IPS panel and went there to check. No luck. All the pieces they had were VA panels too. (from the serial #). But they had 42 inches on IPS panel. So I asked the guy at COSTCO to put the 37" VA and 42" IPS side by side. He did so after I explained my findings so far. I could quite distinctly see the difference. IPS had no shading even at very obtuse angle. That was it. Amazon all along was very good with my exchanges, but this one was going to go back for a refund. COSTCO with its extra year of warranty meant that my 42" was coming in. Bought the 42" and compared the 37" at home  side by side in exactly same settings and sure enough, IPS was the WAY to go. VA was significantly lower quality. The blu ray I had purchased was for Netflix and internet and that had to go back too. The Sony BDP-S370 did not allow playlist view like PS3 did. So it was not the greatest piece either. Bottomline: AMAZON has been great with their CSR and Customer Satisfaction. 5 starts for that. 0 starts to LG.
