I purchased this TV after comparing it to other LCDs in a big box store.  I thought the Sony's had a slightly better picture, but for the money, the Samsung was a better value.  This TV has very impressive specs and has just about every connection you could imagine or need.I have a roof-top antenna that feeds two HDTV's - a two-year old 42" plasma and a 19" LCD.  I also have a 26" LCD on a separate Mini-State antenna.  All three give excellent pictures.  I'm not an expert, but I have a working knowledge of HDTV's.  When I hooked this one up to the antenna and a 1080p upconverting DVD home theater (antenna directly to TV, home theater through HDMI), the picture was terrible.  It didn't matter if it was 480i, 480p, or 720p.  I tried adjusting the picture with preset settings and manually with no improvement.  Words and graphics were fuzzy and motion was blurry.  The only time the picture was acceptable was through the upconverting DVD player.  Even then, it wasn't obvious we were watching anything close to 1080p.I returned the TV to Amazon, which started out as a painless procedure.  I have no complaints against the trucking company, Novacor/CEVA.  They delivered it back to Amazon in 5 days.  It then took Amazon over two weeks to issue a refund.  The story I got was that the delivery truck was involved in an accident and the TV was damaged.  Why should that hold up my credit?  The TV and Amazon get two stars.  Novacor/CEVA gets four - I don't know whose fault the accident was so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.P.S. I went back to the big box store and compared a Panasonic plasma side-by-side to Sony and Samsung LCD's.  There is no comparison, the Panasonic wins hands down.  The LCD's were certainly better than my Samsung, but not as good as the plasma.
