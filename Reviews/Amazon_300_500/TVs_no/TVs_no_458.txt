Ok, I'll make this short and sweet. At least I'll try to.Here: find the positive reviews, and listen to them. Ignore the negative reviews.Still want to hear more? Fine. I warned you.I worked for Sony for a few years, and if it wasn't for their inflated pricing, everything in my house would have a Sony logo on it. Then this TV came along.Here's a not-so-secret suggestion: Purchase a Sony TV around Super Bowl time- you'll combine retailer's Super Bowl sales with the timing of old models clearing out. Seriously, you want to pay $300-600 more to have a 2010 vs a 2009 TV? I want your paycheck.I worried a bit about it only being 60 Hz for as large as it is, thinking the size would magnify any ghosting or lag. Negative- maybe if I was watching a SD signal over rabbit ears. Hooked this beauty up to an HD satellite signal, and have been watching the NBA All-Star stuff, and fast-paced Olympic events with ZERO lag or ghosting. Sweet.A couple people commented on viewing angle? Puhleeze. It's awesome.Ok, news flash: the sound isn't stellar...but it's not really better or worse than other LCD TVs I've owned. And who cares? I have everything hooked up to my receiver. I'm not about to own a 52" TV and not take advantage of the home theater experience.I didn't think I'd like 2 of the HDMI connections on the side, but I'll admit it's a heck of a lot easier connecting everything when it's mounted on the wall. (Hint: use a Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Tilt Wall Mount for 32"-55" Plasma and LCD TVs and Displays, it was a great deal).All in all, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Sony among the least expensive in that size range. Ok, so I got a killer deal, but still! With as nice as this LCD is, it's hard to imagine it being the 'bottom' range of their lineup. It's a Sony TV. Enough said.
