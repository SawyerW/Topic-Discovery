I spent 34 years in the commercial audiovisual field and Sony was always the premier TV set we sold, rented or installed. Whe flat screen TVs came out now during my "golden years" they were way beyond my means. I watched TVs with 60Hz become 120Hz and then 240Hz and plasma and LCD become LED and OLED, and on and on. The technology river never stops flowing. The newest was always beyond my price. Besides my old Sony Trinitron ran 24/7/365 for over 12 years and was still going strong. But new technology always beckons. When I saw this model Sony Bravia on Amazon for less than 600 bucks which was my chosen price ceiling. It was only 60HZ (supposed to be blurry with high speed action) and didn't have 300 inputs or wi-fi built in. It did have enough inputs and I bought a Sony Blu-Ray player for wi-fi so I was all set. It arrived a day early and the truck driver helped me haul it in the house. It didn't weigh too much it was just too large to get my arms around it. I plugged it in and turned it on. It set itself and the only thing I did was turn down the color a little because it was too vivid for me. I love simple. The picture does not blur when watching high speed action. Maybe my old eyes just don't see it. But I am more than happy with yet another Sony TV. It's beautiful! The only thing I wish they had incorporated was a remote-controlled variable line audio output. It has that output but it's fixed and the volume cannot be controlled by the remote control. I actually have to get up and walk across the room to change the volume on my external sound system. My old CRT had that variable feature. But it's a beautiful picture, the sound is more than adequate with the internal speakers. (Another gripe by other reviewers) I find it more than loud enough even for my aging ears. I've never had it above 65%. It was a snap to set up and it looks and sounds beautiful. What else is there? It's a Sony!
