I have had this TV about a month.  First, the negatives....Amazon emailed me the name of the company that would deliver it.  I guess for big ticket items, this is normal.  That company gave me a 7 day window for delivery.  Not much help, since I can't take 7 days off work for it, and who wants it left on their porch?  Repeated attempts to call were put on endless hold.  Emails were not replied to. Now I'm in the delivery window.  Stressed.  Finally got someone (in their collections dept-which seems to have more staff). They gave me the name of another company that they assign to deliver it!! I can call them to get an appointment for delivery.  Great?  No!  Eventually got someone (after 3 days of calling, and now 4 days into delivery window).  Speaks broken English.  They TELL me a date for delivery (outside of the window I was given) and a five hour window.  They said they'd call an hour before delivery (didn't).  Amazon emailed instructions that I should open the order and inspect for damage in the presence of the driver.  But the driver would not wait and just dumped it and dashed off in a hurry.  Bad experience all round.  But the TV is a beauty.  Easy set up.  If you play around with the settings, the image becomes even more superb. Sharp colors jump off the screen. Simple controls.  Does not have as many options for connecting DVD and VCR as some TVs.  When I connect my computer via HDMI, the TV says "mode not supported" and won't work, unlike my other TVs which I can play my computer through.  Wal-marts had the same TV in store but $50 CHEAPER last week, and no delivery stress.  Just pick it up and go...save money and hassle! Will not buy big ticket items through Amazon again. Amazon is great.  But not ancillary companies they use.
