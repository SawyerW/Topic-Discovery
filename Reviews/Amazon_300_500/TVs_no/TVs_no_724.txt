Did not want to spend much.  Did not have much space, as this tv was going in a corner attached to the wall with a cheetah bracket.  Doors on both sides of the tv I had to be careful in choosing size. This is for use while on the treadmill approx 6-7 feet from  the tv in the sun room.  The picture is most excellent and the first channel I tuned on had snowboarding.  So there was action and my LG tv picture was awesome for as I watching the snowboarders, my heart was in my throat...So in my opinion, it is quite fine to watch that kind of action.  The weight is easy to handle when holding in place while attaching the wall bracket and yes best to have help when putting on wall.  I just wish I could crank up the volume to over ride the treadmill, but then I guess that is really not the problem of the tv.  This is my second LG the other being for the bedroom and is a 32 inch.  I am very pleased with my LG Televisions.  If you place this 26 inch tv on a dresser in my opinion it will be very steady on its stand (which is supplied) as long as you do not have it in the reach of little ones.  My bedroom LG sits just fine on the dresser, although for both size tvs you do have the option of attaching it with screws (supplied) through the dresser top for extra support...but that i found very unnecessary.The Cheetah mount for the 26inch tv was very easy to install and this is the one I choose Cheetah Mounts 23"-37" LCD TV Wall Mount Bracket with Full Motion Swing Out Tilt & Swivel Articulating Arm for VESA 200 100 Flat Screen Flat Panel LED Plasma TV and Monitor Displays.  This mount is Very Sturdy and allows the tv to be angled in the corner.  All in all this tv is a most excellent price and if you r using for any room and do not need the bells ans whistles that the bigger tvs have, then I think u will be as pleased as me.
