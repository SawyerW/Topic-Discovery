I've researched and researched to find the best TV for around $1,200, had to be LED and had to be 46" and this was it!  It's last year's model, but after all the reviews I've read, I didn't see anything that justified the much larger price tag to buy a 2011 model.  The product was delivered on-time and in a clean package.  The TV picture (after using CNet setting recommendations to calibrate) is fantastic!  The new firmware must have cut down on 3D crosstalk issues I've read, because I haven't noticed that so far.  The colors POP, the blacks are great for an LED and it's just so dang thin and energy efficient!I do have a 2011 Panasonic Viera TV in the basement and after spending time with this one, I just really enjoy the vibrant picture so much more than the plasma (especially being in a room where more light comes in.  I really like the chrome bezel and it virtually disappears once the lights are out and you're watching a movie.There are some flaws to be noted.  One, the viewing angle (although not unwatchable by any stretch) is not the greatest.  Once you move to the side, the picture gets a bit washed out.  This is a huge advantage with Plasmas (and even other LCD's) out there.  Second, it has some great internet connected features, but unless you have a LAN you'll have to purchase Samsung's Wi-Fi dongle.  Third, the remote sucks.  It looks cool, but you literally have to look down at it every time you want to change the volume/adjust settings/etc.  Finally, no 3D glasses included and the new 2011 Samsung TV's use Bluetooth not IR for connectivity, so it's hard to find good Samsung 3D glasses at reasonable prices because they are no longer using this technology.  However, you can find great and affordable 3rd party glasses that work great (See Xpand X103)At the end of the day, we are very pleased and I recommend this product (for its price) any day....
