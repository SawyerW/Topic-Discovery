It's been about a month now owning this TV and I am generally very happy with my purchase. In almost all aspects its just a wonderful TV and I think it's certainly a no brainer in the current LED market. Here's what I've found out about my new Sharp TV:Pros:It's got the blacks you want. Plain and simple. Definitely impressive stuff compared to my other two LCD's in the house.Nothing dead, nothing stuck, no flashlighting, and no banding. Another reviewer mentioned these problems but from what I have experienced and what I have heard from others this is a near non existent problem.Deep customization for adjusting hue, saturation, tint etc etc allowing for really fine tuning. Personally this has been more of a con but its only because I'm too cheap to pay for calibration.Great, vibrant colors in general with a picture that has "Pop".Cons:The included remote really isn't that great. I don't enjoy the buttons themselves nor the layout. Of the Phillips, Sanyo, and Toshiba's I have used recently I would say this isn't the worst but not as nearly as good as the Toshiba's. Whatever, not much of a con but it's true. You can always use a universal.As good as the colors are...your gonna need some calibrating to get this one right. I am still trying to get what I want out of this guy but I'm positive it'll work out in the long run. Mainly it's an issue with flesh tones.The speakers are honestly pretty poor. Even compared to my Phillips and Sanyo LCD's these speakers just have a bit of a tinny sound. Not a huge deal but this is where I have knock half a star off on my overall review.No matter what, this is a winning product. Highly recommended...especially in the 32" market. GREAT VALUE. ~4.5 STARS / 5
