I bought this tv before x-mas and have had it set up for about a month now.  It was very easy to get started and with little fuss, the picture was awesome, even with only standard def cable. Like other reviewers, I was concerned when I read about the audible buzzing noise.  I thought I would take a chance anyway, because the price was pretty much too hard to beat.  Well, the buzz was there right from the start and still is a constant annoyance.  The TV was on and I was coming upstairs from my basement, I actually thought my fiance was shaving on the floor above the tv; seriously, it is that loud. Even at high volume, it is still very noticable and extremely annoying. Needless to say, we did call Samsung and they will be sending someone out to look at the tv next week.I do know 2 others who have the 42-inch Samsung and there is no buzz at all with their tv's.I should also note that we are using the stand on a tv table, and it is about 1 foot from the wall.  We do not have a surround sound system or any other speaker system hooked up yet so we are only using the built in speakers. (I read somewhere that the buzz could be b/c it is to close to a wall???)Aside from the buzzing, I am extremely satisfied with the TV.  It's sleek and classy, and I can't wait to get it hung above my fireplace. Colors are so vibrant and even skin color on this plasma is pretty close to looking normal. (I did compare this model at several stores before buying, to make sure that people were not going to look alien or badly sunburnt!)  The picture is very nice and it's so big, you can watch TV from my the curb outside of my house!
