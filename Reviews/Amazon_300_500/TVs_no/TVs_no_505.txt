This TV is simply superb. Me n my wife were saving money since last 13 months....we were going to buy a 52" or above TV in the thanksgiving sale...but we saw this TV for 1546$ and it came with a free Sony Blue ray DVD home theater system (BDV-E300) at that time and we bought it.The TV is simply amazing. The crystal clear quality, the amazing Dolby sound. But the best feature is its internet capability......i connected an Ethernet cable to the TV and the TV automatically did the rest. I could just go down to the Network option and access Youtube, Yahoo & lot more applications. The XMB bar makes scrolling between different options very very easy.I did a lot of research on which TV is the best...i compared dynamic ratios, response times, frequencies etc. etc. but the best thing to do is go to best buy or frys....look at each TV that you are considering and buy the one that you feel is the best....all TV have same performance....it just has to please your mind.....Also, make sure you buy the TV only from Amazon. I have never seen such class of customer service like amazon provides. When i bought the system, the price was 1589$ and in 2 days it dropped to 1540$. I simply called Amazon and said the price just dropped and they gave me a refund of 59$ and matched the price. The TV was delivered before time, and the guy who delivered it installed it on my TV stand and turned on the power for me.The blue ray system i got was defective and a blue ray DVD that i rented from block buster got stuck in it.....again...Amazon to the rescue....Amazon arranged for UPS to pick it up from my house....they are going to send me a brand new system again.....they even reimbursed me for the price of a new blue ray DVD which i had to pay Block buster......Seriously...Amazon rules....I am very happy with the TV and amazon...
