I have been a faithful Sony customer for over 30 years and, up until the last few years, was convinced that they produced the finest electronics equipment on the planet. But my opinion has changed drastically in the last few years due to a series of failures of their TV's, and now it will be a long time before I ever buy anything from Sony again. It appears that they had chosen to lower their engineering/manufacturing standards and were trying to make a killing using the momentum from their old reputation. I guess it's caught up with them since their electronics group posted a $1.1 Billion loss in the 4th quarter of 2011. It appears that the only thing keeping them alive is their (American) entertainment group (music, movies, etc.).My troubles with them started back in 2006 when I purchased their 60" SXRD TV. It produced a beautiful picture until the "light engine" in it began to fail and had to be replaced. When we moved, I sold that TV and bought a 55" SXRD that was a better fit for our new home. Again, beautiful picture, but the light engine in this one failed too! I had it replaced and when the replacement failed, I did my due diligence and found there was a class action suit against Sony for these TV's. Based on this suit, Sony replaced it with a 55" LED/LCD model (KDL-55EX710) but had to pay $250 for the "upgrade" (and pay $75.00 to have the old one hauled off). This was in July of 2011, and 2 weeks ago (early March 2012) the upgrade failed. I have been without a TV since and have been told that my warranty does not cover replacement, only repair. The problem is, they have no parts to fix it. Now, maybe the parts problem is a result of the tsunami, which I can understand and I have great empathy for the folks in Japan. But, dammit!, this TV should have lasted more than 8 months! Frustration is setting in, hence my comments. You have been forewarned.
