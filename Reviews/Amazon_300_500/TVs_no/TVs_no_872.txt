I've had this set for almost 3 weeks, and I absolutely love it.  The picture is amazing; I compared it to sets with 1080p, and I like the picture on this one better.  The sound is also fantastic; loud, clear, and with several different settings for TV, movies, etc.  Speaking of settings, the menus are easy to follow and allow you to set the picture just the way you like it.  The remote is easy to use, and the only thing I don't like about it is that it has a slightly curved shape and tends to fall off the coffee table or sofa from time to time.  Otherwise, I'm really happy.  I did research for about a month and had a hard time deciding between this set and a Panasonic, but I'm glad I went with this one because it's fantastic.  One other note---do not buy overpriced cables for this or any other set!  I bought a $4 HDMI cable from Amazon and it works perfectly.  Why pay $20, $30, or even $50 for an overpriced cable that doesn't work any better?UPDATE APRIL 18:  I'm still loving this set, but I like it even more now that I've learned how to tweak the picture controls.  The default settings have the brightness controls set very high; once I turned that down, the picture looks even more amazing.  I also learned that I can set the picture and sound controls for each input device (cable box, dvd player, etc) and those settings will be saved and reappear each time that device is used.  This is really handy if you like to use different settings when watching a movie, for example.  My advice is to spend 10-15 minutes reading your manual carefully to learn what all the picture settings do, then adjust the picture to get it just the way you like it instead of using the default factory settings.  It makes a big difference!
