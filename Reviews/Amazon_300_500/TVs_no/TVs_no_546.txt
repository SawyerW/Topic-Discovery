Viewed dozens of HD sets side by side from numerous stores (even stooped to going into WalMart (Sorry WalMart lovers, but your favorite store is contributing to the decline of American civilization). Panasonic, suprisingly, had the worst picture, especially its plasma models. Low-end Dynex, suprisingly, had a really nice picure, as did Samsung and LG.  BUT...nothing really could match the crispness and true-to-life looking images on the Sony sets.  Remember when the Trinitrons were the absolute Gold standard amongst all televisions?  They just know what they are doing. I came within inches of buying a Samsung 46" for $750.  Thank God I decided to go to Ultimate Electronics (BTW: They have filed for bankruptcy very recently and will be liquidating their store stocks very soon, so you might get a good deal)I got this set for just $800 and they threw in a quality HDMI cable for $10 extra (don't trust the HDMI cables sold on Amazon for $12)It is easy to set-up.  The remote is unbelievably easy to use to adjust settings, etc.  The sound is great, regardless of what anybody says--they must not have found the graphic equalizer--which is in addition to being able to adjust the treble and bass.  The picture is truly magnificent.  I like bright whites, not ones that are grey- looking, like on the plasmas. The colors are bright and accurate.  But, the main thing is that the picture is amazingly crisp,clear and full of detail (for shows broadcast in HD that is). This TV will remind you--rather it will exceed everything you used to love about the Sony Trinitrons.  Anyone can make colors pop, but nobody does this and does it with the clarity and accuracy like Sony does, in my opinion. To my delight, there has been NOTHING that has disappointed me about this TV, and I consider myself a very discriminating buyer (hours upon hours of research) when it comes to electronics.
