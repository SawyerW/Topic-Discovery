I bought this 12/12/07, and I figure if anything would go wrong it would within 6 months.  Well just yesterday... a vertical green line appeared from the top to bottom about 1/3 way into the left side.  You can't tell its there if you are watching a show that has a lot of movement.  But when the action slows down it very obvious and annoying.  Other than that the TV is 5 out of 5 stars.  Its rather unfortunate, since the $1500+ price tag you would think a couple dead pixels no big deal, but a whole line?edited on 4/7/08Just to follow up its been 6 weeks...no TV, no word on when it will be fixed....there is some good news though My local Comcast has been billing me for the HD package I signed up for $75 and Blockbuster online ($29) and I also receive a letter notifying me about a monthly payment for a tv sitting in a repair shop....Wow this is awesome I get to pay over $200 a month for not watching any TV or movies.  WOW Samsung you are the best.EDITED 6-26-08Finally after 3 months I have rec'd a full refund back to my credit card from Amazon.  Since I made the purchase in December and the "Known green line problem occurred" in January they (Amazon) were able to accept a return and picked it up in April 2008.  They understood that SAMSUNG customer service is below acceptable standards.I purchased the SONY XB4 40" from BEST BUY.  I also purchased the 4 year warranty.  Yes it was about $2200...lot of money but the TV is better than the Samsung no distortion, better quality, and a piece of mind that I have a warranty from BEST BUY that says anything goes wrong I get gift card for the purchase price of the TV from BEST BUY, no waiting for pickup, repair or calling customer service...etc.On a side note AMAZON is one of the best online retailers and I will continue without hesitation to buy small and big purchase items...I will however stay away from Samsung manufactured products...or at least anything over $100
