We are extremely happy that we purchased this TV. I can't say enough good things about the KV-36FV300.The picture quality is outstanding. The filtering creates an image that will amaze you. Lines of resolution are almost unnoticeable and dot-crawl is minimal. We hooked up our digital cable with S-Video and the picture is excellent. I even saw a hint of pixelization during movement on one of the digital channels. This is of no concern because we don't have the HD converter box, but that shows how close this set comes to HDTV.Used the component hook-up for our DVD player. WOW!!! You can get buy with S-Video here but you'll not acheive what this TV can do for you. (Pay a little extra for the component cables!) Sony allows you to select either a 16x9 enhanced mode or Auto for widescreen dvd's and I've found the auto mode allows a bigger picture in widescreen with no sacrafice in picture quality. There are multiple sound and video modes fore each input to tailor each program, so you don't have to mess with settings constantly. Once you get the Clear Edge VM (velocity modulation) and the DynaBlack settings set the TV never stops blowing you away.The sound is impressive! It has a 15-watt subwoofer for deep bass when using just the tv speakers, but I prefer my Yamaha theatre system most of the time. The wireless headphones were a nice surprise! The quality is better than expected but the range is limited. These are great for watching those late night games when everyone's asleep. (sports fans, are you awake?)TV broadcasts through cable, particularly live sports, are simply outstanding. DVD signals are even better!!! And you can't find better sound from a TV anywhere else.Unless you want to struggle with an HDTV (at least until analog signals are outlawed),  BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!!(Advice: ...have it delivered, it's worth the money.) Cheers.
