I purchased this TV about two months ago from Amazon and I can comfortably say this TV is incredible especially for the price it is available at!  First off, I'd like to say that this TV has more color calibration options than I ever thought would be available on a TV.  You can adjust RGB, magenta, cyan, and yellow color channel values.  You can also specify color temp and adjust the blue or green channel drive values within each color temp setting!  The on screen menu system is one of the nicest, simplest menu systems for a TV.  Everything is clearly laid out, easily explained, and easily accessible.  Now there are a couple of sticking points with this TV.First, I wish it had PIP.  Second, this TV has a tendency to push medium gray-scale values towards a slight tint of green when it first comes out of the box.  This IS CORRECTABLE.  With all the color calibration options on this TV, it was very easy to correct this, but it is a must.  You need to calibrate the TV when you get it.  The third point is a slightly lesser viewing angle.  True, you can see the TV very clearly from 176 degrees off axis but the blacks tend to become gray much quicker than they do on a set made by Samsung.  (This was the only major difference I noticed in the stores)The overall finish on the TV is exquisite, remote is responsive, there is a power saving option that comes by default (so the TV takes about 5 seconds to start up.  This can be disabled for a faster startup time if you prefer)  Overall, for the price, this is the best value you can get on a 1080p LCD TV.  I have it hooked up to my media center computer through a DVI > HDMI cable and the picture is truly stunning.  If you use MCE2005, you might need a 3rd party software like Powerstrip in order to view stuff at 1920x1080.  Windows Vista just works out of the box.  Hope this helps.
