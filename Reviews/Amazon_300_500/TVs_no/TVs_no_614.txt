I purchased this Samsung after returning a 2010 46" Sony EX500.  Sony was always a standard in quality for me, but something has really gone amis in the past few years.  The television just lacked the deep black levels and crisp whites that make an impressive picture.  That aside, this model Samsung was a downgrade in screen size, but a big increase in quality.The picture is amazing.  Although there are some issues with extremely fast movement, creating "artifacts", the picture quality is superb.  The LED back-lighting is new in my household, so we weren't sure what to expect.  The blacks are inky, and the brights could sear eyeballs if you turn the brightness to maximum.  Compared to the Sony, changing channels is super quick and the remote control feels lighter and has a more intuitive layout.  What's interesting to me is that the picture this Samsung produces is much smoother than what I've witnessed on any other TV.  Whatever the difference their video-processing provides, I like it.  This may sounds strange, but if you stare at this Samsung, versus almost any other maker, you'll be able to recall more of what you saw in the picture.  Maybe the picture is easier on your eyes, but in the end it "just works".Don't expect everything to be perfect though.  In extremely fast scenes, the "artifact" issues are noticeable.  There is also a screen uniformity issue on my unit where the bottom right and left tend to bloom with light when the screen should be deep black and the LED back-light is on.  (Dear Samsung: if you can fix my unit, I'll up my score from FOUR stars to FIVE).Overall, I would recommend this television for consumers looking for a 3-5 year television investment.  3-D televisions are going to be the next big thing, but if you don't want to spend a fortune paying off 3-D TV makers development costs, this is the TV for you.
