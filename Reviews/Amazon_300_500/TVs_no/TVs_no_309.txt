I got mine from a local store on sale for a little under $1600. That was about three weeks ago. And since then my entire family just can't get enough of it.Picture quality is just great - and that's expected. But what amazes me is all the extra functionality with what this TV is packed.1. Video streaming with Netflix. (It also has VUDU, YouTube, Picasa - but I did not try VUDU yet, and YouTube and Picasa work just fine, but I do not need a huge display to view some low resolution videos from YouTube). So Netflix movies available to watch instantly look great. Even those that are not HD quality. I must say that I have FIOS internet connection, so that must be also a component for high quality videos, but as far as this set goes - it does a great job.2. This TV has 2 hi-speed USB2.0 input jacks, and it recognizes not just flash drives, but also USB external hard drives - even with NTFS file format. I tried both - FAT32 and NTFS, and also external drives with additional power source and without it, - this TV recognizes them all. It can play your video files (and other media too) directly from external hard drive! And it supports multiple video formats, including Matroska H.264. It also supports external subtitles for AVI files. I did not test multiple subtitles formats, but SRT works great. It supports standard Latin letters languages and Korean. No other encodings though.I want also to add a few words about design. I use a TV stand that it came with, and it allows TV to be turned both sides about 20 degree - just enough to get to the USB jacks or to additional audio or HDMI jacks that are placed on a left side. The main ones are located on the back panel - which is also pretty easy to reach thanks to that rotating feature of a stand. The rotation is very smooth and requires no force at all.I can't be more pleased with it.
