I did my research and purchased this for $600 back in the summer of 2009. I wanted something that would last the long haul of technology upgrading and serve as a dual-monitor with my computer.I have used this as my PC monitor for over two years now, HD gaming and watching Blu-ray movies and DVD's continually, on top of the standard browsing. It has never given me an issue and has worked flawlessly from day one.Photos look great, sound is decent (most companies will skip on the sound and focus on other areas since they assume many will buy separate systems for their sound but this, compared to other stock TV's has a decent speaker system built in) and the image quality is outstanding.At times, especially on a cloudy day with the windows open the intelligent sensor can be annoying, constantly adjusting with the change in light from cloud cover, but it is easy enough to turn off and worthwhile to leave on during regular use.The ability to control the TV from the side panel has been a huge blessing. having it as a computer monitor I rarely sit at a distance and it is nice to be able to adjust the volume or change the input (also used with our WII) without having to pick up the remote and aim it at a TV a two feet away.The audio options are excellent, 3 HDMI ports are nothing but needed these days.I recently had to buy a Blu-ray player since the windows 7 upgrade to my PC disabled my blu-ray abilities (HP Pavilion dv5-1183cl, forums claim known issues). I went with the new Sony BDP-S580 Blu-Ray Disc Player (Black) and could not be happier with the combination.Excellent TV, small enough to not be the center of attention in a room, but large enough to really see everything in movies/gaming.
