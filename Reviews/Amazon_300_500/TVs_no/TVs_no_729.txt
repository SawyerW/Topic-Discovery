Very nice..I have not noticed any type of buzzing as mentioned in some other reviews.I almost did not purchase this c8000 due to the comments /reviews made regarding a humming/buzzing. My space is close, so it isn't like the tv is too far away to hear it .(not the case at all)There are so many features on this tv.I have yet to use any of them because when you buy this tv ..you get tv only! I knew that but the adapter they offer to sell you is a must to enjoy this tv to it's fullest.Local cable company doesn't support 3d yet.Also, the tv comes with an owners manual and gives info on each of it's details but doesn't suggest the best choices for the best appearance.For example, if it reads the cell light ranges from a to z .I see that but what is the best option from a to z... F? x? a? hmm all the features same way.I hope this makes sence.It gave me options but I am not a computer programmer and I don't know  what's best,so I have just been experimenting here and there.Finally do not buy a 3d blue ray player that is not the same brand as your tv...very bad ideal..I don't care what anybody says,don't do it!Lots of lots of stuff to enjoy.The 3d viewing is nothing but awesome! and the high definition definetly keeps your attention,the array of vivid colors and no issues with light in the room or not,maybe a 1 percent difference??It works for me.Just make sure you check it when they deliver it ,take it out of that big box and all before the delivery guy leaves because I would be shocked to find something wrong with this tv unless something happened during the transport.Buy what is suggested and it all will be a no brainer.Thanks for reading. xoxo
