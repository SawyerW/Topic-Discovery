Fantastic picture and clarity.  Great value but...This HD Plasma represents a great value, but when watching HD TV it will have the signal drop out (goes black, no sound, and then reconnects and shows image info on the upper left of the screen such as 1280x720 @ 60hz).  I use Wideopenwest cable as a cable supplier.  They use Scientific America (now Cisco) 8642 HDC DVR cable boxes.  I am now on my fourth box.  Box one worked with my now dead Sony projection TV.  HD was fine.  I bought the Samsung Plasma because of the value it offered.  HD cable box 1 one drop the signal 4 times a minute.  I called my cable company out and they replaced.  HD cable box 2 worked great for 5 mos until its hard drive crashed. HD Cable Box 3 was installed and all looked good but it started dropping the signal once per hour so I called my cable company and they replaced it with Box #4.  Tech leaves and now Box 4 drops out over 30 times in less than an hour.  I have tried both HDMI and component input.  IT ONLY DROPS OUT IN HD MODE.  It is worse when using HDMI.I called Samsung customer support and they say they know they have a problem but don't yet have firmware upgrade for this model.  I own four Samsung TVs.  Two are LCD, one DLP, and one Plasma (this turkey).If you use a Cisco or Scientific American HD DVR as supplied by your cable comppany for signal input be warned .  You might be relegated to watching  TV on low resolution480i not 720p.  You might as well cancel any HD cable service or put up with the signal dropping out once a minute or more frequently. In the last ten minutes of watching ESPN2 HD the signal dropped out 12 times.
