I bought this TV back in January. After 3 months of use, I can safely say I am big fan. The picture is crystal clear. The color is amazing. The sound is great. The menu is easy to navigate. And it looks great just sitting there.One of the big factors in buying this TV was the lack of glare from the screen. I have a of windows in my living room so I wanted a TV with a screen with as little glare as possible--this one fits the bill but without, in my opinion, sacrificing anything in terms of brightness or color.Having 3 HMDI ports is also a big plus. You'll want one for your cable tuner box, one for your DVD player, and one if you have an audio tuner you want to run the sound through (I don't use one--the sound is fine out of the built-in speakers). To say nothing of an Apple TV box and/or a game system. I don't know why so many other TVs have so few HMDI ports--it seems like 3 should be the bare minimum.HD cable looks great on this as do BlueRay DVDs. PS3 games are spectacular. Standard "low-def" cable looks fine. The picture simply appears smaller with black space framing the smaller picture. Standard DVDs look just fine too -- the image appears full-size without the need for the black frames (though you will need a DVD player which can upsample to 1080p. I use a PS3 which does the trick flawlessly).The only hitch I have had was with the delivery service. When they called to set up a delivery time, they had nothing available for 3 weeks! However, I was able to drive out to their warehouse and pick it up right away. I don't know if this delivery bandwidth problem has been solved yet.
