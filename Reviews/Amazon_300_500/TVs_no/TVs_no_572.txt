I had read all the reviews before I ordered this set, but I still wasn't sure it was my best option when I placed the order.  After the set arrived, all my apprehensions were resolved.  I could not ask for anything more in a picture and while I had read some reviews that said you do not get any realistic 3-D effects with any 3-D TV (i.e. objects do not come out of the screen at you)I want to tell you that objects do come out of the screen at you and make you want to grab them.  I will admit that it is not as good as a movie theater, but I am not complaining.  At this point there is not much in the way of programming for 3-D, but hopefully that will change this Fall. Direct TV has one channel that runs continuous 3-D programming, but it is not live.Also, if you do have Direct TV, make sure that you have one of their later DVR's as all of them do not support 3-D  I have two DVR's and only one of them supports 3-D.I have the battery operated 3-D glasses as they were part of the Samsung promotion as well as the Blue Ray player.  The battery is suppose to be good for 50 hours of use and turn off automatically when you are done viewing 3-D images.  There is a button on the glasses to turn them on and the TV will flash a reminder to turn them on for 3-D viewing.  There was no alignment as I had read in some reviews as I just turned them on. I did experience a little eye fatigue after about an hour of 3-D programming, but it was nothing major.  The 3-D glasses slip easily over regular eye glasses and for those of us who wear glasses, it is no problem at all.The components hooked up easily but make sure you have the latest HDMI cables as I had an older one and it did not support the 3-D images from the blue ray player.Like most flat screens, the sound is only passable and I added surround sound which is the only way to watch 3-D programming anyway, not to mention movies, etc.
