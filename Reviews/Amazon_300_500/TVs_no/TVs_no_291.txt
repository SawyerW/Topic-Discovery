Purchased this tv @ 6th Ave last night. Origonally targeted the samsung 4665 but a friend alerted me to the Sharp price reduction. Talked to a bunch of verizon service techs and the general concensus was Sharp, Sony or Panasonic are worth the money. The others are iffy, and by reading all the reviews on the latest LCD's, they're right. Stayed up til 2am hooking it up, big difference from the old Pioneer rear proj I had. MAKE SURE your cable box is sending the 1080i signal out to tv or you will not get the picture you are looking for. Check the cable box manual for instructions, OR try this. (after you have hooked up your tv to cable box) Still in 480 mode? leave tv on, turn off cable box, push and hold menu button on cable box and the menu to change the res. should pop up. Do yourself a favor, go to Costco and get the fiber optic cables package for $75. Much cheaper than getting overpriced ones along with tv purchase. DEFINITELY purchase the longest extended warrantee with this, not a big fan of ext. warr's but its a major purchase. Remote control takes time to get used to. PICTURE IS AWESOME!!! Purchase was worth it in the long run. Wanted to get last years model for $1388 but for $300 more I got a better tv all around. You can prob find it a bit cheaper but I had the money now and got the "itch" so.... Thinner, smaller bezel, lighter, blacks are black, no trailing or shadowing on fast action, side inputs for gaming, 1 more HDMI input (3) and a PC input, 4 ms response are the upgrades from last years model. I cant walk away from it. Worst part is, Im leaving for Fla. for Christmas tomorrow and my house sitter is going to have all the fun with my new tv. Its only been a day so take my review for what its worth. If probs occur, I will re-post. Merry Christmas....
