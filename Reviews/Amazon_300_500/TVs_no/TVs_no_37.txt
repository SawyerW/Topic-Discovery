received my Olevia LT27HV 27" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV this afternoon.INPUT SIGNALS1) YbPbPr input (tested on onkyo 6 dvd changer) - 5 star !2) Svideo input (tested on sharp camcorder ) - 5 star !3) composite video input (tested on samsung vcr) - 5 star !4a) tuner port RF input (cartoons) - 5 star !4b) tuner port RF input (non-cartoons) - 4.5 star - a little  grainy on dark scene.5) analog VGA ( connected to desktop PC ) - 5 star for 1280x720x32. In this resolution, the text and graphics are super super fine ! well.. should i say.. PERFECT !!! yes.. they didn't lie.. the scan rate even came out 14.6 ms as tested thru powerstrip module !! thats an added bonus for FPS gamer like me !6) DVI ( haven't tried yet, i need to buy DVI cable first. I will keep you guys posted. I'm very happy with what I see on analog VGA, how happier can I get with DVI connection !!).SCREEN DISPLAY: due to the superb brillance / brightness / contrast / gamma / sharpness, etc, I would rate this 10 out of 10 ! I'm an PC GAMER and have played UT2004, FAR CRY, BF1942, SOF2, RTCW, BLACK HAWK DOWN TEAM SABRE , JOINT OPERATION, DEVASTATION, MEN OF VALOR, PAIN KILLER, RICHARD BURNS RALLY, NEED FOR SPEED HOT PERSUIT 2, MEDAL OF HONOR, DOOM 3, ETC. Absolutly no regret.. worth every penny !Before I bought this, I have been running all my games at 1600x1200 and 1280x1024. I had to lower all my game's resolution to about 1280x720 or lower before plugging in to this LCD otherwise I'll get the blue screen. Lowering the resolution to 1280x720 is no big deal, because I get to maximize all my video details settings to "very high" and those buffering to 'tripple'.
