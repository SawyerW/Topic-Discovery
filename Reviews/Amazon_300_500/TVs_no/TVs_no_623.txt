This is my second Samsung LED LCD TV.  I originally had purchased a UN40C6400 series from Sams Club.  That purchase was easy as they had aligned all of the 120hz+ TV's along one rack attached to individual Blu-ray's.  The Samsung's crisp clarity, smooth motion, and black blacks, made buying any other brand a non-option.  That TV found its way to my patents where they still marvel and exclaim positive remarks over its picture.This model the Samsung UN40C7000 is better in all areas when compared to the 6 series.  The 240hz, ensures crisp smooth motion, the contrast provides even deeper blacks.  This TV is a dream.  One feature which I find outstanding in the newer models is the reduction in MPEG conpression artifacts.  The removal of these makes the picture on the LCD-LED TV's much clearer than my Pioneer KURO plasma TV.  Even Low Def TV looks clear and crisp, with minimal up-scaling artifacts.Since the unit didn't come with 3D glasses, did try the 3d effect until a set arrived.  3D off of Directv via the Samsung looks pretty good, I'll use it every now and then, but not as my preferred viewing choice.  In simulated 3D mode, it worked OK.  Not a feature I'll be using much, not because of lack of quality, but no need to watch the news in 3D.About the only negative aspects would be the slimline connectors that replace the Ethernet port, and RCA ports.  The thin nature of this TV makes it difficult to find space for the full sized connectors.An annoyance found in both Samsung's was the inability to wake the TV to any source outside of the coax or usb slot.  Personally I like setting the TV up as an Alarm clock, but for those that use cable or satellite boxes,using those devices as the input are not an option in Alarm mode.Great series of TV's
