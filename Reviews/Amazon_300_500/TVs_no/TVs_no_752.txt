I bought this tv (in white) in late Oct 2010 to replace my 11 year old 32" Panasonic. I want a 40" or 42" but don't want to spend that much yet, but the old tv was driving me crazy, the remote sensor had gone out and the color wasn't working either. So I got this to tide me over. I ordered it in the white from Amazon, because the shipping was cheaper than on Target. The price was $299 for the white one online, then 2 or 3 weeks later, went down to $199 at Target, and they actually had the white ones in the store (which they didn't before)! Rats. Anyway, I thought it was fine at first, I'm not a tv aficionado or anything. The sound, to me, is okay. However it did run through my channels and give me about 20 channels which I don't have. That wastes a lot of time on the remote. Not crazy about the remote either, and when I tried to program my universal remote with the Vizio code, it still wouldn't work. So...other than that, there are two more things (so far) - sometimes the color goes really bright and the picture blurs, then it comes back into focus and normal color. It doesn't seem as though it's going from a dark to a light picture either. Pretty much the same, and it'll just happen. Also, several times when I have been changing the channel with the arrow button, the tv has shut off. It also did this once when I was manually entering the channel #. Doesn't bode well. They don't make 'em like they used to. Do you think I will get 11 years use out of this one?Update: I found the code that works for this tv: 0030. However, my OFA remote doesn't have an HDMI 2 so I need to find a new remote.Update 2: The tv will now sometimes turn off when I am using the up/down arrows on the volume.
