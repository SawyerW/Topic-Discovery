I purchased this Samsung 46" LED/LCD HDTV over the Black Friday 2010 weekend for $899 from Amzaon.  It's a fantastic deal at that time. Great looking TV with super sexy slim design.  Lightweight and easy to setup.  Amazing HD quality and higher than usual workmanship than the others.  There are plenty of HD hookups with optical out and even an ethernet feature which is extremely useful.  I find is suprising that a S-Video input is not available while the composite is still there.  But I don't miss it anyway.  Using the ethernet, I can connect and stream my media using DLNA from my PC and mobile phones without the need of another 3rd party device(Google or Apple TV).While there are other higher end Samsung models with more features, I find this one having the best balance of features for the price.  Wish it was 240Hz with Internet@connect Apps for YouTube and Netflix, 3-D ability, even slimmer, local dimming, and etc, but those cost much more and sometimes well more than double the $899 I paid.  Couldn't ask for more for the price and quality.  There's even an iPhone App too, but will require you to purchase the Samsun Wi-Fi dongle unless they update the firmware to work over eternet(Which I think they should).I also praise Amazon's amazing and outstanding customer service for my purchase and handling of any issues with the TV.  I purchased all my accessories for my HDTV from Amazon too, because all the other places will over charge you for HDMI and TOSLINK cables.  I've basically dropped all my local retails(Best Buy, Fry's , and etc) and taken my business with Amazon going forward.  Will defintely consider my #1 source for all my future purchases.  They often have the best deal and will not rip you off like the others with taxes, shipping, and poor customer support.
