Pros: The Tv was delivered ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  Great picture standing right in front of it, but not as crisp as 1080. Similar set-up to our 52 inch 650 LCD Black Samsung TV (also bought from Amazon), so was easy to navigate.. Sets up digital for air very well. We do not have cable. We live in the city. We use an inexpensive HD antenna from WalMart that works very well and can be adjusted when needed. Cosmetically it is a beautiful little tv and the white is much easier to keep clean than our black touch of red-does not seem to be as much of a dust magnet as the black.  It is white for our bedroom, and there was not much to choose from in the white category.Cons:  The picture becomes dark or discolored when viewing from the sides or below straight on viewing. The sound is low at times and varies on different channels. The font when setting or trying to  change set-up on the tv is very small so can only be seen very close up. The sound cuts out and the picture goes out briefly if a person comes too close to the tv accompanied by an annoying noise (adjusting the antenna has helped, but not always). Maybe a better antenna would do the trick in this area.It is OK for our TV viewing in the bedroom, but we are looking for a different TV for the kitchen in the same size.  We wanted Samsung since our 5 star 52 inch Samsung is absolutely wonderful. We originally were going to buy two of these (22 inch white) and I still might since the ratings and price for the 650 22 inch Samsung in black is about the same as this one. 22 inch Tvs just are not as great as the 32 inch and above Tvs are.  All in all a good enough tv which we will not send back, but disappointed nonetheless. Others that we looked at Best Buy in the 22 inch size were very similar and not as good. However,the Samsung 650 LCD in the 22 inch size has 3 HDMI inputs at Best Buy whereas the one offered at Amazon has only 1. Amazon's much cheaper, though and that is probably why.
