I've had a Samsung DLP since 2007 and loved it when it first came out.  For years I've been seeing newer and better things come along.  I saw this TV at my local Best Buy displayed next to a Samsung LED.  In the store the Samsung LED looked incredibly bright, shiny, and sharp, while the Panasonic looked a little dim by comparison.  Ladies and gentleman - don't let that fool you.  This plasma tv is bright, vivid, and downright gorgeous even moreso when you calibrate it.  I have not seen a TV that looked this gorgeous in a long time and don't even slightly regret this purchase.The TV looks incredibly clear and the Proper handling of 24p makes the image really pop and stand out.  After rewatching some blu-rays that I thought looked good on my old TV on this one, I decided to never watch another blu-ray on my old TV again as the difference was that much!The 3D looks fantastic.  I bought some SainSonic 3D glasses on Amazon because they were available (as opposed to the Panasonic ones) and cheaper ($58~ a pair).  I watched Kung-Fu Panda 2 in 3D (Best Buy exclusive) and Cars 2 in 3D.  It was better than the theaters.  I was worried about the distance because my tv is about 13' away from my couch but even at that distance the images lept off the screen and you could definitely experience the depth in the picture originally intended.  I did not experience any ghosting or cross talk in either movie and had it set to "Vivid" to increase the brightness of the picture and everything looked great.Delivery was amazing they unpackaged it and even set up the stand and helped me set it on my entertainment center I was blown away.  Awesome shipper.To sum all of this up - don't settle for less.  This is the perfect TV at an incredibly enticing price and you will not regret making this purchase in the slightest. And it's much cheaper on Amazon than other retailers so definitely start with them ;)
