*Updated, since we've gone another year of heavy usage with this TV, and it's still as good as the day we bought it. We leave it on in the evenings, whether or not we're watching it (I like the background noise, and news), so we're probably going on 5,000 hours.For those of you who have had the "popping" problem, it would help the rest of us owners (whose TVs are still fine after well over 2 years) to know:(a) What was the manufacture date of your TV?(b) When did you buy the TV?(c) What time of year (month/season) did it "pop"?(d) What is your setup? Wall-mount? Stand?(e) Is the area behind the TV well ventilated?*The previous few questions are only because plasma TVs use a lot of power, and of course will run hot (just feel the back after a couple hours). One of the number 1 rules to owning a plasma is to use it in a VERY well ventilated area.(f) What were your TV settings most of the time? Brightness/Contrast? Low/Regular power? Did you lower the settings for the first 200 hours as recommended for all plasmas?(g) How many hours a day did you typically run the TV?I only suggest that people update their reviews with more info, because it might make a difference as to how the owners of working sets continue with their current setup.  If it turns out many of the "poppers" were hung on the wall in a room with no venilation behind it, or right up against a wall, or anywhere near a heater/vent, or left on for several hours at a time - that's going to make a huge difference, and it might help others preserve their TVs, saving from the same outcome. The average owner might not be aware of the proper care and setup of their plasma, which could lead to some (of course not all) of the unhappy buyers of this TV.Just a thought.Even if it dies, we had some good times.
