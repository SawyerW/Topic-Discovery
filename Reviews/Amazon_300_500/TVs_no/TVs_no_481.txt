Before I purchased this TV I researched and researched.  And kept coming to the same conclusion.  You are not going to buy an LED at this price anywhere.  The price was a huge selling point, then came the picture.  I read and read about the lighting problem and yes, I did see it once.  And yes, if you look really close you can see faint brightness in the corners when it comes to an all black background.  Then I did the update for the LED and it seems to have helped.  I've watched several dark looking movies and haven't seen it.  After all of that I came to the conclusion that the picture on this is just awesome.  I'm a big sports nut and watching any sport on this is just the best.  Colors are spot on and the 240hz really struts it's stuff during games.  And as for the 240hz motion, like a lot of people have stated before.  I turn it off when I am watching a blue ray movie.  It actually ends up being to clear if that's possible.  And that's a real good problem to have.  So picture wise, you can't go wrong.Sound, ugh!  I'm not an expert when it comes to all the techs of sound.  But the sound on it is real bad.  It's not something that stopped me from purchasing it, and after awhile most people won't think much about it.  But when you hook it up to a sound system you will really notice the difference.  And again, the sound part for me was not a big deal.Overall, great TV.  The best price you'll find.  The delivery people were fast and great to work with.  So if your looking to update tv's, this is the one you should go for.  And once you hook up your HD cable, you'll know why.
