The first 5 weeks with this TV were fantastic, very similar experience to all of the positive reviews - we were more than happy with our purchase.  That ended after 5 weeks, we had turned the TV on, went into the kitchen to make lunch, came back to a black screen.  When we looked closely, we saw a spider like crack underneath the glass and the TV would not turn back on.  The TV had been sitting on its TV stand since amazon had delivered it without being touched or moved.  We are currently working with the Samsung warranty to get this problem fixed but I just heard back that they say it is "physical damage" and not covered under warranty.  After some research, I found a forum on c-net dedicated to this issue - hundreds of angry consumers with the same exact experience we had - all flat panel samsung tvs that mysteriously cracked under the glass without anyone touching the unit.  In most cases it took them weeks/months of complaining and filing to get resolution from Samsung - usually with first a rejection under warranty.  It is just not worth the trouble.  I am hoping Samsung comes through to fix the issue, but it is not looking good. At this point, I'd recommend avoiding Samsung all together (believe me, I did not think that a couple of months ago - I thought they were top of the line which is why we were willing to spend so much on the tv) - the complaints I found were on Samsung brand tv's specifically.  They obviously have a defect issue with the number of complaints I have seen.  This is my first ever negative review and I have avoided posting anything until I gave Samsung a chance to fix the issue and after hearing that we incurred the "physical damage" and that is not covered, I have to say something and post this review - it is just not right what they are doing.  I plan on filing with the BBB and joining all the consumers on the forum who have already filed with the NJ Attorney General's office.
