I am an avid movie watcher and extremely picky when it comes to my monitor.  This monitor is hands down the best value right now in the 40" sets and is as good, if not better than, the slightly more expensive Sony XBR4 series (actually the LCD panel proper is the same as the Sony XBR4 as Samsung manufactures Sony's panel for the XBR4 sets).  Once properly adjusted--although it is alright out of the box if you like poppy look--and viewing from a high definition source (I use a PS3), the picture quality is totally unbelievable!  The black levels are perhaps the best out there--comparable to the Kuros--especially if one uses the energy savings mode on auto and properly adjusts the set.  Now I find myself wishing the movie theaters were even a fraction as clear as a Bluray playing on this monitor!  Given 20/20 vision, I recommend a viewing distance of 5' for best resolution of the finer details and no more than 7' in any case, although preferences about this will definitely vary.  The Auto Motion Plus, a highly touted feature which creates more screen frames than is in the source in order to clear moving objects, is interesting but not for everyone; it DOES sharpen moving objects using some fantastic technology but the effect is unsettling for some and very strange if on high.  I cannot comment on the speakers since I have not used them, but they are stylishly implemented in the frame, which itself is beautiful.  The only complaint I have is the high-gloss finish, while beautiful, scratches and shows dust very easily and must always be cleaned using only a jewelry cloth (which is provided with the set).This set is just a wonderful piece of technology from Samsung, and this is not coming from a big fan of Samsung even!
