My wife helped my in the house and remarked "what skippy brand thing in the hell is this?" and I laughed my head off!  I have been doing 3 seporate tech project systems in the house and bringing in names like "Loewe", "HSU", and now "Olevia"!I did a lot of research in this this thing and recalled an article saying LCD prices would be falling big this year and thought i would save this purchse for last given it would cost less.  Last week CompUsa ran a deal for $699 and I jsut ran over and purchased it.  I am a big fan of Amazon, but this deal was too good, and financed for 21 month no interest!  For little over $33 per month for the next 21 months, how can I go wrong!  Even if the tv stinks, this is one hell of a computer monitor for the money!I think most of the reviews said most of what needs to be said.  The high def picture is just stunning!  Its hard to compare to the sony as the store images are so bad given the split signals, but the blacks were blacker on the sony.  At $699 I could have bought 3 of these vs. just one 23inch sony!  The DVI input off my Bravo D1 was just incredible.Synatax just released a new 26' lcd for list of $899 with some improvements.  The specs on the Syntax line are incredible for the money, and the 27 set I have has impressed me with its build quality.  I have the new remote, and while its not the best, I really don't mind it at all.  I will be using the cable box one until I get a universal one figured out.In conclusion, if this thing proves durable I will be very happy.  The Warranty does not include the lcd itself so read up on it and consider a suppliment.  At $149 I did spring for the compusa one, although I hate them!  It is very liberal.  I took the 2 year.Pro: Picture quality, state of the art imputs, good looks and VALUE!Con: Skippy brand you'll have to explain to all whom ask!
