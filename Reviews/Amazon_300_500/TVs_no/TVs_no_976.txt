I did what everyone reading this is doing; pour over hundreds of reviews, forums, and expert opinions. My concerns were 1) the great room this TV was going into is super bright, 8 big windows; and 2) the room is huge and the 42" TV I had mounted on the wall just looked tiny.I settled on this one because the 55" was a better price point than the comparable 60". I did look at a few 60" LED TVs.  Because I like to watch a lot of sports and action movies, LCD/LED TVs were just non-starters.  Even some of the new claimed 240hz or others just can't get rid of the motion blur.When I got this TV delivered and set up I was impressed. After some recommended break-in and playing around with the settings, I find the picture quality amazing.  I did break down and buy some of the off-brand 3D glasses and the 3D performance is very cool (though not the main selling point for me).  DirecTV's 3D channels help but there isn't too much in the way of genuine 3D content.As for my #1 concern, glare, I don't think it's an issue. With any plasma, there is certainly more glare than an LCD screen.  There are about 2 hours in a given day when I have to get up and close some of the blinds to prevent the glare from being an issue. However, these are the hours when the full sun pours through all of the windows during the day when I'm not usually home.  My wife swears she doesn't notice the glare and thinks I'm crazy to even talk about it.Viera Cast is cool, though I wish they'd have a web-browser. I can't comment on the sound quality because I run everything throw a Pioneer Receiver and sound system. The TV does have an HDMI ARC(Audio Return Channel) which is vital for people running such a setup.  Make sure your home theater receiver supports ARC or you won't be able to hear sound from Viera Cast through your speakers.In short, buy this TV.
