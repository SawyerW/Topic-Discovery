The User Reviews at Amazon.com were a primary reason that I selected the Sharp. The Amazon.com "white glove" shipping policy and product price were also important. Free shipping sealed the deal.The set lived up to the positive user reviews. Some are satisfied with bright, saturated color. I am quite concerned with detail, clarity, brightness, and viewing angle as well. I feel that if you can define the lapels or collar on a black jacket and the whites and blacks are true, and color is acceptable your picture and adjustments are acceptable. I actually had to crank down the brightness a bit, but the other factory settings worked for me. I prefered to turn off the automatic color feature which could be quite useful. I was impressed that apparently this Sharp technology was awared an Emmy.I felt the audio was better than other reviewers, and very good. If you are not satisfied, it is likely that you require a full audio system.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of broadcast HDTV. I am using my old antenna system. Yes, there are a few of us left. I expect that the HDMI inputs (2) may be useful when I purchase PC / Internet "by the drink" TV technology when it is available (supposedly 2008).I placed the set in an armoir that is 36" wide with about 3/64" to spare. Side speakers or controls would have been a major problem. Some useful buttons on top, and bottom mounted speakers were a big plus for me.I agree with other reviewers that channel switching is sluggish. I'm not sure how other sets compare on this issue. I found this to be a minor flaw. A true channel surfer should visit a box store to determine if this is a problem for them. Four "favorite channel" buttons can be set on the remote to ease this problem.I am pleased with the purchase. I expect that tech prices will always drop, and chose to pass on economy brands. I believe the biggest advantage of HDTV is watching any sports event and enjoyed the second greatest Super Bowl ever (Namath is still King).
