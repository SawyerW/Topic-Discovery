After doing lot of research I decided to buy this TV. The ordering process on Amazon was smooth. Soon after I paid for the TV the price went down and Amazon was kind enough to match the price.Since this is my first HD TV, I am unable to compare the quality of this TV to other HDTV's.  My friends who own many HDTVs were blown away by the quality of this TV. One of them has 2009 Samsung model and he said this TV is far better than his TV. The HD channels looks amazing on this TV. The SD channels look much better than I expected. I had two different cable/satellite providers for three weeks and I compared the same picture/channels and found that quality of SD channels depend very much on the service provider. HD channels from both providers looked amazing.TV has 2 USB ports in addition to many other types of inputs. You can view pictures, movie clips taken using your digital camera on this TV without any special software. The TV has its own media player. Pictures taken using digital camera looked very sharp on the TV.  I have connected a Flash drives, various memory cards using USB memory cards and USB external hard drives to the TV.The TV is very easy to setup. I recommend that the minimum level of the eco sensor to be changed to a higher number. This completely solves the issue of TV being "too dark" at night time. Printed material included with the TV has a separate sheet on the possible dark pictures due to Eco sensor and how to fix it. You can either turn off the Eco sensor or increase the minimum brightness level. The TV has a small speaker. However, it produces good quality sound for day to day use. If you are looking for Movie Theater sound quality, a home theater systems is recommended. As an average user, I am more than happy with the quality of the sound.
