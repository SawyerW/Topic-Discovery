We purchased this TV to replace a 4 year old 40" LCD that we wanted to move upstairs.  Overall, we have been pleased with the TV's performance.  Picture quality is excellent, though we did need to adjust the factory settings to get to a color spectrum that was more to our liking.  We also immediately turned off the 120Hz feature as this is not so much of a feature as it is an annoying distraction.  Some have complained about the edge lit nature of the screen, but generally we have not seen any light bleed in dark scenes.  That said, depending upon the signal source, we have seen some very very minor sharpness issues in certain dark scenes.  Again, this seems to be source dependent (Think House on Bravo (minor issues) vs. House on Fox (no issues)) as it is not a consistent flaw across all channels or sources.The internet connectivity of this TV is also a nice touch.  We've gotten movies from Amazon's VOD service though finding Amazon's movies through Yahoo was a bit cumbersome (Note to Amazon - get your own app on the TV).  We've also used the VUDU movie service, which due to its accessibility and selection is pretty cool.  We did did not get the Samsung proprietary wireless device as we had an Apple Airport Express already around.  We have not had any issues with streaming, even using an 802.11b signal.The one issue with this TV is the sound quality.  It's "good enough" for casual TV watching, but has sort of a small/hollow/tinny sound that could be better.  This is mostly due to the size of the TV cabinet which simply can't house big enough speakers.  For sports/movies, run the sound through your home theater, or alternatively, buy a sound bar.  If you are on the fence because of the sound issue, don't be.  It is really a minor complaint in what is ultimately a great TV.Highly recommended.
