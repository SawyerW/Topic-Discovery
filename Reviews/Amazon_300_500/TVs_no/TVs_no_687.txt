I've been very pleasantly surprised with how much I like this TV. My old tube HD TV (Sony 1080i) died and I did some quick research and decided to go with the LG 42LD520. It has a fantastic picture. Our local cable TV network HD broadcasts look fantastic and so does video from my AppleTV (Hard Drive model), NetFlix movies from my ROKU XR (Sorry Apple there was just no reason to get the new generation of your AppleTV when the ROKU also offers Amazon videos), I haven't even watched anything from my Blu-Ray player yet because everything else looked so good I haven't felt the need yet. All devices are connected via HDMI but at first my ROKU XR was connected via component video and that looked wonderful as well. The built-in cable management feature is also a nice touch.It doesn't allow me to create my own labels for the inputs and I have to choose from the presets which mostly don't apply. The only one that applies to the equipment I have connected is the Blu-Ray player. There are no presets for AppleTV, ROKU or any type of Internet streaming so I'm stuck with HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 as descriptions. Yuck. The other main disappointment I have is that there is no way to label the TV channels. I'd like to be able to label them ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, Discovery, etc. but there is no option for labeling channels whatsoever not even any presets.To me those drawbacks are minor annoyances but there is no reason not to have those options available on a TV as nice as this one. So 4 stars for User friendliness but 5 stars on every other aspect of the TV. I know the 550 model would have networking and NetFlix built-in but the ROKU box is tiny and simple and I think much better than what I've heard about the built-in networking in the 550. So if you're trying to decide between the two models then just let me say that I'm actually pleased that I opted for the 520 and put the savings toward the ROKU XR.
