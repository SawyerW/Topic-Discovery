Not perfect, but it's the closest thing I've seen so far.  Really deserves 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of a couple convenience features missing from the remote, and the limited number of non HDMI inputs. The picture quality, light weight, reduced power use, and thin cabinet are just terrific. The remote takes a couple hours to really bondwith though you can start watching TV and movies pretty quickly without knowing how to make adjustements other than selecting your input source.Pros:* Increadible Dynamic Contrast. I feel like other people are in the room with me. Even up close to a few inches away the images is crisp, clear, and lifelike.* Light weight at only about 65 lbs or so, about 1/3 that of an old 32" TV.* VGA computer input, 4 HDMI, Audio out, and a couple other type inputs.*240Hz demo feature lets you display 240Hz on one side and 60Hz regular on the other. There's also multiple modes of 240Hz you can select. Great feature to play with while watching the latest Bond movies.*2ms response time (sounds good to me)Cons:*Only one regular RCA input that is shared with a Component input (you can use either the 3 component inputs jacks~ or just one of them for your video, then use the Left and Right audio). Bottom line is you only have one non-HDMI video Input (not counting the computer VGA input).*PIP only accessed from tools menu instead of a single button on remote. Swapping PIP image to main image required selecting that source input instead of a single swap button. Can only display TV or Cable image in PIP and not other HDMI input devices.*Touch of Color is only one blue light at the bottom instead of all around the edges as I expected.That's the quick review. I'm sure someone will go into more detail soon and I look forward to hearing other takes on this new LED series. I'm very happy with the purchase, especially at 10% or more below the list price.
