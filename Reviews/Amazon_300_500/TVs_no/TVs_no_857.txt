I am so glad I finally decided to purchase this TV,I must have looked everywhere I could think of over the past few months looking at 55" HD TVs. I already own a 47" HD Vizio TV, but I wanted a bigger one in the living room, but I also needed to find the best deal I could. When I came across the Toshiba 55", 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HD, 3D, Wireless Internet connection television at the price I found it for, I knew I had finally found what I was looking for, but I still had my doubts as to what the quality would actually be as I have never owned a Toshiba television before (I have owned several of their computers however), so I took a little time to think about it before I actually purchased it, and I read the reviews, most were quite positive so I decided to give it a chance. Boy am I ever glad I did, I thought my last HD had an excellant picture, in fact people use to comment on how good the picture was until I got this one, the picture is so clear and so detailed you feel as if you are actually there(I still really like my Vizio to though). I think it is safe to say that I love this television. The set-up was so easy, and connecting to the Internet was effortless, I just told it to look for my home network and it found it, now I don't have to go through my game counsel to watch Netfix, and I love all the free widgets and Vudu and everything else you can get to online through this television. It has to be one of the best purchases I have ever made. The sound is good also, but I have my TV hooked up to my stereo system, it always makes the sound so much better when you hear it through an actual sound system. So, if your considering buying this TV I wouldn't waste any time, especially at the price they are selling it for!
