I have been researching flat panel TVs for months now trying to decide between Plasma vs. LCD, TV size, and picture quality.  What I found was the Sharp LC46D92U.  First of all LCDs appear to be the direction of the industry as there may be limitations to the advancements that can be made with plasma technology.  Secondly the advances made with the Sharp LC46D92U have put to rest all of the advantages held by plasma sets in the past.  Plasma TVs for example had deeper blacks than LCDs because plasma TVs do not use a back light.  Also in the past, faster moving scenes on large LCDs have been a problem because the frame rate conversion was to slow to keep up with the fast motion.  The Sharp LC46D92U put all issues to rest because they doubled the frame rate conversion solving the fast motion problems, and a 5 wave back light has solved the black level problems.  Now, I could go on about how this set is superior showing you all of my research, but I don't feel that I need to as this set speaks for itself.  Be sure to get the D92 module as it is the latest set with the advanced 5 wave back light, 120z frame rate conversion, and the 4ms response time.  Also watch out for the previous D62 and D82 modules as some stores are still trying to push old stock (Best Buy & Circuit City, etc.).  These old modules do not have the latest advances nor do they have as many connections, and they had some banning problems on the old modules.  Also as a side note this set is 1080p Full HD, so it is ready for the latest forms of HD (1080p) (Blue Ray DVD) (HD DVD).  All in all, the picture is fantastic and the price can't be beat and that is why I bought the Sharp LC46D92U.
