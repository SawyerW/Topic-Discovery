Right now in the electronics industry, many of us are going to have to purchase a brand new television. Although for a lot of us, we don't know why, but if we don't we can't watch our shows. In a couple of years, we will be watching televisions shows in High Definition. Although it might be expensive, there are inexpensive choices instead. Sylvania knows that feeling. With SDTV's, EDTV's, and HDTV's, in can be confusing. Not just that, it also can be very much a huge pinch from our wallets. Fortunately, you can buy one that is simple, with all the convience of your everyday needs, and this is one of those.The Sylvania LC200SL8 is a LCD 20 inch television that is inexpensive from the company, but convient in price. At nearly 15 pounds in weight, this television is sleek and easy to setup and works like a charm. It is easy to connect your video game systems like the Xbox 360, your DVD player, or your converter box for all your cable needs. You can also view HD programming at a smaller resoultion. Although to some it might be a hastle to some, it isn't much of a problem. It is very easy to operate and the display is absolutely beautiful on all your favorite movies and television shows. You can also view programs in 16x9 widescreen or the traditional 4x3 aspect ration with the new ATSC tuner. There is one disadvantage though, the instruction booklet could've been a bit easier to help those who have a hard time setting up televisions, but it isn't a big deal.All in all, if you get a DTV, digital television some time soon, I definitely recommend Sylvania a whole lot because they bring out a lot for anyone at a convient price. It is inexpensive and delivers well for anyone looking for a new television. This television is really worth it.Price: B+Convience: B 1/2-Easy To Operate: B 1/2+Sound: B+Overall: B 1/2+
