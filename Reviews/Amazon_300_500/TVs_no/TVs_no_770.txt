I did not think it would be as good as the movies we have went to see. It is better! My kids say it is better! My Grandkids say it is better! We have Directv so I can watch 3D any time of the day. There still is limited shows but I am hoping for more. I love this TV!! I bought it for the 1080p not the 3D. but the wife said get a HDTV with 3D it is the way to go. She reads Consumer Reports, so I checked all the reviews and this Panasonic was listed as top line! Something about Panasonic is the only 3D to use 1080p in both eyes? Directv also listed it as one of their advised 3D TV's to buy, it was the first on their list BTW! Now I am no techie, but my daughter told me after watching for 5 minutes that this 3D was so good I could sell seats in my house! LOL. I wish 2 sets of glasses came with the TV but hey if you can afford this set you can afford the glasses. I just hated giving them back and forth to the whole family all night. I bought my Pana here on AMAZON @ World Wide Stereo and they used CEVA to ship the TV the truckers came with the TV early (3days) and helped me get the box off too. Very nice delivery men BTW!  The whole process from order to turning this TV was 5 Star for me. This is my second Panasonic HDTV the first is a 720p in our bedroom that I have had over a year and we are very happy with. I have watched how many ESPN 3D football games? How many 3D shows? People came in on Halloween and sat down and would not leave! they just wanted to see 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its better and better...
