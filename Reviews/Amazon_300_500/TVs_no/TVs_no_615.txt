This LED lit LCD TV has an amazing picture.  It appeared better than it's competitors when I compared it to all the TV's at Best Buy, so I bought it from Amazon.  The honeymoon has ended and it is looking more like a nightmare.I bought this TV in August and after only THREE months of light use (12 weeks of less than ten hours a week of usage), the TV literally melted down.  I was watching it from my couch last night and the LED TV went black and randomly started clicking on and off, simultaneously the internal power supply started to meltdown and filled my house with toxic smelling black  smoke.  All this happened in less than 30 seconds.  I unplugged the TV to get it to stop melting and billowing black smoke.  Super scary.  I had to open the doors and windows for an hour when it was freezing out before my house stopped smelling.  I did some online research today and it seems that at least thousands of people have had a problem with their Samsung TV power supplies failing (that is what I assume has happened here but only a technician could confirm).  Google search for: Samsung TV power supply problems.  Also look at consumeraffairs.com and there are 125 pages of complaints.I contacted Amazon customer service and will update this review once I hear from them.  The TV started back up after cooling down however, I am afraid to plug it in because I don't want my house to burn down if it overheats again when I am out of the room or not home.Where is the Quality Control Samsung?  Why on earth would they keep putting in third party power supplies (capacitors) that fail so quick?I was fooled by the slim profile and amazing picture. Not again.
