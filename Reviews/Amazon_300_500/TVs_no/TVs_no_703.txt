GOT THIS TV IN THREE DAYS WITH FREE SHIPPING FOR [...], SAW THE SERIAL NUMBER WITH THE D INSTEAD OF THE W, HENCE THE VA PANEL AND NOT THE IPS, BUT WANTED TO SEE THE PICTURE MYSELF. HOOKED IT UP TO COX CABLE WITH HDMI 1080I RIGHT NEXT TO MY 6 MONTH OLD SAMSUNG 720P. I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT ON SMALLER TV'S THE RESOLUTION DID NOT MATTER THAT MUCH, WELL IN THIS CASE I DON'T KNOW IF ITS THE RESOLUTION, THE LED OR THE 120HZ, BUT THE LG LED 37 ABSOLUTELY BLOWS AWAY THE 720P SAMSUNG. THE SAMSUNG LOOKS LIKE A DYNEX OR SHARP IN COMPARISON. IT IS MUCH BRIGHTER AND HAS MUCH MORE CLARITY. HAD MY FAMILY OVER FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AND MY MOM COMMENTED ON HOW GREAT THE PICTURE WAS ON THE LG. THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO HER HOUSE AND GOT TO SEE THE PICTURE ON HER SAMSUNG 52 60HZ THAT I HAD HER BUY LAST YEAR, EXACTLY ONE YEAR OLD. AGAIN THE LG LED LE5300 BLOWS AWAY THAT TV ALSO. IT LOOKS CLOUDY AND DULL IN COMPARISON. BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS TV I SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME COMPARING THE 37 LED'S, SAMSUNG, PANASONIC, AND LG AT BEST BUY, AND ALL WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE REGULAR LCDS THAT WERE NEXT TO THEM IN BRIGHTNESS, CLARITY, AND COLOR. THE THING THAT PUTS THIS TV OVER THE TOP IS WHEN YOU PUT IN A BLUE RAY DISC, AS IT IS ALMOST UNWORLDLY. NOT EXACTLY SURE IF ITS THE NEW SONY BLUE RAY PLAYER OR THE TV, BUT I'M THINKING IT'S THE TV, AGAIN IT TAKES TV TO A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.COMPARING THE DARK KNIGHT ON THE YEAR OLD SAMSUNG 52 60HZ TO THE LG 37 LED 120 HZ IS NOT EVEN FAIR, BUT IT MIGHT FREAK SOME PEOPLE OUT AS IT DID ME AT FIRST. IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOUR IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THE CHARACTERS. OVERALL I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE, YEA  FOR 599.00, NO TAX, AND  FREE SHIPPING, THIS TV IS SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING THAT EVEN  EXISTED 2-3 YEARS AGO IN THIS PRICE RANGE. YES THE SPEAKERS COULD BE BE BETTER, BUT SOUND NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SAMSUNG'S. AS FAR AS VIEWING FROM AN ANGLE, I WALKED TEN FEET SIDEWAYS FROM 5 FEET AWAY 30 TIMES AND SAW NO REAL NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE, AS IF YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO WATCH TV LIKE THAT. I GUESS THE IPS PANEL MIGHT BE BETTER, BUT TO ME IT COULD BE A HEAD CASE THING LIKE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS SWEAR THAT APPLE PRODUCTS ARE HEADS AND TAILS ABOVE THE COMPETITION. OVERALL I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT SOMEONE WHO PAYS [...] TO [...] MORE FOR A SAMSUNG 37 LED IS A FOOL, AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO'S FAMILY INCLUDING MY SELF HAS THREE SAMSUNG TV'S LESS THAN A YEAR OLD.
