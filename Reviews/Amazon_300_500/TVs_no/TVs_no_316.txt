I've been using the HLP5685W for almost ten years now and could not be more pleased with it. DLP technology is still commonly used in projectors, but DLP TVs have mostly disappeared. However, they have some significant advantages which have led to me keeping this set over purchasing an LED LCD or Plasma in recent years. In particular, the ability to replace the DLP bulb (and color wheel if needed) means that the TV can be kept as crisp and clear as it was when it was brand new even ten years later. I know from having other LCDs and Plasmas that this is not true for them.In 2004, when this set was released, it was the cutting edge. It has VGA, DVI, multiple component inputs, and a single HDMI port. It is not a "smart TV", because back then they didn't exist! But it has served me very well for watching sports, Blu-rays and playing videogames. It is also flanked by very high quality speakers--so good that I simply stopped using my 5.1 system because it wasn't worth it!The only drawback, in my opinion, is also one of the benefits. That sounds odd, but I'm speaking of the pedestal. If your system and area you'll have your TV in can accommodate the footprint of the pedestal, it's very convenient to have it so that you don't have to worry about buying a shelving unit or hanging it on the wall as you do with a flat TV. However, if you don't have space for it, that can be a problem. Make sure you have a good space for a TV like this.Anyway, even nearly a decade later, I still think this is a great TV. I just recently replaced the bulb and the picture is crisp and bright--I love it! I don't feel like they make 'em like this anymore. It feels like consumer electronics and TVs in general are not built to last this long these days. It's unfortunate, but makes me all the happier to own this model.
