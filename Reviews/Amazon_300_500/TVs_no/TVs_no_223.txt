After several months of research, and changing my mind between Plasma vs. LCD, 1080p vs. 720p and size (40" to 46"), I am happy to say that I got just the TV I wanted.- Glad I went with an LCD, because glare was a bit of an issue with my room and when comparing this set side-by-side with comparable Plasma sets, I actually thought this looked better on some programs. It's really amazing how much glare comes off of Plasma's when you look at them in stores (not always an issue for everyone though depending on their setup, of course).- I ruled 1080p out because after comparing side-by-side from real viewing distances (7 to 10 feet) I could not tell the difference. 1080p is just not something I need at this time.- I had thought about going for a 46", because when looking at a 46 vs. 40 in a store, it made the 40 seem so small.  I am soooo happy I ended up getting the 40". It fits perfect in my room (max sitting depth from TV is about 10').  Anything bigger would have looked too big in my opinion.  When my wife came home to see the tV for the first time she actually thought I ended up getting the 46" because of how big it looked. =)I have had the set for just over a month and I still am in awe when I watch stuff on it.  HD programs are sweet and even the Standard Def. programs look pretty good. It really all depends on your source for how good they look.This set has plenty of easy to access options to adjust colors, dynamic mode, sound, etc...Even when the set is off, it looks amazing. The design is very nice and would make a nice, classy addition to any room.  A week after I bought the TV I saw a magazine ad for this series of Sammsung's that focused purely on the beautiful design and looks of the TV.  The ad was right on.If you get one too, enjoy it!
