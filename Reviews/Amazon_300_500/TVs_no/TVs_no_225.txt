I ordered this on the 21st and it arrived after 4 business days even though I took the standard free shipping.  I purchased it for my brother "were roomates".  He hasn't had the opportunity to get an HD cablebox yet but it is connected to both an xbox 360 and a ps3. We have viewed many blu-ray movies and logged many gaming hours on it, mostly Halo2-3, Madden, Heavenly Sword and bioshock.The picture quality with his standard cable box is as expected, mediocre, however when viewing blu-ray movies or playing games it is similar to my LNS-4095D 1080p(in my bedroom) and I seriously can't tell the difference IF and this is a big IF its on 720p. We have both noticed that if the console output on the 360 or ps3 are set to 1080i on fast moving games the edges are noticeably blurry.  Not bad but you can definitely notice it and it does effect competitive game play IMHO.However when set to 720p my eye can't pickup any of the former blurriness and on this superb 40" set I can't see a difference between my 1080p and his 720p.  The colors and black levels are all very good "once you tweak the settings".  However its not quite as crisp and brilliant as my living room set, Sony bravia 46XBR2.  However that sets not even comparable in cost.  Also if you are going with a 46" or larger set I suggest 1080p at 40" its not noticeable to the vast majority of consumers.The sound is barely adequate since it is a bedroom set but anyone who wants to have this in the living room should invest in a sound system. The connections are very convienent and needed as he has 3 HDMI devices (cablebox, 360 elite, ps3).I would highly recommend this set like stated early can't get better bang for your buck than than this set.
