I think this TV is only available on the used market now, so this is somewhat pointless, except to say that if you can get this TV for a reasonable price then DO IT.  Right now it's only available from one seller at 895 for a used device.  You must be kidding me.  However, when it was available in the 600 dollar range it was a great great buy.  Like all of these TVs, it requires some tweaking of the picture out of the box but once you do that it looks GREAT.  For the money you absolutely cannot beat it.If you are a gamer or another person that has 6 or 8 HDMI devices, it might not be the TV for you.  It only has 2 HDMI and 1 component.  I am not a gamer so that is sufficient for me.The HD tuner is nice.  We stream a lot of TV shows and movies but since there was already some cable run to the roof of our house for an old satellite dish, I decided to pop a rooftop antenna up there.  We get pretty much all the major networks and plenty of spanish language infomercial sub-channels as well.  Just because I don't have cable or satellite, do not think I am not a picture snob.  I absolutely am.  I wasted hours of my off-time for over a month debating which TV to buy.  I'm just not paying over $100 a month when I hate 90% of the programming offered and I get adverts shoved down my throat for a third of the time I'm watching.After reading about the minority of people who have the TV just utterly fail after 6 months, I did opt for a 4 yr warranty.  Usually I refuse to buy an extended warranty, but I'm not going to have a bricked $700 TV.Awesome TV, my parents were looking for a TV around this size and one smaller, I had them get the 32" version of this TV (although it is slightly different, of course) and I wish I could find this exact TV for them to buy as well.
