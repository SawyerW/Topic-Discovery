The Television is a 42 inch LCD HD 1080p, 120 Hz TruMotion, Internet Capable and Wi-Fi ready. The Price $629.99 when I made my purchase, tax free. My jaw hit the floor, it hit the floor for a second time when she finally arrived. She was more than I expected she has 4 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, 1 AVI, 2 Compost cable ports, 1 Lan cable port to go dial up to the Internet if you wish, or she also has a Wi-Fi adapter port which once purchased for $50 can be put right into the port and boom no more LAN cable you are now Wi-Fi. This is one of the few Televisions which are Wi-Fi ready so far more a slated to be released in the future, but for now this 42 inch LCD from LG is the bad boy on the block. The remote is super sexy and extremely simple to understand and use, it took 5 minutes to assemble the TV once I pulled it out the box. The picture and something called invisible sound which makes the sound even cleaner and sharper blew me away, I jizzed as soon as I was playing Call of Duty, or Dante's Inferno, or Gears of War on the HDMI channels with the 1080p, and the TruMotion 120 Hz which is specifically put on this TV for hardcore gaming and sharper pictures. I cant say enough about this Television you have to experience it your self to understand what I'm feeling and talking about. Buy one today and I know you will be more than happy when she comes in the mail tomorrow. She is sitting pretty in my bedroom and when I take off all the lights and either watch a movie or am playing a HDMI game, I fall in love all over again.
