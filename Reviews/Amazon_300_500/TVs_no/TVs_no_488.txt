Well, first off, let me say this television is by no means bad.  The picture quality is fantastic and the 240hz feature takes some getting used to, but brings you closer to the movies in a more personal way. 240hz will seem a little weird at first, but give it a try.  One thing I have to note, however, is that the "flashlighting" "spotting" effects have unfortunatly made their way to my TV since day one.  I do most of my watching in the evening in a dark room, so whenever the screen goes to black I see the splotching clearly and bright as day.  It's really a let down for how much I paid ($2,500 in december, ill get to that later..) . .For the price of this TV they should have really ironed out those problems beforehand, or do a recall or a firmware update to fix it.  I heard it has something to do with the LED being side lit.  Inexcusable in my opinion.  Lastly, I am very disapointed to see the price of the B8000 55" go down $600 a week after I purchased it for a whopping $2,500.  Technology advances, I can understand, but they should have let the consumers know the "C" line was coming.  So basically,  IF I would have waited a couple weeks I could have gotten a UN55C7000 with almost twice the contrast ratio,  3d ready, and no flashlighting.  I really feel screwed over.  After viewing the FAQ on the samsung website, they claim the B series is not 3d ready and never will be 3d ready.  So those of us who just upgraded to what we thought was the cutting edge, best, new LED TV two weeks ago will be quick to learn the TV is infact an incompitant and over priced LED TV.Now that the television has dropped nearly $800.00 in price, it really is a great buy for ANY consumer.  You're getting a lot of TV for that price.  If you have the opportunity to grab the C7000 for five hundred dollars more, definetly go for it.  I still feel the TV should be lowered in price.
