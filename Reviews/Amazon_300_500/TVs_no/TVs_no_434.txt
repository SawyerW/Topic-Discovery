Have owned this TV a week and like it more and more every day. The  picture is amazingly clear, vivid, and rich in color, even with my standard definition satellite receiver. While producing a good image in the daylight, this set really comes alive and excels as evening approaches and the room dims. Picture and sound adjustments are plentiful and easy to use, but can always be returned to factory defaults when so desired. When shopping and viewing plasmas and LCDs side by side the LCDs invariably appeared sharper and brighter. In fact I brought one home only to return it the next day. Its image was indeed "sharp", but for some reason didn't seem pleasing to the eye. The qualities of a plasma TV are apparently more subtle and harder to detect in store type settings. In the end, I relied upon the positive reviews on Amazon and other sites and couldn't be happier with this choice.The only negative worthy of note is that the speakers are mediocre in quality and face straight down which can cause a little distortion when the TV is situated on a hardwood surface as mine is. Backing off the treble and bass a little (in the audio adjustments) helped a lot. Of course, for musicals and most movies I channel audio through a good sound system connected directly to the satellite receiver. Additionally, anyone considering this set would be well advised to read up on the issue of "image retention". The set has sophisticated safeguards built in which were apparently lacking in early plasma sets, but suffice it to say, it is better to avoid static images for long periods of time. An informed adult should be able to make good choices in viewing habits and experience no problem. However, If the set is to be used heavily by children, an LCD might just be the wiser choice.
