Picked up the Sony Bravia 55EX501 @ Costco yesterday for $1700 + tax and ran it for about 12+ hours straight through.  So far, so good...PROS:- GREAT PIX QUALITY for HIGH QUALITY TV BROADCASTS.  For Blue Ray movies and high quality HD broadcasts, such as CBS Sports, this TV is a home run.  For example, watched Iron Man on Blue Ray on it, and the pix quality was fantastic!- TRULY PLUG & PLAY- controls and remote are very easy to figure out.- LOSTS OF INPUT PORTS- 4 HDMI ports, 2 component, and 1 composite port- intuitive Input selector and easy to label.CONS:- POOR VIDEO QUALITY for MEDIUM TO LOW QUALITY TV BROADCASTS.  For lesser quality HD tv broadcasts or non-HD tv broadcasts, the picture quality is WORSE than my Sony KDL42 rear projection LCD HD TV.  This is because this TV is so high resolution, that it is less forgiving on less-than-pristine broadcast signals...  Regular DVD's still look very decent though.- VERY LIMITED "FAVORITES" CHANNELS. 10 only?  And, they jump around in order every time you select them and don't "stay in place."  This is actually very annoying.- DIGITAL BROADCAST CHANNEL DESCRIPTORS DON'T WORK- ie all channels show up with "The programming information cannot be displayed."  I found this to also be very annoying, because I like being able to see the names of the programs if it's on a commercial as I flip channels.- NO S-VIDEO PORT.- REQUIRES SOME HORIZONTAL LEVELING DURING SETUP.  This tv mounts onto a flat stand, which you then have to screw in 4 philips screws to tighten down.  Problem: you actually have to horizontally level the tv or it will slightly TILT to one side.  I only just realized this AFTER setting it up.  So, I will have to wait until I can get some help to loosen and re-fasten the screws to level it in place properly.  (What a pain!)  Also, the tv wobbles around a bit, even on the stand.  Doesn't feel 100% firmly secure.- NO EARTHQUAKE FASTENING STRAP LOOP.  There are no strap holes for you to fasten down this TV to the tv stand or to the wall...  Sony sells these "separately" now?  I used 3 strips of velcro and fastened it best I could to the TV stand.  <knock on wood.>
