Why 2 stars? I could not update it - at first I had trouble getting the HD setup but once I figured that out (I am not a techie) it is spectacular.This is a great entry to HDTV since it is a great price/quality and had 2 HDMI slots - a rarity!  The picture is crisp and breathtaking with HDTV.  The HD movie channels are amazing. Each HD channel for network TV seems to display their shows in various screen formats, which is annoying, but that is not the TV.I bought this at BestBuy December 9th, 2006 and choose the 324 instead of the 325 model that has the 4000:1 contrast ratio because I didn't think there was a big enough difference for the extra $200+ I would have to pay and I like the styling of the 324 better.  (At BB I had a 12% discount for Rewards Club members so it was $1029 before tax - Amazon has it at $900 something with free shipping but I didn't want to hassle with a shipping return.)I'm not a TV/techie type but when I learned how to do it, setup was easy (and yes, it does a few seconds for TV to turn on). When I bought the TV BB told me to see any channels in HD I had to have an HD cable box.  Comcast in Baltimore City had set me up with regular digital cable when I moved in but it was an HD capable box (HDMI input in back) so all I had to do was call Comcast and upgrade to HD cable ($5 extra) and then hook up with the HDMI cable and disconnect the regular coax cable.  FYI - if you sign up for HD cable at Best Buy they take $50 off your TV.  I bought the $99 Monster HDMI 4' cable there too for convenience.It's light enough for me to carry in the box so I didn't have to pay the $50 delivery or setup fee (also free on Amazon).  Everyone complains about the sound, but it seems fine to me - but I am not used to surround sound anyway.  Hope this helps! : )
