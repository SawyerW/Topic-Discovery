After reading a ton of reviews on several sites, I hesitantly bought this on sale at BJ's for $399...the price was too good to pass up. First and foremost I want to clear up the "lip sync" issue, because that is a truly annoying thing to have to live with...you HAVE TO USE AN HDMI cable with this set ($32 Walmart - bought the Vizio brand - figured that made the most sense).  The regular audio/video cables that come in the box are pointless, Vizio can have them back. "lip sync" fixed.  After a few days of use, I noticed the volume fluctuations that have been described in reviews...I could live with them, but choose not to...so I bought Vizio's basic Sound Bar ($98 Walmart).  Got that home and again with the cables provided, I couldn't get the sound bar to work, so back to the store to buy an "S/PDIF" audio cable(This is what it said next to the input).  Not available at Walmart this time, so over to Radio Shack I went.  The guys there had no idea what I was talking about, but we did an internet search and found out it is simply an "optical audio" connection, they had one and I bought it ($25 Radio Shack).  Got the sound bar working, and the "Volume Problem" is fixed and it sounds great!  The sound bar utilizes the "TruVolume" and "TruSurround" features perfectly.  Now I just need a universal remote so I can control everything with one device.So my final thoughts are...with all the extras bought and in place, this set is a phenomenal value considering the price paid!  $399+35+98+25=$557.  Plus I threw in the 3 year warranty offered me for $40 (after all, I said bought it hesitantly).  So for everything under $600 and the proper/best video/audio hook-ups in place and complete with sound bar, I am very happy.  I knocked it down 1 star for Vizio being a pain in the ass and making me do all the "runaround", I am in Marketing, and if I worked for Vizio, I would put out a bundle edition with EVERYTHING in one box.
