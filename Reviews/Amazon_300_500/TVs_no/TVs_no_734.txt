I recently bought this TV from Amazon after having done a lot of research, and viewing different TVs in the store. For its price range this TV offers the best picture and depth of colors of all of the TVs I compared. The main decision I had to make was between this and the Samsung 46UNC6500, which when I did a side by side of them, the colors and picture looked much richer on the 820UN.For those wondering, the difference between the 820 and 810UN is a glass screen on the 820, which gives a "better" contrast ratio and adds about 15 lbs to the weight. Regardless, the TV is not particularly heavy and I set it up, lifted it out of the box, walked about 40ft, and put it on a TV stand at belly button height, with relative ease.Pros:Easily the best picture I've seen on a TV in this price rangeExcellent color display and very rich colors (personally I don't know if the added yellow pixel makes a big difference macroscopically, but the TV looks very nice) Other review sites noted a richer color display and some gained energy efficiency from the 4th color addition (CNET [did not review TV, but previewed Quattro technology] and Flat Panel Reviews)Nice design aesthetics, the TV looks very attractive and has nice cut buttons that are flush with the display (think PS3 buttons)Very affordable priceI have not tried out the Apps yet, but the TV can act as a Netflix browserSet has little blooming (I noticed none) for an LCD display, colors do not wash blue on the edges like the Samsung I viewed didCons:I do not feel the stand is super stable, but only time will tellThe glass screen is SUPER reflective, if you are going to be watching this in a room that has ample sunlight on the screen, I would think about going for the 810 or a non-glass screen TV. The picture is beautiful, but the depth of the black will be ruined when the screen is acting like a mirror during dark scenesTo the above comment, my room is really well lit, but when I turn the lights down, the glass is no longer a problem, so as long as you have good control over the lights, don't worry.Overall the TV was a great buy, and I couldn't be happier with it.
