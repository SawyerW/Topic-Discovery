Alright guys, I am not technically inclined, so forgive this technically ignorant review, but I am a person who likes something to work as soon as I take it out of the box. I also don't want to mess with problems and/or flaws. This product met one of those - it works coming out of the box. However, it does have a manufacturing flaw in it that causes the sound to just kind of fizzle out and it will stay out for a couple of minutes, or it will come back on if you turn the tv off and then on again. That wouldn't even bother me as much but it takes longer than a regular tv for the picture to come back up. Anyway, it took 3 online chats with Sony and 2 firmware upgrades for the problem to be "fixed"...it still happens periodically. Also, we are having a problem with the picture going black and then coming back on. It's almost as though the cable is going out. This may not apply to you, because it applies to Time Warner Cable. TWC has new digital cable boxes they rolled out this summer (2010) and between their manufacture and some Sony tv's, there is something missing that causes the picture to go in and out like that. The way to fix it is to hook up even more cables in addition to the HDMI cable. Wouldn't be too much of a problem if our tv wasn't wall mounted and it wouldn't be extremely hard to get those cables down the wall and out the already full hole in the wall. You might think, so those 2 things are it? Let me tell you, they are infuriating when they happen. I N F U R I A T I N G. As far as the picture, it's great, volume is great (when it works) and to operate is a breeze. But I wouldn't purchase again. There are newer tv's for the same price that would be a much better investment. I like Sony, but they could have done better than this.
