This is one fantastic TV. I had it up and running in no time (save for letting it literally warm up, see note later) and was blown away by the picture, even though we had checked it out in the local stores. The design is beautiful and the stand provides a very solid and stable footing. I was able to attach the stand alone but needed help to lift it to the TV cabinet. The set is packaged well by Samsung and arrived with no issues. Set up was fast and hook up is a breeze. The Samsung Apps are good. The wireless works well, but I have to re-enter my router passkey to get it up and running. I have watched a few movies from Netflix and that process is painless and the movie ran perfectly.  At times the pictures dims during Internet use. I assuming it's due to bandwith, etc. Delivery from Pilot was OK. The delivery guy was great, helping me take the unit out of the box to check for any screen damage. I didn't expect that service. He also made a great suggestion. Because the unit had been sitting in their warehouse for 10 days it was cold. Be sure to wait for the unit to reach room temperature before firing it up. He said he's heard of screens cracking if you don't let it warm up. I appreciated that! I had scheduled my shipping date and window. Because of the snowstorm, they came the next day. But they never called to tell me when they were coming. I finally reached them locally thanks to a national sales rep. She got me their number, which was not in the phone book, and I contacted them. The local rep assured me it was "on the truck" and would come between 11-2. Luckily, I was home for the delivery. Otherwise, who knows? Overall, from ordering, to getting a great, low price, to setup, this TV is a beauty.
