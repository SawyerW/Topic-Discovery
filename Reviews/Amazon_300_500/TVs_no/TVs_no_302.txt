Bought the 46" XBR4 the week before x-mas and love it.  Couldn't find anything that I thought had a better picture.  Ended it up getting it at Video & Audio Center, same prices as Amazon (within $10) free shipping because I was local, and they had a promotion for a free Bravia home theater system.  The TV is as good as advertised, sports, video, etc. all look awesome.  Speakers actually work remarkably well, but I usually don't use them.  The standard settings, except for the picture (Vivid was just too bright for me), worked fine, though I've played around with them since then.As for HD service, I thought I was going to be able to take my time, but standard feeds just look sad.  I had DirecTV, and ended up just upgrading because the price worked out to be the same as Dish Network over the minimum subscription period (2 years for DirecTV, 18 months for Dish).  That and they could install it the next day.  My old DirecTV DVR (with Tivo) was just better.  I've been disappointed with the interface and remote control, but everything works.  It just could work better.  For the channels that my wife and I watch, the monthly service is a bunch more for Dish Network, which is why even with the current promotions it was a wash to just upgrade.  I did get DirecTV to only charge me for the box $299 + tax, and to toss in 6 free months of HD service.  If you've never had a DVR you probably won't mind the DirecTV one, but I feel like its a downgrade over my old one (except for the picture in picture feature when using the various menus).  Picture is great, there are a ton of channels in HD, and if you're signing up with DirecTV for the first time you'll get a good deal.  I don't know about reliability with Dish, but I've never had a problem with DirecTV.
