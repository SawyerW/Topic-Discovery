I'm usually very passive about writing reviews but I couldn't hold back on this one... I bought this Samsung HP-S4253 HDTV at [...] Dec 12 and received it a week later. I have been searching for the right for an HDTV for months and spent a lot of time on the internet and in stores comparing different TV Makes and plasma vs LCD. I bought one Sambre 42" from a military exchange, great price, but I wasn't very satisfy with it, I returned it and continue with the search until I found this Samsung HDTV.  In short, this is the most satistfied item I ever bought! I loved it right from the moment i took it out of the box, it looks very appealing. the image quality is just one word - amazing!!! I connected it to a Samsung DVD recording with an HDMI cable and and played on 8020i mode, there's just no better image quality you could have gotten else where. it's basically like viewing real life through the mirrow... even with new the 8020p mode, the normal eye will not really notice any big difference in quality. It has a good sound quality too, the remote controle has everything you'll espect from a beyond-average, user's guid tells you everything you need to know in simple terms. the color desplay is very pure, the black depth is so great that when I compared it with my small LCD monitor TV, I just don't want to look at LCD again. besides, there's nothing you're missing out with LCD on this plasma, it's got a 60,000 hrs life spand and a burn in control technology. with the satisfaction from this tv quality, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay a couple hundred dollars more for it. Have already made up my mind to stick with Samsung for electronics.
