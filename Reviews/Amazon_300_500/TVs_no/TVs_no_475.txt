The picture quality of the tv amazing, but there are black patches on each corner of the tv. This is not specific to my set. Everyone who has gotten a Samsung LED-series television has been noticing the same problem. I have tried contacting Samsung with the following email, but they told me just to return the television if I was unhappy. Here is a copy of the recent email I sent them:This is my second formal attempt to contact your company regarding a 55" Samsung LED UN55B8000XF. I informed you in my first contact attempt that I had purchased less than two weeks ago this television from Fry's Electronics in Concord, CA. Upon hooking up the television, I noticed four black corners which hindered my viewing pleasure and took away from the effectiveness of the high definition television. I asked what your company's formal stance was on this model and it's problem with dark corners and I asked whether the 8500 series set to be released would have the same problem. To date, I have received no response from you. I take this to mean that the dark corners are not supposed to be there and that they are in fact, a defect. It is unacceptable that Samsung will not reply to my request for information given the thousands I have paid for this television. This is my second documented request and if I do not receive an acceptable response and solution to my problem, I will have no choice but to pursue my complaint in a legal forum, seeking to reimburse the costs I had to pay out of pocket with regard to the purchase, delivery, set-up, and so forth, of this defective television. I look forward to your response within the next three business days. Thank you.I will update this review if I receive an acceptable response or if I am magically illuminated with a solution.
