I have had my tv for 1 week now, and have no complaints with this product.  I upraded from a Sony rear projection, and the difference is incredible.  I did LOTS of research and waffling before finally settling on this TV.  I was debating between the Sony XBR9, Samsung UN46C6500 and the UN46C7000.  I finally settled on this set because of the brightness, picture quality and a bit of future-proofing with the 3D feature.  I have read several reviews saying that the sound is poor, which is maybe going too far.  The sound is better than you SHOULD expect from a TV this thin.  And honestly, most people buying a $2K+ tv are using a home theater of some sort anyway.  Buy this TV for picture clarity and quality.  The blacks are very "inky" and the whites are ultra-white.  There are lots of audio and video adjustments on the TV allowing you to fine tune if you want to.  The remote seems very high quality also.  Brushed stainless look with backlighting is as aestetically pleasing as any remote I have seen.  As others have noted, dont plan on using the wifi adaptor (sold seperate) with an Apple Airport router, but the wired ethernet works fine for the apps and widgets, which work well.  I would rate the 3D higher, but there is almost no content available at this time.  There is only 1 movie available at retail, and less than 5 currently slated for release this year.  To make matters worse, the various 3D manufacturers are trying to get exclusive bundle rights to the few movies that are rumored for release (panasonic and Avatar, Sony and Alice and Wonderland, etc).  I would definately reccomend this to a friend, and have enjoyed the 3D movies that I have watched (Monsters vs Aliens & Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs).  Go for it!
