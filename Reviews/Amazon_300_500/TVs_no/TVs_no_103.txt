I spent about two to three months doing research on this and other plasma TV's! Reviews were pretty good for this set from a customer stand point, CNET, for example did not do justice for this TV on their reviews.Any way, after going to several stores, I was lucky enough to end up in CompUSA and seeing this TV set literally side by side between a two Pioneer plasmas, one of them the Elite model, a Panasonic, a Hitachi and a Mitsubishi.All of these great TV's, however, after a lot of watching different media being played, the picture quality of this TV set beat hands down everyone of them and it rivaled the Pioneer Elite, despite the fact that the latter one is 1080p and over $5,000.00! No surpise here, considering the specs.The people from CompUSA were great, so great that they gave me a great deal, $2,299.99 from $2,999.99!I took it home, and on the first day, I accidently tripped with one of the HDMI cables that I had connected to the back of the TV and to my PS3 and I broke that HDMI port. My TV was not detecting it anymore and it was useless.I called Samsung, now I'll admit, that I did not say exactly how things occured, but they did not care how it had happened and within minutes, they confirmed to me that a technician would be coming to my place within 72 hours to repair it for free!Finally, the technician arrived with a new HDMI board, he then replaced it and within 20 minutes he was done! That same evening, Samsung called to find out how my TV was working, if the technician was on time, clean, friendly, etc. Talk about great service! All in all, I am very pleased with the TV and Samung's customer service!
