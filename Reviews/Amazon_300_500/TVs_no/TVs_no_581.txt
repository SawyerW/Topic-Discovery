I initially happened to order last years model from Amazon at about $200 off, when it came after 2 weeks, the screen was cracked in about 12 places (heard horror stories about the bad "low price" shipping across country), Amazon had no replacement so I got a refund.  Found this years version PN58C6500 available from Vanns (available from Amazon but I ordered direct from Vanns), but I had to pay $200 more.  After about 10 days I got the unit, set it up and the picture was the best I'd ever seen on a tv, like you are looking through a window at a live scene, not a tv.  Unfortunately after about a month all the HDMI inputs stopped working, I determined it was the tv (not bluray player or my Onkyo receiver which did the HDMI routing).  I was apparently too far from Phoenix (Maricopa) for a Samsung repair visit!@#, so another couple of weeks and I got a replacement shipped from Vanns.  I tend to set controls to underwhelm so as to be more realistic, contrast & color at about 45, cell light at 17-20 depending on mood/movie/time, set to "darkest" setting, and I kicked up the gamma to +1, very nice picture, no buzz whatsoever.  Though I had some early issues, they were handled well and I just had to wait a bit for it all to settle out.  My early concerns about possible buzz and heat generation ended up being non-issues (the Onkyo 7.1 is the real heat generator!).  I am very pleased overall, my only negative is the remote can be a bit unresponsive at times, though I don't use it much compared to the cable & receiver remotes.Update: While I had my settings adjusted for a very "natural" picture, I recently decided to make it pop a bit (like in the stores), so I took my very balanced, natural settings, and cranked up contrast, brightness and color all about 5 units each, and restored gamma to 0, now while it isn't as natural as it was, it does pop "like a plasma should", I actually prefer that now, and the picture is even more amazing.
