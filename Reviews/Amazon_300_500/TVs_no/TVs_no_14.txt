I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.
