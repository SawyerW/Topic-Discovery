I researched HDTVs until I was sick of it.  Viewing distance was planned to be about 12 feet, and I decided to go with 42".  I checked actual sets at Best Buy and other vendors and discovered that I couldn't tell the difference between 1080p and 720p from a distance of more than three feet, if at all (I took my own DVD and checked the settings on the various sets).  For my tastes, the image on the Panasonic plasma was more pleasing, warmer and more realistic.  The lower price made it a no-brainer.I ordered the set on a Sunday night.  On Monday, the price dropped about $50.  I called and Amazon credited my account for the difference.  My set was to be delivered the following Monday, so on Thursday, I called the delivery folks to coordinate the delivery.  A nice lady informed that that the set had already arrived and would I like it delivered the next day?The delivery was well within the scheduled window.  Two gents brought it up the stairs, unpacked it, mounted it on the stand, connected it to my cable box, put batteries in the remote and turned it on.  It worked perfectly.  They said they'd take the box and packing material if I wanted but suggested I might want to keep it for a week, just in case.  I decided to keep it, just in case.  The deivery, unpacking and setup took about ten minutes.I spent about an hour playing with the setup (thanks to the other reviewers for the picture settings!), hooking up the home theater (the built-in speakers might be ok for some but not me), dvd, etc.  About a month ago, I purchased a Tripp surge protector for the whole system, just in case.My friends rave about the picture.  As for me, I've had it now for a couple of months and couldn't be happier about the set itself and Amazon's service.
