The key to selecting tv  is asking what you want this tv for. LCD tv's are lighter, use less energy, costs have come way down, no screen burn in to worry about. However, Plasma tv's are still cheaper, have greater viewing angles, and produce vastly better picture quality. LCD's have come a long way, but they can not reproduce the deep, rich blacks of a plasma.  LCD tv's produce pictures that are bright, crisp, and sharp.  Most often, you'll find LCD's displaying animated films in store demo mode. The reason is b/c animated films are supposed to be sharp and creased and bright, and are good matches for LCD's. I like films, and plasma's do a much better job displaying them. So, why should you buy this model, and not a lower model? What are the main differences? Well, this model is capable of displaying 1080P 24fps(frames per second) at 24hz(the refresh rate of the pic). What this means, is that it is a perfect match for Blu-ray. Most films are shot in 24fps 24hz. If the tv can't display that, it must Change the signal to it's natural resolution to display the film.  Regular tv doesn't run at 1080P 24 fps, only Blu-Ray films. So, this tv is for serious movie buffs only who will be playing plenty of Blu-Ray films. If you only want to watch tv, or dvd, you can easily get a lower model, such as the V10. And also 3d is great and i feel better then other 2 tvs i check out which were sammy 8000 and sony.Right know Tv is down to 3900 with bundle that includes 2-3 pair of glasses 2 movies and bluray player great deal thanks 6th ave ele.
