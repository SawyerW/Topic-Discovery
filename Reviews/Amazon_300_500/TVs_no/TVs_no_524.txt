I read nycsoftwaremans review and agree completely.I was fortunate enough to hook up the tv next to the 32" Samsung 1080p model. The Samsung costs over $150 more than the AOC! The difference in picture quality was almost non-existent.I consider Samsung one of the best quality hdtv's on the market. I think this tv is well worth the money and is on sale at Radio Shack right now.It has vivid colors, great detail and if you're 7 or 8 feet away from the screen,there's no need to adjust the angle. I was very surprised by the differences in picture quality when you adjust it for a movie or gaming or whatever.The adjustments for contrast,brightness, etc; work well. I found the "MID" (not low and not high) adjustment to work the best.One of the main reasons I purchased it, besides the great price, was that it has 3 HDMI connections. That's rare for a lot of the smaller tv's. I talked to a guy at Radio Shack and he bought one himself. He said they have had this model turned on almost 12 hours, every day of the week, for the last 5 months. He said they haven't had one problem with the tv. To me,thats says alot! I've only had the TV 5 days but couldn't be happier. You get a great bang for your buck. The only downside I can see,is the sound quality. It's actually about the same as the Samsung but I think we all know most HD's don't have the best sound. However, the TV is in a rather large room and I haven't had to turn it up to full volume yet. If you don't have the cash for a sound system, I would still reccomend it. It's good enough until you get the cash for one. The Sony 32' sound qulaity is not up to par with this set,so judge for yourself. All in all, it's a great buy and I highly reccomend it.
