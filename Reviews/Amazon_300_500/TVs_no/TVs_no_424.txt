We have had this for about 2 weeks and are very happy with it.  It was very easy to set up.  Our cable package only has broadcast stations but with this we seem to be able to get the digital versions of a whole lot of basic cable channels.  Unfortunately, there's still nothing on them except reality shows and procedurals reruns, so it just confirmed for us the uselessness of cable TV.I hooked up my Mac Mini with a DVI to HDMI cable and got a Microsoft Wireless keyboard and mouse for it.  It works very well as a PC monitor and we are able to watch Netflix Watch Instantly movies, YouTube videos and TV shows from Hulu or the networks' sites.  We are using Boxee.tv as an interface and that works well.  Next up, get an eyeTV so we can use the thing as a DVR.This is working out exactly as I had hoped and I strongly recommend this TV.  We checked out the different brands at comparable price points ($400-$500) and only this one and the Samsung really floated our boat.  The picture is almost too clear.  I mean, how many acne scars do you really want to see?  It has a very usable favorites function which allows you to save your channels.  It also interfaces with our Sony Home Theater system with an HDMI cable so we can control the whole system with one remote.  Actually I can use the Home Theater remote and my wife can use the TV remote and we can have remote wars.It has a Picture in Picture function so you can watch TV while you're working on your PC.  One complaint is that in order to go back to full TV you have to go through more key presses than I would have liked.  The only other complaint is that it takes a few seconds to tune in each channel.We now have a very useable media center in our living room which gives us complete access to all the wonderful entertainment out there on the interwebs!
