Being an electronics buff, I hold a high standard to quality.  This Samsung UN46C8000 is amazing.  Picture quality is the best I have ever seen.  From the quality remote to the stand this television is the set for you.  After it was programmed and user preferences were set, the first HD channel was a golf tournament on Golf Channel HD.  Truely breath taking!!!  My other HD sets are Plasma ranging from 58 to 32 inches.  This is the first LED television I have owned.  Being one inch thick, weighing in at 55 lbs it was very easy to handle.  The picture quality on non 3D broadcast makes it look like a modified 3D.  I have never seen anything like it.  My wife who could not care the least about technology, was very impressed with the picture quality.Amazon made the purchasing experience painless with no sales tax and inside delivery.  The delivery staff unbox your television, plug it in to make sure it works and are friendly to boot.  Last but not least, you will be very impressed.  I am very impressed with this next generation of quality.  Samsung you definitely  got this one right!!!!Update:All of the above comments are still true.  I have watched my first 3D movie with the glasses and everything worked perfectly.  3D makes movie watching a whole different experience.  Only one major problem...Other than the 3D movie that came with the free Samsung glasses, there are no other choices to purchase.  3D Blu-ray technology has not caught up with the 3D televisions.  ESPN 3D debuts in June on Directv.  The All Star game will be telecast in 3D and the College Football National Championship game will be in 3D. The television had software update available at the Samsung website.  It was easy to update.  The television was manufactured on March 30, 2010 and the software upgrade was available on April 15.  The 3D Blu-ray DVD player also had an update.  Not difficult to perform but a little surprised.
