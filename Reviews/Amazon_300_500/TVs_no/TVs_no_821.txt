Bullet points for people needing info:1. The stand for the 48" is perfect.  Just remember to read the directions ;-)2. It has a glossy screen.3. It is NOT a true 120Hz.  It has an "effective" 120Hz refresh rate. It's really a 60Hz trying to be a 120Hz. It didn't bother me enough to want to return it.4. It has no external power button (at least that I could find).  Without the remote, you're screwed.3 & 4 are why I gave it 4 not 5 stars.Now for the complete review:I received mine a day late and yes, it was Amazon's fault (they didn't get it on the truck on time - you'd think since I'm a Prime member they'd do it right). Got an extra month on my Prime membership for the late delivery though.  Box came in pretty good condition from FedEx (small ding on the top but didn't penetrate the box). It comes in the normal box you'd get from a brick'n'mortar store and not double boxed.I had read a previous review about the screws for the stand being too short. I'm not sure if the stand is quite the same as the 55", but the stand for the 48" is perfect.  I had actually gone out and purchased the longer screws after reading that review....then I read the directions: there's a slot in the bottom where the base slides in to and the screws were the correct size.  DOH! Typical male 'I don't need no instructions' attitude lol. So, if you own the 48" don't worry..the stand is fine.Setting up is pretty easy.  Connected to my WiFi no problem. On screen keyboard is horrible to use (as most are). It does suck that you have to accept a Yahoo! internet terms of service, BUT you don't have to register any personal information.The TV picture is AMAZING! Like others have said, it does remind me of a plasma.  Played Iron Man 2, Thor: DW, Avengers and Skyfall through it and the action sequences were just as clear as any other 120Hz (but without the 'soap opera' look you get with 120's)Streamed Netflix just fine. Haven't tried the other services.
