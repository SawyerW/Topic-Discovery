I use this as a monitor for my gaming PC and my Mac.So far I am extremely happy with this TV, but I thought I would mention a couple things for those that want to use it as a monitor.First off you are going to want to do some decently major calibrating. This tv has so many cool features for manipulating picture and they are all ON by default it seems, and most of them are not needed for gaming or general computer use.  Here is what I did to make it look "correct".PC - Gaming:On the PC I only had to change setting within the TV menu.Picture:Auto Brightness Control - OFFBacklight  60Brightness  50Contrast  45Color  45Tint  0Sharpness  45Advanced Picture:Color Temperature  - CoolBlack Detail  - OFFActive LED  - OFFReduce Signal Noise - OFFReduce Block Noise  - OFFFilm Mode - (I left this one on Auto)Professional Picture: Color Tuner:Red saturation -10Green & Magenta saturation -15(those are all minus)MAC: (I had to do actual color calibration within my mac system settings, and change the color mode to 9300, the one that said was standard for displays & televisions.)Picture:Auto Brightness Control - OFFBacklight  25Brightness  50Contrast  50Color  50Tint  0Sharpness  30Advanced Picture:Color Temperature  - ComputerBlack Detail  - OFFActive LED  - OFFReduce Signal Noise - OFFReduce Block Noise  - OFFFilm Mode - (I left this one on Auto)Professional Picture: Color Tuner:Red saturation -10Green & Magenta saturation -15(those are all minus)Once I had all these settings figured out everything looks amazing. Unless you are going to splurge on a new 4k TV and spend wayyyy more money, I'd recommend this TV.Note:Unless your computer is specifically set up for it, this TV will show up as 60hz, but that's the computer, not the TV. I believe you would need to overclock something on your computer to run anything at 120hz.
