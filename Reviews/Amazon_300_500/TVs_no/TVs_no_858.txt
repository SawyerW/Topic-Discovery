I got this for $1300 including taxes & shipping on tigerdirect.com.Pros:came with adapters to be able to still use the old rca & component cables.  Has a 3.5mm audio jack & vga port so i can plug my computer directly into it.  Very thin lightweight tv, i lifted & set this up all by myself.  The ps3 plays 3d blurays & looks good on this tv, i prefer passive 3d like on this tv because there's no flicker & the glasses are basically free at theaters. i dont think the sound is as bad as some people say, its fine with me but if im watching a new movie i use my surround sound anyway.Cons:usb port is only 2.0 and doesnt play .flv files, doesnt play audio on some .mkv files (if the file size is too small), no usb keyboard support (needed since there's no keyboard on the remote).  3D is not worth the extra $ so far, I wish I had gotten a bigger tv instead of 3D.  The digital optical audio (fiber optic) has a delay unless you downgrade the video quality, so peoples' mouths dont sync with the words.** update 3-3-12 **downgrading this from 4 stars to 3, just discovered this tv doesn't play media from external usb hard drives or sticks unless they are formatted to FAT32, not NTFS or exFAT.  FAT32 doesn't allow files over 4gb in size, so this means I can't have 1080p movies on the drive since they are sometimes up to 20gb. And if your drive has partitions, sometimes the top usb port will only view the 2nd partition and the bottom usb port will only view the 1st partition, which is backwards.  I got a tv with USB built in so I wouldn't have to get an xbox or ps3 as a media player, so this really annoys me.** update 6-6-12 **the 3.5mm jack for the pc audio has slowly degraded and now is barely audible.  now i would have to get a new computer with hdmi built in, thats the only way ill be able to use the tv as a computer monitor (btw the tv has a vga port but dvi would be better).  Save your $ & get a bigger non-3d tv** update 12-31-12 **this tv just lost another star, down to 1 star now.  Because it doesn't accept NTFS drives, the standard for over 10 years now, I had to format my new 3tb external usb hard drive as FAT32 which is unstable.  After plugging it into the tv and back into my computer, I lost 500gb of data!!  Windows converted 5000 files - movies, tv show episodes, family pictures, and a book I was writing - to an unrecoverable .chk format.  Again, 3D and 240hz are not features i ever use so I suggest getting a bigger non-3D tv that recognizes NTFS drives.
