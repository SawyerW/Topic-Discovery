I had been researching HDTVs for the past 6 months before finally, settling on this model.  I decided to go with the Plasma over the LCD mainly, because plasma offers much better PQ and motion for the money and I didn't want to sacrifice size.  The new Pioneers are very nice but way too expensive if you ask me.  So it came down to the Samsung 5084 or one of the Panasonic 1080p models.  For a long time the specs of the Samsung had me leaning that way.  However, after seeing one in person I was not that impressed, it looked cheap.  Panasonic also has a much better track record for reliability when it comes to Plasmas (they are rated for 100,000 hours vs. 50,000 - 60,000 hours of other manufactures).  No knock on Samsung they make great LCDs check out there 71 or 81 series.The 3 current Panasonic models are the PZ77U, PZ700U, PZ750U.  The 3 models can all be purchased within about $250 of each other (MSRP range from $2800 to $3500).  The 77U and 700U are almost identical with the exception that the PZ77U has an anti-glare screen and the PZ700U has a slightly upgraded speakers package (who buys a 50" plasma for speakers anyway?).  The 750U adds to the 700U a third HDMI input and more picture settings (I was going to go with this model but the HDMI input is right in the middle front of the TV?).  Panasonic has a very highly rated anti-glare screen, not to be confused with anti-glare coating found on the 700U and 750U; they are not the same thing.  I went with this model because the anti-glare screen actually increases the contrast.  So far I have had it for 3 months and been extremely happy with my purchase from 6ave.
