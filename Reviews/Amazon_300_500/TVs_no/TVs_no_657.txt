This isn't going to be a full videophile review; only a word of caution.  After purchasing this TV, on the second day, the menu would pop up and try to change to component or another mode (like store demo mode) or it would change the viewing settings from "normal" to the "spanish soap opera" looking one while we were watching TV.The bottom right of the screen has a red light that indicates that the remote is being used and it was constantly flashing during the times it was acting possessed or someone was inadvertently sitting on the remote.  After taking out the batteries on the remote, it continued.  In fact, it got so bad that we couldn't do anything with the TV, we couldn't even turn it off- we had to unplug it for a bit.  Then it would be ok for a short while.After calling Samsung, they directed us to a local TV repair place.  We described the problem and they contacted Samsung.  The TV repair place didn't even bother coming out, they wanted to order the part that was necessary to fix it.Because of this issue and the flashlighting in the corners of the screen, we decided to return it.  I honestly didn't want a TV that had to be worked on after the second day.  The TV repair place was really pressing us to get it fixed, but Amazon said they would not take it back if it had any work done on it.  So we returned it as is.We have been waiting for the refund to get the UN46C8000, and I started looking at the reviews and the comments for that one.  Apparently, others have been having this problem with the other model as well!So just be careful.  I don't know how well it works after being fixed, but it appears to be a very common problem with this years models.
