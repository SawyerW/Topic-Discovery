I was one of the "holdouts", I didn't believe the FCC was serious this time about the DTV changeover and I waited till the last day and then some. I called them up and ordered a converter box, which was a piece of s***. It broke with 2 weeks of me owning it, trust me they are not worth your time.So I was without TV for a few more weeks and then I was doing my weekly shopping trip to Target when I found this TV, went home and did a little research then went back and bought it.  What a TV for $200. It includes all your legacy connectors like BNC, composite, component, s-video and even includes (2) HDMI connectors. All the different inputs are selectable via the remote and the buttons on the side.Picture quality is excellent, not at the level of a Sony Bravia or a Samsung, the only other 2 brands of LCD TV's I would even bother with, but close Don't get me wrong, Pioneer and Sharp make excellent TV's, but with these three you get comparable quality for a lot less. This tv has 2 stereo speakers in the back, you definitely want to get external speakers or use some kind of receiver as the sound is somewhat muffled.Oh and for setup they include a giant, foldout poster but you don't even need that. Unpack it, put the stand on, plug the antenna (if you are using OTA like me) plug it into the wall and follow the prompts for language and channel scanning.As for the size I could have purchased a 32" tv for about $500, but if you are a single person like me, no kids and rarely have people over then there is no point in getting anything bigger. I have nothing to prove to people, that is what some people out there buy huge tv's for, to show off to other people. This sits right next to my bedstand, the 32" crt monster is outside hooked up to the Xbox 360.
