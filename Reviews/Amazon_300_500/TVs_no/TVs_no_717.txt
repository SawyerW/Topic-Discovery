I am really impressed with the picture quality, especially after fine tuning the picture with DisplayMate software.  The colors are very vibrant and the blacks very deep.  (You really shouldn't rely on the preset settings for your TV; DisplayMate will help make sure the settings are appropriate for your lighting.)I decided to go with plasma and compared the LG with Panasonic and Samsung.  I ended up going with the LG primarily because it was the only one that properly handles 1080p/24 sources, such as bluray players; some of Panasonic's 3D televisions do, but at nearly twice the price.  The LG was also less expensive (OneCall had the lowest price and were great to do business with.)The main drawbacks with this model are excessive power consumption (compared to LCDs) and the weight; it comes in at a whopping 120 lbs -- definitely needed to call for backup when I set it up because it is much too heavy for one person.The other problem is that the display developed a 2-1/2 inch solid black line from top to bottom on the left edge.  I guess this isn't particularly uncommon for flat screens, but it was still annoying to have to call LG within a month of using the TV.  To LG's credit, they quickly arranged tech support and the TV repaired.  I understand this is fairly complex technology, so I'll judge a company on their customer service.  LG was very easy to deal with.  I still feel a need to knock the overall rating down one star because it's not an inexpensive product.Before you decide on which TV to buy, whether plasma, LCD, or LED, check out sources such as cnet, Amazon customer reviews, and DisplayMate.com.  Do not rely on how the picture looks based on how BestBuy, Walmart, or any other big box store sets them up; they use settings you won't/shouldn't use at home, and you probably don't have 100 fluorescent lights overhead in your living room.
