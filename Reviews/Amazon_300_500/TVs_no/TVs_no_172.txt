I spent a fair amount of time researching the newer 32" LCD's as it's been about 2 years since I purchased my last one (a 30" Olevia from Amazon).  I am totally satisfied with the Samsung purchase, Amazon, and even EGL.  There seems to be issues reported by several customers with EGL,  but having had previous experience with them on a few other orders, I was aware of how they do business.  Basically to get your TV as quickly as possible, track your package on-line, and once you see it hit your local EGL depot, give them a call to set up a delivery date.  If you wait for them to call, it could add several days.  They were very helpful, and delivered the TV on the day and timeframe I gave to them.  What more can you ask for.  It's not UPS .... but what do you expect for free!!!Back to the TV.  The only shortcoming of this set is only having one YPbPr port, but I knew this ahead of time, so I went out and bought a newHDMI DVD player .... I needed a new one anyway!  Now the YPbPr port is free for XBox 360.  Having 2 HDMI's is very nice.  This is the interface of the future.  The TV also has  Optical Audio Out, which is a very nice feature as I have this hooked to my 5.1 Receiver making the sound much better than the built in speakers.  The built-ins are not bad, but you cannot compare them to a set of Bose speakers and sub-woofer.  Almost forgot,  not only does this TV look awesome when it's turned on ... but it has a very classy and elegant piano black finish, that you don't want to hide.  The Armoire doors stay open!!!  One other little strange quirk with this Samsung TV.... it takes about 5-6 seconds to turn on.  In fact, when I first powered it on,  I got nervous because I'm, used to a 2-3 second turn on time from my other TV, and thought it was DOA .... just made my heart skip a beat or two.  Once you get used to it ... it's no big deal.
