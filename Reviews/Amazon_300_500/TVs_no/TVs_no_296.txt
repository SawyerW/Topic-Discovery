I spent 6 months online and in stores researching LCD TV's.  I read reviews on every imaginable website.  I even looked at the TV manual on Sony's website, just to see what features it had before I bought it!  If you're going to spend this amount of money you want the best.  This TV is the best.  I ordered it from Amazon because the price was good and I saved around $300 in sales tax.  I figured I could easily spend that money on an upconvert DVD player, which you MUST have to view regular DVD's on this TV (with any kind of quality), and HDMI cables.  I also bought the Sony upconvert DVD player from Amazon.  I have a few tips however to get the best bang for your buck...First tip:  Follow the shipping.  Amazon emails you a tracking # which you can then plug into Eagle Freight's web site to track your package.  Once it gets to your state, call them and arrange for delivery.  Don't wait for them to call you!  When it reaches your state another delivery company may be subcontracted to deliver.  That's where your proactiveness comes in.  By being proactive (and very anxious to receive my new TV), the TV was delivered 3 days early!  The guys came in unpacked it and let me plug it in to make sure it worked.  I had them leave the box, just in case.Second tip:  Google "XBR4 calibration".  You'll find a web-site called AVS.  There is a forum on which a bunch of techno geeks discuss how they adjusted this TV.  You can then print off settings and see what's best for you.  The manual for this TV is not comprehensive enough and doesn't explain well what all the settings do.  This website discusses it at length and then some.Third tip:  Direct TV offers the best HD package.  They have over 100 channels.  Standard TV looks OK, but HD is like looking out a window.  So clear...Where ever you buy this TV, you won't be disappointed.  Sony is a leader in electronics, and you get what you pay for.
