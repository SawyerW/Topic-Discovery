Writing this to help save some the grief that I went through replacing my old TV unit, which was a 51" Sony rear projection. That tv lasted 8years with fairly heavy use. We decided to downgrade to a 40" range model and I throroughly researched brands on consumer reports.com. I opted initially for the 40" Samsung LED/1080p/120HZ. Upon setup noted that the picture was sticking (macro blocking) when watching HD quality signal with UVERSE. Other than this issue I found the picture to be crisp and the color very good. Decided to take it back and wound up getting the 42" LG 1080p/120HZ. After turning this TV on, the picture just doesn't compare with Sony or Samsung - skin tones were terrible and the brightness and contrast levels just couldn't get dialed in for my taste; SD video was also grainy. Too many misses for me with LG, so I am taking back. Decided to try this Sony model. I was against it because for the same price you can get 120HZ from other brands (noted above) which is supposed to ensure smoother picture when watching sports or movies with a lot of action scenes. Out of the box I'd say this TV was as good or better than the Samsung LED. I will say that I can see just a slight and occasional delay in the picture when watching a game but otherwise it's a really great picture. Moral of the story - Sony makes great electronics products that are high quality and last long enough to provide good value. I wouldn't waste my time with another brand of tv. You won't be disappointed with this tv. If you are concerned about it being 60hz vs 120, the next step up is only about $100 or so more at wal mart ($693 as of November 2011).
