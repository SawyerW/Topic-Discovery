I purchased the 55 in LED from 6ave electronics and when I received it the large remote did not work. I called 6ave, they told me to go through Samsung since it was new and under warranty. I called Samsung and the CS Rep tried to charge me for a remote! I explained it was a new TV, and she said OK they could send a remote it would be about 5 business days. After 5 days, no remote so I called Samsung back to get the status. Well, guess what, no order for a remote was ever put in the system but the fact I called about a broken remote was in the system. They said they would create a new order and it would take about 7-14 days from now to get the remote. I asked them to send it express mail, since the TV can't be fully utilized without the large remote and I have already had the TV well over 2 weeks and it is almost useless without the remote. They refused to send it xpress mail, they all gave the same scripted phrase: "it is Samsung policy to send it UPS ground" I asked them, it is also Samsung policy to send defective remotes and not put in a replacement order? This is not standard procedure, Samsung sold me a defective product then failed to send a replacement. They acknowledge their mistake but do nothing to rectify it. I also purchased the additional 4 year warranty, I can not even imagine the horror I will have to go through if anything happens with the TV.I spoke to at least 5 people in customer service, including the "ECR" department. The ECR department is supposedly for situations that have "escalated". They were not only no help but outright RUDE!! I asked to speak to the ECR supervisor and she would not even get on the phone with me. The ECR Customer service rep would not even give me the Supervisors name, they will call me back they said. Needless to say, I am not holding my breath for the call. If you like being ignored and treated rudely then by all means get a Samsung. If not, look somewhere else....
