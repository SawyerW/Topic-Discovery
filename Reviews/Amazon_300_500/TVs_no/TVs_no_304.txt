Overall, this TV is great; offering 3 HDMI ports, a RGB VHS port, 2 component video ports, etc., it's clearly not lacking.I'll only delve into what I *don't* like about this TV.1) Aside from a component and S-VHS port on the side of the TV, everything's on the back.  If you are using the TV on a table, this wouldn't be a problem.  But if you want to wall-mount, if say your buddy brings over his XBOX360, unless it is one that supports HDMI (and you have an HDMI cable into say your DVD player), you'd have to unmount the TV, hook up an HDMI cable, re-mount the TV.  Is it the end of the world?  No, but it is a definite pain.  Especially considering there are other TV's which have the hook-ups on the side (likely for this very reason).2) In certain cases (very dark scenes), the TV has almost a 'milky' looking background.  It's hard to describe, and I likely wouldn't have even noticed it, until I saw a review on another forum complaining about this.  Is it an actual defect?  I don't know -- I haven't contacted LG (yet), as it rarely exhibits itself, but when it does, it is annoying.3) As noted above, it has 3 HDMI ports.  UNFORTUNATELY, if you want to use a Harmony remote, you can only program it to 'directly' connect to HDMI1 or HDMI2, NOT HDMI3.  I've attempted to work-around this, but have had only limited success.  (I could alternatively program the remote to navigate input selection differently, but that would result in increased time to switch to a port.)Those are really the only two *bad* things I have to say about this TV.  Otherwise, it's great.  Note that I'm not an expert by any means, and clearly the source used to feed it can also have a direct impact (I use a PS3 for Blu-Ray, HD-A2 for HD-DVD, a NAD T-534 for SD-DVD, and Comcast HD Digital Cable).
