I just purchased the 92U after a lengthy comparison with other sets, such as the Sony KDS55A2000, and am very pleased.I am feeding the 92U from my Verizon FiOS set top box (which presently has 21 HD channels available) and from my  Toshiba Upconverting DVD player. The picture from the FiOS HD channels is outstanding. Jump-out-at-you images with rich color and no banding. From the DVD, its still quite good due the upconverting to 1080i.  Of course, until I buy a Blue-Ray or HD DVD and associated disks, I won't be able to see true 1080p.One of the customer reviewers here (Araki on 4/5/07) deplored the sound from the TV speakers. He said that "this may not be an issue if not an audiophile" to which I say that this is not an issue if you ARE an audiophile because no audiophile listens to TV speaker sound.  All TV's use small cheap speakers, knowing that  audiophiles or home theater movie buffs will have separate reciever/multiple speaker setups. In my case, I'm running the audio through a Sony STR-DG510 receiver into a Cambridge Ensemble 208 system (two speakers + a subwolfer).The product discription here of the LC52D92U is very sparse and confused.  The 92U is an upgrade of the 62U and just came out in Jan 2007, so First Date Available at Amazon couldn't have been April 2005.  Also, none of the notable upgrade features are even mentioned!!  Its the first LCD HDTV with a 120 HZ refresh rate (other sets are 60 or 75 HZ) so that pixel artifacts seem to have finally been eliminated from fast action scenes.  At least I haven't noticed any so far. Also with this model, Sharp has greatly improved on the viewing angle and the black color rendition -  you can see this at any store when you view the 92U in comparison to the earlier 62U or any other LCD set. I suggest going to the Sharp site to read a much more comprehensive product description.All in all, IMO this is the best LCD HDTV on the market at the present time.
