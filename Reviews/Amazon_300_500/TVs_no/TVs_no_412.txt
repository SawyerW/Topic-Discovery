I picked up this tv feb. 5 2010 and all I can say is what a great tv. Had it set up and working in 15 min. Regular cable is so so but thats not the tv's fault. I got the HD box and service from comcast and wow, what a picture. Supurb picture with a sony 1080p upscaling dvd player. Super picture also with the computer. Have a dual output graphics card with dvi output. I adapted the dvi to an hdmi cable and now have the most awesome 52 inch monitor.****************INSTALLATION NOTE: When connecting your computer you MUST use input 6, hdmi or pc cables.YOU MUST HAVE AN AUDIO INPUT TO GO WITH THE VIDEO INPUT EVEN WITH A HDMI CABLE. There is a 1/8" diameter audio input jack in between the computer video inputs on the back of the tv and thats what I am using. The tv will not recognize the computer without video AND audio input together it will give you an "incompatible audio input error" message. It took me a bit to figure this out. Lets see. The tv only has 20 watts speaker output so the sound is only fair. I have the tv volume off and am running the audio out from th tv to a home theater reciever which sounds great. I love this tv lets see how long it lasts. Register online with sharp and the will increase the warranty. by 3 months. I think I will still purchase an SquareTrade 3-Year Electronics Warranty.Updated Nov. 19 2010: Still working great have added a Panasonic Blu-Ray player last weekend.(See my Blu-Ray reveiw) Just a superb picture with the Blu-Ray. I did run into a problem updating the firmware via the usb port. It keeps telling me its the wrong update file, bust Sharps website insists it the correct file. I will have to talk to cusomer service. If anyone else has this problem please post a solution.
