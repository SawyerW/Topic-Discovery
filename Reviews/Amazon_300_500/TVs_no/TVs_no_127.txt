I bought this TV in 2006. Shortly after I experienced a "diffusion problem" aka "blue sparkles". I had it serviced under warranty and tech replaced the entire panel. I wish they would have given me a different TV though. This did remedy the first problem.The TV had a great picture. It died in 2010 outside of the extended warranty. It developed these massive pixelated lines across all sources and channels. The lines made the TV unusable.Upon researching the problem, the solution is most likely a panel replacement. I'm unsure if you can even do that now since the TV is so old. When I had the first panel replaced it was $1000 which Samsung paid for (warranty).I gave the TV away for 100 bucks.PROS: TV displays 1080i which is rare for a "720p" set. I bought this when 1080p was very new and nothing was using it. We are still unfortunately far away from full use of 1080p (over the air, tv etc). The glossy black border was a nice touch. No swivel stand but this wasn't typical for Plasmas in 2006.CONS: Screen is INCREDIBLY reflective. Light bounces off like a window. I have a new plasma which has a coating that reduces glare. It's night and day to this set.BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. The Plasma is VERY loud. You have to turn the volume up significantly to overcome it. My 50 inch is quieter. This must have come with technology advancements. This sucker is heavy and must weigh 100 lbs. My 50 inch plasma is actually lighter.. The TV also gets very hot. Much hotter then my 50 inch.This TV was marred with problems. Google and you will find. Most common now is people find that it shuts off and won't turn back on.I stuck with Samsung for my replacement TV for the living room and bedroom. I hope this was just a one off thing for them and the others will last much longer. I was close to dumping them but Sony burned me harder with product failures so I avoided them.DON'T buy this TV used. It's a ticking timebomb.
