Well after my 3 year old decided to take a wrench to my Samsung 51" active 3D plasma I was in the market for a new TV.....After looking at a lot of different sets I finally settled on this Toshiba and let me say I'm glad I did!Pros:The 2D picture is amazing colors look crisp and blacks are dark.The 3D picture is much better then expected(more on this below)The apps on it are useful and I like the netflix button on the remote makes it very quick to get to. The youtube app also works great.Very thin would look great on a wallPlenty of connections with 4 HDMI and the L shape that they are arranged in makes hook up easy.I had the entire thing unboxed and adjusted in about 45minBeing able to convert 3D>2D is great! Especially if you have children.Cons:It does take about 30 sec to turn on not a huge deal to me but may be to some.The remote is a bit cramped and some buttons are hard to read.The sound is standard LED/LCD sound IE bad but I use an external receiver/speakers.Navigating the nettv menu is a bit slowNow as a person who had an active shutter plasma for a year then switching to this I can say with out a shadow of a doubt go with the Passive 3D. I had read quite a bit about losing resolution on passive sets vs active but I honestly couldn't tell a difference. We sit about 8 ft away and the picture looked sharp and I could only see the interlaced lines if I walked up to the set. The biggest difference between the 2? You could actually sit comfortably and watch the passive set with no issues of ghosting, the room being too bright, losing sync with glasses(this was really annoying), no headaches, didn't have to be right in front of the set, no batteries to worry about, and my daughter could actually watch Tangled in 3D with out me worrying about her breaking 100 dollar glasses. Another note on headaches, my wife couldn't watch the active set for more then 30 minutes before experiencing a headache but with this she watched it for 2 hours last night with out an issue(not even eye strain).In conclusion if your looking to jump into the 3D world of entertainment this is a great starting point for a TV that will give you a amazing 2D and 3D experience. Even if you decide this set isn't for you I implore you to go with passive over active 3D especially if you have a family.
