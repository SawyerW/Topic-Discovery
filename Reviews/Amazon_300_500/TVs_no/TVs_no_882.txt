So far so good.  I cant even begin to say how long it took me to purchase a TV because of all the comments I was reading on this or that.  I finally just broke down and got this for one of the family rooms.  I still planned on getting a bigger and higher quality TV for my main room, so I was ok with getting the lower end model first.  The first and most important thing I'll say is that it's definitely worth the money.  The HD looks great.  I dont think I really have any bad thing to say.I was of course worried about that break in period that everyone talks about.  So, I did go ahead and let the TV run with the contrast and rest of the settings around 50 (based on some comments I saw on AVS Forum) for the first couple of weeks.  I mean, I watched what I wanted, but I did leave it running on lets say that Starz channel when I wasnt watching the TV.  I didnt leave it on games too long, and I didnt watch many channels with the black bars on it.  If I did, I hit the zoom mode on the TV to avoid it.  Of course you lose a little picture quality when you do that, but at least I was being safe for the time being.  It has this pixel shift option that you can set to work every minute or two minutes, which helps you feel secure about it.So in all, Im very statisfied.  I was going to consider getting a Panasonic for my next TV to compare, but I noticed the edging on the Samsung looks way smoother and since I didnt have any problems here, I'll be getting another.  maybe the 6500 model though.
