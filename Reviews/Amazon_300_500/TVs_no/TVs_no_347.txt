Okay, since my last TV was a 27" CRT, this set is of course amazing. But as the other reviewers here say, check it out against the competition. There is a very good review out there on the internet by a well-known consumer electronics site on the 52" version you should check out. I used their calibration for my set (the 46") and then watched a few minutes of several films --- it looked just great. I have an upconverting DVD player and it does a superb job on normal def DVDs with this set. I just set this up two days ago, so I hooked it up to basic cable service, and the standard definition quality is really quite good -- maybe better than previous generations of LCDs? (I really wouldn't know.)  There were some issues early on with this set which have been fixed with firmware upgrades. My set has version 1003.M with a date of 4/9/08. There is one newer version which I am not sure is worth bothering with right now. The manual for this TV does not describe how to check your firmware version, but what you do is find the "SW Update" submenu option, and then press Info on the remote. My only complaint of note is the surface is shiny and lighting in front of the set will reflect in the screen. Some experimentation with the Auto Motion Plus is recommended for your own taste. For watching films, I have set to Off. I'm not a gamer, but mostly watch films and TV broadcasts (including sports). I do receive several HDTV stations without a cable box, and the Indy 500 in HD looked great -- I think I had the AMP at Low, but some reviewers have recommended turning it off for sports. I thought the red bezel might put me off, but when I looked at the set in a store, I knew it wasn't an issue for me. The delivery service from Amazon was professional and the delivery person was quite careful and courteous.
