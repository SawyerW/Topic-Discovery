Ive had this TV for about 6 months and My feelings are sort of mixed about it. I got it from best buy in a package w an xbox 360 which was pretty sweet and the price was fair.PROS-Slim and sleek, looks great mounted above my fireplace. touch sensitve power and volume buttons are nice also-internet apps are really cool. i can show youtube videos to my friends without have to pull out a laptop.netflix works good also but layout for searching movies could be better-Tru motion is sort a double edged sword. Looks great with animated movies like Avatar or Toy story but not as good with fast paced action films because artifact becomes more noticable. i thought i would be good with sports but u really cant see it which was dissapointing-fair price. like i said i got a xbox 360, call of duty black ops with it for 1200CONS- Refresh rate is sort of slow. really dont get that detail that u look for in sports and movies. i have to mess with the settings so many times to make the picture were i think it should be. this can really effect video games-HDMI imports are in a weird position and can effect mounting since the tv is so thin. u cant really place it flush to the wall unless you drill holes for ur cables-But my biggest compaint is the picture quality. my 50in panasonic plasma looks much better and is way better for gaming. the trick is really messing around with the settings. i prefer vivid with slighly turning down backlight and contrast to prevent bleeding and keeping color below 75. expert settings are just a waste of time. but the problem is a movie will look good with one setting but sports look bad and vice versa. I really was disapointed with the quality with Satellite HD programming. probally because most are just 1080iOverall thou it is a nice tv for the price but the picture wil not blow u out of ur seat.
