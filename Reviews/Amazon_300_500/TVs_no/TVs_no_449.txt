After carefully scouring review upon review and then spending hours at various shops staring at the comparable 32" models from Samsung, LG, and Vizio, we decided upon the Sony. The Sony had all the right features at the right price. We've since streamed both Netflix and Hulu (have to use a PC and its VGA connection, along with a standard stereo jack - more on this in a moment), and Blu-Ray looks fantastic. Others have complained about the picture quality of this model, that it was somehow duller than others. Before I purchased this model, I compared a Samsung right next to this one in the shop. The picture was nearly identical. Each had its own unique saturation levels (adjustable on the Sony), and I would have been satisfied with the picture quality of either. The Sony won because of the red accents on the Samsung, which would have driven me up the wall. Not to mention it was cheaper.The only thing I could complain about with this TV is the sound quality. The speakers produce quite a bit of high end and low end, without much in the middle. Of course, once it's hooked through our stereo system, that problem goes away, but for everyday TV watching, the sound is not as good as the last CRT flat panel we had. Further, streaming Hulu or Netflix sounds especially muddy with low end extremes and not much in the middle. Even after adjustments. Anyway, best to hook this puppy through a surround system.I gave it mediocre marks for channel surfing (which frankly I don't do too much) because it is slow to change channels.Overall I am very satisfied with this TV. I would recommend this to anyone purchasing their first high def set. It's a good bargain with fantastic picture quality and plenty of new fangled and old school hook ups. It does everything we expected and wanted it to do, plus a bit extra.
