Purchased this unit in spite of Bob Gilbert's asinine "review"Pros:- VERY slim- Unbelievably light for a 47" TV- Easy to wall-mount- Fantastic picture quality- 120Hz refresh makes shows and movies come alive, it really does feel like you're watching it in the studio live- 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio (i know, they kind of make up their own ways to measure that, but this TV has unparalleled color vibrance and good deep smooth blacks)- Aesthetically pleasing- Speakers are well above-par if you turn on the virtual surround in the menus. Still not comparable to a real surround sound system, but they are some of the best integrated speakers I have ever heard- PRICE, oh god the price, it's incredible, I feel like I'm getting away with something naughty at this priceCons:- There is a bit of a delay from input device to screen output (about 1/2 of a second), so games kind of suck on this. I was really unable to play my xbox on this due to the lag  HOWEVER, this does not detract from the overall quality of the unit, for TV and movies, this thing is beyond incredible- It would be nice if the capacitive buttons on it had a dim glow or something, I have to put my face about 3" away from them to see which is which and where to press- It would also be nice if the buttons had some kind of tactile bump or something so you know when your finger is on it.. if it's dark in the room, it's impossible to use the buttons without a flashlight. Usually I use the remote though, so it's really not a deal breaker or anythingOther notes:- I would recommend finding HDMI cables with very flat/slim connectors, as there is not much clearance back there where you plug them in. My "normal" HDMI cables had to have their connector kind of wiggled in there for them to plug in all the way, as the connector will press up against the back of the TV. Not really a CON, just something to be aware of- If you wall mount this, you will either need longer VESA screws, or a mounting bracket that has recessed screw holes, as the mounting holes on the back of this are recessed, and the included screws will not be long enough for most standard VESA mounting kits with flat brackets.Overall:TV and Movies: Buy this NOWVideo games: Would not recommend for gaming, too much processing lag between signal and output
