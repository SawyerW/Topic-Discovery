I bought this TV in Aug 2010 starting developing a 5-6" thick horizontal pinkish magenta line in November and by end of November it was completely destructive to picture quality if anything light colored was present on the majority of screen, forget winter sports... I contacted Samsung who condemned the screen over the phone and promptly (2 weeks prompt) sent a technician over from 2 hours away at the only Samsung authorized service call facility in the pacific NW. Technician showed up late in the afternoon and promptly blamed this problem on me because I had image retention at periphery of my screen where icons and toolbar were. I use this TV as a HTPC second plasma old plasma never had a problem that it replaced for over 5 years and that TV explicitly stated not for HTPC usage. This one was touted as specifically for this type of usage. He denied the installation of the screen he had with him due to "abuse" clause" Anyway Long story short 10 phone calls to Samsung, I fought with Samsung, got case escalated and at that point I was denied warrant-ability yet again. Unknown to me at this point I gave up, went to a local TV repair shop who apparently was Samsung authorized and replaced a couple driver boards in TV, which did not fix TV. In the interim Samsung closed there account immediately because they gave them 3 months notice they were going to no longer perform TV repair. Samsung would have none of that and closed their parts account "immediately" and they were unable to take in TV for warranty followup. Just know that Samsung is the worst tech company I have "ever" dealt with when it comes to warranty or customer service, and if you need it, you may as well just go buy a new TV. Its a shame they have some good products, but you should go into it buying "as is" because that is how Samsung will treat it ultimately.
