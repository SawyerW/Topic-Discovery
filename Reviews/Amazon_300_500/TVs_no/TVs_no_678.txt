This is a beautiful TV. I'm one of the few that likes the bezel; it fits well with my decor (that ugly stand, however, is another story). The TV is razor thin and has a robust feature set that sets it apart from most other TVs on the market and makes it a great value.I'm a Sony guy, but I can't deny that the picture quality is about the best I have seen in a TV, black levels almost equal to a Kuro, and PQ easily on par with the Sony H909. There are enough customization options to get the absolute picture for whatever room and whatever ambient lighting you have in your den.However, none of this matters if the TV just doesnt work.I received this TV damaged, with a bent panel that destroyed the intelligent backlighting feature. I dealt with it for a while until customer service could manage to get someone here to fix it by installing a new panel. After it was fixed, the TV truly shined, looking just fantastic for about 2 weeks.Then, all my HDMI inputs just stopped working; I guess my input board is faulty. As I use this TV primarily as a monitor for my HTPC (all TV runs through this) along with my game systems, this latest defect has rendered the TV pretty useless. I am currently waiting for someone to come fix this problem, after a painful ordeal with the absolutely clueless, ignorant customer service representatives. I mean, this lady didn't know what a home theater PC was, and told me, "you're not supposed to connect a computer to a receiver." I just hung up on that moron. It pains me to have to give this thing a bad review, but as I sit here staring at the "No Input" message I just regret buying this damn thing. Should've gone with a Sony or a Panasonic. I'm an N=1, sure, but I've yet to have one of the many Sony TV's I've purchased fail me even once, but this, top-of-the-line Samsung has already failed me twice. I shudder to think what I'm gonna have to go through when this thing fails  me after the warranty is up.
