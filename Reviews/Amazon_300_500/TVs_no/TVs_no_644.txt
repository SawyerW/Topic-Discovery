Although this set (UN46C6400RFXZA) has phenomenal picture quality under pristine daytime conditions, unfortunately it's accompanied by serious faults... And for the price, these faults are entirely unacceptable.I've gone through 3 of these sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) in an attempt to remedy the following 6 faults. I've finally given up and requested a Samsung Field Rep come to view the set.1.) Unacceptable random LED light leakage; bleed through in all corners as well as across the screen when viewed in low light situations (similar to a theater setting). The resulting BLACK colors/shades/gradients appear similar to a nighttime overcast sky (cloudy skies reflecting a city's lights), an affect resulting in picture gradient inaccuracy, inconstancy.The only way to overcome this issue is to fill the viewing room and maintain with (simulated) daytime lighting (i.e., Costco Warehouse).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.2.) Samsung AutoMotion Plus results in randomly generated dropped frames and shutter with ALL inputs (OTA, Samsung Blue-ray 5500c, Wii, Dish Network ViP722k) with the exception of streaming content.This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.NOTE: All devices are connected with Samsung high-speed HDMi cables with the exception of OTA (Over The Air) using coax and the Wii utilizing component connections (480).In a CNET post found yesterday (dated 5/9/10) Samsung officially recommends turning OFF the AutoMotion Plus feature - But by doing so one degrades the picture quality you've paid a premium for.Q: Why does Samsung feature AutoMotion Plus in the first place if it doesn't work, even when used in conjunction with its own 5500c Blu-ray player?!!.[...]3.) The set's (UN46C6400RFXZA) OS (Operating System) is seemingly buggy, resulting in random freeze-ups requiring occasional hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.4.) The Netflix application occasionally freezes up rendering the set completely unusable requiring a hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.5.) Internet@TV and its applications are buggy resulting in crashes that freeze up the set (UN46C6400RFXZA). These random freeze-ups require hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.6.) Netflix streaming in approximately 40% of its use appears to have difficulty maintaining a consistent stream when viewed through the set (UN46C6400RFXZA) vs the Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player. The Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player has double the memory for cache, an entirely different OS, entirely different major (widget) applications than its LED LCD (UN46C6400RFXZA) counterpart - The Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player appears to maintain a much more reliable and stable streaming platform than the set (UN46C6400RFXZA).ALL 3 SETS WERE PURCHASED FROM THE SAME COSTCO - THE LAST WAS PURCHASED 7/9/10.
