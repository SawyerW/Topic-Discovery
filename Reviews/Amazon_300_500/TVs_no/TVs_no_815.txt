I have friends who had recommended Vizio since I was looking for a decent TV for a decent price. As much as I like Samsung, their TV's are costly and for me at this time it didn't make sense. Now I will say I do have an issue with Samsung's marketing scheme where they list the CMR Rates of 120Hz, but in reality the real refresh is 60Hz. I also found I don't like the lower levels of the CMR ratings as it makes the TV look glitchy, blurry, and un-natural. That being said:The Vizio 42" Smart TV has a crisp display, great colors from factory (minor tuning has been done so far since I have had it and I can post settings, but I just keep ending up back near default with everything I try and put against my 23" Asus monitor.)The Full-Array LED works beautifully as unlike edge lit LED's doesn't blur/blend the whites with the blacks, of which, this TV has amazing black quality from my experience thus far! The screen is more than bright enough for the day and by setting up another setting is more than dimmable enough for extreme night viewing. I have no complaints on the display other than wishing that my HD cable provider and the channels would also be upgraded from 480p for certain channels as it looks bad after watching 1080 on others.The sound is great! Not perfect, but plenty loud in the smaller room I have it in, the 10W downward facing speakers put out amazing sound for the size and price! Completely satisfied here as there are no rattles, pitches, whines etc!Start up time is great: Only takes 10 seconds from the time you push the remote till the screen is ready.\Smart apps work well from how much I have tested and used them, Youtube works better than I expected it too. App start up time is decent, not long, nor instantly fast.
