I bought this TV after hours of searching and reading. Let me say first off that the brightness in the corners that there are so many comments about didn't bother me at all. They are there when the screen goes black but they are easily ignored and did get less when I updated system software from Samsung.Pros: Best picture ever. the resolution , clarity, etc is absolutely phenominal, the controls are numerous, the TV is incredible. Especially on non-HD shows. you feel like you are watching HD even when you are only watching 480i TV. Don't put much value on the content features such as internet, yahoo widgets etc. there are too many other ways to do these types of things and do them better that I put no value on these at all. I could not get streaming tv or movies of any kind. I didn't list those last 2 things as cons because in my mind no other TV can do them either so do them other ways instead.Cons: the resolution and clarity is so profound that some shows look unreal. It is almost a 3D effect. It is not 3D but there is something about it. I could not get used to it and decided i didn't like it. Funny, that sounds like too good is not good, but if your used to how a show looks then when it looks really different it is wierd.The only other con I had trouble with is the color. It seemed too inconsistant. The movie wouldn't have enough color so i turn it up a littel then the commercials would have way too much color. Even from station to station I would have to adjust the color. These kinds of things are easy to get used to and easy to find settings that help but never the less it is a con in my mind.But overall Samsung is definetly on the right track with this TV. Best I have ever owned - ever.
