I originally bought this TV on the strength of reviews from CNET/Amazon/CR etc.My local box store had it for around 1000$ CAD, which at the time was a good deal. Current models are cheaper.I used the cable in/2 HDMI/component and occasionally the video in. I would be considered a power user and have never felt limited by my connectivity options. The picture quality is good, but not amazing considering this is an entry level TV.My issues with this TV began just before the warranty expired. I lost one of the backlights and the picture began flickering at higher brightness settings. I called Samsung and my TV was taken away for repair. When it was returned, it was DOA- no picture at all. When it was returned a second time (after another week or so), it seemed to work fine.Fast forward 7 months later and it has started flickering again. When the backlight is turned down (making it almost unwatchable in a bright room), the picture will not flicker. Anytime the backlight is turned up to more than 2 out of 10, the picture disappears and blacks out for a minute or so. The picture will come back for a few seconds then black out again.Samsung has told me the warranty is done and I am out of luck.My 1000$ TV is now a large paperweight and will be going to landfill. If I have to replace the power supply every few months, then I am not taking another chance that getting it repaired with money out of my own pocket will help.As a culture we are beginning to accept crappy quality control and poor manufacturing standards in order to enjoy low prices. It is wasteful and wrong on many levels. How long will your Samsung TV last? Are you willing to roll the dice? I hope you have better luck than I...
