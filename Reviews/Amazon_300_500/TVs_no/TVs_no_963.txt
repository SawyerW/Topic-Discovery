Bought it December of 2011 and by then the "fluctuating brightness" issue mentioned so often here had indeed been remedied by Panasonic.A little tip from me to you if using with a home theater sound system and speakers (I use it with an Onkyo TX-SR308 purchased in 2011):Connect the HDMI cable for the TV into HDMI 1 on the TV (it's the only one that uses Audio Return Channel ["ARC"]), and then connect the other end into the appropriate HDMI port on the receiver.Then connect all the OTHER HDMI cables NOT into the receiver (as you may have done in the past), but into the HDMI ports behind the TV instead (the sound will run back to your receiver through the ARC feature in the first cable whether for broadcast, DVD player, Apple TV, Roku, or whatever, so only the HDMI cable  from the TV itself needs to plug into the receiver, not the other HDMI cables (they go into the TV).This is the only way I could get all the things to turn off AND on using the TV's remote (there are lots of people having this issue, I learned on the Net, of being able to turn everything on with the TV remote but not off [or vice versa, I can't remember for sure now]).  This fixes that issue.Also make sure you set the sound to HOME THEATER rather than to the TV speakers.TO CHANGE SOUND FROM TV SPEAKERS TO HOME THEATER:1.  On the TV remote press the MENU button.2.  Scroll to VIERA LINK and press the OK button.3.  Scroll down to SPEAKER OUTPUT and select HOME THEATER.4.  Scroll down and click BACK TO TV.If no sound check your MUTE buttons on both your TV and your receiver remotes, then play with the volume.  If neither of those fix it, putter around some with the menus, but this is what did it on mine.All this stuff should be fairly easy to figure out if you explore the setup menus and change things one by one, but I had assumed the HDMI cables would all go through the home receiver, and that doesn't work.  Instead everything should be plugged between the TV and the particular component, and the TV should be the only HDMI cable connected directly between the TV and the receiver (and then only on HDMI 1 on the TV side of things since it's the only one with the Audio Return Channel or ARC).
