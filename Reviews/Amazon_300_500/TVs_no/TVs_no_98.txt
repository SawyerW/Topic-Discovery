I was pretty lucky to catch this deal during a brief period that it was listed for $699 (brand-new from Amazon)with free shipping. There was also a rebate for the Mustang tilt wall-mount ($89.99). I don't have an HD tuner yet (probably upgrade my Comcast soon) but with regular SD (using S-video) the picture is fine. DVD's are excellent, crystal-clear picture and like the other reviews state, the audio isn't good. I have this hooked up to a surround-sound system - definately the way to go. The speaker are in the back and can sound muffled if it's too far away. The shipping company Amazon uses(Eagle)is... fair. I checked the tracking information every day to see how it was coming along, it arrived in Atlanta (where I live) and sat for 2 days before I decided to call and find out why it was just sitting there. They told me I needed to set up an appointment to have it delivered. I made an appointment for the next day between 8-noon. At 12:30, no one had arrived so I called. I was told the driver was running a little late and would be there within an hour. At 4:30, still no-show. I called back and got dispatch. It turns out the driver was told to put me off and make another delivery 3 hours away because the customer wouldn't be home after 3pm. It was finally delivered at 7:30pm. The delivery guy was very nice and I could tell it had been a long day for him. So, bottom line; I paid $699 for the set with free shipping, no taxes and a free wall-mount. I also had to spend a day waiting for it along with time and effort to get it delivered at all. Not a bad deal in the end.
