I am updating my intial review below for my Vizio tv.  It seems I was not able to use the apps due to speed of internet connection.  I raised my speed and now the apps that I have tested do work with no problems.  Netflix and You Tube both loaded and ran with no issues.  The sound is good and it looks slim and sleek. I will be contacting my satellite provider to come out to check the cables and see if I can get a better picture since I do not have an HD receiver and programming.  However, since the local channels do air in HD, I should be able to have a better picture than I do. I'm sure when viewing DVD's on a blue ray player, the picture will be fantastic. I don't want to knock Vizio, as my daughter has had one for about 5 years now with no issues. I still think that Vizio offers a great product for the money.  I also must say that delivery was made sooner than I expected to receive it, so very happy with shipping/receiving experience as well. Amazon is a great place to shop!Initial Review - I just installed my new Vizio tv yesterday.  To my dismay, since I don't have an HD receiver, I will now have to obtain one, as the picture is not that great without it.  What really upsets me though, is the fact that the Apps do not work.  It recognized my wireless router, however, the Apps that I have tried are not working. Netflix takes a bit to load, then it takes a bit to be able to pick a movie.  When I tried playing a few movies, none of them would actually play.  It just kept buffering and then just froze.  Each time, I would get a message saying it appears that movie is not working correctly and I should try selecting another.  After three movies, I quit.  My tablet will play the movies, but not this Vizio.  If I can't get it to work, I will have no choice but to return it.  I was so happy to finally get my big screen smart tv..... but now, very, very, disappointed.
