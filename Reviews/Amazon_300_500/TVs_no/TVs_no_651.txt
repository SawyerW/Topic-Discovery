I'm absolutely blown away by my new TV.  I already have a plasma Samsung in the living room but I after giving away my very old (ancient really) box tv that was in the bedroom I decided to research which would be the best tv for me.  Now I wanted a tv that had internet applications so after checking out the Google TV, the LG and the Vizio, I settled on the Samsung 6500 led.  I wanted a tv that had internet capabilities and this tv goes from tv to internet with ease also the clarity is great, even when I'm watching youtube videos.  I wish I would've known prior to buying that I need a lan adapter.  When I read the product description, it had said internet ready and I thought that meant everything was included and internet ready out of the box.  It wasn't a big problem since it's about $52 for a lan adapter at amazon.  I would've bought it together had I known.  I actually didn't get an LG TV because one of the reviews said I would have to purchase something extra for $150 so I could use the internet on the tv and if I'm spending hundreds of dollars already I didn't want to spend and extra hundred so it could do what it's suppose to do in the first place.  The clarity of the Samsung is amazing.  I like the eco friendly options and the upgrades that you can download online for the tv.  The volume is great as well and the TV is so light.  Keep in mind I went without a tv in my bedroom for 5 months because I wanted to make sure I got the right one for me.  I had gone to Best buy and electronic expo, target and even walmart to see the differences between the clarities of the tv's and the Samsung to me is still the best brand for clarity.Even though I had to buy the adapter for my TV, it was well worth it because it wasn't as expensive and I got exactly what I wanted.
