I did a lot of research before making my decision to go with the Samsung 50" Plasma tv model 5053. I was very nervous about this so called buzzing noise, but I took a chance anyway. I purchased the tv from Circuit City because they had the best deal at the time. Yes, right out the box when I first powered the tv up, there was a very loud and annoying buzzing sound. I was sitting about 11 feet away from the tv and the noise was very audible when watching a quiet scene in a movie. My heart was crushed, because the picture on this tv is UNBELIEVEABLE!!! I hooked up a Sony HDMI upconvert dvd player and the picture quality on a movie is just to die for. I called Samsung to complain about the buzzing sound and a technician came to look into the problem. I'm very happy to say that Samsung has finally seemed to isolate this buzzing problem with this particular 50" model. Two guys showed up and explained to me that they would be lowering the voltage on my plasma tv. They went on to assure me that this would in no way affect the performance of the tv. They unscrewed the back panel and tinkered with the motherboard to lower the voltage current in two specific areas. After that they pulled out some special adhesive strips and taped them onto certain areas of the back panel. They put it all back together and PRESTO!!!! The buzzing sound was reduced to almost nothing. It seems that they really know what they are doing now in regards to this problem. Now, I'm enjoying my tv to the fullest. I have yet to receive my Direct tv package, so I can take advantage of the HD content. You heard it from me. Samsung is GREAT! The two technicians that came over were just awesome and they seemed to know exactly what they were doing. I would say they were at my place for no more than 35 minutes. I sure hope this info helps all of you out there dealing with this buzzing sound.
