I've had my eye on this TV for about a month now. I saw it at Fry's on sale for 499 about a month ago while I was just browsing around. I was tempted to buy it, but without permission from the wife... it could've been a bad idea. Went back two days later to get it but the sale was gone and the price was back to like 799. I was so mad. Last night I went again for some other things, to my surprise they had this TV on sale again for 499! Wife was with me, we talked- we got it.This TV is all around great. We have it in the bedroom, and the thing I like best about it so far (besides the amazing value and great picture) is the intelligent sensor. It allows you to save power (and your eyes). When it's dark in the room it dims the screen to save power and not to be overkill on your eyes. AWESOME. Our plasma was so bright and a hassle to adjust settings all the time so I just dealt with the brightness. This power saving feature can be turned off, but leaving it on auto is the smart thing to do.Other than all of that, speakers have come a long way in built in LCD TV's. I'll have to say these sound about as good as my 46" Samsung in my office- which was a pricier purchase. If this is going in a living room or game room, a sound bar or full surround sound would always be better- but for basic TV watching the speakers are more than adequate.As most people will say the 120hz is iffy. At times people look to be moving faster than they should, or there are little distortions. I think it's best used on blu ray, but I generally have that turned off.If you're in the market for a TV- go to Frys ASAP and grab this for 499. The price Amazon has is fair, but Fry's price was unbeatable and I couldn't resist....
