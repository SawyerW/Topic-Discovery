This is my first HDTV, and, for the money, I'm very satisfied. I needed a TV to go with a PlayStation 3, and this Samsung's HDMI input, 720p (and 1080i) image are perfect for those needs.There are a lot of reviews about this TV, so I'll just summarize the basic points.- It's not true 16:9. You can change the picture size easily from the remote, and 16:9 channels do create a thin letterboxing effect. However, the 'wide' setting eradicates these with no discernible side effects. Plus, for HDMI input, there is a 'Just Scan' option which seems to simply display every transmitted pixel - perfect for the PS3.- Yes, the sound is not perfect. Out of the box it is pretty flat. You can easily create a custom EQ which helps a lot. The speakers are small - it's a small TV - but perfectly adequate once the EQ is adjusted to suit your requirements. The volume level is perfectly fine - in my house it is set around 15-30 out of 100. So - plenty of room for much louder volume.- Picture quality is great. There is the problem of viewing angle. The best picture is achieved when viewing fairly directly. I sit a new feet below it, and the image is a little darker. From the left and right, this is also a problem. However - the TV can be tilted backwards on the stand. The stand can also be wall mounted, and the TV tilted forwards. So there is quite a lot of flexibility. This kind of problem is normal in cheaper TVs, but it is not that significant with this TV. I have certainly seen far, far worse.- I don't have any problem with the remote button layout. It's fine.- I miss an electronic program guide in the digital transceiver. It's an unfortunate omission, but I can live without it.- Image quality is excellent.- The PS3 looks great on it, and beside it. They are a match made in heaven - shiny, black, plastic heaven.All in all, I am very satisfied.
