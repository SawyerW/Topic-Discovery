UPDATE: This is unit #4. The box appeared to be fine. I took it out to find it has a large crack in the bezel frame near the screen. I didn't even try to go any further. I am extermely frustrated with this entire process that started on 12/18. The final result is another trip to the UPS shipping facility, lost work hours, no TV for the holidays and a 4 year warranty from FairTrade that I need to cancel as Amazon does not handle that for you. What an incredible waste of time and effort. Take my experience as a worse case scenario maybe, but it could have been you. I hope you have better luck.This is first one I actually received after three attempts by Amazon to get it to me. I wanted it by Christmas, however, the first one was never delivered due to being damaged in transit, so the shipper did not attempt delivery to me (thank goodness). The second one was mis-labeled and I have no idea what happened to it. I just know I never received it. Amazon dispatched another one. The third arrived! I was all excited just to see the box. I took it out of the box, hooked it up and turned it on. The upper left side of the screen had a triangular area that was almost pure white unless the screen was completely dark. Obvious defect. So, repackaged and off to the shipper I go to return. Other than the frustration so far, Amazon has been great about keeping me informed and providing good return RMA service. I must say that the unit I saw, well if not for the flaw, would have looked good and I would have been happy with it. Waiting for the replacement unit sent 2nd day air at no charge either way. I will update when I receive the next unit.
