Pros:  - Excellent picture  - Simpler 3D glasses  - OK soundCons:  - When TV is at "centered" position on the base, the TV is at a 20 degree from the base (the centering detent is off that much in the base). Attempted to disassemble base to see what was up: 3 screws came out fine, the 4th was impossibly tight. So 2 strikes against Toshiba's quality.  - Impossibly long start-up time  - Impossibly long time to change channels  - Never have been able to connect to the internet; Here is a summary from my Toshiba Forum communication:  I have now connected TV to router with network cable; I can connect this way. To make another attempt at connecting wirelessly, I have also now done the Easy Setup using PIN, entering that PIN to my router. My router thinks I am now wirelessly connected. Would that it were so; as before, the Network Connection Test tells me that I am not connected.So I have now performed Wireless Setup:  Easy Setup using PBC  Easy Setup using PIN  Assisted Setup  Manual Setup  IP Adress Setup (Manual)  DNS Setup (Manual)When I go to Wireless Information, the Status shows connected. It also shows Authentication as WPA2-PSK and Encryption as AES (even though, in Manual Setup, it said it couldn't connect because those 2 items were incorrect).Even wired to the router, I can get Netflix, but the "Widgets" function tells me I'm not connected.Forum response was to disable all router security and try again. Didn't work.I just received a Panasonic Blu-Ray player which I was able to connect wirelessly in 5 minutes.  So, the response I get at the Forum is: "It sounds like there might a hardware problem with the wireless in your TV.I'd suggest contacting support at (800) 631-3811." We all know the nightmare that will be; they tell you to do all the things you've already done and end up being no help at all. It appears that I will be sending back this WPOS.
