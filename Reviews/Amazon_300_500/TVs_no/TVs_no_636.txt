My first impression of this television when I pulled it out of the box was that I was looking at a picture frame they must have sent me by mistake. It's tiny compared to my old 42" Visio LCD, so much so that you can hardly notice it when looking at it from the side. The exterior of the television is sleek, with an all-glass panel giving it an elegant design that will look good in any room you put it in. The controls for the television took me a little bit to find, as there are no buttons, but rather touch-sensitive areas along the bottom-right of the television.Setup of the unit was easy enough, but I highly recommend getting a wall mount for this as the base plate for me seemed slightly malformed and didn't want to fit right away. As it is, not all the screws would fit, and I ended up having to get some longer screws to finish securing it. I'm not sure if they're all like this or if it happened to be the result of storage, heat, and shipping. However you choose to set it up, it's extremely light and took very little effort to lift it onto our TV stand.The picture quality is amazing on this television. I use this screen for my xbox (games and netflix), my Blu-Ray player, and one of our computers. Even the difference in image quality between my old television at full 1080p and this one is almost unreal. There's almost no perceptible blur (you might see a little in an action sequence or two, but unlikely unless you have amazingly good eyes and visual response time), and the blacks are, well, black.My one real complaint with this television is the same one that I have with all televisions. The built in speakers just don't match the quality of the picture. Granted, you can't really expect them to, but you definitely do want to plan on using an external sound receiver if you want to really enjoy all the experience this television has to offer.
