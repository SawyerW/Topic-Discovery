IF I COULD STOMACH THIS MUCH GLARE I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A PLASMA!!I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A LCD SCREEN.FIRST, I WILL NOTE THAT I PURCHASED THE UN32C4000 LED, BUT TOOK IT BACK BECAUSE THE PICTURE WAS A BIT DISTORTED ON FAST MOVING SHOTS SUCH AS BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL. IT WAS NOTICEABLE TO THE POINT OF NAUSEA-AND YES I CALIBRATED THE HECK OUT OF MY TV BEFORE I RETURNED IT.  I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP IT!  YOU COULD ACTUALLY SIT THERE AND WATCH THE MOTION DELAY CATCH UP TO ITSELF.  I FOUND MYSELF STARING AT THE DELAY INSTEAD OF WATCHING THE ACTUAL PROGRAMMING-NOT COOL.  I KEPT IT FOR ABOUT A WEEK TO SEE IF I COULD LIVE WITH IT AND JUST COULDN'T.  DURING THIS TIME FRAME I DID MORE RESEARCH ON ALL THE SPECS(SINCE THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS WEREN'T IN YET) AND CAME ACROSS THE 5000 SERIES. I NOTICED THAT IT HAD A FEATURE CALLED LED MOTION PLUS.  I FIGURED THAT MAY HELP WITH THE ACTION DELAY. IT REALLY DOESN'T.I WILL ADMIT THAT I HAVE LIMITED ELECTRONICS KNOWLEDGE, BUT I BELIEVE THE REASON WHY THERE IS THIS DELAY IS BECAUSE SAMSUNG 32" LED'S ARE 60HZ AND NOT 120HZ?  UNFORTUNATELY SAMSUNG DOESNT MAKE 120HZ YET IN THE 32" LED.  AT LEAST I COULD NOT FIND ONE ANYWHERE, INCLUDING THEIR OWN WEBSITE!AS FAR AS THE GLARE IS CONCERNED, IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF SCREEN FILTER/SHEET YOU CAN ADD TO CUT DOWN ON THE REFLECTION, I MAY KEEP IT.  IF NOT BACK TO THE STORE WE GO...FINAL NOTE...IF YOU PLAN ON MOUNTING THIS TV TO THE WALL(WITH FULL MOTION TILT AND SWIVEL), YOU WILL WANT TO KNOW THAT NONE OF THE STANDARD MOUNTS WILL ACCOMODATE IT.  FOR WHATEVER REASON, SAMSUNG MADE THESE TV'S WITH NON-STANDARD 'M8' SCREWS AND THE MOUNT KITS IN THE STORES GO UP TO 'M6' HOLES (AGAIN THIS IS FOR FULL MOTION MOUNTS-IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TILT ONLY MODELS YOU MAY BE IN LUCK.)  I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS SO I CALLED SAMSUNG TECH SUPPORT AND AND WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE TOLD ME THEY DO NOT HAVE MOUNTS TO SUPPORT FULL MOTION FOR THIS TV YET.  YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD AT LEAST MAKE IT TO FIT INDUSTRY STANDARDS LIKE THE REST OF THEIR TV'S-BUT NOT THE CASE.SOOOO, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND ARE HELL-BENT ON PUTTING THIS THING ON THE WALL WITH FULL MOTION, YOU WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THE MOUNT AND DRILL THE HOLES BIGGER TO ACCOMMODATE THE M8 SCREWS.I REALLY LIKE SAMSUNG TV'S OVERALL AND REALLY LIKE THIS NEW ULTRA-SLIM DESIGN, BUT BETWEEN THE MOTION SICKNESS AND THE GLARE I AM PUTTING UP WITH A LOT AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS ONE WILL BE A KEEPER EITHER.  I MUST SAY OVERALL IM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER WITH THIS LED TECHNOLOGY FROM SAMSUNG THUS FAR...
