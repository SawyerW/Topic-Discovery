For a TV of this price, I had expected better technical performance.  The primary problem this TV has is that it does not process audio signals properly when the customer has a separate 5 or 7 channel audio receiver / speaker system. One would expect the TV to pass through any digital audio signal it receives over the HDMI 1.4 interface to the optical audio output which one would hook to their receiver.  However, this TV down grades the audio to 2.1, (I assume that is what it needs for the built in speakers)  The solution is to connect one's sources to the receiver and have it pass on the video and audio to the TV. This works for the customer devices, but does not work for internet provided content, as that is transmitted directly to the TV over the internet.Thus NETFLIX and other internet audio cannot be run into the receiver in its native mode, but only 2.1 format.  It took me 4 days to get Samsung technical support to confirm this fact.Another smaller problem is that there is no way to delete local media "devices" once the TV finds them.  In my case, when I got the internet working (easy to do, BTW) the TV found three of my computers and continues to list them as "Devices" although I am not sharing anything from them.  I am sharing using Samsung PC Manager, but that is the last "device" the TV found, and so any time I want to access media from my PC such as pictures, songs or video, I have to push the "A" button on the remote and skip over the "devices" I don't share.  It should be possible to delete devices that TV has found.I put this information here as it seemed like a place that customers might actually read.In general the TV works very well and it would be too much trouble to return it for these aggravations. Other reviews cover the TV very well.
