So this TV was an excellent price.  I was looking for a decent new 1080p LED set and enjoyed my previous Vizio Plasma previously.  Well this TV unfortunately was not quite up to spec.  I'm no videophile, and I probably can't speak to the technical details others might, but I was definitely annoyed by the edge lighting as it bled into the image.  I did read this is fairly common for edge lit LED sets, and turning down the backlight can help (honestly I didn't know this until recently).  Other than the bleeding, the most part, the colors were great and I didn't really notice any sort of motion blur or things of that nature.  I wasn't blown away either.Yes, the speakers are crappy. But that wasn't an issue for me since I have a nice receiver.My main issue was with how this set handled signal switching (if thats the proper term). For example, I have a PS3, 360 and an Apple TV, all through 1 HDMI from my receiver.  I typically watched netflix on my 360.  However, every single time I load up a show, the signal disconnects and I have to power cycle either the TV or my receiver for it to establish the connection again. bad bad bad.  It also had a hard time detecting my Apple TV when the receiver switched to that input.  This, coupled with the mediocre picture quality and backlight bleed prompted me to return the TV.One thing I'll hand Vizio is that the product packaging was easy to unpack (and pack), doing no damage to the box.  The screwdriverless screws to attach the base are also a convenient touch.  I can't say the same for the LG I just ordered.  So setup time with the Vizio is actually quite less.So if you're looking for a budget TV, and its not going to be your main TV, this could fit the bill.  I can't recommend it as centerpiece for your home theater.
