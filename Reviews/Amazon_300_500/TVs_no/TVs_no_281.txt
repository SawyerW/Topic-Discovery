Save yourself a headache and avoid this product and all Philips Plasma's. If you take your chances and buy a Philips plasma, you might as well buy the extended service contract as you will likely need it.I purchased the Philips 42in Plasma TV a little over a year ago and it started showing a thin red line vertically in the middle of the screen at about month 11. It was still under warranty and called customer service.The repair shop picked it up a few days later. This was in the beginning of December. It is now March and they have replaced several parts without fixing it.Here is the current workflow.1. Repair shop orders a part from Philips.2. Philips reviews the order to decide whether or not to give permission to ship the part since it is under Warranty.3. Philips reviews the order and eventually gives permission to send the part. (this seems to take 3 weeks each time)4. The part arrives 7-10 days later.Part doesn't fix the TV and it starts all over.Customer service has no way to track the status because it is in a different system.The repair shop has no way of tracking it because philips has to give them an Order number and this doesnt happen until they give permission to ship the part.Anyhow, when you call customer service, their only function is to tap dance around until you get aggravated and bored and get off the phone. They may promise callbacks, but it never happens. I even got one of their supervisors to admit that they provide service, but not good service.I have a friend with the comparable Samsung that he got at about the same time and it works fine. Also I have anotehr friend with the Sony and it works pretty well, but pricier.I have never had a TV break in the less than a year, but this one did and a neighbor purchased one as well and it lasted only 15 months was too costly to fix.Picture actually wasnt bad. just poor quality.
