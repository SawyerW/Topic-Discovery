I received my TV about 3 weeks ago.  I wanted a little time to settle in with it before i wrote a review.I've read just about every review out there for this specific TV on multiple websites before i purchased and can say i only agree with the positive one.I chose Amazon b/c they were a couple hundred dollars cheaper and i have always had good luck.  Pilot delivered the TV on time and in one piece.I am moving up from a 32 in. Samsung LCD so i was a pretty big jump in quality.  I mounted the TV with the Samsung slim mount that actually gave me the most problems.(mostly my mechanical errors though)  The TV sits as flat as possible along the wall making it look like a painting.Picture:Just amazing!!  I hear about the "soap opera effect" which did come into play.  Some movies looked so real you could tell the sets were fake.(duh) But after a week i have gotten used to it and can't believe how great the picture is.(especially for sports)  Blacks are such a deep black when i watch TV at night it almost feels like there is no border if it is in widescreen and cuts off some picture.Sound:I know a lot of people complained about the sound.  I live in a loft with large ceilings and i was impressed.  I actually sold my receiver and speakers because the sound was so good.  I'm not saying it is perfect for every situation but as far as TV speakers go i love them.Samsung Apps:This is the only complaint i have.  Some people may find these useful or fun but they are just boring.  Youtube and Netflix are nice but i have them on everything else.  My phone, xbox, laptop etc.  There just isn't anything on there that makes it exciting at all.  Kinda wish i would have purchased a model down to save some money but am very happy over all with my purchase!!
