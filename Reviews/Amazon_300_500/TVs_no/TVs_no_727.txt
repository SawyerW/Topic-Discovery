I was going back and forth between this and the competing Panasonic Plasma that have the best ratings of the year. I am very happy with the Samsung-not to mention saving $500 off the Panasonic price. I barley even considered LCD's etc because it's a fact plasmas have better pictures. Had a buddy over that bought the Panasonic from Best Buy (I guess he likes paying more for stuff?) and his comment was that he actually liked my picture better not to mention the slim design.I ended up buying the bundle deal with 4 Shrek 3d movies, 2 adult glasses and the blue ray player. The player is basic 3d and I don't mind because I use the new apple tv to stream netflix not to mention you can do it via the TV itself so upgrading the blu ray player would be a waste. There is talk about the software upgrade out there. It was a snap as I have the TV hard wired to my router. If you can't do this the jump drive upgrade seems like a pain-I'd just buy a cheap 50' Ethernet cable and do it via the tv menu upgrade like I did.The buzzing noise-yes it buzzes. When you are more than 2 feet away you cannot hear it not to mention when the sound is on you can't hear it. Funny thing is I never even though about the buzz and only recently realized the old Samsung dlp I have also buzzes. The buzz is so minor I am surprised people get hung up on it (and I'm usually pretty uptight about things).I would highly recommend this TV and buying it through Amazon. FYI my kids love the 3D!BUZZ UPDATE- So I moved the ferrite power cord block Samsung gives you with the tv all the way up the power cord against the back of the TV and the slight buzz I had disappeared. No buzz at all even when my ear is one inch away from TV.
