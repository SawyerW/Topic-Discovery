Well it arrove with Target store sealing tape on it.  The manufacturer's box with the tv was merely dropped tinto a bigger box and shipped out - - - - no padding, no insulation,  no air bags , nuthin' !I thot the worse... wurst...  rust...  I didn't think it would work.I set it on its pedestal; plugged in the antenna cable and the power cord; loaded the handheld remote with batt-ries and pushed the "on" button.  I was thinking that this would be the same size as the one it replaced but that one musta been a 16" tv as this one is maybe 15% or so bigger.From there on it told me "hello"; instructed me to let it set itself up and that was about it.  This thing was ready for the evening news in maybe fifteen minutes.....  It musta scanned the entire solar system for channels 'cause it now brings in BOTH PBS alternatives and channels I didn't even know existed.  I am using a Channel-Master Omni  mounted up in the attic with a 20 db in-line amp (also purchaced via Amazon).Sound is adequate but I'm a little hard of hearing anyway.Vision is remarkable.  It don't matter where in the room you are - if you can see the screen reasonably; the pichure is clear.....  none of that negative imaging nor funky colors when viewed at an extreme angle - - - - - like the LCD tv in the living room.The volume and channel buttons are on the rong side of the controller but that's a matter of ergonimics.  all the other stuff is pretty much easy to unnnerstand.  It even has an AGC for the volumn  option. That is to say there's an option that modifies to reasonable average volume those super sound commercial messages that blast between the normally set volume in the rest of the program.Would I recommend this product?  absolutely. Besides having the usual features and connections this one offers a superior viewing angle and a volume AGC.
