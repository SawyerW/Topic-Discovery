I'm not a pro regarding televisions and certainly don't pretend to be. However, before buying this TV I did a lot of research (almost too much). This TV is amazing. The DVD upscaling from my ps3 blows my mind alone, then there's blue ray... amazing. I'll list a few pros/cons so I don't ramble on for too long:PROs1)blue ray and up scaled dvd's are vibrant.2)gta iv and other ps3 games whether 1080 or 720 are beautiful and smooth3)lots of inputs. 4 HDMI! Also, convenient connectors on side for quick setup.4)turned off, the TV makes the room look sweet. The red isn't overwhelming in the least.5)lots of options in menu. good for a variety of viewing options/environments6)120 HZ is adjustable, necessary cause well... go to a store and see.7)Although pricey, it's cheaper than comparable TVsCONS1)The remote is terrible. It's as if an ipod had a slow cousin. Minor pain.2)Although I don't have issues with glare, it is possible to see how a house with lots of windows could be problematic.3)It can be hard to watch basic broadcasting cable (no HD Box... yet) but what HDTV would look amazing without a digital box?4)speakers aren't great (plan to get sound system)5)120 HZ sometimes can be too good. Change is difficult for some people.6)I can't stop watching movies/playing games; so pretty.No issues so far, but I haven't had it more than a month yet. Also, the TV was purchased at a store and not online, though it is cheaper on Amazon.My advice is to check it out at a store first. It is prefect for me but of course people have different opinions. Usually after I make a big purchase there's a moment of regret or guilt. With this TV, I still feel I made a quality investment and increased my quality of life. There are a lot of variables to buying a TV today so do your research. I would recommend this TV to anyone.
