The picture on this LCD TV  can be summed up with one word...Stunning!I investigated several LCD TVs before I bought this one; and I'm very happy with my decision.The Pros:1.) Crystal clear image when viewed from a source with High Def.(HD) broadcast AND you have the necessary cables. [see below Cons: 1.)]2.) 4000:1 contrast ratio: this is basically a comparison between the whitest white and the blackest black that the TV can give. This ratio is outstanding and accounts for some of the units exceptional video performance.3.) Lots of inputs on the back; 2x HDMI inputs, 1x S-Video, components, PC connections; as well as output jacks for connections to home theatres.4.) Inputs on the side of the unit for external devices such as video games and camcorder; these include an A/V input and a S-Video input jack. There is also a Headphone jack for private listening.5.) The external cabinet is a high gloss metallic surface that just glistens; I don't think I ever seen a TV as eye appealing as this one.6.) Comes with a good swivel stand and fully functioning remote.The Cons:1.) The unit does not come with any connecting cables except for the power cord; so, if you want the best HD reception you need to get a triple video  (Y/pb/pr)  or a HDMI cable. Also, you may require S-Video or component cables if they are needed for other external input devices (VCR, DVD etc).2.) Some other reviewers have felt the audio/speakers were somewhat weak; I thought they were adequate. I purchased this unit for its video aspect; if  I want top end sound I can hook this TV up to my stereo system.All in all, in spite of the minor concerns mentioned above, this is an outstanding LCD TV; the picture is as good as I could ever wish for. If your looking to invest in a high end HD TV, then you owe it to yourself to check out this unit before you make your decision. 5 Stars.
