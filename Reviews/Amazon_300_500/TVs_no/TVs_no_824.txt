When I initially bought my TV, the picture was great. However, I began to have problems with the TV where it would freeze up. After sending the TV back in and having the wireless card replaced, I found that the TV still has the same issue, freezing up to the point where you would have to turn the TV off and back on again. After multiple hours of time spent with customer support, I was told that there was an incompatibility issue with my wireless network such that it caused the TV to lock up. I was told that I would have to either disable my WiFi network (then what would deb the point of an internet TV) or disable the Network or File sharing function of my WiFi network. I was also told that it may have something to do with how the TV is not DLNA compatible. I have a standard out-of-the-box network from an Apple Airport Extreme, nothing fancy. I wouldn't know how to set up anything fancy with my network anyway. I spoke with Vizio by phone and email more times than I care to count. I was hoping to exchange my TV for a model that would not have the WiFi issues, but apparently I am told that all their TVs have the same WiFi card AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO HAVING THE SAME LOCKUP ISSUE! I was told that I am not alone in having this issue. So while having to deal with repeating the same story over three months to various support reps, getting the voicemail of a manager who takes over a week to return a voicemail, overall I have to rate the whole experience of owning a Vizio as abysmal. I'm still trying to troubleshoot the issue with a different manager, who has shot down my proposal to exchange my model for a newer one in the hopes that it resolves my WiFi issue. I guess, we'll just have to see...
