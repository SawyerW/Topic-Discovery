But I want to upgrade my living TV to this new model...Picture is the greatest TV in the store. But 2 things about this TV . NO subwoofer for such as high end TV! They pull that out! So  means ,U have to spend another $500 or more for surround sound system .Plus another $500 for TV stand to get some BOOM...second: damn price. $4300??????? Is to high for lame speakers & size ...I just want to wait till around fall ,price comes down around $3000 then buy it ...so I use the rest of the money i saved for surround sound and stand.... is to much money for not such as high solid unit right now..Anyway I cant wait price goes down. & U should too..
