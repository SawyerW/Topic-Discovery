Bought this a few weeks ago and wanted to wait before I left my feedback.  Delivery was just OK.  I kept checking online and it kept saying that it was in transit waiting for something from the shipper.  Finally I called the shipping company, and they arranged to deliver it the next day - so if you watch your delivery online - don't hesitate to contact the shipper to set up a delivery time.  No set up - 2 men just carried the box in - but it was kept upright.  I had my kids help me unpack it so I could try it out - but the drivers were long gone by the time I had it hooked up.But - it didn't matter, the set up was quick, even for a non-techie like myself.  Got the bottom put on (it does require 2 people) and put it up on top of a dresser.  Hooked up the cable box, a few adjustments, and it's fine.  We've watched movies and it looks wonderful.  We use no other speakers except for the TV and the sound is also great.  The color is off just a tad upon delivery, so I'm going to try the settings that were recommended in the first post (the color wasn't really noticeable until we watched a tennis match and the court colors were really, really bright).I am really, really happy with this TV.  From my experience so far, I would not hesitate to buy another Panasonic Viera for our house.Updated Jan 1, 2013 - just wanted to say that after owning this TV for awhile now, I would NOT hesitate to purchase another Panasonic TV for my home.  I have not had ANY problems with this TV.  The picture is still clear as the day we bought it.
