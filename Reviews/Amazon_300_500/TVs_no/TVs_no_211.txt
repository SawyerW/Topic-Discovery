When I was looking for a TV, the Samsung LN-T4065F came out on top, which included my price point.  But when I saw the 61 model in a store and realized that I could save from a couple to a few hundred dollars I opted for the 61.  And boy, I'm not at all disappointed in that decision.The 4061 is a terrific TV.  Besides looking great, the performance of the TV is what I had hoped it would be.PROS- Fit and finish is terrific.  I've been a huge fan of Samsung lately, and this will continue my fanaticism- The Picture quality and brightness are top notch.  Ok, it doesn't have 120Hz refresh (btw, that's pretty amazing), but I really feel that didn't need to be a requirement in my viewing of movies or watching a low quality TiVo recording.- The color saturation and contrast is terrific.  It sounds crazy, but sometimes it just seems the image is popping out of the screen.- DVD and Game performance is perfect.  I have an older Samsung 50" DLP and there's a double digit millisecond video delay, which is horrible for playing games.CONS- The blacks aren't as black as I had hoped.  Especially in a pitch dark room.  It could be that I have it sitting on top of an entertainment center.  I just purchased a wall mount for it and hope that will help.  I think it may be light pollution from the lamp.  I'm also considering having it tuned by a professional.  I have a couple of tuning DVD's, but it's pretty complicated- There appears to be a slight manufacturing glitch / defect on the bottom portion of the screen along the bezel.  For instance, you know when you put your finger on a LCD screen and the colors change.  Well, that's whats happening on the lower part of the screen.  You can only see it when the screen is black.---In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone.  If you desire an upgrade, get the model with 120hz refresh.  If not, this model offers the best bang for your buck.
