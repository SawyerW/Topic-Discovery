I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.
