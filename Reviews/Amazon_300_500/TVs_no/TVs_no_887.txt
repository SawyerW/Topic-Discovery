Just received this tv a week ago to replace a faulty 2010 model (free under warranty) I absolutely love this TV as I did the original before it stopped working properly.  I was a little leery of it only being 720p but after a trip to Best Buy to see it side by side with similar sized full HD tv's I couldn't pass up the deal.  The resolution difference is negligible unless you're sitting with your nose pressed to the screen.  It does suffer from some temporary burn-in while playing video games but it's gone within a few minutes and hardly worth complaining about.  I've yet to try out 3D with this set, the glasses I bought for the 2010 model aren't compatible with this set as Samsung has switched from IR reception to Bluetooth for the 2011 model TV's.  Thankfully they are super nice and swapping out my old glasses for the new Bluetooth models at no charge.  The old glasses had some trouble staying in sync due to interference from other light sources and possibly light from the screen itself, b-tooth should eliminate that issue completely so I'm super excited to try it out in a few days.  I think the only semi-complaint I have is the lack of built in internet apps, though it's not really needed as game consoles and a large number of the blu-ray players out there have them built in.  As for technical support and repairs I couldn't ask for better than Samsung has given.If it wasn't for the lack of internet apps and not being able to use the 3d on this set *yet* I would have given a full 5 stars.  Oh, also...Glasses have some down in price by a good amount, when I bought the first TV Samsung's glasses were sitting around 100-120 dollars, now they can be had for $50 a pair for the battery type, making it much more affordable to get the whole family in on it.
