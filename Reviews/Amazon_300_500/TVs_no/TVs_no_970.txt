I purchased the Panasonic tv to replace a 55" Samsung LED tv (8000 series) and I absolutely love it.  Originally, I was so excited to buy the Samsung right before Christmas and enjoy the "state of the art" in tv technology.  The Samsung is super thin, super light and has a bezel that is about .25" wide, quite visually attractive.  Unfortunately that is the end of the good parts. There are many reviews of these tv's but suffice it to say the samsung is unwatch-able on certain programs.  Modern Family and The Office are two shows that highlight jitter and motion blur in even the simplest scenes.  It also had the ability to make movies look like they were filmed with a camcorder, color was way off, highlights were blown out.  After a lot of color corrections and various settings you can get a specific movie to look better but then the next program looks awful. To make matters worse this tv would randomly change from one input to another (after a google search come to find out other Samsung owners have this issue).  After all this I returned it to Best Buy and exchanged it for another hoping this was a defective unit only to find the exact same problems with the replacement.I'm writing this bad review of the Samusung to contrast it with the incredible performance of the Panasonic Plasma, don't be fooled by all the Plasma bashing.  They are far superior to the LCD/LED garbage being hustled out there. I turned on the Plasma, set it to THX picture setting and everything looks great.  Superior black level, no motion or jitter effects.  I laugh at the energy consumption sales tactic as well, the Samsung had an estimate of $17 per year and the Plasma's estimate was $24. I will have two less Starbucks this year and spend the $7 for the extra electricity.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Plasma, I would recommend Panasonic after my latest Samsung experience.
