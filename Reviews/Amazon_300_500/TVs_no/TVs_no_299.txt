I would buy this TV all over again.  Paid $2,499 for it in January 2008, which at the time, was $800 cheaper than 2 very popular brick and mortar places. As much as I appreciate a great picture, I am no audio/videophile. So I'm not going to go into the technical details.  I'm just going to say that after 16 months there are still programs and sporting events that come on that prompt me to say "WOW!".  The clarity and detail are amazing. What's more, I've never had a single issue with the set, so I am hoping the money I spent for the extended in-home service plan turns out to be a complete waste.  Once the satellite installer set up the HD (had analog prior)that was it.  Incredible picture with not a single adjustment.Hopefully I can write this same review in another 16 months.  Also, kudos to Amazon.  They are incredible to deal with. From initial order right through delivery.  Probably the best service provider I ever dealt with.***UPDATE January 18, 2011***I have now had the set for 3 years and still not a single issue. What's more, with all the technological improvements and breakthroughs made within the last 3 years, I still have guests and family looking at my set and saying "I've never seen a sharper picture on a television."I also just purchased my first Blu-ray player with streaming capability. Bought Avatar as my first Blu-ray movie. Let me just say that I will likely never go to a theater ever again to see a graphics and computer animation intensive movie. I will wait and buy or rent it on Blu-ray. Between the quality Blu-ray player, well made movie on Blu-ray and the quality of this TV, the visual was stunning. The streamed video also looks terrific, even through WIFI.So lets hope I can add another positive addition to this basic review in another 3 years. Given todays expensive and seemingly disposable/short shelf life for technology, 6 years for this set will likely be a good return on investment, although I certainly hope I get even more than that.
