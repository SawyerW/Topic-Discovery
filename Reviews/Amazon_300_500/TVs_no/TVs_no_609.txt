Up until I purchased the PN63C7000 I was a die hard Panasonic guy.  I didn't realize at the time that Amazon had a gift card promo going that they didn't carry the Panasonic 65" VT25, all I knew was that I wanted to get a new TV soon so I bought up a lot of gift credit.  When the time came just before Christmas I found myself stuck having to choose among other brands, and Samsung was the only one I was willing to consider for a new PDP.I wish I had read up a little more at some of the video forums out there, but I didn't.  Unfortunately there is a very real buzzing issue with the 7000 and 8000 series.  It's hard to explain, but it projects literally out of the screen and hits you primarily if you're in front of the panel, even if you're as many as 15+ feet away.  I have never heard this kind of buzzing before, but it's of a higher frequency and it sounds like it's coming from inside your head.That's not to say that this TV is horrible though, it has a beautiful picture and excellent 3D.  Having the volume up pretty loud helps get your mind off it, as does just trying to pretend it's not there.  Of course if your furniture is positioned in a way that your head won't be lined up with the panel that helps too.Aside from that I really was impressed with the digital features including streaming support, youtube, etc.  Speakers are pretty poor compared to a home theater setup, but that's to be expected.  If the buzzing issue didn't exist or if there was a fix (to date Samsung hasn't found a way to fix via repair) this would be a 5 star TV all the way.  If Amazon carried the VT25 though I would have returned this to get that instead, I haven't heard of any Panasonic panel buzzing problems.
