The first thing that I will say is that I am very happy with this set, the picture quality is fantastic. I was somewhat surprised to see the rating was only 3.5 stars, but am confident that it will even out over time to be in line with the other models in this series of TV.That being said there are some flaws as mentioned in previous reviews.- There is a buzzing sound, this however depends on the settings of the TV. If the contrast is cranked very high you will notice it more. After calibrating the TV and turning down the contrast its not noticeable. (This is a common problem with Plasma TVs and not specific to this model). I sit about 11 feet away from the TV for reference.- There are fluctuating blacks at times. This is very much dependent on the content. I have not noticed them nearly as often when in THX or a mode with similar calibration settings. Perhaps I got a set that is less affected by this, but if it was as big a problem as some would suggest I would have sent the TV right back. Or maybe I simply got used to it, so take this for what its worth and make your own decision. I would recommend finding a store that stocks the TV and get a look at it yourself.The things that I liked:+ Picture quality is fantastic+ Great modern exterior design. I had originally purchased a ST30 and exchanged for this model and the difference is night and day.+ Compared to the ST30, the Wi-Fi dongle is hidden along the back of the TV. On the P46ST30 model it protrudes out the side of the TV.+ 3D looks great, I got the Avatar 3-D bundle with purchase and am not disappointed. I don't know how much I will use it in the future, but I thought it looked great.In summary, not a perfect set, but among the best I've seen. For the price I am very satisfied with my decision and definitely recommend it.
