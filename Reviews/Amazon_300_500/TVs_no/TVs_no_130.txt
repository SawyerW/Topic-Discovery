It took me months to finally decide on an HDTV for my wife and I. I knew it was going to be a big investment and I was determined to make the right choice. So, I read everything I could find about HDTV's and eventually learned a lot.  Once I was felt that I was educated enough, I started shopping. The Samsung LNS4051D had the best specs I could find for the price, so placed my order.ORDER/SHIPPING:  Amazon makes it very easy to place your order and the buying experience was great as always. Shipping on the other hand, didn't go so smooth. Amazon estimates 3-5 Days, THIS IS NOT TRUE. Eagle Shipping Company will probably get it to you in about 7-10 days from the timeit ships. But let me say this....Eagle has the best customer service ever! When I realized that my TV wasn't going to get to me in the estimated 3-5 Days I called Eagle and explaind my problem. They were very responsive and very helpful. Even though it was not their fault Amazon had told me the wrong shipping time, Eagle rushed the delivery so that I would have it in time for a family event I was hosting. The were really great!THE HDTV:  WOW! Let me tell you, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I love the televison. The picture is amazing, sound is more than adequate, the design is gorgeous and the features are great. My one and only complaint is that it only has ONE component input. Sure, 2 HDMI inputs are great but my XBOX 360 and DVD player/surround sound system require component so I have to switch the cables back and forth. But you know what they say, "You can never have enough inputs"Summary  I strongly recommend this HDTV! (just remember it may take a little longer to get it than what Amazon tells ya)
