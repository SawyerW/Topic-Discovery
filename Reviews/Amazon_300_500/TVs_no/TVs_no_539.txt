I would have sent this TV back but for another review.  I found the picture WAY too dark, but I'd read a review saying that this was due to the TV being shipped with Auto-Contrast turned on.  On this model it's called "Ambient Sensor".  Go to Menu/Settings/Picture/Ambient Sensor.  Turn it off and the picture is as bright and crisp as you could want.  "Ambient Sensor" is the last of the Picture options.  It does not appear when Picture is first selected.  It is necessary to scroll down to the end (or, equivalently, up one) to access it.That done, I had a bright, crisp picture, but there was something still not quite right.  For lack of anything else to try, I checked the settings on my L series 32" Sony HDTV that this is replacing and found that the settings were different.  After setting Scene Select to General, I set this 40" TV to the settings on the 32", namely, Backlight to 8 and Picture to 90.  The resulting picture is nothing short of incredible!!-----------------------------------Added in edit:  The more I view this TV, the more I like it.  The HD picture has a 3D quality to it, even though this is not a 3D set.The more I use it, the more I HATE the remote!  It makes one wonder whether the engineers who designed it ever tried using it. You can see a picture of it about 1/3 of the way down the page, on the left. Like every other remote, it has a button surrounded by a ring:  press the top of the ring to go up, the bottom to go down, the right side to move right, the left side to move left.  All well and good...so far.  The problem is the ring of buttons that surrounds it.  Even though I've had the tv for only a week, I can't count the number of times I pressed Favorites only to then press MENU when I'd intended to press the bottom of the inner ring.  The outer ring of buttons should have been placed in two horizontal rows somewhere else.  However, as annoying as the remote is, the picture is so great that I would not reduce the star ranking.
