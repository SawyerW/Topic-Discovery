This TV is cheap, not just inexpensive, cheap. I would not buy this TV as my main TV. I put it in a bedroom so it is much easier for me to deal with its quirks and imperfections as I am not watching this set the most in my home. It has a good picture (if left in energy saving mode) and poor sound quality. At least on my set, if you change the picture settings in any way off of Energy Saving mode the next time you turn it on the LEDs will not light up and the picture will be so dim you can hardly see it. The LEDs come back on if you change back to energy saving mode and will come on the next time you power on the set if you leave it in this mode. The sound is not good but did not expect much from the speakers on a TV this cheap. It is "listenable" at least where you can at least understand dialog, etc. Other issues are the pretty bad "flashlight" effect in all four corners from the LEDs but only looks really bad on a very dark or black screen. Standard def programming is close to unwatchable I have noticed on this TV and even HD programming has some "ghosting" in some faster motion scenes. Again, both of these issues are tolerable for the shorter periods of time I use this set.I orginally bought this TV as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend's parents as they do not have an HD TV yet. I wanted another for my bedroom anyway so thought I'd try this TV out for a bit first to see if it was good enough to use as a gift for them. I found that it is not good enough for them to use as a main TV and we will be purchasing a slightly more expensive, but better name and quality TV for them for Christmas and I am keeping this cheapo in my bedroom.Hope this was helpful.
