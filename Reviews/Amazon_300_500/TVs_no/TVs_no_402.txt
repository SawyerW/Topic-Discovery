This is probably the best tv on the market right now... there is only 1 issue with it, and almost every review before mine has pointed it out independently. If they gave it a bad review - then they are missing the key: TURN OFF THE TRUMOTION.TruMotion is great for documentaries, sports, news, etc... but when you are watching The Dark Knight on Blu-Ray... it makes the movement so realistic that you feel like you are watching a camcorder.Positives:The one thing that I haven't seen anyone else write about is the menu system and setup. PLUG AND PLAY! Perfect picture right out of the box... the only setting that you need to ever adjust is the "TruMotion" which is VERY easy to find since LG has made probably the easiest to use menu system I have ever seen on a TV.Picture Quality:Top Notch. While they are coming out with a 480hz TV this year (as seen at CES), my bet is that your not going to physically be able to see the difference.An example of how good the picture quality is:We watch "Good Luck Chuck" on BluRay when we got the TV. After watching it my wife made the comment "I LOVE this TV", when I inquired as to why, she said "Jessica Alba doesn't have as good of skin as me! I feel so good about myself".  Seriously you can see THAT much detail... Along the same lines, AVOID watching any Dane Cook movies, his face is disgusting and pockmarked up close. Don't say I didn't warn you.You can read the rest of the reviews here for goods/bads... but overall you are not going to regret getting this TV. Its worth noting at the time of this writing BestBuy has this TV, XBox360, and GeekSquad install available for $1299 total! Usually Amazon is the best deal out there... but if you want it now... and wouldn't mind the free xbox - its a great deal.
