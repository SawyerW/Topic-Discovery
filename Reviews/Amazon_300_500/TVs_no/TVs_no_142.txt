Okay, so you're trying to find a TV and you can't debate between plasma or LCD HDTV.  You're mixed up & broken between screen resolutions and screen sizes.  You're worried about details involving burn-in, contrast-ratios, and which brand is the best.I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.Face it, you're basically going to have to do the research by yourself, or simply take advice from people you really trust.***** ***** ***** ***** *****Here are the reasons why I bought this TV:It's LCD HDTV.  Plasma may have better contrast ratios, and may provide smoother picture but I am a gamer.  I play games that involve overhead displays (health bars, ammo meters, etc...) that are essentially frozen on the screen.  Buying a plasma would only provide agonizing burn-in with those regions.It's Samsung.  Samsung produces really amazing LCD HDTV's.  If it were a plasma, I'd definitely opt for a Panasonic.It's 40".  I originally wanted a 42" TV, but then realized that I'd be spending several more hundreds of dollars for 2 more inches.  Reality check---I recently graduated from college and I am broke.  40" is still very big (and quite a luxury) for a college graduate.The resolution---it maxes out at 1080i, I know.  Higher numbers are wonderful and all, but usually end up yielding higher PRICES (at least $[...] more).  If you really think about it, there isn't much that outputs 1080p, besides the PS3.  If you didn't know already, the PS3 is $[...], and is probably the cheapest BluRay Disc player on the market.Besides the PS3, your current DVDs & gaming-consoles & HD Cable Television will not improve, since they are currently maxed out at 480p - 1080i.  To me, 1080p is not big enough of a technological jump for me to shell out another $[...].The price.  Of course you have been shopping around.  You know that this TV's price is pretty darn cheap.  Unless you're gonna find yourself a magical mail-in-rebate, or some type of employee discount, this is gonna be THE DEAL for you.  Think about it---Amazon's free shipping.  No tax (depending on where you live, i guess).  This is the price that you pay!!!The one *one* complaint I have regarding this TV is that there is only one Component input (RGB).  As a result, I plug in my Nintendo Wii via Composite (yellow-cable for video) and my XBox 360 into my Component.This basically forces me to purchase an HDMI cable for my XBox 360, so that I can up my Wii to Component cables.All-in-All, this is really a great deal.  Amazon is a very reliable source, and the TV is outstanding.
