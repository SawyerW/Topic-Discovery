What can I say that hasn't already been said?  For my uses, Vizio got absolutely everything right with this set.  Even the case design is brilliant.  If you're unfamiliar, all the inputs are color coded and labeled, by type and relative quality.  That, and the case itself is the absolute sharpest design I've seen on the market. I wish more manufacturers would take notice instead of sticking to the over-sized-monitor look.Luckily, the list of "pros" does not end at "the case looks nice."  The screen is incredibly crisp and vivid, even before adjusting.  There's the option of having the television take over brightness control, saving your eyes in the dark and cranking up the juice in direct sunlight (not sure a total of 44 watts is really "cranking up the juice" but work with me, here.) All the specs and features are here that you'd expect when dealing with video quality, a nice response time, great contrast ratio, and most importantly to me, a great viewing angle.  It sits quite a bit higher than my bed, but the picture is flawless.  Other notables, there's very little delay in the remote, you can surf without waiting for each to tune.  And another tiny but critical aspect that some manufacturers can't seem to wrap their heads around, a "sleep" button on the remote.  Why on earth do some manufacturer's tuck this away in a menu?  Ridiculous.So what's not so good?  The sound, of course.  Scourge of the LCD TV.  Despite their absolute best efforts in software, including options for SRS surround,  TruVolume, equalizer settings, balance, bass and treble controls, it's still average at best.  By now I'm willing to accept that LCD TVs will never sound that great.  In my family room, I would need to buy an amplifier and speakers, but in my bedroom, it's just fine.I took the risk buying a TV from a fairly new face on the market, but they've made a great first impression.
