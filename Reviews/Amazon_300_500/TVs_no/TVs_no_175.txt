I have had this TV for several months now, and I must say that I am very happy.  The picture is bright, sharp, and colorful.  HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs look excellent on this set, and it is really the best way to use this set.  Standard DVDs look very good, but would probably be better with a DVD player that up-converts standard DVDs to HD quality.  Standard cable TV looks good, but not as good as on a conventional tube TV.  The menus are easy to navigate.Energy consumption: First, this TV puts off some heat.  Not as bad as a plasma, but I definitely feel the heat on my hand within 4 to 5 inches of the screen.  The screen gets very warm to the touch, but not hot.  The set has an energy saving feature that can be controlled from the remote.  The energy saving feature has four settings (Off, Low, Med, and High).  The 'off' setting gives you the brightest and most colorful picture.  I only use this setting for watching movies, or if the room lighting is very bright.  The 'high' setting reduces the brightness of the screen, and considerably cuts down on the heat output.  Personally, I use the 'medium' and 'high' settings for most of my regular TV viewing.My only real complaint of this set is the remote.  It has a poor layout, with the number buttons near the top and the 'Enter' button on the lower part of the remote.  If you enter channel selections directly, you have to awkwardly shift your hand to hit the enter button.  The most annoying thing about the remote is the fact that you have to point it directly at the TV for it to work (no bouncing signals off the walls like most remotes).  If you are pointing the remote off center of the TV by just a few degrees, it won't work.  I don't know if it a design problem with the remote or the sensor in the TV, but it sucks.  Whoever designed it that way should be taken out back and flogged!Overall, a great TV that I highly recommend.  I took one star away because of the design of the remote.  Happy viewing!
