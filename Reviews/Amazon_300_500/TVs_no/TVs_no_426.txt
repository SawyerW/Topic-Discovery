Getting a new HDTV can be as tough a decision as a buying new computer.  Comparing all of the specifications, brands and sale prices every weekend can be daunting.  Two rules: Never pay full price and always choose quality over quantity(size in this case.)I purchased this TV during the holidays as a gift for myself.  There have been a few "deals" below $300 on 32" sets from different companies.  I knew those would be inferior products and I was torn between this and its brother 504 model. I ultimately determined that the 504 was a special holiday version made probably made with a few cheaper components for a better profit margin and ordered this online from WallyWorld for 449, during the long site to store wait the price dropped to 399.  I was credited the difference very easily with a phone call, and received the same rebate last week.  The reason for ordering online was due to a 20% off promo (see rule #1.)ONE ISSUE.  The set I received has a little damage to the box.  It didn't do anything cosmetically to the set, but there was an issue with the picture.  In a couple of areas, there was a slightly lighter dark gray area when is should be black.  When I noticed this at home, I was pretty perturbed.  Especially after waiting 10 days.  To determine whither to return or exchange, I scoured the internet for a term and prevalence and for it was called clouding, but was only in reference to much older LED TVs.  I believe it was due to the handling, not build quality.  My replacement set is perfect!If you are a tech person and want a big bang for your pick this is the way to go.  There are many features that are not very common in 32" 720p sets such as: nice display adjustment (including backlight) treble, bass and balance audio adjustment and Picture in Picture(only when using PC and TV:There are NOT two tuners!)  Don't hesitate to pull the trigger when you find this at the right price.  5 stars!
