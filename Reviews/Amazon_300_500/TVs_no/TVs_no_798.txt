This would have been a great TV if COBY had perhaps spent more time tweaking the firmware.  Here's what I've noticed- The flash lighting others mentioned isn't bad, and had people here not mentioned it, I probably would not have known to look for it or noticed it.- If you expect to watch anything but the news, you will want to get a decent pair of speakers.  The built in speakers are at best equal to that of a clock radio, with the fidelity of a mobile phone playing music  The trouble is without an analog audio output your choices are limited to something that will accept an optical digital input - or using the controllable outputs of a cable, satellite or antenna box.- Via HDMI, I could not get the 1920x1080 resolution from my laptop to display properly without some scaling, stretching or overscan.- There is a curious amount of automatic contrast/noise-reduction processing going on that at times make flesh tones look very pasty and blurry.  On screen graphics, like those shown when watching a weather report appear very sharp, but as soon as a person appears their face and exposed fleshtones look very blurry and blocky.- The "video noise reduction" setting was always greyed out when using HDMI inputs- The TV does have settings for overscan, stretch/zoom adjustment, and dynamic contrast.- The TV does take 5-6 seconds to turn on.  The blue light blinks briefly and gets brighter when it is being switched on.  A message that says "Powering off...." or similar appears momentarily before the TV turns off.- The remote control is actually very nicely designed and does not look like a generic remote, but some of the commands are not debounced properly which makes accidental "double-clicking" very easy.- The LED backlight is, very bright, which makes this TV great for bright, sunny locations like a kitchen.If only COBY would address as many of the above issues as they can in a firmware upgrade (there is a USB service port on the side), this would probably merit the $400+ non-sale price.
