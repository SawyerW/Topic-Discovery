I purchased this tv on Jan. 22, 2008 and had no problems at all until about Mar. 11, 2008. Just a few weeks over the time limit to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement. Then the high pitched sound started. Once the tv was on for an hour or two it would develope a high pitched whine coming from the back of the set and continued the whole time the set was on.  I contacted Samsung and they had me send it to NJ for repairs. Well, I got the set back from NJ today (after almost 3 weeks) and it doesn't even look like the same set. When I sent it in for repair I sent it in the original box with all original packing and it arrived today in a different box with different packing. My brand new tv (barely 3 months old) that left here without a mark or scratch on it, was covered in scratches, back and front.Further unpacking revealed a 1" diameter hole in the front left corner that was broken out of the set along with pieces of plasitc that just fell out of the packing. I was also completely missing the oval base plate that I originaly sent.  I contacted Samsung again and they said to return it once again to the repair shop in NJ to see what they had to say about it ? So much for Samsung's warranty and customer service, it's beginning to look like I'm out almost $700.00 for a beat up, broken, missing parts tv. It's really a shame too because before the noise started up and I had to send it in for repairs it was a nice tv and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. All I can say is "Good Luck" if you purchase this set and I hope that you don't encounter the noise and have to send it to NJ for repairs.
