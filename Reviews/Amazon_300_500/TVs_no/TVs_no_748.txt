I purchased the white framed model after returning a Toshiba 19" that was so poorly shielded that every AM radio in the house became white noise when the tv was just plugged in.... but as far as the Vizio, I had higher hopes. For one, the plug was grounded. It looked slick out of the box. The first trouble came after about two hours. The picture went black but I could hear the audio. I changed the channel. Problem solved for about 10 minutes. Then the same thing happened.  I eventually called tech support and spoke to a helpful person who told me how to reset the unit. (turn it off, unplug the unit, and hold a button down for 30 seconds. This seemed to solve the problem..... for about 30 minutes. Even though the gentleman gave me a case number and instructed me to call back if there were further problems, I decided 300+ dollars was too much to be messing with tech support on day one. Back it went. I have noticed many newer brands of Chinese "junk" tvs out there- both in stores and online. Many of these newer brands have horrendous sound and they cannot be fully programmed with Direct TV receivers, which is important to me. Also the Vizio continued with the am radio interference, although to a lesser extent. I have come to realize that ALL tvs, even the major brands are now made in China due to dirt cheap labor. I settled on a 26" LG unit. I have a blue ray player from them which has been very good. So far, all of the problems I have had with the Vizio are not present with the LG. Amazon thankfully has the best return policy.  The makers of tvs should concentrate on QUALITY. It is sorely lacking.
