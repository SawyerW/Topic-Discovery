I had been researching (stalking) the Samsung 71 series for about 7 months as I thought that had the best picture I had seen.  Well it was, until this model came out.  I have the original firmware and have not had a reset but when I do I will just upgrade the firmware so that issue has been taken care of.  This set is amazing.  My girlfriend and her brother are definitely not videophiles by any means and when they first saw the picture they both said, "I don't even know what to say.  I can't imagine a better picture."  Her brother even said, "I know you told me that you were getting a new tv but I never expected this."  Yes, it is that good.  It is a little bright out of the box but after applying CNET's settings it looks awesome.  The AMP feature on this tv might not be for everyone (I love it and usually watch everything but movies on high and I usually watch movies on low or medium) but even with it off the 120hz refresh rate helps reduce motion blur.  This is huge for sports.  I have not tried connecting the infolink so I cannot comment on that.  Probably have no use for it but I will in the future just because I can.Pros:-Fantastic picture-Vibrant, realistic colors-Red Touch of Color (may not be for everyone)-Swivel stand lets you direct the tv to any part of the room in which you are sitting-120hz refresh rate-AMP-VERY DARK BLACKS and VERY WHITE WHITES (unlike plasma)-All of the inputsCons:-Sound is weak so you should hook this up to other speakers/theater-When using PIP in PC input split screen with tv, I cannot get the sound from the tv program to come through the speakers (if anyone knows how to do this let me know.-The bezel is a dust magnet so be prepared to clean often-Remote: The remote's wheel is not very accurate but you can still press it just as if it were four arrows.Advice:  Buy it and enjoy!
