This tv is the best I had come across in my lengthy research of televisions. At first I was against buying a 3D tv though the stunning 2D picture quality turned me around. I now enjoy both options of viewing.I do not write reviews, though and writing this one as a warning.This tv is beautiful. I however would never have bought this plasma version, if I had not been constantly told that burn in was a thing of the past for these newer model plasma. I would likely have opted for the LED. I am pretty unhappy when I notice scenes that expose my 4:3 burn in. It is quite annoying to have had a tv 6mths to find that you were not supposed to watch it regularly and all shows AND commercials must be streched or zoomed. I went through the break in period well though it seems there are just so many things you may not watch. In particular, ESPN HD, or use the Dynamic (torch) mode as this is the only thing I can think of that would have caused my problems. And shame on me for letting my kids operate it and watch Nick shows which are all 4:3, as are most commercials. Although it is not clearly "in your face", unless you actually sit down and read the manual from start to finish, any burn in issue is not covered by warranty.If burn in were a thing of the past, I think they would cover this. With all it's stated "technology" to prevent burn in issues, I find it to be quite misrepresenting. I could so called "fix" possibly by burning/aging my entire screen, though this should not be neccesary. Still, I have a very beautiful picture for allbut lighter scenes. However, it is nice to make a decision not based on lies. BE CAREFUL and study all care and instructions if you buy these tvs. Venting slightly, but I hope this is informative as well.
