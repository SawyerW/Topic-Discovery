I am giving SAMSUNG 24 hours to change a bad decision they made today to not honor their 1 year warranty on a 58 inch plasma TV. I have had this TV for 4 months just over 4 months..... a Christmas present I gave my family.... and one day 2 Friday's ago we were doing our housework....the TV was on like it always was.... Our little boy was watching his cartoons.... when we noticed a few hours later, that the screen was black. But we could still hear the sound. I thought the DVR was stuck so I turned everything off Powered down. Powered back up and the TV is now not working at all....no sound....no picture so I did a detailed search on the thing...... there is a tiny spider crack on the INSIDE of the screen. I told Samsung what had happened and they told me to send pictures......and from those pictures they determined it was PHYSICAL DAMAGE....HAHA  From pictures????According to Samsung policy, physical damage is not covered under Samsung warranty.....but there is no physical damage on the thing....its been sitting in the same place its been since we bought it ...no damage to the outside of the TV its from the inside!! They could see and feel that if they came to my house and checked it out themselves but after 12 days everyone refuses to honor the warranty or even come to our house to see for themselves..... These clowns made my family wait 11 days now without a TV/Wii/Playstation/DVR/DVD player to tell us they have determined it to be physical damage... thats almost laughable. Every forum and message board known to man about TV's will be splashed with this story and I pray Samsung loses millions because this is NOT a one time thing!!! Many complaints are already circulating these forums of this same nature.  DONT BUY SAMSUNG!!  THEY NEED TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS IS NOT A 1 TIME INCIDENT!!!
