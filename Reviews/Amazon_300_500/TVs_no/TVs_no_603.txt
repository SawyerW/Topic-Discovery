It took me a couple of months to decide on a 3D tv to purchase.  It wasn't that I wanted a 3D tv, I just needed a new tv and figured I had better get one that is 3D capable.Now, if you are like me and want to get a 3D tv, but aren't sure what to get, let me help you out.  I chose this TV over other LCD tv's for two reasons.  1) I went to several retail stores and watch the Samsung and Sony LED/LCD tv's and was even able to compare this tv side by side with a the Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV.  My conclusion was simple, the plasma has better viewing angles and contrast than the LCDs.  Trust me, viewing angle makes a huge difference with the 3D.Now, as for 3D content, I got Monster vs. Aliens and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs... both look fantastic.  But were I was blown away was when I downloaded WipWout HD on Playstation 3.  The 3D graphics are stunning.  I mean really stunning... it is like nothing you have ever seen before.The best way to describe the 3D effect on this tv (and all active shutter TV's I have seen) it to compare it to looking into a box.  Most of the 3D effect goes deeper inside the TV.  It is kindof like looking out a window and seeing beautiful landscapes stretched out before you or seeing deep space.  Some of the effect pop out of the screen (in the beginning of M vs. A there is a guy playing paddle ball and everyone jumps when he hits the ball out of the screen).As for non-3D content, this is the best TV I have ever owned for watching movies and sports.  The contrast is amazing.  For video games, I still like my Sharp LCD (mostly because of the brightness).  Of course as more 3D games come out, I will probably grow to love this TV even more.All in all, great buy!!! Don't waste your money on the LED/LCD's because this tv is way better and less expensive.
