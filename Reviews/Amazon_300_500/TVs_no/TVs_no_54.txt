Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. &#60;br /&#62;<br />
