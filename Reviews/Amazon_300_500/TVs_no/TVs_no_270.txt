After a lot of research and direct side-by-side comparisons in electronic stores I decided for the Samsung HPT4254. It had the by far best picture and detail among its competitors and outstanding connectivity. I prefer plasma over LCD because the picture looks more natural. 720p is beyond the human eye's resolution unless you are watching this 42' TV from less than 6 foot...we watch from a 10-15 foot distance and for that purpose 1080p is truly a waste of money.I did not regret my decision. I purchased through Amazon.com, EGL called and delivered the TV at a time specified by me in less than 1 week, and unpacked and inspected the TV for me (free shipping/white glove delivery). Very convenient and I saved hundreds compared to local electronic stores.Picture and sound are excellent. HDTV is breathtaking out of the box but some tweaking of settings is necessary to get the perfect picture (easy on-screen navigation). I was concerned about the quality of standard definition, but even in wide screen mode (stretch from 4:3 to 16:9)) of standard TV, picture quality is great. Samsung's burn-in protection does the job well. I fell asleep a few times and the DVR stopped with a still-image for quite some time without any signs of burn in; there was some image retention which cleared within a minute of watching regular TV.Sound is absolutely clear and more than adequate - if you are someone who needs base to shake walls, get your separate sound system...no built in TV speaker will suffice. I have an expensive sound system connected but have rarely felt the need to use it.A minor point of criticism is that changing channels takes about two seconds and there is a message ("searching for signal"). Also, there is occasionally some image retention even without a still picture.Overall - I am more than satisfied with my purchase although I am quite picky if it comes to electronics. Highly recommended!
