I just upgraded to this from a 60" Sony rear projection SXRD set.  The picture quality difference is amazing.  With this set, the picture is sharper, colors are more natural, and dark scenes pull amazing detail because of the black levels and contrast ratio.Setup was pretty easy, and took less than 30 minutes to put the TV on the stand, hook it up to my system, and go through initial setup.  I have done some calibration, and the picture is very natural, with deep blacks and nice tonality.Lots of reviewers have complained about poor sound quality.  From my very brief listen, I would agree, but it's irrelevant if you have a separate sound system.  If sound is important to you, getting even a basic surround sound system would be much better than the TV sound..I've played a bit with the online apps.  Youtube is a bit of a pain, but most remote-driven Youtube implementations I've seen kind of stink.  Lack of onscreen options and slow data entry make for a less than satisfying experience.  They should set up some kind of web-based interface where you can connect your computer to the TV through the network and paste video URLs in from YouTube.  Someone please do this!  Pandora is quite nice, and I think I'll use this often.  The first HDMI input supports Audio Return Channel, so if your receiver also supports ARC, you can pipe the sound from Pandora or Youtube or the other online apps (including Hulu and Netflix) back to your receiver via HDMI.  Makes hooking it up very nice as I only needed to connect a single HDMI cable back to your receiver.Overall I'm very happy and impressed with this TV.  I haven't really looked at a Plasma for several years, and Panasonic has really raised the bar for picture quality at this price.
