I was leaning toward the LNS3238 sold at Walmart for $900 (plus 7% tax = 963) at first, but found the LNS3251 on Amazon (sold by Amazon for $1030, no tax, free shipping.) I called Samsung to get comparision info between the two. The LNS3251 has 4000:1 contrast ratio and a couple more inputs such as for Ipod, etc while the LNS3238 has 3000:1 contrast ratio. I was still reluctlant to buy a big ticket and delicate item online, but decided to give it a try after reading the reviews here, and I am glad I did. I ordered it on 1/17/07 and Eagle delivered it yesterday. Reading the reviews here, I expected Eagle to open the box and set it up for me, but they did not. I did not really mind since it was such a minor task. However I would still rather have them open the box in case of any damage.  My review would be similar to most of the reviews here: great picture but audio could be better. Overall, it is a great TV for the price.CON: This TV generates quite a bit of heat for a LCD TV. On a side note, I bought a 40" Sony LCD TV 6 months ago. At that time, I really liked the Samsung 42" plasma but it generated too much heat. I could not place my hand on its screen for more than a few seconds. It was that hot. TV's from other brands did not feel that hot compared to the Samsung. That's why I decided to buy a LCD instead of a plasma at that time. Now, this 32" Samsung LCD seems to generate more heat than its LCD competitors also.Remember to register your product online within 10 days of purchase.
