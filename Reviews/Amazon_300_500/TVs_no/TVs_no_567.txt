The TV does what it is supposed to for the most part. I also bought the 3dTV from samsung to go along with it (6900)For optimal calibration go to this site. I found it very helpful, and does the TV justice.[...]What I liked:- Lots of inputs, HDMIs, opticals, PC inputs and the like- Picture clarity and blacks are stunning, post calibration (football games in particular)- Panel does not get too warm, a huge plus, after extended viewing- Anynet function very good and detects things quickly- Netflix, Pandora is seemless- clean, non pixelated picture- SRS sound terrific given the small space it occupies- Watching "watchmen" the ultimate test in blacks holds up well.What I did not like:- lack of a QWERTY key board means it renders facebook and other applications useless- lack of wireless on the TV, and need a $79 samsung specific dongle, or feed the LAN connection directly, or use the 3d blu ray player with wifi.- does not send dolby digital signal out via the optical cable (disables it, sends 2 channel PCM)- need Wireless -N signal for seemless service, G wont work seemlessly, Netflix will get stuck- SD programming with bars on the side does not auto wide and fill the screen (something Philips did: my old TV did)- there is slight buzz after extended viewing, but supposedly normal- every input has to be programmed for seperately (TV, Blu Ray)...no auto feature to replicate- Remote control included should be be universal, and is not.Neither here nor there:-3d viewing is OK, can give you a headache...Panasonic viewing was better-2dto3d pretty impressive given the original was not shot that way, but again warning against extended viewingFor best HD viewing, give direct HDMI ins from Bluray, and Cable set top box. Sending signals through recievers, can pollute video signals (pixels) once in a while.Still not sure whether to tack on a 4 year warranty or not.Will update after 30 days or so.
