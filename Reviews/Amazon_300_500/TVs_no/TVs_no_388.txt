sony tv at my local stores was over $2200, one national store ran a  sale for $1700 plus tax and delivery. Amazon offered the product for $1450 including delivery and set-up. as for set up the delivery people would only open the box but not turn it on saying it was to cold and would damage the tv. had to wait 24 hours to turn on tv. this was dissapointing, but just watched my old set for another day. doing the set up took quit awhile, as i did not like the colors as they were in the preset mode so i had to experiment with different combinations over several days until i got what i wanted. have been told most people like the factory settings. well at my age my eyes even with glasses are not perfect so i wanted it my way. did not like the sound from the tv. i have a older (about 10 year old) sony top of the line surround sound system that does not accept hdmi cables so my sound even when i hooked up the surround system was not as good as with the old tv. after reading the instructions for my old system i found it had a fiber optic input for digital souund which i did not no was there. local stores wanted $75 for the calble but i found the same cable on ebay for $25 the end result was i now have fantastic sound and i am happy. bought the sony s550 blue ray on sale for $309 (reg $400). a week later i found out that they have a new  improved model s560 for $350 wish i would have known. the setup for the blue ray was real easy and i love the upconvert of my old dvds. they give a great sound and a great picture. i bought this model cause it was the top of the line, the xbr was out of stock, dont no if the lower models deliver the same performance but with this being my first lcd tv i wanted a top of the line model. when i replace the bedroom set i will look at some of the lower models as i dont watch that tv very often. I have had the tv for one month so far and would recommend it to anyone.
