Highly recommended. I've had this television for nearly 2 months ...all I can say is WOW...WOW.  What a great picture.  Running it with the THX Pre-set.  Deep, deep blacks.  Very "film-like" quality to the picture.  Vivid color.  Great 3D.  Got the Avatar package for additional 2 sets of glasses.  The 3D effect is as good as when I saw it in the movie theater.  3D viewing great from most any seating position.  I am extremely pleased with this TV.  Constantly noticing how much better the picture is compared to the LCD that it displaced.This television is my 3rd HDTV.1st is a 30" Sony XBR Bravia CRT (i.e glass picture tube)-2003.  2nd is a 46" Sony XBR Bravia LCD-2006. I have been complelely satisfied with both those TVs.I was all set to buy another Sony XBR Bravia.  Wanted a larger screen.  Put a premium on picture quality and reliability.  Wanted 3D but it was not a must have.  The ratings for this Panansonic TV have been all quite good.  But, I was a little worried about buying a Plasma ... not as popular as LCD-LED, burn-in concern and power consumption.This TV was significantly less money (especially when you include the extras required to watch 3D).  The Sony XBR Bravia 3D TV ratings were not quite as good. I understand that the Sony 3D LCD-LED TVs exhibit some 3D "ghosting" and have 3D viewing position limitations.BTW, the 1st TV was delivered DOA. But, I am sure it was caused by the person who delivered it.  He was rolling the box end over end up my sidewalk because he was delivering it alone, did not have/use a handcart to bring it to the house from the truck ... and didn't ask for help from me.  It was too late to stop him because I saw it as I was opening my front door. The stress on such a large piece of glass caused it to have a fracture right down the middle of the screen that you could see if you used a flashlight examine it.  Amazon was great about getting a replacement to me with no problems.
