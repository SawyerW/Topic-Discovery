Overall, this TV provides a very high quality viewing experience. The number of features in this TV justifies its higher price tag. Luckily, I got it while it was on sale for $[...] (CAD).Blurays are extremely clear and vibrant, and paired with a PS3, gaming is taken to a new level of immersion. Colours are accurate and video noise is minimal. The Motionflow technology is a great addition for certain types of movies and games, and enhances the overall realism. I haven't tried HDTV over the air yet; I need to get an antenna first!The XMB menu system is very convenient and will be familiar to PS3 users. The menu is very fluid and fast and eye catching. The built-in speakers sound great, but with a TV like this, it's almost a requirement to have a surround sound system. Visually, the TV looks very classy with its minimalist design and would fit in with any decor.One of the main selling points of this TV is the ethernet connectivity, in my opinion. With DLNA-certified software installed on a PC on the network, one can access videos, photos and music with a touch of a button. Internet access is also great, with Youtube about one second away from whatever you happen to be watching. Multiple HDMI ports and a USB port ensure you have sufficient connectivity options for miscellaneous devices.I've had this TV for about 3 days and I noticed some clouding when the screen went completely black. This is a caveat with LCD technology and this TV is no exception. The clouding is not noticeable whenever there is something playing on the screen; only when the screen is completely black does one see some clouding in the corners of the screen.Aside from the clouding, this TV is perfect and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a 50+ inch screen.
