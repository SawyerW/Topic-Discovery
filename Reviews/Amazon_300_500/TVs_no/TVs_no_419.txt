First, I'm not much of a TV guy, so I can't really rate the picture quality. To me it looks great, but I don't have much to compare it to.I am however, an engineer who does embedded software development for a living. And that means that I recognize a firmware bug when I see one. And I've seen three after only about two weeks of usage. And that's with the latest available firmware as of 02/2010, version 1.08We use this TV for two purposes:1.) To connect our family computer to it (via HDMI) and enjoy the nice 1920x1080 resolution2.) To watch some HDTV content which we receive via an outdoor antenna - using the built-in ATSC tuner.Here are the problems so far:1.) Whenever we switch to the PC (via HDMI) we can still hear sound from the TV channel. It's very faint, but it's audible - especially since we sit directly in front of the TV when using the PC. This is reproducable - not just a one-time event.2.) Once, when watching ATSC TV, reception was poor and the TV went into a "loop" always repeating the last 3-5 seconds of video and sound - similar to an old vinyl record that skips... This stopped only when we changed the channel and then went back to the original channel. So far this only happened once, but it looks like the internal error handling for ATSC TV is not foolproof.3.) When switching from HDMI (PC mode) to TV, we had no sound. Volume was turned on, but we heard nothing. Eventually we increased the volume to what would have been quite loud, and finally the sound came back - suddenly and loudly. We were than able to decrease the sound back to the regular range without it disappearing.None of these are real serious problems, but they leave the impression that the firmware is still a bit immature...I would have still rated it 4 stars, had it not been for Philips customer support who so far has sent me nothing but meaningless pre-canned replies when I alerted them to these problems....At the end of the day though - we don't regret the purchase.
