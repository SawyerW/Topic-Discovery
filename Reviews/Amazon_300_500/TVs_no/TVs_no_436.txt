This is my firs plasma HDTV, and I am truly amazed at what a great TV one gets for 600 dollars. The reason I purchased this particular HDTV from others with similar features was in part because it was 100 dollars less than the others, but it was also because it was from a well known electronic giant that has always produced high quality products PANASONIC. I would say my decision was based on 10 percent price and 90 percent brand-name. The picture on this TV is outstanding when connected to an HD source like cable, over the air, and of course from a blue-ray player. It is truly a picture quality one would expect from a 1,500 dollar set, simply amazing. The picture from a standard definition signal is good, but not great, yet it is still above your average LCD or tube type non HDTV set. In order to truly appreciate an HDTV especially a plasma like this one, one has to connect it to an HD source, but if one is not available standard definition still looks very good on this Panasonic.The sound on this Panasonic is very good for being built in speakers. Most tv's fall short in this department not this one. The features and connections are good. I especially like the fact that it has a port for an SD card. This Panasonic also has a lot of customization features that are very useful, and will allow you to dial the picture and sound to ones liking. The only thing missing from this great plasma is a computer connection. I really would of liked to be able to connect it to my computer other than that I strongly recommend this outstanding plasma HDTV from Panasonic, you will not be disappointed. Panasonic is a high quality manufacturer, and it shows in this Plasma HDTV. The finish on the set is a high gloss piano finish that states pure elegance. Outstanding!P.S Amazon's white glove delivery was outstanding. White glove meaning that it was delivered, carried in, and was even set up in my living room. For free!
