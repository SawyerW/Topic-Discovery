I was excited to have my new LN46A650 delivered today. From what I had read from the reviews and from my other research I had one fear about the TV, reflection from the screen surface. I'm sad to report I am going to be returning my Samsung for a model with a flat/matte finish on the screen.I was really disappointed when I turned this on. The reflections from the windows were terrible.My setup has the TV on a wall which is parallel to an exterior wall with (2) 30x60 windows approximately 10 feet away. The glare IMO is unbearable, bad enough that I am willing to pay the return shipping charges. I also see quite a bit of glare from a floor lamp I have in the corner of the room. It surprises me very much that this is not an issue for more people.I went as far as taking my Westinghouse LCD off the wall in my bedroom and setting it up right next to the Samsung to compare the amount of glare between the two. The cheapy Westinghouse wins hands down. No reflections whatsoever with the Westy, but with the Samsung I can actually see my neighbors house very clearly out the window in the reflection in the screen. The reflections are worse with dark screens, but are still noticeable while watching a baseball game.The picture is the best I've ever seen, and the "Touch of Red" gives it a classy look, but if you have a worry about windows reflecting on the screen, I would suggest going with a model that does not have the glossy/glass finish screen. If you are building a home theater where reflection is not an issue or if you always watch TV in the dark then this is probably the TV for you. But if reflections in the screen bother you I would think long and hard before buying this TV.
