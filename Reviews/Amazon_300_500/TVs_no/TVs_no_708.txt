I was looking for another LCD, after returning my Toshiba 40G300U 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black Gloss). I was going to buy a Sony BRAVIA EX 500 Series 40-Inch LCD TV, Black, but the Brandsmart associate swung me a deal for this LCD, which would be bigger than the Toshiba and the Samsung LN40C630 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black), which I already own. Not to mention, I have familiarity with LG's because I also own a LG 37LG30 37-Inch 720p LCD HDTV. What I love about this LCD television is the many, many picture options. I will give my opinion of each one.TruMotionThis is the best feature of this LCD. It gives the user, what is called the "soap opera" affect. I already know how this works because this is a major feature of the Samsung, The Tru Motion feature rivals that LCD.Clear Voice IIThe sound of this LCD is one of the best of the LG LCDs. The Clear Voice II amplifies the human voice on the LCD. I really noticed this, while playing Call of Duty Black Ops. I noticed when voices are heard, they are much louder than the actual sound.Picture WizardThis feature is great, in my opinion. This option shows a picture of a painting, which lets you adjust the black levels, tint, color etc. The painting is just to show the user how the picture will look, once you go back to watching a program. The changes will be saved to the picture mode, which is called ISF/Expert Mode.AV ModeThis feature is just a quick way to change the picture settings, without going to the menu. I already know about this feature because I already own another LG LCD.Energy SavingThis mode is OK. I like to put it on minimum. It dims the LCD picture, slightly. If you go beyond that selection, the screen dims, tremendously.Intelligent SensorThis feature is similar to the Energy Saving feature because it dims the screen.SimplinkThis mode has improved from previous LG models. Now, if you hook another device up, you can access it by way of the LG remote.The VerdictThis LCD is a steal. Not to mention, the picture and color rivals the Sony and Samsung, as far as picture quality. What makes this LCD great is the options. You will not be limited to how you want your picture to be. It took a while, but here are some great picture settings for this LCD:Aspect Ratio: 16:9Picture Mode: Expert 1Energy Saving: MinimumBacklight 75Contrast 90Brightness 40H Sharpness 80V Sharpness 80Color 70Tint 0Expert ControlDynamic Contrast LowNoise Reduction HighDigital Noise Reduction HighBlack Level HighReal Cinema OnColor Gamut StandardEdge Enhancer High
