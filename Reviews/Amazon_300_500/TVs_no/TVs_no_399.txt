I bought this set a month ago from Fry's in CA.  It was on sale for $949 and with tax beat all on-line retailers.  I did the research and viewed the screens in stores.  I live in a small RV and am limited on space and have lots of window light.  The Panasonic plasma was my 1st choice but the plasma is a fragile set as you can not lay them down, they aren't supposed to travel over 5,000' in elevation and I was also concerned with vibration.  So I was considering the Sony 40" and the Samsung 40" but the reviews and specs of the LG along with the 2" of gained viewing space with a fine matte screen attracted me.  I also saw the LG 42" in several 4 and 5 star hotels!  They prefer LG because of reliability.  I have been watching my old VHS movies from a Sony dual player directly connected to the LG via 3 wire component harness.  LG sound is very good!  I have read many complaints about the LCD sets having poor sound, well the LG is great!  Also I have a Sony 1080i upscale DVD player to watch my standard DVD movies.  They look great on this set.  Yesterday I installed my new Sony S-350 Blu Ray player and watched "The Dark Knight."  WOW.  It is like better than the theater!  I could not believe it, even the sound is terrific.  Tonight I want to watch a standard DVD movie because this player up scales to 1080P and the reviews indicate standard movies will look as good as a blu ray.  I will check this out!  Believe me when I tell you there is NOTHING out there that beats the 42LG70's performance with an excellent matte screen with no reflection! By the way, I am using CAT-2 HDMI cables from the Blu Ray player to the Denon Receiver and from there to the LG.  From AMZN seller for under $10 each and that allows 100% transfer of all Blu Ray transfer data!  Too Cool!
