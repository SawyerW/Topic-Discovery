The SONY KBL32BX450 with high definition 1080p is an entry level model with outstanding picture quality. This is a highly recommended HDTV for you.I had researched purchasing HDTV for the bedroom and the SONY is better than the rest (LG, SAMSUNG, PANASONIC and budget models). You pay more for the SONY but you getting a SONY. It is worth the difference. Do not compromise.This is a new 2011 model with basic features. There is no Wifi, this is 60Hz and is not an LED TV (however picture quality compares to LED sets). There are only two HDMI ports that may not be enough for some people. The only "complaint" is the sound quality. You will need to adjust the bass/treble and use the equalizer in Custom Mode. It is the same issue that flat screen sets just don't have great speakers. Regardless, this is an excellent television.There are enough settings with options to calibrate and customize the picture to your liking. It is best to disable the ambient light sensor that restricts the brightness and vivid contrast of the picture. Once calibrated, the picture is awesome. The fleshtones are realistic. There is abundant contrast with the blacks are coal black and whites are bright white. The colors are vivid and vibrant. The set will require picture adjustment and calibration out of the box. Motion blur is almost non-existant for a 60Hz set.The features and specs of this set are well documented. You have a USB port to view pictures and videos.If you are very budget conscience then consider the SONY 720p model KDL32BX320. This is also a great set but you don't pay for the Full HD. If you won't do gaming or watch BluRay then this may be for you. If you are looking to install in your living room then look for a SONY with a larger screen.I purchased this from a store with special grand opening sale but wanted to post review for Amazon folks. I would typically buy from Amazon.
