This is the first time I've purchased a TV online, but I was thrilled with the price and Amazon has always been great, so I trusted purchasing a TV online.It's my first day with the TV, and everything has been great so far.  I look forward to upgrading my digital converter tomorrow for a better picture, but even without it I don't have any complaints. I've read that the sound on these TVs are less than to be desired, but compared to my older TV I don't see any difference, and once I figure out how to set up  my surround sound, I think I will be very happy.  The picture quality is amazing.  I had to adjust a few settings based on prior reviews, because frankly, the picture was too good and I was starting to get dizzy.  After a few adjustments, everything looks great.  My biggest concern was the viewing angles, especially having purchased the TV sight unseen, but no matter where you sit, the picture quality is still remarkably clear.  So far the TV is everything and more than I expected, especially at such an amazing price.My only bad experience was the delivery service.  I appreciated that it was free, but as the old saying goes, "You get what you pay for."  My TV was supposed to be delivered between 9 am and 12 pm, I received a call at 11:40 from Pilot saying that they had car trouble and would deliver the TV a little after noon.  Noon turned into 2, then 3.  I called the corporate facilities for Pilot, and they were not helpful.  I called the local Pilot facility, and the woman said she would call be back in 5 minutes to give me an update.  An hour went by and I had to call again.  Only then did she tell me the TV was 45 minutes away.  I finally received the TV after 5 pm.  All in all, I spent my entire day waiting at home for the delivery guys.  I had work to do, and I was unable to get anything accomplished because of Pilot.  It's a good thing that the TV seems to be worth the wait.
