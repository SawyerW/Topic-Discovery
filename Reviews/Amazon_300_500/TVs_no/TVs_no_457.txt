I have had this TV for a number of weeks now. At first I was intimidated by its size and surprised at how small the manuel is for it. Although I was able to set it up physically, electrically and internally quite easily, I still found it somewhat confusing at times in reference to the internal adjustments (the ones needed for my individual needs and preferences). These adjustments were not always clear nor even defined as to what would happen if I did this or that. But in the long run all came out in the end without to much difficulty. Also, one must be careful when setting it up to keep the screen away from anything that can cause glare or be ready to put curtains up [as I ended up doing :-)].The picture quality of this TV is absolutly stunning. There are  multiple choices of screen size and resolution inputs. Colors are sharp, well defined, clear.I was totally shocked by the quality of sound from this set. I have a Sony Home Theatre System to go with this TV [I like the Bravia Link feature}, but I naturally tried just the TV speakers. There is a simulated surround sound option that is resonably affective. Although it doesn't have the completeness of a home theatre system, but it still has an impressive enough effect on ones audio senses so that one may consider forgoing the entire home theatre system.The remote control was initually intimitating, too, with its miriad of buttons. But with a little practice I found navigation rather straight forward.I did a lot of research, over a year, before deciding on this set. I was still leary when I purchased it. But after these few weeks of ownership I feel I made a great purchase. I don't think one can go wrong with this set. It is hard to beat especially for the price. I paid less than $1000.00 which included the shipping.
