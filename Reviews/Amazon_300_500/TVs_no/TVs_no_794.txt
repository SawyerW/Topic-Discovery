Okay this is my first review but I think it is necessary. I own many different tv types from rear projection, crt, led, lcd, as well as plasmas. This Coby was going into my sons room, so it just needed to have an okay picture, not really expecting much. Well the picture was soo bad I had given up on it within 15 min.Pros:Price - CheapForm factor - Fairly thin but gets thicker in the center section still good thoughCons:Sound - Well it is bad but not really expecting much on an led tv, so you can ignore this con unless your used to other tv types. This didn't affect my rating.Picture - Flash lighting on all four corners! I had brightness turned all the way down and still it was unacceptable. Also this set has the worst clouding issue I have ever seen. When the picture goes even remotely dark, these bright patches of light bleed all over the screen. This alone is grounds for return. And if that isn't bad enough there is a major noise issue with any content. I had the same channel going to this tv and my Samsung lcd and it was like night and day. There were all sorts of artifacts and noise that weren't present in the Samsung. And there are not enough adjustments to make the picture even halfway decent. I didn't even have enough time with the set to check on ghosting but I'm sure that was there too. It didn't matter if it was standard or high definition, the picture was just bad.Summary: I understand this is not a high end tv but it isn't even worth it at the low price its at now. What good is a tv that's unwatchable? Coming from somebody who knows what a good tv picture should look like please stay away from this set. I regret wasting my time with this set and will stick to name brands like I've always done, with exception of this one time. This one is going back.
