I've only had this for a week, but I'm very pleased.  My other large TV is a 50" Pioneer Kuro Elite Plasma, which was almost 5x the price.  I wasn't truly considering this 490d until I saw it in the store, where the picture looked "cleaner" and PQ was equal (to my aging eyes) to the 1080p's it was close to...and I didn't feel the need to needlessly spend money.  My goal was to replace and edge lit LED LCD that was 42" in the family room I decided was too small, and gain internet video which I'll do via a blu ray.  This did that for half the price I was about to spend.  I received 2 free glasses and the 3d is pretty cool...not something I was looking for originally but definitely something we'll continue to use after watching 2 movies so far in 3d.  This looked just as good in 3d as the Panasonic 3d I saw in the Magnolia Display room.  Downside is glare (reflection on the panel) with windows during the day, but it's not a deal breaker for me, and not too severe in my situation - expect some of that with any plasma.  The upside of these reflective screens is a clear, clean picture.  I'm very happy for the price...or should I say I'd be unfortunate to have missed this if I bought something more expensive which I was about to do...just for a bunch of "specifications".I've noticed no degradation in PQ from the 1080p LED this replaced...I've not compared the 2 via blu ray which might reveal that, but I use this TV most of the time @ 1080i fios (down-scaled to 720p I guess now) input and the TV shows look just a great as before- but bigger which is waht I wanted.  No regrets - from someone who knows in most cases "you get what you pay for".
