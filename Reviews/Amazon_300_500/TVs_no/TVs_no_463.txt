The 52V5100 was everything I hoped for from an inexpensive, big-screen, HDTV.Set up was no effort (open box, remove TV, plug in, turn on) but took 20-minutes to find all of the available channels. The 52V5100 found more than I expected.  Not only did it bring in the analogue cable TV channels (I haven't upgraded yet) but also the 50 or so, over the air, digital channels (in the Philadelphia PA area).  Therefore, watching analogue cable looked bad on the big screen but there were also all of the local HDTV channels.  Watching football on Fox was in HD and much, much better than the regular cable version.Once the channels were in it was time to be judgmental.  My last HDTV was a 32-inch LG and I spent two weeks trying to get the colors the way I wanted them.  The 52V5100 was perfect out of the box.  Blacks look ideal in programming however some people's jet-black hair lacked definition (too black?).  Picture quality looked excellent.  No blurring during a football game. Colors looked perfect.  Images look good even at angles.First video test was a standard DVD using an up-scaling DVD player and the images looked very good to me.  No blurring through action sequences.  Two people said that "King Kong" looked fake.  I don't know if that was the movie itself or the player leaving out some detail.Negatives:No picture in picture (get what you pay for).Remote is nothing to be excited about.  It's a little thin with a rounded bottom.  It doesn't have the Sony "return button" that goes back to the last entered channel while channel surfing.  It could be more intuitive by having the primary buttons in the middle.  I've had worse remotes (like Comcast's).Monitor's HDMI slots are mostly on the side of the TV, with only one located on the back.Sound is average.Definitely would recommend.  Price paid at local Mom/Pop TV shop in January 2010 was: $1,199
