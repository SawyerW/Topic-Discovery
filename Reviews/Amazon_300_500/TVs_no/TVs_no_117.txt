I've had this TV for about 5 months now and I've been very happy with it.Back in June 2006, I purchased the Samsung S4095D (1080p LCD) and I had to return it after a month.  The backlight was splotchy and the black levels were really disappointing.  The overall image quality just wasn't very good for a $3000 (at the time) TV.A few months later, I bought the S4253.  At first, I was wary about the relatively low 1024x768 (rectangular pixels!) resolution.  After using it for a week though, I realized that from about 6 feet away, I couldn't tell that the S4253 has a lower resolution.  However, I could definitely see the better contrast ratio and no weird backlight issues.I've been watching upscaled DVDs and playing Wii on it for the past couple of months, and everything looks great.  If you have a Wii, definitely get a set of component cables.  The difference is night and day.The PC input works great too, but you have to uncheck "Hide modes that this monitor cannot display" in the monitor properties tab under Display Properties.  This will let you select 1366x768 resolution, which is a proper 16:9 resolution that matches best with this TV.  If you use 1024x768, the image will be stretched.Pros:- Excellent image quality and contrast ratio with no backlight bleeding or  splotching.- Good sounding speakers (much better than the tinny S4095 speakers)- Lots of inputs in the back and side.  See my photo in the photo gallery above.  I have hooked up a PS2 (component), Oppo 970HD, HTPC, and a Wii (component).- No issues with burn in even after long gaming/TV sessions.- Excellent viewing angles.- Cheaper than LCD TVs.Cons:- Slight green tint.  I think this can be fixed with some color settings tweaks and maybe some tweaks in the hidden service menu, but I haven't really tried.  It's really not very noticeable.- Slight buzzing noise from the back.  I don't notice it unless I mute the TV and listen for it.- Heavier than an LCD TV.Notice that I didn't list the 1024x768 resolution as a con.  A TV that is about 40" or 42" doesn't really need 1080p.  I've seen both and the better image quality of the plasma really outshines the higher resolution of the LCD.
