It's a shame this (and probably all comparable technology) gets bad reviews for what, in many cases, seems to be a blatant lack of understanding on the users part of the technology or how to properly use the product. I love this TV. The image is flawless. Crisp, bright, vibrant and Samsung seems to have the best black to color depth so the image pops in every lighting.Design: 10/10Picture: 10/10Built-In Sound: 7/10Features: 10/10Price: 7.5/10Design:I have mine mounted with the Samsung's 'Ultra Slim Wall Mount' (WMN2000) and between the mount and the minimal depth of the TV's design, it hugs my wall impressively close. I also ran my cables through the wall so I was quite happy o find how easy it was to (while mounted) lift the TV away from the wall and plug in my cables without removing it. (Power cable could have been a tad longer but not that big of a deal)Features:I also have a Samsung blu-ray player and home theater receiver and love how in sync the two were in regards to remote. One I set up my receiver the TV already worked off of that remote without any added hassle. Blu-Ray (240 functionality) and 3D are stunning.Sound:If you plan on using the built in speakers, plan to be unimpressed. The sound from the TV speakers is pretty lame but that's to be expected.Picture:Image quality is where this unit really shines though. My sister has a 50" (also 1080 and 240) but from a lesser/generic brand and the difference in picture is remarkable. It's like looking at an acrylic painting next to a watercolor,, or watching a Pixar movies next to an old school Disney flick like Aladdin. Every thing else seems bland and muted. The image is flawless. Crisp, bright, vibrant and Samsung seems to have the best black to color depth so the image pops in every lighting.Overall:Highly recommend this TV.
