First off, yes I do see banding on vertical and horizontal pans with solid bright back grounds. Its not that bad and if I had never gone on to the AVS forum I would probably never had noticed it. If stuff like that bothers you then don't buy this TV or any other LCD TV in this price range. They all have some sort of artifact type issues. If you don't want any artifacts or motion blur then go plasma. You can go 120hz on a LCD but your going to pay a lot more money for the same TV with a higher refresh rate.The good...I think Sharp has the best overall HD picture and color compared to any other TV in this price range. The colors are fantastic and I like the fact that you can fine tune the TV to your hearts desire. Black levels look good as well. The TV cabinet is well designed and the sound quality is good. SD channels look alright, better then most of the sets that I have seen out there. There is some motion blur on sports but not near as bad as the entry level Sony and Samsung TVs.The bad...As I stated before it does having banding. Don't fool yourself into thinking you will get one with out it, they all have it. I mostly notice it when I am watching football and the camera does a fast side to side pan. I have read that a lot of people have problems watching hockey because banding that is caused by the ice. The remote is not very good. It wont control my Phillips DVD player or my Sony receiver. For some strange reason it does work with my Motorola cable box.If it weren't for the banding this would be a 5 star TV. I have had it for about 3 weeks now with no other technical issues. I will update this review if any think changesCheers
