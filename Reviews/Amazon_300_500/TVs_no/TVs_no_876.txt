Now to start this review off I'll admit that I didn't do enough research on the product before purchasing it so many of my disappointments could have been avoided with more research.First the good:pretty slim around 2" in depthnice screen size fitting a 43" screen in a 42" base600hz refresh rate good for fast motionGreat contrast (of coarse plasma)and that's about it...The no so good:For some reason plasmas aren't 1280 x 720 or 1366 x 768 like LCD 720p televisions but rather 1024 x 768. This translates to a picture that looks like a early 2000's crt computer monitor...just stretched out, so this really isn't a good choice to use as an external display for a computer because your losing 200+ pixels horizontally.Not only for a computer, but other devices will look kind of awkward on this unit also. I must say the xbox 360 formatted the image pretty well though.The next issue was the constant buzzing sound that came from the back of the tv. It wasn't mounted on a wall and we sat about 8 ft. away...but when the sound was low you could here a buzzing CRT TV's usually make (was very annoyed by this).Next issue was the ports.... 2 hdmi, 2 component and a digital out....I was okay with it at first but using this tv for the family room with many devices just wasn't the best fit. In addition when we would try to switch hdmi inputs the TV would have problems adjusting to different devices and would give a message saying "display mode not supported". This was only resolved by using only 1 hdmi and switching the cable from one device to another.And make sure you a dark room for this TV otherwise you'll be watching yourself half the time, the screen is glass so its highly reflective.Also didn't like that the stand doesn't swivel, and the remote is cheap feeling compared to our other Samsung.As you know by now...we sent it back and thanks to amazon for all the assistance. We'll be getting a 1080p LCD.I'd only recommend this unit as a secondary tv or if you have few devices to connect, other than that....get an LCD.....they use less power too.
