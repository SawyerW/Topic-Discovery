I have had this TV for a couple of months now and I absolutely LOVE it.  The picture is amazing and I have no problems when I am watching HD channels.  Sometimes on a couple of channels that are not HD, I do have some lines at the very top of the screen but not in the picture.  It's always on the same 2 channels so I'm not so sure it's the TV and not the cable.  The sound is great when watching TV but we also purchased the recommended blu ray player and need to double the volume when watching a DVD-also not a problem with the TV.  Playing with all of the settings was a little much, I think it's almost too customizable. We stuck with the defaults on most things.  A couple of issues we have had are: there is only one set of plugs on the back for a component meaning our Wii.  We had to get a blu ray immediately because it uses an HDMI cable, which our DVD player doesn't.  It has plenty of HDMI inputs though.  I also got the recommended Linkstik wireless LAN adapter and I have fantastic wifi in the house but the internet TV sometimes freezes after little use when scrolling between apps and the whole system needs to be shut down, I don't have a problem streaming movies though.  Amazon beat the price of the big box electronic stores by several hundred dollars and squaretrade also beat the price on the warranty by a couple hundred.  I was able to schedule delivery it worked out well.  I would buy this tv again and again.  The picture quality is above and beyond any I have seen, and I've seen a lot! I shopped for months for the perfect TV and I pretty much found it with this one.
