I ordered a Samsung LNS3292D on 23 Sep. I also received a message with a projected delivery date of almost 4 weeks. However, the tv actually arrived in the area on 7 Oct. From there, it took a few days to play phone tag and actually set the specific delivery date, but, regardless, it was much sooner than originally projected. I also live about 20min outside a major metropolitan area, so I think that helped, too.All is not well that ends well, however. The delivery man was prompt in bringing my tv, but after about 10 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to get a clear picture on the set, he declared that he had to go and insisted that it was not his job to make sure that the tv was working properly. I have read many horror stories of unaccepted returns, and so I specifically clarified with the dispatcher (prior to the dely) that the delivery man *is* supposed to wait until you can verify that the set is working. In fact, while he was there in my apt, I called the dispatcher and *again* clarified the above, but Mr.Stubborn still refused to wait any longer. [Nonetheless, he spent another 10-15 minutes arguing with me and the dispatcher about it -- during which he refused to give me his full name and refused to give me a copy of the invoice.] So I ended up not accepting the shipment and filing a complaint with Eagle (the delivery subcontractor). I have since talked with Amazon, and they tell me I have to wait until Eagle ships the set back to them (so they can verify the return), at which time they will send a replacement. God only knows how long this will take.Chances are that there was nothing wrong with the set anyway -- I just needed a few more minutes to make sure.  I asked if they could just re-send the same set (hopefully with a different delivery person), but apparently they can't do that.So that's my experience. Hope that helps somebody.
