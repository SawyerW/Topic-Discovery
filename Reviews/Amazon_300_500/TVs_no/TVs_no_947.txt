I have had my Panasonic Plasma GT30 for almost a month now. I was nervous ordering from Amazon because I did not want to go through the return process if it came broken, but the TV came in perfect condition and the delivery man stayed until I had the TV set up and plugged in to make sure it was in perfect condition. I know nothing about TV's and bought this based primarily on other reviews. The final selling point was seeing this TV side by side at a box store with the Samsung 8000 LED, their best TV I was considering. Once side by side I could see the plasma had richer colors so I went ahead and bout it on Amazon. The best thing I can say is the picture is incredible, words can't describe how good it looks, which is what I wanted in a TV. I have not tried all the extra features, but the veracast menu is simple and I will get around to it soon. Netflix works great with this television, I use streaming all the time now. The sound is not great, but none of these flat screens have a good sound, so I bought the sony HT150 sound bar for 300.00 and it sounds great for a minimum price investment.The bad---- One thing I did not like, to get this unbelievable picture, you have to know something about calibration and have a good eye, I don't. I use primarily the THX mode, because everything looks good on that mode, but I went to reviews on line where others have posted their settings and I used some of them in custom settings menu. That was the way to go, I now have the perfect settings for main TV viewing using these settings. One thing you will notice is the picture looks different on many different channels because this TV will show clearly the exact signal coming in. So you need different settings based on the content your using. But if your watching clean 1080 or Blue Ray, you will experience as I did for the very first time what PERFECTION is all about. I recommend you go with this Plasma and not an LED, LED is not quite at this level yet.
