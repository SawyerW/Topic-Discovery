I was looking to buy a second 46" LED for the bedroom and discovered this one (UN46C8000) while browsing. Even without 3D capabilities - I just loved the looks of it as well as the picture quality - plus the internet apps (Netflix, Hulu plus, Vudu, Yahoo widgets etc.). The 3D capability is an added bonus for a couple of hundred dollars more - and a steal with the 3D Blu-ray player and the 3D starter kit bundled in free at the same price.We have watched a few 3D movies in the last week. 3D looks great, very immersive experience even for a 46" display. The 2D --> 3D conversion for regular programming is also pretty impreseive and I am sure will improve with the next versions and as technology evolves.  Internet apps work great - especially love Netflix and Yahoo widgets. Facebook interface sucks - and basically no good.Setting up a Samsung Apps account is very confusing. No clear instructions on where to go and register. You have to go to the Samsung apps home page on the Internet (AND on your PC - not the TV itself) - and register your TV, create your profile and add your credit card to activate your account. The manaul for the TV itself is also very basic and doesn't explain all the features and options in detail. Samsung could have done a better job with it.I have it mounted on the wall with the Samsung ultra low profile mount. Very easy to install and mount (under 30 minutes) and the TV just sticks to the wall like a wall painting..with very little clearance between the wall and the TV. Keep in mind - if you are also plugging in a Samsung USB wireless LinkStick (wifi Lan adapter) - there is not enough space/clearance between the wall and TV and the Linkstick rubs against the wall (atleast in my case).Overall - very happy and satisfied with this TV.
