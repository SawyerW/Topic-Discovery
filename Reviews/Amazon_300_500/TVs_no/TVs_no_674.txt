I bought this TV(UNC8000 LED 3DTV) as an Amazing deal over the holidays. Was 1350 bucks for TV + 3D Blue Ray + 3D pack which included 2 3D glasses and all 4 Shrek movies in 3D. Reviews were positive on Amazon for this TV and so I just went for it, although after using this awesome TV, I feel like I should have got the largest one on the market. :PI have never owned an LCD/LED TV before so this TV just blew off my mind. The picture quality is crisp and bright. The TV is so thin, that when it arrived I was trying to figure out where the connection sockets could be! The TV is surprisingly thin and light, mounted easily on my rotating TV stand. I dont have a home theater system yet, but the speakers are pretty good for such a slim TV!I also ordered the Samsung 3D Blue ray as a part of the deal. It didnt come with an hDMI cable so for now am using AV cables to view the output. I think for that reason 3D output is not so gr8 yet, waiting for my HDMI 1.4 cable(remember you need HDMI 1.4 compatible: cables, Blue Ray player and home theater systems for playing 3D) to arrive. However, I enabled ESPN 3D (programming is not 24hrs yet) but from what I saw, ESPN in 3D looked fantastic, not as gr8 as I had expected though. I had seen a Sony 3DTV demo, and I feel it was better but its just too expensive.Anyone still undecided about whether to buy 3D or non-3D, I will say buy it. In a few years time everyone will move to a 3D TV eventually and you dont want to be stuck with a relatively new non-3D TV.Pros: Sharp, Beautiful picture, Slim & light, gr8 speakers, sleek remote, couple of useful Internet apps (esp. Netflix).Cons: Nothing major, except for the 3D quality, which is okay not the best, Typing using the remote is very slow, Apps load a little slow for someone used to crisp apps on the computer!Its running gr8 so far. Been a month of 10-12hr/day continuous usage so far and am loving it!
