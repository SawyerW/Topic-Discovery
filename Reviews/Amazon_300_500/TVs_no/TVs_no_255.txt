This TV is everything I wanted it to be. I don't mean to sound like a shill, but there are so many reasons I'm happy with this television. I was buying without any experience with the brand, but it has really proven itself with this unit.It was easy to set up; you just screw in a few bolts with the parts included. The actual television is so modern and stylish. I've so enjoyed just looking at it and admiring the smooth, glossy finish. The actual picture quality is great, though I have to admit I have yet to plug in a 1080p source [there are plenty of other reviews that would confirm that aspect's quality, I'm sure]. Everything is definitely grainier because of showing low resolution sources on a hi-def screen, but I'm absolutely confident that when I get a 360 hooked up later on, it'll be splendid [those HDMI ports are just waiting for love]. The physical screen, by the way, is great; it's TFT, meaning it's more matte than shiny, and thus easier to see with light on it.The menu was a big deal to me; I'm still enjoying the clean, attractive interface, but the main thing I like so much is how easily some functions work with the remote. Since I'm using sources that aren't hi-def, I like to stretch them out to the edge of the screen. The remote has a button [view mode] to switch through several stretched-out viewing settings, and I've found that really useful. A few other useful features of the remote are being able to customize several "favorite channel" buttons, a button to turn on a backlight behind the remote's buttons, and a button to quickly switch through inputs.The speakers are really quite excellent for something /included/ in a television; they're good and loud [I've never turned them more than halfway up], though they lack a little bottom end [and with good reason; where the hell would they stick a subwoofer?].That's all I have to say, really; if anyone has any questions about my experiences with this TV, I'll be willing to try to answer them.
