With the upcoming years in electronics coming up, the whole television signal will be completely changed from the traditional NTSC analog, to the ATSC signal, many people don't know which kind of a television to buy. Although it is tough, many people can't afford the HDTV's, many are considering EDTV's, and SDTV's instead. Sylvania does know that feeling for all consumers. They've definitely made some of the best quality electronics on the market, and still bring out the best that is affordable. This television does bring out that theory well for anyone who wants a new television.The Sylvania LD200SL8 is a 20 inch LCD television is a lightweight and convient DTV to buy, at a affordable price. The television is easy to setup and easy to operate. At a lightwieght 17 pounds, it is easy to place on your entertainment center, or hang on your television mount. The television also is sleek, and includes a DVD player that works well. It is compatable to nearly all DVD playback compatablities. It is capable of playing DVD+/-RW discs in Video mode only (not VR mode as the case with Sylvania's DVD recorders), MP3 CD's and traditional CD's. The sound really is great to listen to in crisp dolby digital sound for your favorite movies and television shows. The display is delightful and looks great, and elequently well for your cable box, as well video game systems like the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. There is one disadvantage, you can't change the screen from 16x9 widescreen, unless you have a HD converter box or antenna.All in all, the Sylvania LD200SL8 is a great TV/DVD combo at an affordable price for those who trust Sylvania, and for anybody on a budget. I really like Sylvania's brands of electronics, and I really recommend this for anyone who wants to change with the times, but not strectch so much out of the price.Price: B+Convience: B+Easy To Use: B 1/2+DVD Playback: BOverall: B 1/2+
