First time product review so, be kind.The Toshiba Regza 42HL167 is a phenominal value.  I wish that were all there is to say about the set, but, it's not.  So, let me continue:  You're getting 1080p resolution, an over-the-air tuner (most still don't have a built-in tuner), plenty of high-quality connections (including HDMI, DVI, Component, etc.), and the ability to fine tune all of your color settings to the nth degree.  When you put all of that along side Amazon's prices, and your bang for the buck get's huge.That said, why didn't I give this set 5 stars?  Well, that's pretty simple.  Out of the box, the picture on this TV looks pretty horrible.  On [...] there's a pretty lengthy discussion of the green push on these sets.  Basically, many of these sets seem to have their green levels jacked through the roof.  It affects the quality of your dark levels and even just some simple shade.  It really makes some of your first movies look horrible.  To sum up, I'm docking this TV a star for such a bad out of the box experience.  I don't think you should have to spend an hour+ callibrating your set to get a good picture.  Fine tuning, sure... but these color settings weren't even in the ballpark.Anyway, after spending some quality time callibrating the set, the picture is just gorgeous.  Even using my Xbox 360 to upconvert my DVDs, the picture is great!  After all was said and done, I couldn't be happier with the TV.  The picture is great!  Halo3 in 1080p is a beautiful thing, and, all of the content I throw at this TV looks fantastic... I just can't wait to put HD DVD or Blu Ray.To sum up, as long as you're willing to spend some time working on your picture, you'll end up with a fantastic looking TV.  If playing with your settings is something you're not interested in, I'd suggest you stay away.
