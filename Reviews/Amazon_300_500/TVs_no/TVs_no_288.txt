I bought my Aquos almost a year ago for about $1250 after conducting an excessive amount of research into features, pricing and, most importantly, picture quality.  This TV has been fabulous and I don't regret buying it for a second.  The picture clarity and the pop of the colors is unparalleled.  Even in the store I noticed that the picture jumped out compared to the rest of the screens, including the Samsung TVs that I was comparing it most closely.  The 4ms refresh rate makes watching HD sports an absolute pleasure.  The box itself is a thing of beauty and spectacular engineering, the built-in speaker sound is more than adequate for regular TV viewing, and I find the remote to be sufficiently solid and intuitive.  If I had to make a complaint, I suppose that having the third HDMI port on the side of the TV is a little less useful that just having it in the back with the rest of them, but I haven't used it much.  Also, my Sharp Blu-Ray player (which I received for free with the TV) is less of a quality product, but it syncs up easily with the TV.  I'd probably get a Playstation 3 instead if I were purchasing from scratch, but hey, it was free so I can't complain (too much).  I also don't know how well the wall-hanging function works as I have it on the stand, but it is spectacularly thin so I would imagine that it would look great on a wall as well.Finally, I can't attest to the quality of Sharp's customer service, nor of the various vendors that Amazon lists, but I can say without reservation that the machine itself works wonders.  I have had no banding issues or exploding parts, nor any other problems.  With the prices dropping down under $900, this TV is a bargain that performs as well as many others listed at double the price.
