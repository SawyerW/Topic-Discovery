My brand new Sony KDL46BX420 is about 10 hours old and after 48 minutes on the phone with a clueless Sony "technician", it has been declared officially "in need of repair." It has not worked for a single minute. Will Sony replace it? No. Will Sony send a repairman? (Are there still TV repairmen?) No. Sony will give me a telephone number. I am supposed to call, set up an appointment and, if I'm lucky, just take a single day off work waiting and praying for him to show up.This is the third Sony in my house (the other two work great, thanks) but the first two were made years ago when Sony cared about quality and still topped the charts in Consumer Reports. No more.I had done a lot of research and knew the BX-line was the bottom of the line for Sony, but I didn't want 3D or "motion flow" or internet connectivity. I just wanted a good, solid TV.Forget it. This TV screams "cheap." It is made entirely of shiny, black plastic that reflects every light in the room. And, oh yeah, it doesn't work.I will revisit this review if/when the set gets fixed, but as for now I would avoid the BX-line.Or, better yet, avoid Sony and try a Samsung. I sure will next time.UPDATE TO REVIEW, June 9, 2011:Well, the repairman just left and after he fiddled with the controls a little - - admitting that he wasn't sure what each one did - - he said the best he could do was get me a "decent" picture and poor sound. He also said that it was clear the Sony technician didn't know what he was doing and that it was best to always call Sony during regular business hours in order to get a technician in this hemisphere."If I were you, I would get an LG next time," he said. "They are really good."Good to know for "next time." No more Sonys for me.
