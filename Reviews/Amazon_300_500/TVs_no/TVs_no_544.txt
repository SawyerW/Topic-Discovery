This is my 8th Sony TV; nary a one has been a disappointment, especially since the advent of the HDTV age. For comparison, I purchased a Samsung 55" plasma which provides a beautiful picture and video playback; however, none of the 3 Sony LCD picture qualities currently in the house are challenged. I just convinced my next door neighbor to buy the 40" KDL-EX500 version from Amazon (I bought all of mine from Sony.com) after he saw the picture my 46" unit put out. We also have a 3rd gen. KDL 32" Bravia as well as a 40" Google TV which is superb in every aspect EXCEPT the interface device, which is not backlit, small, difficult to navigate in the dark, etc. The picture it produces is, esp. using Blu-ray technology, nearly palpable.Back to the issue at hand, specifically, the BRAVIA KDL-46EX500 y 120Hz 46-Inch LCD, the best advice when you spend this much money on technology is to get and use a Crutchfield HDTV calibration DVD to get the proper settings for the surroundings. Most surround sound systems are overkill and people, IMHO, tend to equate 1000 watts of power as starting points for good sound. Most professional guides and websites (did I say [...]?) will provide excellent advice on sound systems and wave propagation dependent on the shape and size of the room, etc. It can make all the difference in the world whne you;re watching a creepy show and you KNOW someone is sneaking up behind you! That's why this accessible and relatively inexpensive technology is so much fun to have in the home.Figure out what size set you need, read the professional AND user reviews, wait for the sales, and buy yourself a Sony. And a 3 to 4 year warranty JUST IN CASE something happens. One more caveat: there is NO evidence that Monster cables are any better or faster than any other HDMI cables on the market no matter WHAT the sales kids tries to tell you. This is one item where you can definitely save a LOT of money if you shop around. Good luck and Happy Viewing!
