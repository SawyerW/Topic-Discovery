I bought this tv on black Friday and I was so excited for it. I plugged it in and it didnt have sound... I was really angry until the sound came on about 30 seconds later. I shrugged it off. Later while watching movies or tv the screen would shift to the left about 10 inches leaving only black screen on the right side. Also the sound going in and out kept happening. Notice this is 2 problems. I called philips and they said they would gladly send a technician. They called the next day giving ME a number to call to have the people come fix it. The company was 2 hours away and said they didnt travel this far. So I called philips. Once again the next day they gave me a number to call. That place was 3 hours away. Finally I called again and they said they would call me back the next day. Finally they decided to send me a "new" tv as they called it. I waited for a week and it arrived. I dismounted my broken tv and replaced it with the "new" one. Then I packed up my old tv and shipped it back to philips. I turned my "new" tv on and it had no sound and a black line through the screen as if it were missing a line of pixels. I called philips to find out what the heck was going on. They said they could send me an actually new tv since my REFURBISHED one was not working. I said there was no way I wanted a philips product again because I was 2 for 2 on getting broken ones. There is a theme here of bad service and unreliable products. Needless to say I called them today asking what they were going to do to help me out. Nothing. They could let me file to get my money back from them. I could get no compensation for all my time on the phone and my lugging around of 2 100 pound tvs. BUYER BEWARE.
