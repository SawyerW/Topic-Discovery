Just got this yesterday, it was delivered by a UPS guy, who brings to our door single-handedly by himself and we're at a 2nd floor without elevator. I was really nervous ordering something this big on amazon because you cant return this 'cuz amazon has only in home warranty repair on TV's. Even though amazon has this policy where the ordered TV should be unpack on delivery and you should inspect if there something broken, you can refuse to sign so there wouldnt be a burden on you because you cant return the TV... or something like that. Anyhow, when he were about to give me his portable thingy to sign, I ask him if he were instructed to unpack this, and he said he's only here for delivery, so I signed.  I inspected the box, it looks like its well taken care, I unpack and connected it thru my PC, I open up pixel detector buddy and carefully inspected dead pixels, there were NONE. I open up bunch of video files and this TV has gorgeous black, the colors are great. Exterior looks great, it has glossy piano black exterior. I was opting for 32 inch of the same model but amazon.com doesn't ship to Hawaii. This TV is just a bit bigger than my 2407FPW Dell monitor. The speaker a bit weak, but then again, for its size, this is just good only for small rooms and not on living room, yeah I use this on my room. My only consolation for TV is that I hope to get the Mustang wall mount for free via rebate. I would have bought 32" model on reputable store on pricegrabber.  What I hate about this TV is the headphone jack, would been great if they put it on the side. PIP isnt a dual tuner PIP, you cant have 2 TV station on your TV at once. Its either a tuner and other TV inputs. This thing should last about 3 or 4 years or until LCD TV can do full 1080 resolution.[...]
