I have been shopping around for TVs for a long time.  I had a pretty strict budget, but I wanted a TV that I would not constantly be desiring to replace.  After a while it came down between this and the Panasonic TC-P42S2 plasma.  Since I live in pretty high elevation in Colorado Springs (over a mile high), it would be safer to go with LCD.  I bought this TV for $624.04 price matching with Ultimate Electronics at Best Buy.  Set-up was quite easy (I used CNET calibration settings, the only thing I boosted was color).  The TV looked fantastic!  Clarity was astounding and colors were quite vibrant (It seemed at the time).  No comment on the sound (I have surround sound), but I wouldn't expect much.  After watching for a bit I did notice some motion blur (Quite common in LCD's, can be lightened by buying 120hz sets but that in itself can have undesirable side effects such as the "soap opera" feel).  The blur was not near as bad as many 60hz LCDs I have seen, but it did give me a bit of a headache.  Then I went over to a friend's house and saw his Insignia plasma. Colors looked much more accurate and better yet, there was no blur.  I did not hear any buzzing or other problems usually associated with plasmas at high altitude.  I returned this set for the Panasonic TC-P42S2, and I am glad I did.  I have had the plasma for a while and I feel the plasma TV outdoes LCD in about every way (especially colors and blacks-I never knew blacks could be so black until the Panasonic).  I still give this TV a good rating.  If you can deal with a little motion blur, some lighter colors and blacks, and do not want to spring for plasma, this is the TV for you.
