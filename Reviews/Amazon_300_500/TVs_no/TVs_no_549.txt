I'm a non techie.  I read a bunch of reviews.  I try to learn the basics and then I proceed to the check out line...in this case the check out button.  Oh yeah, in the case of a tv, I like to take a peek.  I decided that it was a bit of a riot to not look at the tv I was going to purchase, I mean, instead of looking at the tv, everybody is reading the specs.  Its sort of like looking for a date on match.com vs. seeing the real deal.  So, I looked to see what appaealed to me regardless of price.  Then I asked myself "why" does this appeal to me? The Sony's picture was very pleasing, to my eye. The other pleasing tv's were about 2-3 times the price...led skinny guys.  I was drawn to the Sony for its "warm" colors.  Possibly other sets could be set up to match it, but that was my personal experience.I wanted a larger tv, but again "large" is subjective, it used to be 21".  I have a 32 and was replacing it so...I liked the LED tv's "skinniness" but I have to admit, I didn't think that it was worth the price for that feature :)  Then I read all the specs and the reliability stuff.  The Sony had more stuff than I thought i would ever use...I'm not a gamer and I'm not a big volume turner upper.I also have a Dell and a Samsung.  Both great pics.  The Dell has this problem where it turns it self off or else its hard to turn on.  The Samsung's pic is great; however, it is a more "saturated" bolder brighter pic that feels a tad aggressive to me.I have a blue ray and i am contemplating some surround speakers...maybe.  Sometimes all that stuff feels a tad aggressive for listening to the news...I mean every time I turn on the tv it's not "an event".I have to admit, I like seeing the name Sony in front of me.  I'm a boomer and Sony was always the top dog in my memory.  I didn't get an extended warranty...not sure why...I hate dealing with that stuff and getting frustrated, but maybe i will.  Any advice would be appreciated :)Bottom line, as they say, I'm ver pleased.
