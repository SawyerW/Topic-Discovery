I bought this from another site, as it was cheaper than Amazon at the time of purchase. Since I have gotten the TV, Amazon have dropped the price to be the cheapest!I purchased this so I could stream Netflix, Amazon or files from my network drive, while on the treadmill. The TV is wall mounted and you will need a 100 x 100 wall mount stand. The Amazon app does not work for this the B series, I heard that it does for the older A series but I do not own an A series to confirm this.I had a little trouble hooking it to the network,I do not broadcast my SSID for my wifi router. I had to skip the auto-install and then manually select network to get it to work. Sound is loud enough that it can be heard over the treadmill so that is cool for my needs. Picture looks really clean and sharp with lots of options compared to my Samsungs. Visio does not have a current list of the codecs or file types that they support for this TV. I did call techinical support (as my samsungs have this in the manual so wondered if I was missing something) but not with the Visio. The manual that comes in the box is tiny and the majority of the manual is actually in digital form in the TV itself. To access the manual through one of the on-screen menus using the remote. If you are trying to use mp4 movie files this TV does not support them. A call to technical support suggests that mpeg may work they could not give me a codec that would work!I give it four stars because of the issue of Amazon App not working and no information on what codecs will work with the TV.
