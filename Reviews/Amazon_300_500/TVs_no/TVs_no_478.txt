Just picked one up from Sears this afternoon. Paid $2,600 with the 10% Sears card discount.  Replaced a 62" Toshiba DLP. Compared it to the 8500 and didn't see the value in spending another $1K. Also compared it to the Sony XBR9 and the Samsung did it for me.Brought it home and had it running in 15 minutes. No problems at all. I must say the colors are just sick. I'm watching the Boise State-Nevada game on ESPN through Cox Digital Cable (Cox STB connected through an HDMI cable) and the 'blue' of the Boise State uniforms and helmets is just unbelievable. Details of the field and the sidelines are intense. I can see the paint chips from the 'stick' marks on the players' helmets. I agree with other posts regarding the 3D appearance. The image just pops out. SImply amazing.I've tried. I've really tried to find the problems with the spotlights in the corners. No luck. Perhaps the problems relate to older models. Perhaps it's a firmware fix. There's no doubt Samsung is having QC problems along with customer service issues. If I were experiencing the spotlights or random source selection or defective features that others have experienced, I would be just as upset as they must be.  But this unit is beautiful and I am fortunate...so far.As for those complaining about the speakers, I disagree. No, they do not compare to 5.1 or 7.1 systems, but they are more than adequate for 'the basics'. I do plan to purchase a home theater.I picked up the extra warranty from Sears based on the comments from other posters. I plan on watching A LOT of TV over the next 30 days as the box is still in the garage.  If I experience the QC problems it's going back.Overall, I recommend it. Best of luck to those with problems.
