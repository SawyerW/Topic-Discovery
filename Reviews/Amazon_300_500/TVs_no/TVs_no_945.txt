I bought this TV Jan 15 2012. It replaced a Sharp Aquos 60 inch LED that died after about 2 weeks of owning(see my other sharp review) This is my 3rd Panasonic Plasma TV. I still own and use all 3 Panasonics a 37", 50" and now a 60".So far this TV has exception color depth and texture. Skins on faces have richness and texture to them and do not appear clayish or discolored as the LED TV I owned appeared. My understanding the texturing comes from having some of the best darkness that brings out textures. From this it is my opinion buying the higher end was well worth the extra money.I watch sports football and hockey. The picture quality and smoothness of motion is very nice. The viewing from angles is fine as well.  As compared to the LED, there is none. the LED had a jitter or a blur or a bending of lines depending on the motions being fast or slow or the colors moving and a white out of the screen when veiwed from angles. I see none of that with the GT30.An added feature I like I did not find on the other brand is a sleep timer. This with the sleep timer on my surround sound is nice since it shuts off the TV if I fall asleep.The network configuration was easy, I skipped the dongle and just plugged the USB into the back of the TV. I configured the wireless network and password using the remote and found the devices on the network. I signed up for the Viera connect and can watch some free TV and movies through there many interfaces.The only complaint so far is that unlike the Sharp that had more of a keyborad layout for typing using the remote, this has a cell phone type pad and a more advanced layout with the @ key for the dot com.That and the wallmount locations on the back of the unit sat lower on the TV making me have to lower the mounting brackets on the wall.I have not gotten any 3D glasses so I can not comment.I gave it 4 stars since it does not have a web browser interface and one can always do better or find soemtehing better eventually
