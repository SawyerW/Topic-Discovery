I bought this TV back in Dec. 2007 as a gift for my older parents.  They've used it daily ever since.Before purchasing this model I found a professional review that stated that the HD quality was more than acceptable for this model (keep in mind it's 720p), but that non-HD digital and analog signals were some of the worst you'll find in this price range.  I know, you buy a TV like this for watching HD.  Problem is, you don't always receive HD.Before I bought my parents an upcoverting DVD player they used the regular player for this TV and it was just horrible.  The picture was worse than what they had with the older analog set.  Rushed out and bought the new DVD player.  That problem was fixed.They receive their digital TV over antenna.  Keep in mind that on antenna you can get three signals - analog (which disappears in 2009), digital (regular signal for lack of another term) and HD.  Since analog is going the way of the dodo there's no need to address that.  However, there are plenty of times that the digital signal is not in HD.  When that happens, this TV's picture is kind of disappointing.  Not horrible, no, but if you're stuck without an HD signal long enough it will make you wonder why you spent so much money.Keep in mind that there are digital TVs that do handle non-HD signals quite well - but you have to find the professional technical reviews out there to find out which ones they are.This might sound like I'm bashing this TV, but I don't intend to.  It was worth the money.  Just buyer beware.  Buy this if you know you're going to receive an HD signal on a regular basis.  If not, you might want to look for a different model.
