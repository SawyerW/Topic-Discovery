I knew that buying an HDTV on line was a bit risky. However, I went and found this model television in the stores and thought that it looked great. So I decided to give it a chance. Now I know there is usually a reviewer that gives a product a bad rating based on his experience... and I hate to be that guy... but the television hasn't worked right from day one. I have two long rows of dead pixels in my TV. Furthermore, the optical out wasn't functioning correctly. A guy "from Samsung" eventually showed up with a board that he replaced and that fixed the audio problem but not the image. I am now waiting in Limbo for Samsung to make up their minds as to what to do next. I have had this TV for almost a month now and believe me if I had known what I would be going through I would NEVER have purchased it. Sure it's a good price for a TV... but beware this TV can end up costing you more than you think.UPDATE: Well I DID get a new TV from Samsung. I wish I had gone to Amazon first... but... well live and learn. Since I got my new- new TV I have to say I love it! I'm watching HDTV for free with a cheep digital indoor antenna that I got from a local store. The picture is amazing. Watching Heroes and Lost in HD 5.1 surround sound is awesome. I have an Xbox 360 HD player and the image is fantastic. The contrast ratio on this TV is fantastic, and the 1080p DOES make a difference to a video junky like me. I can't seem to change my review stars... but for the record I'd now give it 4 stars having overcome the initial disappointment and now using a very solid product... recommended.- Oh and a special note to those that wrote in with encouraging words and advice... thanks.
