You have been reading reviews from people who JUST BOUGHT the TV! Here's the one you NEED to read from an owner of 2.5 years. It is not a matter of IF the LCD screen will go out, just a matter of WHEN. When being most likely within 1-3 years max. Toshiba KNEW when they sourced the LCD screens for this TV that they were faulty and had serious issues. Sony has a class action suit against them right now for doing the same thing. They went ahead and bought them in bulk for a song and installed them anyway to save money and increase profits while staying competitive in price. Not only does the TV blow up before dust can comfortably settle on it, any deep bass sound rattles the housing with a loud buzz. The picture is not all that terrific compared to decent, reliable brands (Hitachi, Samsung). All in all, you would be better advised to pile your money up in your driveway and burn it than buy this piece of inferior crap. Oh, the best part? When the TV guy comes and hauls it in to diagnose what I just told you is going to happen...the cost of the LCD screen replacement 1s over $1000 alone! That's right...not only do the low life SOBs at Toshiba continue to sell the inferior displays, they price the replacement parts higher than the original cost of the whole set! Add $250 into that for labor and you have a potential $1250 pile of Japanese garbage (plus original cost) sitting on a workbench in a TV shop on it's way to polluting a landfill somewhere.I have no axe to grind against Toshiba...you simply buy any of their products including the highly touted Regza line at your own risk. They are absolute 100% TRASH and guaranteed NOT to last 1/4 the time of other brands. All the above IMHO.
