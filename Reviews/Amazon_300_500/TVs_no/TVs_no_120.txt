Like everyone else, I shopped around for months looking at all the brands and types of TVs that are out there.  I finally landed on the S4253.  There simply is not another HDTV this size with this picture quality for this price.  Look all you want, you will return here empty handed.  Sure there are some LCDs out there that are razor sharp, but they are around 3x the price.  I'm not really willing to go that far. Every single other plasma (and LCD) in this price range looked terrible compared to the Samsung.  It even looks good while its off, the glossy piano black finish is great.This is the first device that I actually used the various settings on, they do work.  Movie, standard, dynamic.  The different settings of zoom, so you can eliminate the letterboxing that some shows have.  (also getting rid of pesky advertisements some channels run at the bottom of the screen) Nice blue LED around the power button and it makes a little Tivo'ish sound when you turn it on & off.  It even has a simulated surround effect it creates with its two speakers.  It works.  It made me check my surround receiver a couple times to make sure it was not on.  You can clearly hear things behind you.  Its a pretty neat trick.Anyway, in closing, great set.  The only problem I can think of is that it doesn't have a DVI input on it, only SVGA.  Which isn't really a problem, I was just sort of hoping for one.  Plenty of other inputs.  Composite, S, HDMI.  It even has connections on the side so you can hook things up temporarily without having to get behind it.I can't leave without mentioning Amazon.  They were $500.00 less than my local brick and mortar.  Great shipping with Eagle too.  I called the company once I saw it was in my city and asked if I could come pick it up several days early.  They agreed with no hassle.  Great purchase and great overall experience.
