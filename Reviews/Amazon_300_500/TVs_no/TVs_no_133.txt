Like everybody else I researched and reviewed all the options for my flat panel purchase. I considered the 32" for a while and then got "feature creep". For only a few hundred extra bucks I got the 40" and I'm glad I did. So I dove in and bought it from Amazon.PROSNice big picture! Super lightweight relative to Cathode Ray Tubes tvs.Superior picture quality with HD and with DVDs. Easy to configure.NO motion artifacts. Standard LCD horror stories do not apply on this model.The Eagle shipping was great. Mine shipped from harrisburg PA to the DC area, so it was FAST and without problem. They called me one day and we scheduled delivery on the next day between 2PM and 6PM. Shipper arrived promptly at 2 and carried the box into my home. Great service.CONSThe picture quality is absolutely top notch. As you will find, standard cable signal quality is NOT so good. In other words, your TV can display an astonishing picture quality that reveals the severe limitations of standard definition cable signals.HD on the other hand is AMAZING. You'll find that you prefer watching film of paint dry on Discovery HD to your favorite TV show on standard channels. My only advice is get used to it!True black tones are not true black on an LCD. They're real close, but not perfect. This is probably the single limitation of LCD displays. You can tell, but you probably won't care given how good everything looks. Or, if you can't deal with this, get yourself a plasma.The sound volume is not strong. Sound quality is fine but volume is weak. This thing has 5W or 10W sound - look at the specs. It's OK for just watching TV on most channels but you have to pump it to 50-70% on certain channels. If you are hard of hearing, have a big room, live in a noisy environment, or just like it loud, you will need reinforcement. And, clearly, for theater sound you will need reinforcement but that is true for any model of TV.Overall very happy with the product and with Amazon's role as my merchant.
