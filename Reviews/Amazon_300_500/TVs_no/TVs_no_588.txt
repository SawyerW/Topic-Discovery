I wanted to buy a 3D HDTV. So the first thing I did was view amazon.com's 101 about 3D TV. That settled the issue for me---Plasma it is. Then I went to the local Best Buy (really WORST BUY) and viewed one. It was superb, excellent, wowed me, never seen anything like it.The picture is so real that at times it scares me. I see a well known actor and with this TV it makes you feel like you are right there. You see features on people that you NEVER saw before. It is true that the actors are now paying more attention to their make up--they have to. The 3D is so good it can startle you. The 2d-3D conversion is good, but depends on the movie. If it is not a action picture then the effect differs. I doubt you will want to watch the nightly news with this feature.One thing I always wanted to know but no one mentioned was: what happens if you play a blu-ray 3D disk that comes with the paper glasses??? Well what happens, unfortunately, is nothing. You have to use the paper glasses. This, of course, will change as more media is developed for real 3D HDTVsOne of the best features is that Samsung was extremely smart to be in the forefront with their internet connectivity (WIFI)--- and things are already there, from facebook to netflix. It is made very easy for the consumer. Before this set I did not bother with the internet and TV because it was just to much trouble.As you can tell, at this point in time, I think Samsung is way ahead of the HD and 3D curve. I cannot recommend this set enough and amazon.com makes it very easy to get via their home delivery and in home setup (Best Buy with their Geek Squad want $400.00++ to adjust your settings!!!). Amazon.co should pay me for this review. Also, if you want a 3D blu-ray player, buy Samsung. Again, the connectivity is a snap and the internet is easy.
