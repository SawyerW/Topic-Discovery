I have a 55 inch Toshiba 55TL515U Television bought a year and a half ago. It has two huge bars running down the middle of the screen and the technician that Toshiba gave me the contact info for says the panel is bad and to add insult to injury there is no replacement panel available even if I wanted to get it fixed. After 5 calls to Toshiba customer support who tirelessly give me the same phone numbers around the country for various part dealers they work with and insist that there MUST be a part, all the suppliers of the mystery part tell me it can NOT be found and is not in their inventory. This makes a $1500 TV that's a year and a half old, un repairable and a complete loss. Toshiba tells me if there is no part available than that  is the reality of it with no concern that they make TV's that are literally disposbale with such a short life span, unable to be repaired. Their senior tech AND their case workers ALL agree that they should simply just keep putting me on a never ending circle of calling the same suppliers in denial that there is any problem here and that they are doing everything that they can. Apparently they can afford to throw away a a few grand every year in shoddy mercandise and it's no big deal to them that it is NOT repairable.  A tv that is 1 1/2 yrs old (6 months over warranty) and is not repairable because the Toshiba company doesn't make the panel necessary to fix it should be criminal and I should be able to have repair as an option for my hard earned money. I would also love to know why this model of TV 55TL515U doesn't have a replacement panel available after such a short time frame (1 1/2 years) and why the TV is set in considered serviceable by their phone support but NOT by their on site technicians who can't communicate that with their phone support so I could get my television fixed. Please take warning buying Toshiba who makes disposable TV's and their customer care who doesn't seem to care at all.
