Got my TV delivered about 3 weeks ago and so far it performs absolutely awesome.Delivery:  This is one area that you need to take charge of.  Track your order and ones you see it being delivered to eagle location near your area, just initiate the call yourself and arrange for delivery.  They bring it in and set it up.  Otherwise you will wait for few more days for them to call you.I am in NJ area using Cablevision.  For the first two weeks I was without IO and digital box.  So I was connected directly to the cable.  TV had no problem finding all available channels, including digital for ABC, NBC, FOX and few others.  They transmit in 720P and picture is just fantastic.  But you may need to control what mode to use on HD and SAP channels yourself.Running with DVR box:  First of all cablevision S. Atlanta DVR box produces really good quality.  But make sure you configure your box correctly to recognize all modes this TV supports.  Otherwise it does automatic conversion to what it thinks your TV supports.  Converting 720P to 1080i, no matter how good conversion chip is - still will not create original quality picture.  You want to see 720p transmitted channels in 720p and 1080i in 1080i.Connection: USE HDMI cables for DVD and digital cable box.  You can notice the difference in picture quality.  TV has two HDMI inputs in the back and I think one on the side.  There is also optical input, but I did not try it for sound yet.Short story.  Even without any adjustment the picture is stunning - no comparison to older model.  My TV is in the bedroom and surround sound is more than satisfying for the built-in speaker.  The only LCD that I can think of that may produce a bit better picture is Sony XBR2 or 4.  But in my mind the price difference is not worth the miniscule difference in quality.Note: If anyone played with colour calibration on this TV and found better settings - please email.Hope this helps.
