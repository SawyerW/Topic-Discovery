Just got it on Saturday July 13, 2002.The picture is amazing. The only downfall is, to have that amazing picture, you have to watch DVD's. I have BEV as a satellite supplier. Most of the channels are clear, except for some, it seems the picture is too big for the channel.Now, I've upgrade from a 10 year old JVC 27" (Best TV I've ever had). The picture just looks huge, I'm sitting approx. 11 feet away. The ideal viewing distance is suppose to be 9.5 feet.It's just so huge. Now, that may just be because I upgraded from a lot smaller to a lot bigger TV.I've watched approx. 10 movies on it, and WOW, I would never be able to watch them on anything else (unless it's bigger).Other little tidbits, is that when the movie is in letterbox (2.35:1), you still have the black lines on the top and the bottom. You can zoom in even more, but then you lose some of the picture. (my wife is very disapointed with this).To use the full screen when you are watching a 4:3 tv show or movie, the picture seems a little bit stretched, just takes a little of getting use too.If you are watching the TV from angles greater than 30 to 40 degrees, you really can't see very much.Besides what I've mentioned, it is a great TV for a great price, and a big plus, you can use the speakers for the Center channel of your receiver.I've also played my PS2 and XBox on it, it just blows your mind how detailed the games are now.I'm also having a technician coming in to make all the fine tuning on the TV (I don't want to lose the warranty, if I do it myself). So I will let you know if it makes it even better.I would give this TV a four and a half star, it lost its half a star because of the things I've mentioned above. And that is an assesment based on three days of having it. Give me a year, and I'll let you know if it has improved.
