I had initially bought a Sony 46HX800 and returned it in favor of this TV.  The Sony's colors weren't very good in a set at that price point and feature set.This Samsung has incredible picture quality.  The colors are vibrant and striking.  I have no complaints on the picture.  Clarity, color, sharpness are all excellent.Sound seems powerful and clear too.  I usually only have to turn it up to 6 or 7 on a scale of 100 and it fills my bedroom with sound.  It doesn't sound thin or tinny at all.  Good sound.I am using the separate wifi adapter to load in the wifi applications.  They are interesting and kinda cool.  A bit slow, but they are something to mess around with.  Theres netflix, youtube, vudu, yahoo, and the other usual suspects.  They all seem to work well.I am not a huge fan of the chrome stand and chrome accents on the bezel of the TV, but they don't bother me like I thought they would.  I thought the shiny chrome stand would be reflective when I watch the TV, and it is, but not to the extent that it bothers me.The remote is slick and fancy, but its a bit flat and it kinda hard to feel out the buttons sometimes.  Not the greatest design, but its functional.There is some LED bleed in the corners.  I do see the LED bulbs a bit in each corner during letterbox movies or when the screen is completely black.  That could be an issue for some, but it doesn't bother me since the picture quality is just so unbelievably good on this set.  You wont notice the LED bleed on full screen programs unless the screen goes black.All in all if you can get a good deal on the set, I would recommend it highly.  Can't beat the Samsung picture quality, particularly their rich and vibrant colors.
