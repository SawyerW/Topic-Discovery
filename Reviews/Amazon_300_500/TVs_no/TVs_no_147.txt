I bought the Samsung after comparing it with the Sony and Panasonic equivalent models. I found that the Samsung had the best picture as well as stylistically looking the best. When I hooked it up, it gave a very good picture for SDTV. However, I found one big flaw that may not affect most people. My cable provider does not scramble local HDTV broadcasts, thus if you don't have a HDTV receiver, you can access these channels. On my Panasonic 32" plasma, I'm able to view these HDTV channels. These channels are access through my cable provider by using the dash (or dot) button. For instance, my NBC HDTV channel would be 92-3. My plasma is able to access these channels because it has a digital signal tuner. The Samsung has only an analog signal tuner. I could only access HDTV channels on the "Air" (antenna) mode and not in the "Cable" mode. Using an antenna on the plasma, I could pick up all of my local channels. However, on the Samsung I could only pick up 1/2 of the local signals. Granted, the antenna is small, but again, the plasma could filter the signal where as the Samsung could not (the TVs are only 1 wall apart). I returned the Samsung because of this fact and am going to get a Sony that has a digital signal tuner. I could be wrong and this Samsung can access digital channels, but after about 1 hour, I couldn't figure it out. Also, the instructions that came with the Samsung are lacking in description of the more technical side of the TV settings.All in all, if you've got a cable box to get your HDTV setting or getting your HDTV with a strong antenna, this LCD delivers a really crisp vibrant picture. However, it just didn't work for me.
