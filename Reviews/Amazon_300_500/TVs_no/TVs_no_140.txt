This was the first HDTV I bought, and I am very happy with my purchase. I use this TV to play Xbox360 and watch HD-DVD's with the add-on. It's amazing to watch the new high-definition dvd's on the TV. I also have HD-cable through Comcast, and although the signal isn't as good as an HD-DVD, it still looks great. Standard definition cable doesn't look that great, but thats what you should expect when you get a TV with higher resolutions. Opt for digital or HD cable. Regular DVDs still look good though, so don't worry about that.Playing the 360, the TV is flawless. I use the game mode while playing Oblivion, Gears of War, even Halo 2. The TV just does everything I expected it to do. I am eventually going to hook my gaming PC up to it through the VGA connector, but as of right now I am having trouble finding a long enough VGA cord for the right price.I gave the TV 4 stars instead of 5 because of the User interface and remote. The remote is slow to react to my button pushes, and the menu interface isn't the best either. A remote can be replaced (try the Harmonix remotes), but the menu system is stuck there. Some options are hidden away. The game mode option is under setup category instead of picture. The brightness option is hidden in power management instead of just being called brightness.At the end of the day though, when I got used to the menu navigation, I just love this TV. I think Samsung has a customer for life now whenever I upgrade TVs.I also want to point out that Amazon did a tremendous job with Eagle USA shipping (look it up as EGL shipping). They delivered the TV right to my house, brought it in and opened it up for me. They waited for me to turn it on and make sure it worked to my liking, and they even took the garbage from the packaging with them as they left. 5 Stars for the delivery (which was free also).
