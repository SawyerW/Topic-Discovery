I was an early adopter of this TV.  I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.
