I was shopping for a large screen to use as a computer monitor and discovered that buying a TV with the tuner and extra inputs was very little more money.  I was apprehensive about a few of the reviews, but it appears that if it gets past the point of infant failure, you'll do fine.The screen is HUGE to use as a monitor on my desk, but am loving every inch of it.  The brightness is a bit high, but I am still working on adjusting it to my liking.  Playing a video file is a wonderful experience.  Gone is the watching a postage stamp effect.  The only downside is the built in sound.  A bit tinny with weak bass.  But with the tiny built in speakers, I guess that is to be expected.  One other nit pick, when using the HDMI input fed from my Mac mini's DVI output, the sound is non functional.  There is no provision to input analog or digital audio on a separate connector like my old Panasonic had.  If you use the VGA input, yes, there is a separate audio input that mates up with it, just not if you choose to do the higher clarity on the the HDMI.  (Yes, I know that HDMI carries audio, but not when fed from a DVI source.)I was able to enable the full 1920x1080 resolution on my Mac by installing SwitchResX and the hints that Mr. Hicks gives in his review further down the list.  The panel mistakenly reports back to the video card that its native resolution is 1440x900.  I am assuming that is a firmware bug.A few other random notes:-Tuner sensitivity is very good.  I pull in everything transmitted form the Sears and Hancock very well with a rooftop antenna.  -No cable sub.-UPS banged up the box pretty bad.  Several holes and complete tears.  Bad enough that i took pictures before I opened it.-The sound is LOUD.  The scale goes from 0-100 but you will rarely need to turn it above 10.
