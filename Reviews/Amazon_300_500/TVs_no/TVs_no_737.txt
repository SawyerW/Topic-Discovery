When Mitsubishi introduced their 65" version of this set, my husband fell in love. We first saw it at a Los Angeles showroom a year ago, and I had a very hard time dragging him out the door. The minute we got home to Florida, he started tracking the information being provided on the "soon to be introduced" 75" version. First, it would be by Christmas, then spring. Finally, Mitsubishi introduced it in August - a long wait, but well worth it.I'm not a techie, so can't begin to elaborate on the amazing features of this awesome HDTV, but if you are looking for a really big screen television, with 3-D like clarity (it is 3D ready) don't hesitate to buy this set. It will make your home the center of football season, with or without the popcorn and beer!The folks at Amazon were very helpful - I think we may have placed the first order for the Mitsubishi L75-A91 that they received. Their "white glove" delivery service was exactly what they said it would be. It took 2 burly (but polite) guys to carry in this set, take it out of the box, and plug it in, and they did so exactly within the time-frame we requested at the time we placed our order. Our hat's are off to Amazon - this was definitely the biggest online purchase we ever made, but it went smoothly, without a hitch. And I have a very happy husband!The only "con" that I can think of is that this dlp HDTV is 15" deep, and weighs about 150 pounds, so you can't hang it on the wall. If having a wall-hung TV is more important to you than the picture quality, you'll need to look at a different product. For us, the picture quality, and the fact that our last Mitsubishi lasted 15 years (we just gave it away to make room for this big guy) made this purchase worth the money.
