While I have used LCD monitors for computers, this is the first LCD TV I have ever bought.I have to say, I am extremely displeased with it. I may return it.First, regardless of the connection type, or when viewing a DVD or cable signal, there is an EXTREME amout of digital noise in the darker areas of the picture. Also, when any object moves, whether it be a person, text, etc, there is a halo around everything. Closeups of people are practically unviewable; they all look like they have been painted. Text is VERY soft, almost "bulged" looking.Also, no matter how hard I try, the contrast is simply incorrect. It is either too soft, or way too harsh. Although the setting is completely variable, there is no noticable difference between any of the middle settings. In fact, in order for the noise to go away in the black areas, the contrast must be set all the way to max. Unfortunately, this makes skin tones unwatchable.If you are viewing from 15 or more feet away, the picture looks crisp. Anything closer than that is completely unacceptable.Furthermore, the holes to mount the Sanus wall mount are too small by only a tiny fraction of an inch. The base of the TV is supposed to be VESA compliant, and the Sanus Mount should fit, but the screws simply won't go in the holes. I looked in the Samsung manual, and they want you to buy a special mount from some obscure company. This unit is advertised as VESA compliant, and therefore should fit any 75/100 VESA mount.I don't know if this one is defective or what. Either way, if it is returned, I certainly won't be buying another LCD TV anytime soon.I am a very technically savy person. I have never run into problems such as these with any purchase I have ever made.
