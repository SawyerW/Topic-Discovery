I just got this Samsung LN-46A650 a couple weeks ago and after a couple weeks of watching BluRay movies with a PS3, HD programming & HD sports via Comcast Cablecard in a TivoHD & an off air antenna, viewing family photos & movie trailers from an Apple TV, and playing Call of Duty 4 & Burnout Paradise on a PS3, and....this TV is freaking incredible!I've had different kinds TVs (CRTs, DLP, Plasma & LCD), but this by far is the best TV I've ever owned (famous last words, right?). This replaced a 3rd generation Samsung DLP. If you watch HD programming, HD movies & HD sports, get this TV. If you're a gamer, get this TV.I've had no issues with banding, flashing lights in the corners, random shutoffs, dead pixels, hazing, whatsoever. I'm no expert, but most of the complaints on the forums are from people who just like to complain. Turn your brightness down and enjoy your TV! Colors are realistic and vibrant. It's got dark blacks and bright whites. Brightness can subjective, but Standard setting is fine. Looks great even when it's turned off.I used to be a big fan (and a former employee) of Sony, but I have to admit, Samsung is blowing away Sony with pricing and quality. No offense fanboys.I highly recommend buying through Amazon. Transaction was a breeze. Ceva delivery was great. They delivered four days earlier than promised. After checking Ceva's website, I called them a day early to request an earlier delivery, they couldn't so they set up the next day. But they showed up later that evening anyway.pros:awesome picture120Hz AMP smoothing makes BluRay movies look 3D4ms refresh rate4HDMI inputsnumerous controls over adjustments and settingscherry coke red bezelglossy screenminor annoyances:remote wheel is sensitive (get a universal remote instead)speakers sound weak (get a 5.1 surround rig)shiny bezel shows fingerprints (just wipe it down)
