I bought this TV after reading the on line reviews then going to a local store to compare to the sony XBR. I liked this picture better in the store.Picture quality wise, the HD picture just using an antenna and watching "over the air" HD broadcasts at 1080i are amazing. I love watching Jay Leno at 1080i...the picture is so sharp and vivid it's almost like 3d.I also like the picture from my Samsung HD960 upscaling DVD player at 1080i. This TV doesn't work with this player at 1080p which I thought it would, but nonetheless, some of the IMAX DVD's I have at 1080i using the hdmi input are no less than spectacular.This TV does a very good job with motion. There are no artificts or pixelation like you see on a lot of LCD's. (not that I can see anyway). That combined with the super duper contrast ratio give an amazing picture. Bright vivid colors and black blacks...no noise, no artifacts. It is very, very good compared to anything else I've ever seen.This TV also has a vga analog computer input....if you've never seen your computer at 32 inches you're in for a treat. It works great attached to a computer and the color and contrast is excellent.The remote, menu system is so so. It seems like I always want to grab the remote upside down. There's nothing really bad about the remote control, it's just average.Sound wise, it could be better. If you are using a surround sound system that's not an issue but I bought this as a bedroom TV mounted at 45 degrees off the ceiling (awesome). I view from a distance of about 7 feet and I think that's just about optimum for this screen size. I'll probably hook it up to a surround system.It came with one dead pixel and you can't see it unless you are right up on the screen. It's not an issue for me.
