I've had my LG 42LE5500 for a few weeks now and I couldn't be happier!  The picture on this TV is so good that it makes our livingroom TV look really inferior, especially on SD cable stations; so, we ordered an LG 55LE5500 for our living room to replace our 52" DLP (which we love but don't like having to replace bulbs)! The 55 is supposed to be delivered this weekend and I'll post a review once I've had it for awhile.We have the 42" in our bedroom and it's perfect! We have it wired to the internet and we have highspeed so I'm not seeing any problems with the streaming quality  - streaming Netflix is far superior on this TV compared to streaming it through my Wii on our living room TV. Vudu HD - OMG, I didn't realize a movie could look so good!  I've not tried the other apps or a blue ray movie yet but hope to soon.Many people complain about the "soap opera" effect with the LED/LCDs...yes, I have that on this TV but it doesn't bother me anymore.  It's the price I pay for having such a clear picture.  I know I can probably adjust some screen settings to add more noise or judder but I don't feel the need at this time.Sound - I love the Clear Voice II selection - DH used to have a problem sometimes hearing the dialogue over the action sounds and with Clear Voice on, he doesn't have any problems; and, I don't have to keep answering his "what'd they say?" questions.Edge lighting - many people complain about the edge lighting and I just don't get it - yes, I see a tiny bit of light bleed into the dark banding around widescreen shows but, for me personally, it's not that noticable - it looks like a tiny edge of spotlighting across the top of the TV.  And, I don't see it at all in non-widescreen shows/channels/movies.I honestly don't understand the negative reviews for the LG LE5500s - we are very happy.  But, long term will tell.
