Got this TV and wall-mounted it in my bedroom. Love the picture, features, etc., all of which have been well covered in other reviews. But, it died after having it for a week - dead as a doornail. I called Samsung the night it died, and they set up a repair call with a local (D.C. area) repair shop. I called the shop the next day, and they were on top of it already. They guessed from the symptoms that they would need either a power supply, motherboard, or both, so they ordered them that day, and told me the parts would arrive in a day or two (not 4-6 weeks, as I expected!). Sure enough, they arrived at their shop the next business day, and they set up an in-home repair appointment for a few days later. The tech showed up on time, and replaced the power supply. Viola - worked like a charm. So, we all know that s--- happens, and that the after-sale service is what's important. I'm more than satisfied with the way Samsung and the local shop handled this. The TV's been perfect ever since - it's been a few weeks.One thing to note is that this TV, and some other newer Samsung models have a known issue with connecting the TV to Verizon FIOS Motorola DVRs over HDMI, which is what I do. The TVs sometimes don't recognize the "mode" (480i, 480p, 720p, etc.) being sent by the DVR, and displays a "Mode Not Supported" message that can only be cleared by resetting the DVR (power-down/up cycle). You can find lots of information on this by Googling "Samsung FIOS mode not supported". I've been able to limit this problem to only once or twice a week by following some of the instructions in the various forums, and I think Verizon is working on a permanent fix. For now, the only 100% reliable fix is to use component video cables, which degrade the picture ever so slightly. But, after all of this, I still highly recommend this TV.
