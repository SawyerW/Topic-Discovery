Family and friends told me I spent more time reviewing what HDTV LCD to buy than purchasing a car or a house.  Ha, I thought --- I am getting a Samsung 4071 where 90+% of the reviewers are happy.  I never thought I'd be one of the 10% to have the TV TOTALLY FAIL.  No picture, ghosts, then grey screen.I had been very happy despite the fact price went down more, newer models out - I had no complaints.My big concern --- the threads and reviews I've read about Samsung's service, warranty and people having to wait 30 days or more to get a power or control panel.  Time will tell and I'll update the review re that.I got rid of a perfectly good, 10 year old 32" Sony only to upgrade to something that fails in 2 months.  Pretty scary.UPDATE:  It is SUN 6/21 and I still don't have my tv... The Samsung outsourced repairman is local and has replaced several things - still not working.  Has ordered supposedly the last two possible parts/display boards it can be and should be out here Monday.  He says failure rate is 1-2% and that is considered good and that they fix them.  He still endorses the product over other brands.  While I recognize this is who is buttering his bread, Samsung service center and this repairman have been relatively responsive in phone calls, calling back, etc.  To me this is a big portion of customer service.  Will update if it ever gets working.Update on 2/14/09:  The last component that could be replaced without just getting me a new tv, was finally replaced and all has worked superbly since then --- way back end of JUN08.  Samsung tv repair representative said it was like getting a new tv since all the replacements were newer.  In any event, everything I had thought it would be --- love it.  Spoiled, just ordering a new Samsung 19" for my bedroom.  Despite all the initial issues, am happy with Samsung product
