Sometimes in the past I've had problems with HDMI cables not being the right color.  Some were too black.  Some weren't black enough.  Some just had too much of a rubbery feel to them.  You know what I'm talking about.  It can be frustrating when you spend hours scouring the web to find an HDMI cable with just the right rubber content in the insulation only to open the package and see that the tint and feel didn't match exactly with the picture.  Annoying, I know.I heard about this cable while attending a meeting of the local chapter of HDMICE (pronounced HD MICE, stands for HDMI cable enthusiasts) but was justifiably skeptical.  How could any cable match up to the hype behind it?  I was hesitant, but in the end, my excessive (and somewhat troublesome) infatuation with all things Amazon got the better of me.  My wallet felt lighter, but I felt like a weight was on my shoulders as I waited for it to arrive.  My wife told me I needed to get some counseling, but she's been saying that a lot lately so I don't think it had to do with the cord.When it arrived, I found my hands shaking as I performed the necessary box opening rituals prescribed by HDMICE.  As the rituals removed all traces of bad HDMI cord heeby jeebies, I felt a warmth accompanied by a glowing light worthy of getting a new wand from Ollivander's coming from the cord.  I realized then that it's true what they say: the cord truly chooses the cinemaphile.Suffice it to say, I have ceased using or buying any other HDMI cords from that point on.  I can happily say that this cable is remarkably adept at transporting pictures and sound in the form of digital bits of information.  It also is nice and cabley, which is a real plus in an HDMI cable.  I am a very satisfied customer.
