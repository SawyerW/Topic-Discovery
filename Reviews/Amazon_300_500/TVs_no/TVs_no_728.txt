I've had this TV for a little over a week now and smile every time I turn it on.  I upgraded from a Toshiba 62" DLP unit that I had owned for about six years (Tired of buying lamps every 6 months).  I always liked the picture on the old TV, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of this Samsung.The form factor of the TV is terrific, less than 1.5" thin and looks great mounted on the wall.  Motion is not a problem for this plasma; football, action movies, and other fast paced events look great with no blur or ghosting.I also like the fact that my Samsung 3D BD player and the TV are in sync, and that the TV will select the best settings for a given media through BD Wise.Calibrating the TV was reasonably easy, Samsung gives you a plethora of options related to white balance, colors, and cell brightness.  Achieving the perfect picture for the given environment wasn't difficult.As a bonus, I can control my TV via my iPhone with the new Samsung remote app.  The app controls most of the various functions of the TV, and has worked well for me so far, particularly when it comes to entering search keywords into one of the included internet connected apps.  The app selection so far is pretty good, I expect it will grow in time.  I like having the ability to use Yahoo widgets and search for YouTube videos directly on my TV and plan on utilizing the various on demand services soon (Hulu Plus, Amazon VOD, Netflix).Minor gripes I have...I do wish I could turn off the extra inputs so I would not have to go through the excess ones when selecting certain connections.  There may be a way to do this, I just have not been able to find the right method as of yet.  In addition, the TV only outputs Dolby Digital from the ant/cable input so, even though my HDMI sources send the signal to the TV, it is unable to pass it back via the SPDIF connection.So far, I have no issues with the TV buzzing or malfunctioning in any manner.Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.
