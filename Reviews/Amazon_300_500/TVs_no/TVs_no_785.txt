I purchased this TV about 3 years ago and have been using it as my main living room tv ever since (it's probably too small to be a proper living room tv, but I guess that's  matter of personal preference).  I am not a tech person and I really just bought it because it seemed like an ok size and the price was right at the time.  The TV has been ok, but in retrospect I wish I had done more research.  It's totally functional and it's never broken, but there are some issues.Issues:-Sound is the worst problem.  It is very hard to hear dialogue, so I end up turning the volume waaaay up to hear it, and even then it's still difficult.  But then if music or background noise in the show comes on, it's waaaaay too loud.  Like I said, I'm not a tech person, so maybe it's somehow possible to fix this, but I have never found a way.-Picture is ok, but not great.  When it's really bright in the room, it gets a lot worse.  Again, it might be possible to fix this if you know what you're doing, but I certainly don't.-Takes a long time to turn on and a long time to change the inputs.  When you turn it on, it takes several seconds to boot up.  More annoying is the inputs.  To change from one input to another you have to keep pressing the input button and scroll through all the inputs to get to the one you want (you cannot just select the one you want without hitting all the others first).  This is not a huge deal, but it's annoying if you switch inputs frequently (to switch to the Roku or the DVD player etc).So basically, it's not the worst TV out there, but I think that you could probably get a much better set for not that much more money.
