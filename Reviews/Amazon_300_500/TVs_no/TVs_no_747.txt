I purchased this LED for our guest room when the price was $299 at Target.  They dropped the price down to $209 and I was able to get a price adjustment on the guest room TV and thought it was too good of a deal to pass up for a TV we needed for our bedroom.  I am using over-the-air (OTA) feed for my guest room and DirecTV for my bedroom.At $209 for an LED TV, I would normally say "beggars can't be choosers" and be happy that I got such a good deal.  However, given the overwhelming glowing reviews for this product here on Amazon, I feel I should mention a design flaw to make sure everyone is aware of what they are buying.  You can read the "positives" from the other reviews on here.When watching dark programming or dark colors, you can see waves in the picture emanating from the center of the screen going both up and down.  It is more evident in "Movie" mode and less in "Retail" mode.  Likely do to the "Retail" mode being the most used in store displays.  Those who currently own this model, give it a try.  At first I thought it might be a singularly bad TV I bought.  Only, I went to our guest room to see if the other TV pulsated with waves.  Sure enough, the same thing.This engineering flaw may not bother some people, but it does me regardless of the price.  What is funny is my wife was the first to notice these waves.  This, coming from a woman who initially couldn't tell the difference between an HD video feed and an SD video feed.  Bless her heart, she got it right with this baby.These were my first Vizio TVs.  I will be keeping this model in my guest room but returning the model for my bedroom.  We watch too much programming in our bedroom to look past this issue.Again, maybe this warning will not deter someone set on a deal like this.  I suggest going into Target and changing the picture setting from "Retail" to "Movie" to see for yourself.Good luck!
