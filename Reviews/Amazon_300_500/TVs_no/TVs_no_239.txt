I've already learned one important lesson in my limited experience with HDTVs - it's not all about the picture.  In the case of this unit, the picture quality was very comparable to the 23" Sony Bravia HDTV I had recently bought (slight pluses and minuses for both), but the Samsung is far more well thought-out and user-friendly.  I'm really surprised at how big of a difference that makes, but it does.This TV will change channels fairly quickly (about the speed of a non-HDTV), whereas the Sony Bravias (and I assume others) are painfully S-L-O-W.  This was irritating enough when I was just using the relatively small number of over-the-air channels, with cable it can drive you absolutely crazy.Also, the Samsung will sense what inputs are actually being used, so that it will only go to the ones that are hooked up to a VCR, DVD, etc. and not S-L-O-W-L-Y cycle through them all, as does the Bravia (where it's a real drag if you hit that button by mistake).Another nice feature is that the LNT2653H has separate coax inputs for antenna and cable.  If you, like me, want to use both, this makes life much easier.There are actually a few other smaller items that are superior on the Samsung as well, but the real epiphany to me was that usability is so significant an issue in these HDTVs.  Don't get me wrong, picture quality IS important too and this one looks to me as good as any, but you can't really judge that aspect very well in a showroom anyway.  Once you get it home you have to actually use it - and the differences there are striking.I'll also mention that, at the time of purchase, the price at Amazon was significantly better than at any other reputable dealer I could find.  The unit came quickly and in good shape.I'll give it 4 1/2 stars, because as good as it is, it's still not perfect.
