I own one of these. I like it very much.With the price difference between this model and the LNS3251D, I would probably upgrade. But the price gap was much larger in the retail outlet where I purchased this tv. Also, I'd say I prefer the style the style of this model to the LNS3251D, but that is a very subjective thing.Dead pixels are a worrying thing. I did a lot of research, and have been told these screens have relatively few defects. The one I received was perfect. Until the industry adopts a zero dead pixel policy though, one must be cautious.The screen itself is beautiful. The refresh rate is very good. Movies look great, as do games. If you're going to be running 3d shooters on this... well I'd check it out yourself first... but I could not easily detect smearing and was fairly unsatisfied with some of the earlier lcd screens.The remote and inputs are wonderful. I have never seen this done so simply before. I still haven't looked through every advanced feature, but within an hour I felt pretty comfortable with how everything worked and plugged in. Very pleased with the remote.I've wanted one of these forever. Finally got into the price range I was willing to bite, and I couldn't be happier. Even non hd programming looks and dvds looks quite good. Computer video looks great even through the analog plug. The stretching of video is usually quite good, but sometimes noticable errors seem to occurOn a side note, the speakers are not great. I've heard people comparing the sound to home theatre systems... I have a pair of $100 Klipsch Pro media speakers that put the sound on this tv to shame. The bass from the tv is non existant to horrible. I'm not talking about blasting rap. Just normal music sounds flat and dead... like listening to it on my laptop.Overall I don't think you can go wrong with a Samsung screen for the price.
