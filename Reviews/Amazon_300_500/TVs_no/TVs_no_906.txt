As many others, I've done my research before buying this TV. I've only had the GT30 for 4 days and am currently very happy with it.- The 2D picture is beautiful. I have another 2 year old Samsung 1080P LCD and I can see a clear picture improvement with this Panasonic GT30. I was a little worried about the fluctuating brightness problems that people have been seeing. I am happy to report that I do not see ANY fluctuating brightness issues in any of the modes (thx, game, custom, etc...)Out of the box the THX mode seemed to be the best, but I found some tunings that CNET posted for this TV and used those. CNET actually posted picture tunings for THX and Custom modes and mentioned that they believe their THX settings were better. My wife and I prefer like their Custom settings more than their THX settings. More realistic...- I can also make a couple of comments on 3D. I've ordered a 3D blue ray player with a few movies, but have not received them yet. I do have ESPN 3D though and was able to check it out. I purchased the x103 3d glasses and used those. The 3d effect greatly depends on the content that you are watching on TV when its broadcast. College football was OK, Extreme winter games were good and Boxing looked great with 3D. I did not see any cross talk and the HD clarity was very good. Just make sure that you don't have a lot of extra outside light in the room or the glasses will appear to flicker a little. In a medium to dim environment, there were 0 issues. I can't wait for the 3D blue ray player to see what movies will look like on this TV.Overall I am very happy with this TV.
