Right out of the box this TV had the back lighting issues some people were complaining of. Set your back lighting to "5" and your problems will be solved. These people complaining of BL issues have their BL maxed out to "10" and they wonder why there is lighting in the corners. First of all, with the BL set to "10" IT IS WAY TOO BRIGHT! If you set the BL to "5" and increase the other settings to your liking (brightness, contrast, etc..) you will see that this TV has a setting for every eye, even for the most visual of people.UPDATE: This TV is incredible and I have full control of the back lighting. I set my BL to "6" and use the enhanced contrast, WOW! It's just the most perfect picture you have ever seen. Initially the realism is disorienting, no joke. But after some time your eye adjusts and OMG is it something to see. Don't believe the bad reviews, they are NOT from techie people. I have had some time to mess around with the settings and it is totally simple to set up. If you wall mount, make sure all your connections are on before you mount it (add USB as well) The menu is pretty slick and easy to understand as long as you're not a moron. The TV has included content that you can access thru the menu which I thought was cool. I like the cooking menu it lots of cool recipes to surf and the images are pretty sick. It also has settings like "paintings" so when you're not watching TV, you can set it to that and it turns into revolving Art. I don't know any of the paintings, but when I set my DirectV to music channels, I will put it on this and its cool to see the famous Art  pieces rotate on the TV like a screen saver. It has scenery, animals, etc.. lots of cool junk. I hooked it up to my Polk Audio Home Theater and holy balls does it push some good sound. The internal speakers blow, so make sure you have a Home Theater or get one when you buy this.I am the most anal TV buyer you'll ever meet but this TV made me happy-happy. I had to increase it from 4 to 5 stars!
