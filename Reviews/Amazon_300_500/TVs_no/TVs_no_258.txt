i was owed this tv as a gift. the 32" size is nice for when i will be taking it to college. the picture quality is great and so is the audio (even though i play my games with the sound off). the black color mathes nicely with my ps3 and to me it looks like a picture frame with a silver wavy line near the base. so it looks great. i also wanted to add that it does have the hdmi input for the ps3 so that is good for gamers. hooking up my 360 wasnt hard either as it has the hd cables with the green, blue, orange, etc... its also very light compared to the old tube tvs. i removet the old 18" tube tv and this was lighter. that sums up all the positives of it.now for the negatives: i have to share this with my brother until i go to college and he is rough with things. i dunno (and dont want) to hook up the nintendo wii. this was designed with high definition in mind and thats a good thing. the wii has old style hook ups unlike the ps3 and xbox 360, so its confusing how to hook up old systems. i also wanted to mention that this is a piece of electronics. its not supposed to be beat upon, so wii players should not look into this tv. my brother and i have been notorious for having wii remotes going through windows, walls, etc...to sum things up, at 1300 (or whatever you paid for it) its a great deal. the picuture and audio are great, it has the hd hook ups, ps3 and 360 games look great and ir is gret for watching my movies and espn sports center on. so if you wint be throwing wii remotes around, this tv is definately at the top of the list.
