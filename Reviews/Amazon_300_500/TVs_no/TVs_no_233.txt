I am writing this review PRIOR to buying one 3253 and two 4053 units. Based on my research thus far, I'll give it a 5 star rating if/when Samsung takes care of their audio issues and I buy the unit instead of the Sony or Aquos/Sharp. BUT I've read on the Amazon LNT3253H forum having 21 RECENT comments on audio problems with that model!!! I see now that there is an audio prob comment in the LNT4053H forum and reference made in the 50" product as well. I'm going to cut and paste a comment from the 3253 forum that seems to point to a problem with this generation of Samsung LCD HD units. This comment out of all of them seems to point to THE FIX by the Samsung service techs needing to swap out the main electronics board that includes the sound card...read on: In reply to an earlier post on May 23, 2007 7:26 PM PDTAndrew Chabak says:I had the same problem: as directed by Samsung I replaced the Comcast cable box, and then even replaced the HDMI cable. The problem remained. I contacted Samsung again, and they sent a Samsung repairman. He then replaced the main board which contains the sound card. Now it works correctly...no sound dropout! Also, I was told by the repairman, that this is a newer version of the board, and this problem has been fixed by him in the past. Call Samsung and ask for someone to come by and fix it. They have some bad boards in these. - Further comment by me: I see in the 3253 forum that there is reference made to other firmware or software updates/fixes being developed...yet those customers that have applied them still have the problem but at a lesser level of occurrence. I'll be calling Samsung tomorrow to see if they want my business .... and will judge how serious they are about tackling the issue that exists. Remembering that there is only a 30day return policy and 1yr warranty. I don't want a temporary bandaid that doesn't hit the actual root cause in longer term use after the warranty has run out. Let's keep them HONEST!!!
