Picked this baby up on Black Friday for like 800 bucks off at the time for like a grand. When I got it I didn't noticed that it was the exact TV my parents have but 46 inches instead of 55, so I immediately was like, "oh, this is going to be nice." It definitely has been. I mounted it on my wall, slightly tilted down, have a HD DVR and a PC connected into it. It's a gaming PC at maximum settings and I have to say it's the best picture I've ever seen. No dead pixels, low heat and low power consumption. The backlight of the TV auto adjusts depending on what's showing, so that's nice. it's 120hz too, so that's good. It does have that auto smoothing thing called the "soap opera effect" which I now understand why it's called that.To my surprise it has a built in Media Center. With the 2 USB ports you can actually plug in your flash drives or external hard drives and watch your movies and shows. It can also read pictures and music. The other option to hauling your USB drives around is using the network. Samsung offers a wireless adapter you can plug in to gain network access or just use an ethernet cable. Samsung says you need their PC Media Manager program in windows to share programs to the TV, but it's slow as heck and doesn't auto update the library when you add more files to the folder. It can, however, see your windows shared folders. I haven't really been able to access them, but since it can see them, there must be a way.The only con I could even think of is that it's too closely priced to it's 3D counter-part. I think 3D is a waste of time at the 720 and lower resolutions, some 1080 shows too. Maybe when it's higher, but for now, in my opinion, it looks like layered cut-outs.So yea, I would recommend this as a gift to you are your friends. It'll undoubtedly get cheaper the more prevalent 3D becomes. It really is thin and sturdy has heck.
