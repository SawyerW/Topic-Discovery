I ordered this TV late night July 1.  I got it around 11:00 this morning through CEVA.  The delivery service doesn't affect my opinion of the TV, but CEVA was excellent.I immediately hooked up my PS3 and HDMI cable (Cables to go 3 meter 10.2gbps, bought from amazon) and after fixing the sound and video output settings (I had it hooked up via DVI and RCA cabling, and my old TV only accepted up to 1080i) it worked beautifully.  Even without being hooked up to my surround sound system, the sound quality is good.  It won't blow you away, but given the form factor of the TV it's still better than I had expected and good enough that I'm not desperate to hook up better speakers.I popped in Blade Runner on Blu Ray and noticed the picture was a bit fuzzy.  I then checked and found that the PS3 was outputting 1080i as that was the best my old TV could display.  A quick change to 1080p and away I went and was absolutely amazed by the picture.  I didn't see any judder, and the colors were magnificent.  Black levels seem good, but I have it in a room with windows so I can't make it completely dark to really get a good feel for it yet.  The glossy screen looks nice when it's off, but is a little noticeable when you've got a direct light source on it.I bought mine as a refurb from Warehouse Deals by Amazon, which ran me less than 1100.  It came in the original box, has no dead pixels, and works perfectly.  There was some tape adhesive on the bottom over maybe two square inches, but that will come off easily enough once I find where I put the cleaner.  This was my first time buying a refurb product from anyone apart from the manufacturer, and it's been great.  Very worth saving $400.Amazing TV.  I'd say it's definitely worth the $1500 Amazon has it for, but paying less is always nice too.
