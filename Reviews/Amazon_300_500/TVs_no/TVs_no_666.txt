If you've read many of the professional reviews of the UN46C8000, you know that one of the common criticisms has been ghosting and shadows when displaying 3D source material. With the June 28th firmware release, this problem has been greatly reduced and the 3D is spectacular. The new firmware load also adds a new "3D Optimize" option to the TV's 3D menu. Selecting this option seems to help minimize ghosting and enhances the 3D effect.Samsung also seems to have done something to reduce the amount of eye strain caused by wearing the 3D glasses. I can wear them for hours now and not notice any particular problem. Unfortunately, there's very little 3D material available yet, but DirecTV's 3D broadcasts are excellent, probably just as good as my one 3D Blu-ray disc.For other, non-3D material, this TV is simply superb. If you want to get the best out of it, I recommend you read the review at Home Theater magazine's web site (no, I'm not affiliated with them) and then configure the TV using their recommended settings. Unless you're already an expert at setting up a TV like this, you will likely get much better results by starting with their suggested settings than you would by starting with the factory defaults.Also, be sure you upgrade the firmware before you adjust the settings, because upgrading the firmware wipes out your customized configuration. Then write down your settings and save them for the next time you need to do a firmware upgrade.One other item I wanted to mention is that several web sites, including televisioninfo, have stated that this TV "has a very heavy-handed dynamic contrast ratio" that you can't turn off. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dynamic Contrast can be adjusted or turned off completely under the Advanced menu. When it's off, I notice none of the adverse affects on the picture mentioned in some of these reviews.
