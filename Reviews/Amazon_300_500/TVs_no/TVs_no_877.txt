This TV was viewed at Best Buy, along with several TVs. It was as sharp and clear as any TV in the store. The picture has great blacks and striking realistic picture and colors. It has good sound even though I usually listen with a Onkyo 7.1 surround system hooked up to it.Pros:1. This TV has no buzzing sounds often noticed on older Plasma TV's.  2. TV has a very clear picture with great color and even better Blacks.  3. My old 2008 Sony 52 inch TV cost approx 4X THE PRICE OF THIS TV.  4. This TV looks more realistic than my old Sony with colors that are not overstated or phony looking.Cons 1. This TV is only 720p not the 1080p I was looking for. Yet it is clearer and sharper looking than the SONY when it was new.  2. This TV has no internet capabilities, but this is OK because I own a Play Station 3 and get the internet (Netflix etc.) though it.  3. First TV arrived with broken screen, but in two days I had a new TV that worked wonderfully.If you have to have the status of owning a 1080p TV then do not get this TV. If you just want a great picture with great color than buy this soon.PS. Almost no TV's on the market today show a 1080p picture. They might have 1080 capability but in 2011 no cable or satellite company brings 1080 into the home (they broadcast 720p). Indeed. only a Blue ray player showing a movie filmed with a blue ray camera has true 1080ip All of these movies you could count on one hand in 2011. It will be 8 to 15 years before the cable subscribers all go to 1080p, and that the movies on Blue Ray are not just remastered DVD's. By that time you will need a new TV.
