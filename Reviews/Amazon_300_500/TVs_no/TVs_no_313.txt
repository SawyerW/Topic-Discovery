While some complain about reflections being an issue, I have found that as long as I keep any sources of glare directly off the screen (particularly directly behind your seating position), glare is hardly an issue. Off axis viewing is superb, as well as color accuracy and contrast. I DO highly suggest you get your set professionally calibrated for the best viewing experience. (This model supports the highest level of calibration possible unlike most consumer grade LCD sets.)For use in a dimmed home theater setting, I have seen few sets that can equal the quality of the image. (with the exception of extremely high-end plasma displays costing many times the cost of this).The swivel base is both nice looking (glass covered) and proves to be handy when making connections on the back or for different seating arrangements. Wall mounting is handy, but be sure you use screws included with the set to attach the wall mount brackets. The depth of other screws could be too long and damage the internals if you are not careful.Drawbacks are the fact that due to the thin profile of the set, the sound from the built-in speakers is anemic but does play loud enough for general viewing. I highly suggest a proper home theater system for viewing movies, etc.A second "drawback" for some would be the fact that the set is quite heavy because the face is solid glass and the rear is metal (not plastic). Personally, I find this to prove the quality of the set inside and out, but it can be difficult to lift/move for many people. And you will want to go with a wall mount that can support the extra weight if you go that route. I have used a heavy duty double arm cantilever mount with no issues with the set for almost a year before using the included stand. Just be sure both the mount is capable of the weight AND the attachments to the wall are STRONG and very secure!
