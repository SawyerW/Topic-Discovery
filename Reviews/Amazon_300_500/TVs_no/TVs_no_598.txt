I just received my Samsung PN58C8000 this week, set it up, and I must say, this is one awesome tv.  I found a few sites online that had the calibration numbers all done for this, so I took about 10 minutes to set my tv up with the same numbers, and the picture is flawless.  Blacks are deep, colors look natural and not oversaturated.The audio from the tv is sufficient, however, I have it hooked up to a 7.1 surround sound system, so the tv audio rarely will be used.I like that the tv can see all of my devices hooked up to the network and can pull in my music, photos, and video content. I have tried using the Hulu Plus and the Netflix apps that are built into the tv, and they also work well.  My only complaint is with this, though. I cannot seem to find a way to turn off the "soap opera effect" from the motion judder canceler. It is visually jarring to watch something that looks like it's being fast forwarded.As far as 3d content, I watched the first shrek movie that came alone with the package.  It does a great job with 3D. I also used the 2D to 3D conversion to watch Mission Impossible that was playing on tv.  While not quite as deep as with shrek, it did a good job of showing depth in halls and separating the actors from the background.I also have a PS3 hooked up and tested out a couple of the 3D games available including PAIN, and Avatar.  Both of those were impressive as well, but they did take a little getting used to.  I tried God of War 3 using the 2D to 3D and it was pretty awesome.  I can see getting a lot of use out of this TV being a big gaming fan.
