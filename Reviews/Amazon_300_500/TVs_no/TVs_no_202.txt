I own this TV, and have never had a problem with it. It works well, was a HUGE upgrade from the old Apex 13" SDTV (Standard definition) in my bedroom, and serves it's purpose as a lightweight, high(er) definition TV, with a larger screen quite well.I have never experienced a dead pixel in the screen or any serious problems with the unit itself.The only real downside is that if you have this TV up high, and try watching it while sitting on the floor the display appears darker than it actually is, which can be somewhat of a pain...However, this is a great TV at a great price, it works well for what I needed it for, now I can watch all my DVDs and video games at up to 525p Enhanced Definition, and the light weight of the unit made it less of a pain to get up the stairs.Pros: Enhanced Definition at low cost to you!Not all channels/games are yet using full 1080p HD, so this 525p EDTV works quite well with a Progressive scan DVD player or Sony Playstation 2 video game software, that can usually only display up to 480p anyway.Light weight (15 pound) design makes it easier on your back to carry it upstairs, downstairs, or even just lifting it up onto your TV stand.Flat panel design opens up a whole new world of placement options for you! Sit it on your TV stand, ontop of your bedroom dresser, or mount it on your wall like a picture frame.Built in ATSC & Digital QAM tuner! (So it'll still work in 2 years without need of a converter box)Composite, Component, S-Video, and Coax cable inputsMakes even basic cable look better!Includes intuitive, easy to use remote!Cons: The instuction manuel is poorly written and not very helpful when it comes to setting up your TV, (thankfully it's easy enough to setup on your own, and it's default setting are fine to begin with)TV screen is hard to see when you're sitting at a lower level than where the TV is placed.The buttons are placed on top of the TV instead of in front, so that can be a little disorienting at first.Overall: This is a great TV at a fair price, great as a replacement & an upgrade for a broken TV, ideal for game rooms, rec rooms, bedrooms, or even the living room.Overall rating: 4.5 Stars
