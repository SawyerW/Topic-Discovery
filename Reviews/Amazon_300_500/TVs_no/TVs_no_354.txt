I went to frys and took days looking at the competition.  The 650 model is $300 more than the 550 but just blows it away in contrast.  It's not nearly as shiny and mirror like as I thought. 60% less than a projection monitor it replaced.  But, if you need matte you need it but otherwise this is perfect.  Sony, not sharp enough.  LG, gray black levels. Mitsubishi, poor repair record.  Sharp, crap.  Panasonic, gray blacks, poor color.  Some of those other brands also have poor side colors but that didn't matter that much to me.  The Samsung definitely has a sweet spot but it should be wide enough for most rooms.The set doesn't have the widest high contrast viewing field (yes, it's a "S" panel).  I have a Panasonic 32" that's much better (practically 180).  But the sweet spot on this is fairly wide at about 70 degrees. That should be enough to accommodate a full room.  The colors don't drop off, just the black level. The more off center you are the brighter the dark area gets.  But like I said, it's not bad.I did some power usage testing- The only thing that changes the power consumption is the backlight.  Backlight at 5 is 121 watts and it bascially goes up 11 watts for ever point higher.  6 is 132, 7 is 143, 8 is 154, 9 is 165, 10 is 176.  8 looks good in a fairly bright room while 5 is good for a room with just a 60 watt bulb at night.Addition:The bezel scratches WAY too easy!  Even a baby's @$$ would scratch it.  Buy a feather duster and only use that to clean it.  Even if you get spots on the bezel don't wipe them off.  The scratches are very noticeable in the light. I'd rather see the dirt spots then scratches.  Samsung really screwed up when they decided on the bezel plastic!
