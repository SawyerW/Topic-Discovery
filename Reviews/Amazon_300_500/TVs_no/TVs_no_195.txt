Let's just say I have had my experiences with LCD TV's. I have a Westinghouse (which has 67+ Reviews on Crutchfield alone, a Sharp and a Samsung) With all that said, this Toshiba puts them all to shame. All the Extras hooked up: PS3, HDTV Sat, HDTV Over Air and of course SD Sat; without any doubt this TV on a whole Blows away the competition (coming from a Die Hard SONY fan) The important stuff; 3 HDMI inputs, TV Optical Out, Ability to select Direct Input when changing Video Inputs(this is important when programming Universal Remotes), A ton of Video Settings and of course it is simply Beautiful.Designed in the image of the Classic Sleek pricey Pioneer Elites or the always gorgeous hard to find LG LCD sets; it's absolutely clean on the outside in the surrounding fairly thin jet Black Bezel...The speakers are hidden, but yet they sound amazing(Adjustable settings). The Picture in SD is beyond ANY other I have seen on an LCD. In HD the set will blow you away, guaranteed! Over the Air reception of HD is spectacular; I picked up 10 channels (5 HD) I did not have before. My PS3 comes to life, especially in Game Mode; all this and I have no space to mention the PC input. The Remote is better than most TV Universal remotes, with the odd exception of it not having a direct on/off CC button(Odd!)..Toshiba has truly figured it out and has set a New Bar for all those "other" Manufacturers to follow. Go compare all the specs on Crutchfield! But Do not let the Amazon price fool you; Toshiba has given the best absolute quality at below average Name Brand pricing...Everyone I have shown the set to, has been in Awe!...then when they hear the price, Forget about it!
