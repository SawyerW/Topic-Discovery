I've been very impressed with the Samsung TV's for a number of years - they have very impressive image quality, holding fine detail down into the black areas of the picture. I bought this model to replace a 42" Samsung "HD Ready" 1080i unit, which was only about 5 years old (and still has a very good image quality - but I wanted to upgrade to 1080P).  After a bit of research and many comparisons, I came to the conclusion that (a)Plasma is still better than LED and (b)Samsung still has the best overall picture quality.I was ready to purchase the lower end model - the PN50C550 - which really has all the features I need and is quite a bit less expensive, but I was able to get a bundled deal on the PN50C7000 along with a Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player and FOUR of the 3D glasses for a good price at Best Buy (most of the other packages I had seen only came with two sets of glasses, and were still more expensive!).  It will be a while till there is a decent selection of 3D movies, but it's a "nice to have" feature in the meantime.Overall I am exceedingly happy with my purchase, with a few caveats:- Upgrade the firmware immediately. The newer firmware version fixes quite a few problems, specifically with correctly setting the color space and resolution when playing a standard def DVD from a Blu-Ray player (and it also improves the 3D performance, minimizing the "ghosting" that many people have complained about)- The sound quality from the internal speakers is poor. I think it's the best they could do with a TV that is this thin, so the designers were constrained by the physical dimensions which prohibit proper speakers.  Get yourself an external amplifier and some decent speakers (I recommend the Denon AVR591 and the Definitive Audio ProCinema-600 speakers)- There is no S-Video input (another reason to get an external amplifier - just make sure you get one that has analog in and upsamples to 1080P HDMI out)You can't go wrong with the Samsung PNxxC7000 series (at whatever size you desire) - and if you want to save some money and don't need the 3D, the PNxxC550 series will probably suit your needs just fine.
