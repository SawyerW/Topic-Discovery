This tv is absolutely amazing, hands down best tv I own or have ever owned!!!I have a Toshiba 32" LED 3D 240Hz (which is still working 2.5 years I've had it with no defect in any quality. It's picture quality and anti-motion blurr features are amazing for watching Football, Hockey, and playing Videogames. I have a 37" HD LCD 1080p insignia 120Hz that some tube or bulb inside the tv broke (the screen went black one day during use of it, but it ended up being a $150 repair and it still work's today) this insignia I have owned and it's been heavily used since I purchased it in 2006, and lastly I have a Hitachi 32" HD LCD 720P 60Hz, which I've had for 2 years as a guest tv (for friends to bring over their gaming systems and use).This Vizio Razor 42" LED, Anti-Motion Blurr, Energy Saver, 4 HDMI ports, and the ability for the Remote that came with the tv to pe programmed to your cable box so you can have a more convenient universal remote, which for me is great because I have too many remotes as it is..This tv is so much better than I could've ever expected it to be, and for it's price I decided in a matter of 2-3 minutes to purchase this tv rather than risking my luck on Black Friday (or cyber Monday.My only complaint with this refurbished 42" Vizio M421VT (which is a very, very minor complaint; but still not something I'm a fan of nonetheless. On the front of the Tv there's a nice backlit Vizio emblem, the only issue with that is the backlit Vizio emblem is always lit. The only time the brightness/intensity of the VIZIO Emblem chances slightly is from when the tv is either off or it's turned on.
