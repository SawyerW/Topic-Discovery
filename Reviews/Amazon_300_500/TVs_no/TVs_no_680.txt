This was an anniversary present for my husband. Not knowing very much about LCD's, LED's and Plasma's I started researching on-line for direction. After I narrowed it down to an LCD I researched the various brands.I appreciated the variety of information on the LG 550 .. I didn't want to only go by what was said on the LG site, after all, what else would one expect to read from the manufacturer but glowing reviews.I found a tech site that offered objective reviews on the top brands. It broke everything down giving opinions/reviews on things in particular as well as an overall review. It offered rankings based on numbers sold in a category as well as a rating based on consumer reviews; then I could read the reviews - good and bad.After all was said and done the LG 550 with netcast and internet capabilities grabbed my attention ... and never let go. I found a great price on Amazon.com. I printed out a description of the Television, a picture of it as well as the specifics/stats and gave it to my husband. We both anxiously awaited delivery ... and we have NO REGRETS!I rate highly the excellent customer service of Amazon.com; they make everything easy - from account set-up to keeping their customers informed of the transaction every step of the way to tracking the shipping.Once we had the LG 550 set up we thought what we felt must be what new parents feel upon the arrival of their first child. We think the look of the television is beautiful - sleek, clean lines. It even comes with it's own cleaning cloth. Everything about the television is, thus far, proving to be just as we expected based on what I had read.We haven't used the Netcast feature yet - were are trying to figure out how to get the service. If I have one complaint it is the fact that more information on HOW to establish Netcast service needs to be included with purchase of the television.Other than that, we are pleased with the LG 550 and would highly recommend it.
