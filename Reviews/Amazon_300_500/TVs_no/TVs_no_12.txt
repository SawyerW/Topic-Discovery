i am writing this review because i lost sound on this TV a week ago. I just got the sound back and want to share how i did it (in my case).I bought this TV in late 2004, not from Amazon. The TV over the years has worked fine. A week ago the side speakers attached to the TV monitors lost sound. Luckily i was still able to get sound through external stereo speakers. But it was inconvenient because i could not use the cable remote control to control volume.Initially, i followed the instructions in the manual ('trouble shooting'). One thing to try was to go to Menu (via the TV's the remote control), then Option, then Output Select. But the Output Select was grayed out; i could not get to it. So i just thought the 32" does not have this option (the manual is for both 32 and 37). i searched the website and got to a forum discussing the no sound problem; some people said the no-sound problem is related to a design flaw, and Sharp will send techinician to fix it for free, even outside the warranty period.So i called Sharp but no such luck. Sharp over the phone made me try various things, including getting to Output Selct, which was grayed out, and they had no clue how to fix that. i specifically asked if i should do anything with the AVC unit; i was told NO. At the end, i was given a Sharp service shop near me, which would cost me $65 minimum (understandable). I decided to do nothing for now; i thought maybe i should just get another TV.Today, God helped me! I read the manual again and decided to press Reset on the AVC system - one reason i never did that was because there is no obvious reset 'button' on the AVC; there is just a small little dot "inside". I decided to press the dot with the tip of a letter opener.... the sound came back! i then went to see if Output Select was still grayed out- it is no longer grayed out!!
