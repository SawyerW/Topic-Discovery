I have had this HDTV for 2 months...  by the time you read down to my review, you have already read the technical side of everything related to this TV.  I rate it "Amazing & Flawless".***** Delivery:  I had never ordered anything so big from Amazon before.  But I am a believer now.  One thing to remember - Amazon does not deliver this - their agent does, so get that service's phone number and call them to schedule and verify the date and time.  And make room in your house for this Big Box!*****  Lighting:  I was worried about three issues during the selection of this TV:  Glare,  viewing angle, and viewing distance.  I looked at this TV in the store and there was little glare, and I found comfortable viewing even at 45 degrees.  At home, it is even better.  Compared to other Plasma the LCD TVs, this has them beat.  Whether I watch this from 8 feet away on the couch, or from 16 feet in the kitchen, it's great.  Some seats on my L-shaped couch get a 45 deg. angle, but they are still excellent views.  Glare from the kitchen area and hallway, as well as the windows on the side of the family room - not  a problem at all.  The LED is bright and cuts right through that.***** Picture:  I have not modified any of the default settings.  I know there are plenty to play with but I am still in OMG picture shock.  I recorded the 1080i version of King Kong on my HD cable system, and I use that as a demo to my friends.  The fight scene with the T-Rex is amazing on this set.  Watching old movies - like you see on TCM - they look "interesting", almost 3D like.  There's probably a setting to adjust them.  And some standard def. programs have a bit of a "jerk" to them sometimes.  But I don't think that is the TV's issue - I think it's the cable system  (Samsung HD 3270).  Watched Band of Brothers all weekend in 1080i mode - outstanding!*****  Inputs:  plenty of HDMI inputs.  I have used my laptop with the PC video cable.  Talk about a big desktop.*****  BluRay input:  I got the LG BD90 (also through Amazon).  This has the true 1080p.  Watched Terminator Salvation - amazing.****  Sound - OK, the sound is not 5-star.  But if you read Consumer Reports, and these reviews, you already know that.  But your best movies will be watched with your surround sound stereo, so for me, it's not a big deal.  I got this TV for the picture.
