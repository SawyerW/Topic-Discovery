TV model is UN46C7000 Software version is FVALAUSC-10212 version: SQ01Purchased on Nov 2010, this TV started to have problem on Feb 4, 2012.  On Feb 4th, 2012, the TV suddenly turns off by itself without anyone triggers it.After this turn off issue, the TV would display a line of white light at the bottom of the right side of the screen, near the red light power indicator.  Then, TV would not function.  It would not respond to any remote or direct action.  At this time, the only way is to unplug to power cord, wait a few minutes and plug the power cord again.  Next, an attempt to turn on the TV would result the same "auto turn off" problem.  The TV may stay up for 15 minutes or 20 minutes before going back to "auto turn off" again.According to the user manual on Page 24, there is a Sleep Timer.  However, this "auto turn off" has nothing to do with the Sleep Timer.  I followed the instructions on Page 24 section "Using the Sleep Timer" to confirm the Sleep Timer is off and none of the Timer is active.  (Even if a Sleep Timer can explain it, it does not explain the line of white light issue and non responding issue)As I searched the Internet, I tried to find the answer.  It seems CNET has some reviews on this issue across a few TV models, in addition to UN46C7000.Meanwhile, after a horrible experience yesterday with this TV, I was eager to see what happens with this TV on Feb 5th.  Incidentally, so far, for 4 hours, this TV does not have the "auto turn off" problem.Still, since it happened once, I suspect that one of these has issue:  the tuner, sensor, motherboard, or firmware.Please advise if anyone has more information on this problem.  Thank you!
