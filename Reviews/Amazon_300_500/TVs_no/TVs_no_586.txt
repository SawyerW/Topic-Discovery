UPDATE - Still love the TV, but am a bit annoyed with amazon. They are running a promotion and you can get a 3d Bru-ray player and 3D Starter kit with 2 glasses and a movie for FREE. I assumed they would just ship them, but I guess you have to put them in your cart like your buying them and than at check-out, the cost for them is removed... So I call amazon a bunch of times to get them, the only way they will do it is if I return the TV I have now and submit a fresh order... I did this, but what a waste of time for me and for amazon... oh well, its still a great deal!I have had this TV for about a week now and am amazed at what a great picture it produces. Video games look very nice, blu-rays, wow. This TV is also very slim, about an inch thick!3D: I dont have a 3D blu-ray player yet, but have played with the 2D -> 3D up convert and it is pretty nice, it dosn't have the pop of true 3D content, but you can see depth, great feature for existing video games.Issues: I don't hear any buzzing at all. I have read that in other reviews, but I don't hear anything. I did notice the video camera "soap opera" effect, that I had never seen on a Plasma before. I downloaded a a firmware update and played with the picture setting and this went away.Delivery: I have had both of my samsung big screen TV's delivered through amazon and both went great. They were on time and helped plug it in to make sure it was working and not damaged in transit.My other TV a 2 year old 52" samsung LCD is no where close to this. This settles the LCD vs. Plasma debate for me. Better motion, colors  and price, Plasma is just better.
