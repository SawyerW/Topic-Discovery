Originally purchased my television to replace an old LCD. After I set this one up, which wasn't too difficult, I had little problem lifting the large yet small screen into the bracket my wife lined up. The user interface was easy to work with, I eventually had the settings to my liking. Now that I have everything connected to it, was glad to purchase a 1080 up conversion dvd player for it for my old DVDs (Gone in 60 seconds looks strangely realistic for a movie I originally saw on VHS). The combo of the TV and DVD player made me go out and get HD cable now. I am completely satisfied with the television purchase. I did however, find the stock speakers on the television average, wasn't worth dropping my six year old surround sound system. My only complaint was when connecting it to my speak system I didn't have the choice of using analogue outputs unless an addition part was purchased (Note: Understandable, my system was 6 years old). But when I went to a local electronics department store, I opted for the digital output cables. Which was a good choice for ease of access. Whenever you start up like a DvD the TV will auto switch to the movie which is nice, it just doesn't seem to do it going back to TV, my guests usually have to call me to find out how to switch it back. It's a short conversation however, but they assume it just transfers between sources by a button rather then going through the menu. Currently have my PC connected to it and it runs without any problems, great for netflicks watching. Excellent TV if you want a "Regular TV", I was interested in the new internet TV gimmicks, but I'd rather buy the add-on google-tv or whatever than sacrifice quality for those features right now.In summary - Great picture, consider connections for your speaker system if you have one, Excellent TV if you want a "Regular TV" and not some giant phone TV with all the app's.
