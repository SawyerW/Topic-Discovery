I bought this TV from Amazon, 3 years ago.  We live in a very narrow row home, so I was looking for an inexpensive flat panel to replace my large bulky TV.  Space-wise it's great!  Picture quality is average.  Sound quality is poor.First, the picture is not high quality but I knew that going in.  I was not sure what to expect.  I was satisfied with the product when I received it.  It's not great but it's good enough.  However, for the price it could be considered great.As for the sound quality, it sucks!  The speakers are located on the sides facing the back of the TV.  Who sits behind a TV?  When we turn the sound up close to it's highest possible volume, the sounds starts to get even more muffled than usual.  This is just poor engineering.The remote that is included is huge and bulky.  We have comcast cable.  We tried to program the cable remote to Sylvania with no luck.  So we have to used 2 remotes.  The cable remote switches the channels and the TV remote controls the volume and the power.Other than that, this TV has S-video and RCA input jacks.  That is a plus because we connect out laptops to the TV.  It also has output Audio jacks for surround sound.  If this is the way you are going then the TV speakers shouldn't matter much.Lastly, remember that this is a monitor and does not have a tuner!!!  If you do not have cable you will be using a VCR or DVD for the tuner (most VCR/DVD combos have them, not all DVD players do).  This transmits a hum from the VCR/DVD tuner.  We have cable and it eliminates hum.  So if you have cable, that should not be an issue.Overall, I give it 3 stars becuase it served us well for the last 3 years but with the new technology and prices dropping, I would buy something with a tuner and better sound quality now.
