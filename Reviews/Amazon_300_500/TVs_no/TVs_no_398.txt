I looked around and researched alot when trying to find a good 40"+ LCD.Was looking into Samsung and Sony..Both had to many faults and just a little too much..This LG was decent price for a very good picture and Television.Looks just as good as other great brands.I was not sure about buying this from amazon but for the price difference i thought it was well worth the wait and nerves.Ceva Logistics shipped this In very quick fashion.Was shipped on Dec 4th from Penn.Made it to San Antonio,TX on Dec  10th.They called and set up a delivery the day before,then two guys delivered it only said they were there to make sure it turns on and i set everything up myself...Not Bad though, You need a screw driver to put together the tv stand,other than that its just1. Put stand together, eight screws in total,(Very easy).2.Plug in and turn it on, You're Ready to watch!(Fantastic)3. Maybe change some of the video settings.I'm watching and loving this LCD as I type this.. I had a tight tight budget for my new LCD, this is very very good LCD for the decent price.The truemotion 120Hz feature is good for Games and Sports,Keep off if you watch regular shows.However I would like to have quicker access to this feature through a button on the remote,it can get old going through a very nicely made menu.The menu is smooth and easy to follow,very visual...The remote is thin and doesn't have tons of buttons or any stupid wheels...ALL in ALL TV is great, Picture is excellent, Price is Excellent,Set up is Easy,and hope i dont have to tell you how customer support is.Not a Tv to pass on for any reason i was going into a samsung but then saw this one and changed my mind very quickly.I would recommend this to anyone.Shipping was scary but it got here fine and im happy.Amazon has been easy to deal with now i see if my service plan is coming.
