I am comparing the sony to a JVC that was about the same price.  I am by no means an expert when it comes to flat panel TV's.I did not buy from this site. One of the national clubs has a better return policy. I purchased this TV and a 42 inch JVC.  I am returning the JVC.  The Sony controls and remote (although not multifunction)are superior in most aspects. I purchased both the JVC and Sony at the same time.Most of what I have to say are based on using QAM on Comcast (no cable box).  With the switch to all digital I found that Comcast in my area (northern suburb of Chicago) has put the digital starter stations on QAM. This means if you have a QAM digital tuner on the TV you can get these stations. Almost all large screen TV's have QAM.The Sony found the stations (about 100 of them) and put them in a fairly logical order.  I had to go through each QAM station and label them through "managing stations". I will have to make a cheat sheet showing which station is which. I have not seen any reviews that address the time it takes to change stations.  The Sony changes stations much faster than the JVC.It appears to be viewable in a brightly lit room. At night it is very bright.  I have not modified any of the settings - yet.I have not yet noticed the problems with the dimmer function that a lot of people have complained about, perhaps I have the update.It does not in my opinion manage the switching between wide screen and 4:3 very well.  It seems like I am always changing the settings depending on what I am watching.  The JVC did a better job.The JVC had an Ipod dock.  My teenage sons really like this they were disappointed when I told them I was returning it.If I was only using the tv through a cable box I don't know that wouldn't be more favorable toward the JVC.  It is a larger screen for the same amount of money.
