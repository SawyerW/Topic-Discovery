I think this is the first TV that I have ever bought that my wife raved about. She noticed the great picture and color on this set which supprized me as usually she does not notice such things. I really like the TV alot the size is perfect for my situation. The first night  I had it I noticed the fluctuating brightness issue but I set  it to THX mode and hooked up the wireless adaptor and it did a upgrade and no problems at all since then. If they still have some left this is a great value and you better get it now. The TV is great but the shipper was not Home Direct lost my first order of this set, how do you loose a 65inch TV? The second order went well although it arived a couple of days late, but they did call and set up the delivery time and the delivery people were nice and waited until I hooked it up to check it out. Overall I am very happy with my purchase a great value and to think I was considering a LCD TV, boy am I glad I did not do that as I watch lots of sports and sorry LCD lovers but the clolor and sharpness can not be beat with the Panasonic Plasma TV. Amazon was great during my lost TV adventure and really stepped up to help me out. I bought my last TV at Amazon and will buy my next one here also. I usually do not buy extended warrantee but I did on my last set and it paid off for me and I bought this set if making a large TV purchase the deal though Amazon on the Sqaure Trade warr is well worth it. I have not tried the 3D out yet but I think Panasonic is supposed to have one of the best 3D pictures and I am sure that it is. I think it is a great looking set also and pretty thin for a plasma, thinner than my last one for sure. The wireless hookup was easy to get to work without a hitch at all. I do not do many reviews and don't go into spec details but all I can say is buy it and enjoy it.
