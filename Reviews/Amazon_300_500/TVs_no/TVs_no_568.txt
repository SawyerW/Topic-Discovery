This is my first Plasma TV. I have 4 other LCD TVs. The reasons why I wanted to try out this Plasma TV was because of the price, high refresh rate, and 3D quality. The Plasma has any LED/LCD TV beat in all these catagories. And this TV is awesome...but get ready for a distinct buzzing noise that cannot be fixed. Your only option is to just turn the volume UP.I had two different Samsung technicians come to my house and tell me the exact same thing  "I'm sorry sir, but this is just what these plasma TVs do". They would not replace anything! They sat back in my chair that's about 10 feet away from my TV, we put the volume level on my normal listening level, and they both agreed that they can hear the buzzing noise. The buzzing noise can be heard very distinctly when you sit directly in front of the TV and are looking directly at the TV. When you sit to the side, the noise gets a little quieter. So this is obviously extremely annoying. And now Amazon will only offer me 80% of the current value if I return it. So now I'm trying to figure out if it's worth returning this and losing money...and then buying a more expensive LED TV in order to get rid of this horrible buzzing noise. I read other people's reviews about this buzzing noise, but they make it sound like this noise was really low and hard to hear. Maybe mine is louder than everybody elses, but it's very frustrating because a brand new 2010 HDTV should not make a buzzing noise...especially the top of the line Samsung. And now I'm hearing that Plasmas won't be manufactured anymore (this is what the Samsung told me). I wish I would've known this before I bought a Plasma. But now I know why Plasmas are so much cheaper than LEDs...even though they have a superior picture (2D and 3D).
