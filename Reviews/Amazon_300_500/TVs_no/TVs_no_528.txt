I was in the market for a circa-30" LCD display that could double as a television, and if you've priced things in that size range, you find out quickly that as soon as you go above 27" diagonal, you're into four figures (at the moment). So you could have knocked me over with a feather when Amazon gold-box specialed this 32" 1080p monitor with a TV tuner for about one third of the price I was seeing for other 30" 1080p plain monitors. And I was very pleasantly surprised at how fast Amazon got it to me, considering I took the free shipping option, expecting it to get here within three weeks, only to have it arrive in three days. It is huge for a computer monitor, it is bright, the colors are strong and well-balanced right out of the box, and setup was a breeze. I don't see how anybody can call this a bad monitor, or a bad TV, for the price. And the digital tuner in it is excellent, picking up about a dozen channels that my other TV with a digital tuner, plugged into the same source, couldn't.REVIEW UPDATED WITH NEW INFORMATION, PLEASE READ: This monitor reports its default resolution to Windows as 1440x900, and I previously rated this monitor 3 stars for misleading advertising, especially when at least three tech review sites also agreed that the packaging is misleading. On the contrary, while the monitor is reporting wrong information to Windows, this really is a 1080p monitor, and it really does give near-1080p resolution even in Windows. If you are having trouble getting it to support its full resolution, try this: assuming you have it hooked up to your video card via HDMI or DVI-D, set it down to 16-bit color (and apply changes), then set the size up to 1680x1050 and apply changes, then set the resolution to 59 Hz and apply changes. Now Windows will let you set it to 32-bit color. At 32" size and 1680x1050 resolution in Windows, and full 1920x1080p for TV and for its component inputs, this TV/monitor is an insanely good bargain at this price.
