Bought mine a week ago, and it is going back to B*** B** this weekend. It is an okay TV, but I bought it b/c I thought my PC could be hooked up. What they dont tell you is it is a HDMI port that can use a DVI to HDMI cable if your computer has a  DVI port, but a lot of computers have VGA (dvi is digital based, while VGA is analog) soo it was going to be more expensive to get VGA hooked to this tv than spending an extra $200 to get the 55" VIZIO that has a digital tuner (this one doesnt have), wifi capable, with apps, AND a VGA port. Yeah this one is going back. If you aren't looking for all those things, and really just want to save 200 then this is a good plasma. Just not what I want. Wish I had known this a week ago and would have saved the hassle of returning it, but live and learn =)***What I didn't like about this tv***Watching sesame street elmo and other characters were pixelized (being run through a hdmi cable, it shouldn't have been happening).This TV has a lot of glare, and even with adjusting the setting for the colors to be vivid, it  reflected everything in my den.Not the connections I want. The computer hook up is dvi to hdmi, and I planed on using a older desktop to hook up to the tv to let the kids do learning activities on it. (which was one of my big reasons for upgrading tvs).**The Better things about this TV**Even though its a 51" it is longer then wider, the 55" I have seems like it is about the same length on the bottom but taller on the sides.The sound was really good for a flat screen, I have read different people saying you need a sound bar. With this model (and the one I got to replace this one)you dont really need it.This TV is thinner then the LCD one I replaced it with.Over all it is a OK tv as I put in the title, just wasn't what I was looking for. This one was fine but if I am going to spend a lot of money on a big ticket item I am going to make sure it is exactly what I want, and this fell short.Oh and just FYI if you havent bought a plasma tv before, you arent supposed to lay them down (not even to go in your trunk to take it home) Best Buy wouldnt let me do it, but they did hold it till Papa could bring his truck that evening and bring it to our house. I hadnt read anything about that, so if you are planning on bringing it home yourself plan accordingly.Happy shopping!
