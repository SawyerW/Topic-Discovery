I think I got a bad unit out of the box. That in and of itself isn't especially damning - it happens. The picture quality from both the satellite reciever and DVD player was poor, even compared to my old analog television. I also tried upgrading to Composite video cables. However what I really didn't appreciate is an incorrect tech support phone number in the manual AND being handed a line by the online tech support person. Here's a snippet of their wisdom:Vizio: OK the DVD player would only need just composite cables or just component cables. And the coax cable you are using from the receiver to TV will not give you HD quality.Mi: But it doesn't hurt to have both the component & composite cables hooked up right? I'm not looking for HD quality but I expected at least as good as my old television. I'm wondering if I got a bad unit since both the DVD & Cable picture quality seems to be "off".Vizio: I would use just the component cables for the DVD player and look into upgrading your cables to the cable box if you are able to.Mi: Okay but, as I said, the DVD picture quality isn't good either, almost like it's out of focus.Vizio: It is probably because you are using both component and composite cables.Mi: Sorry, I don't believe that is it. I looked at the installation instructions and there are two sets of cables - one with three connectors (red, green, blue) and one with red and white. It shows them all plugged in.Vizio: Vizio has left the conversationYep, that last line was Vizio tech support hanging up on me.Update: I returned my unit to Sam's Club and bought a Samsung HD model. This one worked fine - same cables same everything.
