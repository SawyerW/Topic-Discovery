I did a lot of research on LCD TV's.  My first conclusion was that Samsung was the best quality and value.  My second conclusion were that I wanted the following pre-requisites: 40", 1080, 3 HDMI inputs, Samsung's clear panel (some models don't have it), at least 15k dynamic contract and a slick stylish look.  So I tracked the 4065 price on Amazon to get that....And all of a sudden, while waiting patiently for the right price on the 65, I came across the 69 and 71 lines came out of nowhere.  It was excellent timing! That's when I came to my third and final conclusion, which is I wanted 120hz (after seeing it in action in BB).  The 69 won because of its slimmer look and lower price (only differences I noticed were slightly higher contrast on the 71 model but thicker trim).  Anyway, I spent $1699 or $300 more than I was going to pay for the 65.  It was absolutely worth it.  It's currently $1499, so an even better deal.This set is beautiful in every way, not the least of which is the picture quality and features. 20k contrast ratio is great, but I think above 15k doesn't make a great difference. So the main differentiating factor is 120hz. You can alter the 120hz between low, medium and high.  What this does is eliminates the slight motion blur when people/things move on the screen.  For example, I was watching Snakes on a Plane in HD, and the outline of Samuel L Jackson's bald head when he was moving around stayed sharper than with 120hz off.  It looks amazing, but because it's on TV, it looks kind of like an artificial reality.  So that's something to consider if you prefer a little blur to remind you that you're just watching TV...On my way out to work every morning I spend a few minutes just watching it and admiring it.  I'm at work right now writing about it.  Bottom line, this TV is so good I'm at risk of losing my job for it!
