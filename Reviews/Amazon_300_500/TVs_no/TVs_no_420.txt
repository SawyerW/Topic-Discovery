I purchased this set at costco for $[...] because the spec sheet looked just amazing. Its got full hd resolution as well as 120hz, and the set is by far the best looking flat screen tv. There's minimal plastic around the screen, it's thin, and overall it's just a looker. So very much better looking than the Panasonic and Samsungs of the same size.Looks aside, the tv picture is simply not as good as other 32 inch tv's (and [...] agrees, they've reviewed the same model at 40in I believe). For one thing, there's significant patches of flashlighting all over the screen, most of which is on the upper left side. I suppose this could have been just my unit, but it was so annoying that it had to be returned. Flashlighting is basically patches of light when you're viewing a black screen. Of course, this might not bother you if you just watch regular tv, but if you're buying the set to watch movies or play video games, you're going to see light patches when the scene is dark. This drove me absolutely nuts.Aside from the flashlighting issue, I have to agree with what other reviewers wrote. It looks like there is too much light on people's faces. I couldn't get rid of this even after going through the set up and choosing darker resolutions etc. It looks like faces are glossy whiteish, which also drove me nuts.It's really not all bad though. First off, the tv has full HD, and the colors, other than black, are absolutely vivid and beautifully rendered. Also, at that price point, where else are you going to get a 1080p 120hz 32 inch with 2ms response time? I mean dollar for dollar, this set is quite good. So, if you're not a gamer, and can live with some of its flaws, the price is excellent and the set will fit your needs. But if you're planning on hooking up the Ps3 to play games and watch movies, etc. I think you'll be disappointed. I was. Hope this helps!
