I had been shopping for a 42" set for awhile. When I saw the deal for this plasma for $900 including white glove shipping and a free Logitech Harmony 550 remote ($75), I had to pull the trigger.Delivery service came 2 days earlier than initially estimated, but the crew from Eagle Global Logistics was 40 minutes late from their window. They unpacked it, set it up on the table I provided, and hooked up the component cables from my HD cable box. Everything looked great. I've been breaking in the TV ever since (on hour 110 of 250) to "harden" the phosphors, which can help mitigate image retention and burn-in.I went to the local Comcast office and switched out the old box with a new one with HDMI. Picture quality was slightly better on HDMI. HDTV is fabulous with very realistic skintones and no detectable motion blur.Next up was my Apple TV, which is wirelessly connected to a server in my office. Apple TV automatically upscales archived movies to 720p and that looked great too. DVDs upconverted via my DVD player are crisp with no artifacts.My only gripe is that I wish the speakers were more powerful than 15W. I figure this was partly a compromise for putting the TV in a slimmer package. No biggee.LCD is really dominating the market right now, especially in the 42" space. Analysts say that the plasma makers have realized this and are focusing more on larger sizes - 50", 60" and above. The manufacturers still have manufacturing capacity for 42" plasmas, so consumers may see serious price drops as these start to get phased out. That said, this deal was amazing and it may be hard to find better 6 months from now.The Logitech Harmony 550 came separately. I programmed it in about 90 minutes using the newest SW from Logitech's website. Since then I've been doing little tweaks to my liking. It's really nice to have only a single remote instead of four, especially because this is a bedroom setup.
