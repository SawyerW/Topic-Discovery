I bought this television on sale through amazon. Here is my list of pro's and con's:Pros:*Great picture quality*Easy set-up*Lots of available ports*This tv actually has games on it, such as sudoku and whack-a-mole.Cons:*Wireless dongle sold separately (was $75 at Best Buy). The dongle is made by LG specifically for these televisions. A regular wireless adapter from your computer will not do the job.*Remote control buttons could have been arranged better. For example: The "input" button is at the very top of the remote, while the directional pad is way down at the bottom. It's quite a reach for your thumb. Also, the "flashback" button, instead of going directly to the last channel visited, just brings up a list of all recently visited channels, through which you must thumb through, every single time. It kind of defeats the purpose of the button.*The Net-Cast feature. It's why I bought the tv, actually-- so that I wouldn't have to go though my game console to access Netflix and YouTube. But in this department, the LG does not deliver. It gives you seven wireless channels to choose from: Netflix, CinemaNow, MLB.tv, Picasa, Vudu, Yahoo!, and YouTube. No Hulu, no Pandora, no Google. Sounds bearable, right? Half the time, it cannot even connect to the internet, even though everything else in my apartment can. And for some reason, browsing YouTube on my tv brings back only a fraction of the search results as when browsing on a computer. The videos that *are* able to play are blotchy and pixellated, and not clear at all.*Because of my location (and I don't live in the woods), shipping was a big hassle. Way to go, amazon.Bottom line:If you're looking for a basic tv, consider this one. If you're looking for a well-made wireless-ready tv, buy a different brand. If you have nothing else better to do than sit at home all day waiting for packages to be delivered to your home, buy from amazon.
