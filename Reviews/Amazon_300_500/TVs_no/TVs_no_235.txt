Well, I've been waiting for HD TVs to come down in price since the first one that I ever saw(almost 10 yrs ago) was $30,000.  I had been researching an array of TVs and finally decided that LCD panels are the way to go.  At first I thought I'd spend only $400-500 on an Olevia since they tend to have pretty decent quality for a low price event though they are not a big name brand.  THEN... I came across the LN-T3253H at Fry's.  It was $1100 and on sale at $899+Tax = $1000.  I started researching the TV online and compared its features against other big name brands.  No other TV came close to having the same amazing features for the same price.  Others would have only about a 4000:1 contrast ratio and fewer inputs but would still cost about $1000+.  Finally, I found this beautiful TV for $879 at BestBuyPlasma.com.  This came without the addition of tax and with free shipping. BEST PRICE AROUND!After having this beauty for about 4 months now, I have not had a single problem... except when I first configured it with my computer. I looked up the best recommended picture settings and adjusted it accordingly.  It's only a 720p but the picture quality makes up for the lower resolution. The screen produces extremely bright and vivid colors.  I tested this by looking at 5MP pictures that I had taken down in the Caribbean.  I couldn't believe the details and color contrast that can be rendered.  Plenty of settings on this TV make it perfect for anyone. Since I am usually using it for the computer or watching TV at night I have the brightness turned all the way down, but when I watch the movie 300 I just press one button to switch over to my best picture setting.  I'm going to stop here cause I will just end up rambling.  CANNOT GET A BETTER PICTURE FROM A NAME BRAND MANUFACTURE AT A LOWER PRICE!!!  SIMPLY AMAZING!Setup:Vista Ultimate Ed.Biostar TForce 945P  motherboardCore2Duo 6600 2.4GHzNVidia 7600GT OC24-bit Sound Blaster Audigy SE2GB 600MHz RAMMain Display - Samsung LN-T3253H (HDMI)Secondary - 19" Viewsonic LCD(VGA)
