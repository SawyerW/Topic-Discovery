I bought this TV Super Bowl Sunday weekend on a steal deal at FRY's. I cannot post prices here but I will say that I got it at half of the list price on Amazon. This is a great deal for this TV with Internet capabilities. The picture quality is fantastic, I was extremely impressed with even Standard Definition DVDs being up-scaled to 1080p via my Sony DVD player.I do not watch Cable TV, I primarily watch movies and streaming content online. I use Hulu via my laptop computer with an HDMI cable and the picture quality is fantastic. The sound is very adequate for my 1 bedroom apartment living room. If you have a very large living room you might consider an amplified stereo system, but that is to be expected with such a slim TV like this.Netflix works pretty well on the TV as well, although I am not a monthly subscriber due to lack of online streaming content. Yahoo Widgets is a neat feature, although I have not really used it. I like the integrated Youtube program, it is easy to watch some of my favorite videos. However, I would like to see more options in the future (like being able to login to your favorites and your subscriptions on your Youtube Account). I would also like to see Amazon's Video On Demand service with this TV in the future.The energy Saver feature is fantastic. You can set it to Automatic, and it will adjust the brightness based on how bright your room is. If you turn on a lamp or light, then the brightness will increase, and when you turn them off then the brightness will decrease. I love this feature.I went back to Frys Electronics the next weekend after buying this TV and the price jumped back up to the full list price (Twice what I paid). I would not be willing to spend that much on this TV. But if you can find this TV on Amazon or an online retailer on sale then it is an excellent buy. I am very happy with my purchase.
