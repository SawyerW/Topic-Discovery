There's a general rule about rolling the dice and taking risks when buying electronics with cheaper price tags. The LG 47LC7DF is definately no exception to that rule. I have had mine for over two years and I would have to say that the biggest disappointment has to do with the short life span of the parts. When I brought my new tv home and set it up, I was quite happy with what I had paid for. The picture quality and the sound were decent enough (but not exactly mind blowing), but when I hooked up my PS3 and my PC to it with HD cables it was nothing short of perfection. Then, after eleven months of enjoyment, I went to turn on the tv one day - and the power light on the tv just blinked. It would blink about 16 to 18 times and then the backlight would come on, but nothing else would - no picture, no menu, nothing. Fortunately, it was still under warranty so I got it repaired for free. It turned out to be one of the boards. One of the guys who repaired it said that it was pretty common and that the new part would probably last just as long. Sure enough, just over a year later, the picture is gone again, and now it's no longer under warranty.This is not an uncommon issue. As a matter of fact, it is just one of several common issues with this model. I have found quite a few forums where people are having this and many other problems with the LG 47LC7DF. I am now stuck with a dust collecting oversized paper weight because I can't afford to replace the bad part, which runs somewhere between $150 to well over $200.Not everyone is as unfortunate with this tv. A few haven't had any problems, yet. So, go ahead and roll the dice. Who knows, you may get lucky.
