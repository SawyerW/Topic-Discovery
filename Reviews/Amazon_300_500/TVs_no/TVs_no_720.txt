I bought this TV from Frys but hey, a review is a review nonetheless. For most part, I am extremely satisfied with the product. It is pretty slim and neat looking except for the red/maroon boarder (not noticeable but I would prefer all black, personal preference). Plus the logos and buttons glow white only when powered up which is awesome. The contrast ratio is 5M:1. Blacks seem pretty fine, then again I'm not an expert and I didn't have any other TV set to compare the blacks against. Where brightness is concerned, it seemed better than most of other TVs. Again this is an LED TV and pretty good for the price I bought it at. Amazon in upwards of $1600 seems a little expensive. The only thing bugging me right now is its incompatibility with most of the Wireless USB Adapters; I've tried IO gear and Linksys and the TV doesn't recognize either of them. I called LG customer care and they told me it would be compatible with LG's AN-WF100 (Can't remember exact name) or something. I haven't found a store which sells it yet, LG's website says its yet to be released. If I can find a Wifi USB Adapter which it's compatible with, I'd be pleased. Also the auto-dimming feature seems great, but not for me, the picture seems very dark in power savings mode and the blacks take a major hit, but that could be just be me. All in all happy with the purchase. 4 stars simply because the TV doesn't "WOW" me but for the price you can't get a 5-star product.Edit: The Wifi adapter is AN-WF100 and costs $70 at Frys. Apparently I was told the 2010 LG TV's are only compatible with LG's dongle, which is definitely a take away since other dongles cost $10 onwards. I definitely don't want to pay $70 bucks for the same thing, for the time being, I'm using the traditional Ethernet/LAN cable.
