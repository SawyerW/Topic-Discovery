Had an old rear projection TV and replaced it with this TV.Sound isn't very good, as other reviews have stated, so won't belabor it.Picture is good once you get all your settings in place...this took me quite a while as there seems to be so many (and I wasn't thrilled with the default setting). I've been playing with these settings for about a week now. I don't like the smooth motion setting as it gives the "soap opera" effect and to me, takes away from the the film quality of films. I usually turn that off unless watching a sporting event. When watching sports on this setting, you really do feel like you are there. I am still trying to figure out how to get settings to stay though...they seem to go back to default and I find myself constantly messing with that (each component has its own settings, but when I change components, the settings don't always stay as they were before)...I'm sure it is just me figuring out the settings.The color of the picture is very good. Particularly reds. The viewing angle is 125 degrees for a good picture. As you get further out, the picture becomes more washed out. I compensate for that by turning the TV if I need to (if I'm in the kitchen while the TV is on), but it is still an inconvenience. I like that the screen has almost NO GLARE. It makes it easy on the eyes even in a brightly lit room. While the screen isn't shiney, the bezel surrounding it is, but not enough to detract from the pictureSome people may not care about the next comment, but...the TV really shows every little smudge/fingerprint. I am not a neat freak, but it is a nuisance. Make sure you use only recommended cleaners/provided cloth as the screen is delicate and you can mess it up.I got this set, with a Blue-ray player thrown in from Best Buy (black friday deal) for $1,000. So for the price, it is a very good TV. Don't think I would pay much more than $1200 for it though.
