I also bought this at my local wholesale club (you know, the one next to the largest big box store in the world) for less than a grand. I have 3 inputs connected to it - the cable box, an upconverting DVD player, and the PS3 - all using HDMI. And there's still one free HDMI port on the side. The audio output (S/PDIF only, so I needed a coax/optical adapter) is connected to my 5.1 surround sound system.The video looks amazing. This replaced an older 50" Toshiba LCD (1080i max, 1 DVI input, about $2,500 and it was a deal!), and the difference is astounding. It's mounted on a stand we got for it, in the middle of a custom wall unit, so it's a bit recessed.The initial setup uses a wizard to guide you through your preferred settings - you see two pictures next to each other, and pick the one that looks better to you. So you don't need any special calibration software, just follow the wizard.Using HDMI cables made a big difference. I originally connected it to the PS3 using component cables because the HDMI cables I had ordered hadn't arrived yet. When they came, I switched cables, and the difference was huge.The remote is only for the TV - it's not an all-in-one. But what would you expect? The remote is perfectly adequate for controlling the TV.The only thing I can complain about is the sound. The speakers are in the back of the TV, so the sound projects at the back wall, and as a result, it sounds muffled. I have no idea what they were thinking with this design. However, it doesn't matter if you hook this up to your surround sound system - we just always use the surround sound now.We liked this TV so much we bought a second one for the game/exercise room. That one is mounted over the fireplace and is open on the sides, and the sound on that one is fine.Great TV. Amazing value.
