I will start by saying this is the first smart tv I have owned, and has been a big step up from my previous regular HDTV.Pros:Pretty good quality for the price.Image quality is great, plenty of preset (and customizable) profiles to choose from.Detects Films/movies so the image quality/refresh rate will adjust - Film doesn't look "fake," and you don't have to switch from 120hz to 60hz.Plenty of apps to choose from (though missing Skype, which I was hoping for. No big.)Sound isn't bad, I saw the reviews about the not-so-great sound/audio. It doesn't sound too bad.There's an EQ you can play with if you think the audio is too flat.RELATIVELY easy set up (see below...)Cons (mostly customer service, not product):TV has started to freeze sometimes (i.e. when changing between TV to App, or App to App) Only owned and functioning for about 3 weeks/1 month.. so I hope this will be extremely rare.No Skype.Packaging "layout" needs to be improved - The "neck" of the TV (piece that attaches screen to the base) was taped to the corner  of the box and not very visible. We thought the piece was missing, and almost threw it out. Which leads to...Unacceptable customer service (Vizio, not Amazon) -  we called about the missing piece, and were told it would be here in 8 business days.Firstly, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If it was actually missing, that kind of turnaround is UNACCEPTABLE. I'm paying for prime, and the 2-day shipping. We want to watch our TV AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES.Secondly, this isn't a case of warranty parts. This is ORIGINAL PARTS, in ORIGINAL PACKAGING. You failed to include a vital  piece, you should overnight the cursed part to me. The shipping label should have been printing as I "yelled" at you over the phone.Thirdly, the piece took FOUR WEEKS to arrive. Bravo Vizio. You suck. I went on a 3-week business trip, and when I returned, the package still hadn't arrived.Luckily, I'm a great hoarder and I kept the box, so we found this piece later.
