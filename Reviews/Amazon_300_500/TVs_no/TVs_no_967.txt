This TV is a very nice looking TV in the store.  We ordered this and scheduled a delivery time at checkout.  Amazon did honor their price match on the TV as the price dropped $200 after the ship date.  Watch your timing because they only match the price once within 14 days.  If we jumped when it dropped $50 we would have lost $150 extra price match.When it arrived, the TV picture quality was great; unfortunately ours was defective.  It had a large (3-4") wide blue and green vertical bar down the entire front of the TV.  We returned it (scheduled a return pickup through Amazon and the carrier - you cannot send back the same day because you have to contact Amazon first).  Our refund was rather prompt.  The only downside with the TV is that with the glass screen it had quite a bit of glare.  I would give it 4.5 stars if you are using it in a room with windows and 5 stars without.  We returned to Best Buy and realized that nearly all TVs now have glass (vs. matte) screens - even LEDs/LCDs.We looked at TVs again and ended up going with a Sharp 60" Plasma TV.  The glare seems to be a little bit better and we are very happy with the 3D on it.  Both TVs have similar features and both are very highly rated TVs.  I'm sure ours was just a fluke with possibly being bumped in shipment.You can certainly feel comfortable ordering large, expensive TVs through Amazon (be sure it's sold or fulfilled by Amazon).  You can feel confident with both the 14 day price match and their free 30 day return policy.  The TV does not have something "wrong" with it (like ours did) in order for you to return it for free.  This is really nice that you can see it in your room without having to worry about having to pay to ship back what would normally be an expensive item to return.
