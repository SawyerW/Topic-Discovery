I purchased this TV 8/5/2011, it was shipped 8/11/2011 by 8/15/2011 I had to call Sony as a red vertical line appeared about a third of the way in from the left side of the TV. They gave me 2 repair places, neither would service my TV; well one number had been disconnected, so had I been given the correct number maybe they would have. I called Sony back, they gave me another 2 phone numbers. I finally got someone who would repair the TV, only he seemed to fall off the face of the earth. I would call and leave a message and get no return phone call. It is now December 29th, I've talked to Sony 3 times in the last week, they will not fix my TV but replace it with a refurbished TV. I do NOT want a refurbished TV, I want a new TV. I bought a new TV, spent good money on a new TV, that broke at no fault of my own, I want it fixed or replaced. They said they can't fix it, they don' thave the parts to fix it. I asked for a refund of my money or a gift card so I could replace the TV, they don't have the parts needed to fix it bnut since I am not happy with a refurbished TV, I can send the receipt and they'll look over it and see what they can do. Had I known that they weren't going to allow the repair place to fix my TV due to not have the parts available I could have returned the TV and gotten my money back, but they and the repair place drug me around for 4 months so now I am past the date I could return it. How does a brand new TV break within the first 5 days of owning it??? I would NOT recommend this TV nor would I recommend ANY Sony product at this point due to their customer service skills, or lack thereof!
