I was in desperate need of a 1080p 32" HDTV that would fit into the existing entertainment cabinet in my living room, which is exactly 31" wide. You'd be amazed at how difficult it is to find a 32" LCD that meets that requirement. Most are around 31.5", which is very close but just wouldn't fit.Long story short: The set has gorgeous picture quality. No complaints at all about that. Unfortunately, the speakers are extremely tinny and just plain awful. The limited audio controls in the setup menu allow you to adjust treble and bass. I wound up pulling treble almost all the way to the bottom to temper the scratchy highs, and then nudging bass up a bit. But don't turn the bass up too high, or the speakers will distort during loud noises. The best I can get it still sounds far worse than the 20 year-old standard-def set that this is replacing. This TV really requires the use of a separate audio system. In my case, that means I'm going to have to find a soundbar that will also fit my cabinet. I hadn't planned on that.The television is fairly easy to set up. My only disappointment there is that the set only offers a 4:3 pillarbox mode on standard-def input signals. HD input signals are locked to 16:9. Because the upconverting DVD/Blu-ray player I plan to use with this TV doesn't offer a pillarbox mode either, I'm going to have to train my wife to set the player for 480p output whenever she wants to watch her beloved Gilmore Girls DVDs, and then set it back to 1080p afterwards. Or else she'll have to watch them stretched, which neither of us finds acceptable. That's going to be a big nuisance (with a long learning curve, undoubtedly). Why don't TV manufacturers enable full aspect ratio control on both SD and HD signals?The set's a little expensive. But, again, gorgeous picture. I'm happy with the purchase overall, despite these caveats.
