I have three 24 by 60 windows facing the TV wall. Finding the best glare free TV was my number one priority. I was not planning to use my TV as a mirror to comb my hair on the way to work :-) Also I don't like to close my blinds completely and watch in the dark. Controlled light - when the blinds are partially closed - transforms the room and your mood.I must have visited Fry's, Best Buy and Circuit City a dozen times to look at and compare the glare in different models. I checked out the glare of every model on display with the TV on and off. I am sad to report that the Samsung LN650 series has a serious glare problem. Everything in front of the 650 series TV is clearly visible on the screen when the TV is off. When it is on, the reflections are still clearly visible except in really bright scenes. At home it will be more of an issue as you will not be cranking the brightness as high as the stores do to attract attention to sell the TV. It is a great TV otherwise. But what is the point in buying this TV if glare is your number one concern? I am surprised that people don't really care about glare and drop 1500 bucks on this TV.After I concluded my research I purchased the 47LG70 which has a matte screen. There is virtually no screen reflection and the picture is as good as the Samsung LN650 series - I compared them side by side at Fry's. If you are planning to put your money on the LN650, I suggest you at least take a look at the LG70 series. I have had it for a month now and it is great. I am surprised to find only 2 reviews on Amazon on the 47LG70 compared to hundreds of reviews for the Samsung LN650 series.
