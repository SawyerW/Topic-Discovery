This tv was perfect except for the fact that after a little over 2 weeks of owning it, we got a thick green vertical line going down the center of the screen. Phillips said it was defective!!! and they wanted to send us a REFURBISHED ONE TO REPLACE THIS ONE....and we would have to pay to ship our tv back to them...now obviously it was still in warranty, plus we bought the extended warranty. we only had it a little over 2 weeks, and they wanted to replace it with a USED tv....so we spent around 1,400 for a tv that would be replaced within 2 weeks. AND ON TOP OF THAT...the replacement tv would only have a 90 day warranty...so, that would mean that we were screwed out of our intitial 1 year warranty and the extended 2 year warranty....AND THEY WERE ALSO VERY RUDE AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALL!!!! If you own this tv already, take a good look at the manual and read through the warranty, I can guarantee you will not be happy with what is written in there. If you end up having a problem with your tv, you are basically screwed out of the money you spent for the tv!!! I WILL NEVER BUY A PHILLIPS PRODUCT AGAIN!!  After having this problem, I did some research and found many other people complaining about phillips lcd tv's...and the horrible customer service!!! So do yourself a favor and don't buy this tv unless you want to take the chance of having a problem with it, and then not having a good company to back up their products and provide good service to their customers.Luckily for us, the store that we bought it from is very understanding and willing to take it back so we can buy a different brand tv.  THANK YOU BJ'S!!!!!!
