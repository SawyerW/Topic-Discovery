I've had this tv since Jan 2010. So over a year now. Since day one the audio sometimes would cut out. I do have DVR and have only used DVR with this TV. And the only way to get the sound to come back on again would be to hit pause (on live tv) and unpause and it would come back. I've had 2 different DVR boxes, and I doubt that is the problem. I'm pretty sure its the HDMI ports on the TV. Even one of the cable guys from my cable company came out and said that he thought it was the HDMI ports. He said he sees them fail quite often on these newer flat screens.I have an Xbox 360 connected to it via HDMI and a Sony BluRay player hooked up to it. But have had audio/video issues off and on. Sometimes on Xbox I'll get a green screen. Other times the audio will completely cut out and not come back on for a minute or more. Sometimes installing the game to the hard drive solves the problem. But not always. I swapped the HDMI port for another one and it was fine.I also stream Netflix via the Xbox, and watch movies a lot on cable or DVD. I've noticed "ghost" images of what I'm watching get imprinted into the screen as black shadows. Eventually they go away, but they do get stuck there from time to time. I don't know if this is an issue with the TV or HDMI or something else entirely. But it didn't do it before. Its only started happening the last 4 months or so.It has had all these other problems since day one. But I figured it was my fault considering I purchased a display model from Walmart. It was their last one and it was a LOT less then a new one. Glad I have the extended warranty on it because I can see that I'll probably have to have it repaired soon.EDIT 1/25/13: My warranty is up this year, so I figured i better see about getting the issues with the audio fixed. Had a guy come over and replace the motherboard (which replaces all the inputs on the TV) and have had no audio issues since.
