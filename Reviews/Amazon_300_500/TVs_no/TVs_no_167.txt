Based on great reviews, I purchased this LCD HDTV from Amazon and received it in just a few days, however the unit I received was DOA.  I contacted Amazon by Email and they shipped a replacement TV to me immediately as well as arrange for a carrier to pick up the deffective one.  At this point, I was bummed since I had spent $1000 on a TV and had nothing to show for it as well as envisioning a long wait for a replacement.  However, the replacement also arrived in just a few days and it worked perfectly.  I have this TV in my bedroom on a standard (not HD) Dish receiver and off-air HD antenna.  The off-air 720p picture is better than my larger, more expenzive Mitsubishi 1080p picture, and the regular digital Dish picture on the Samsung rivals the HD receiver Dish 1080p picture on the Mitsubishi.  The tuner circuitry in the Samsung also is much more sensitive (stronger off-air HD signal) than the more expensive Mitsubishi.  On the negative side, the remote power on function is VERY slow in response and a bit irritating.  The standard and HD formats also switch back and forth on the Samsung as program, commercial, etc. formats change.  With the Mitsubishi I can set the wide HD format and it will automatically adjust the changes rather than display them in the  different formats.  If the Samsung has this feature, I haven't been able to find it yet.  Overall, this is a great bedroom TV (I was constrained to a 32" built-in space).  I shopped around a lot before I purchased this set.  Owning a 1080p set, I was concerned that since 32" sets were only available in 720p that I might be disappointed with the picture quality.  Not to worry-- The picture quality is awesome-- better than many 1080p sets!  Overall, I believe, without question, this is the best buy on the market when considering quality and price in a 32" screen.  It's also attractive when its off.  Very satisified with Samsung and Amazon!
