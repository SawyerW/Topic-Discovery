When I was searching for TV's I had a budget of $1000. I researched for a lot longer than I should have looking at LCD's vs. Plasmas vs. LED/LCD's. I wanted a TV that would give me the most accurate colors, best image quality, best gaming experience (Xbox 360), and best movie watching experience. Time and time again I saw that Plasmas deliver the best for these uses. You go to Best Buy or some other big box retailer and see all the TV's on the wall and the LED/LCD's look the best by far. But that's because they're on super eyeball-bleeding brightness because those stores are so bright. The Plasmas look terrible there. But bring a good Plasma back home and put it in your living room and it will give you amazing colors, rich blacks, and amazing detail. LED/LCD's for the most part make things look to fake I think. Anyway, I ended up with this TV for about half my budget price and couldn't be happier. The community at Avsforum.com is what won me over. Everyone raves about how good the panel is in this cheap TV. And they're right. I've had this TV for about a year now and its been awesome. 720P, even at 51in, looks great. You seriously won't see the difference unless you're watching a Blu-Ray movie that is very graphically intense and made for Blu-Ray watching. If you have this TV you really need to check out the owners thread at avsforum.com for calibration specs and details: [...]Only con I can think of about this TV is that it does NOT have normal audio out. The only audio out is optical. At this point I'm sure there are newer and cheaper models but this TV has been great. (I see its $749 right now, I got it for around $500 last year).
