Sharp 42" LCD HDTVModel #: SHA LC42D64UThis was my first purchase for a flat screen television and I waited 3 months to ensure that this product review is as accurate as possible. I'm not the type of buyer to buy a new piece of electronic equipment on a fly. My last television lasted 10 years, needless to say I shop for a long term investment. This television in one word is "beautiful."We (my wife and I) went to the store to buy a Sony Television--that's all we ever purchased in the past. They are simply too expensive and with the guide of Consumer Reports we started looking at the Toshiba televisions. We saw the picture quality of the Sharp Aquos LC42D64U and we were awestruck. We kept viewing other televisions and kept going back to the Sharp Aquos.It's just a beautiful piece of Art when it is off. It is incredibly slim and the shiny bezel gives it a golden touch. When it's on, watching the HD channels is so mesmerizing that it literally transcends you. The regular channels look very good as well but of course, not as beautiful as the HD channels. We have a standard DVD player and even with that, the picture is absolutely stunning--imagine with an HD DVD player.In addition, the television has an amazing list of features. It has several features including: an analog PC input, HDMI 1.3 with CEC and Deep Color support, side input panel, and a lot more picture adjustment settings. It also has an RS-232 control port if you have a control system for your AV. It has a USB port for updating firmware in the future which is a great addition (this will allow future HDMI protocols to be implemented).The only draw back I would give is that the speaker sound quality could be better BUT that doesn't take away from the overall performance of the television. If you have a surround sound system, then that reasoning is moot. If you don't, I would still purchase this television because the sound is very good, just in comparison to the television you'll expect a master sound theatre.
