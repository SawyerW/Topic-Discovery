I did a TON of research before purchasing this TV. There were a bunch of bad reviews on this TV, but after reading them all, I decided that they were all idiots. DO NOT buy this TV refurbished or get it shipped to you! Most of the reviews talked about  how the panel wasn't actually from Samsung or how the TV was broken after they got it shipped to them. The TV isn't supposed to by laid down and should not be shipped. Go to your local appliance store, I got a way better deal right after Christmas than I could find anywhere on the internet. Also, read the directions when setting up your TV! The quick quide is only one page! a few people kept complaining about how the TV was crooked when they set it up, and how it was clearly the stands fault. One guy even says how he returned the crooked TV and got a new one only to have it lean the other way. In the directions of setting up the TV, it says to screw the stand in sitting up so it will balance out and not be crooked because the stand is not adjustable. The speakers are not great, but you won't find any better on a flat screen. Do yourself a favor and buy some speaker to go with it. $50 speakers with a small subwoofer make it sound great.If TVs break, they almost all do within the first 2 years. I got the extended warranty plan and am glad I have the peice of mind.I also opted out of internet because it will cost you about 300 more, and just bought a HDMI cable to hook up my laptop to the TV. Also do yourself a favor and get a really good serge protector. If you have the money, you should definitely get this TV. It has AMAZING picture quality - almost excessively real with incredible depth (no need for 3-D). I have had this TV for over 6 months and I am still lovin it! Go ahead and splurge, it is worth it!
