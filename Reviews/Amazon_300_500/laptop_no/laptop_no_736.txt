I just bought one of these and am loving it. It's portable enough to take to class but still powerful enough to multitask, and the battery lasts long enough that I don't even bother bringing the power cord with me. It's great to have my computer with me at all times without having to lug around some six-pound beast of a laptop.Pros: Lightweight, attractive, and reasonably fast (no, it's not a suitable gaming machine, but it's really not intended to be). The keyboard is surprisingly nice to type on. It's by far the best laptop keyboard I've ever used. I thought it might be a little cramped, but it's virtually the same size as full-sized laptop keyboards. The multitouch pad is nice and very intuitive to use. It also manages to cram in an HDMI port and a memory card reader. The screen has a pretty good viewing angle, even though it does glare a bit much.Cons: Yes, it's a fingerprint magnet. They could tone down the gloss on the screen, too. The touchpad is a little sensitive, as others have said, but it really hasn't caused me much trouble, and I figure it can be fixed by tweaking the settings a bit. I haven't noticed the chassis squeaking that some reviewers have complained about. Also, it comes with a lot of Asus bloatware installed, but that's easy enough to remove. The dual partition setup on the hard drive is a little more annoying, but it can be fixed.If you don't want the drive split in two partitions, just go into the built-in system recovery utility BEFORE you set up the computer by pressing F9 during bootup. Then you can recover Windows to the entire hard drive rather than just the first partition. Yes, it's an annoying extra step to have to go through to have all your data on one partition, but it's better to do it before you transfer all your files over.
