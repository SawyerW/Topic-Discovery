The best surprise came after receiving it and discovering it is fully equipped for BlueTooth using the very capable Broadcom software. Rest assured, this Z580 has all the basics.This Z580 offers some high end components in this low budget introductory unit that allows all the abilities that people love about traversing the web, and there is no lag or interruption while streaming video or music. Doubling the RAM memory is possible but not really beneficial since a step upward to a Y Series Lenovo will net better results for the gamers. I'm gaining a real appreciation for the sturdiness built into Lenovo products and for the wide availability of Lenovo product data sheets. This Z-PC is ready for just about everything from the get-go, and it has an attractive platinum plum tint on its outer shell that shows an amazing resemblance to brushed aluminum.One cautionary note is that after purchasing your new Lenovo, create all the factory backups before making any adjustments to the hard drive. If just getting familiar with Lenovo products, one discovers quickly there is a new level of intricacy sitting in front of them, and a step taken too far may have no return path. Possibly more sophisticated than most people care to delve into, Lenovo is loaded with innovation, and a wide assortment of possibilities are readily available.UPDATE:  July 29, 2013There is no compromise for quality, and this computer has it all. Now after using it for several months, my appreciation for it continues to build, and I can't find anything about it worthy of any criticism. Its layout and its reliability are state of art, and I even purchased a second one. The price is going back up to normal again, but even at the full price this laptop will not disappoint. I have used many laptops, and this one is a no-nonsense example of what the perfect laptop should be. Again, a big thanks to Lenovo for this greatest of Z Machines!
