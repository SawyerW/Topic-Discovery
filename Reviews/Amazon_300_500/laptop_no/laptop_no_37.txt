First, I love Macs, and when this iBook G3 800 works, it's a fine machine.BUT... this series of G3 iBooks suffers from a very common and notorious soldering defect on the motherboard that affects about 90% of the systems.In fact, for 3 years after they were made, Apple was replacing them for free because the problem was so rampant, but that offer is long expired.Symptoms?  The system won't boot, or will boot and immediately freeze, or will freeze after a few minutes.  Many times, the machine will boot, but the display will be all black, all white, covered in stripes, or any of a zillion other display problems.  Some people "live with" the problem byactually clamping a C clamp onto the case in just the right spot to putpressure on the chip inside, which keeps it in contact with the board.Some people open the case and wedge pieces of paper on top of the chip, so that when the case is closed, they press on the chip to keep all the pins in contact.  But this is pretty dicey.The problem was faulty soldering on a ball grid array (BGA) chip on the motherboard.  In my case, I knew this going in, and sent the machine out toa repair services that specializes in this repair.  They disassemble the machine, and re-solder the BGA.  It's been trouble-free for 2 years and still going strong since I had that repair done.Search the web for "iBook G3 BGA defect"  and you'll find all you need to know about this issue.  You can find many places that can fix this for $50 - $75, plus shipping.  Just expect to have to do this, and build that into your total cost if you buy one of these.ALSO - these machines are now far too slow to play YouTube videos (or most on-line video of any kind).  Just be aware of that, if that is important to you.  When I bought it 2 years ago, it played YouTube fine, but YouTube and most on-line video continues to get more and more processor-intensive, so now a processor this slow cannot handle it.
