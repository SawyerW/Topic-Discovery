The 2013 Macbook Air updates the 2012 model with an upgrade to the new 4th generation Intel i5-4250u Haswell processor.  This processor is faster, much more efficient and offers a significant boost in graphics performance thanks to the HD 5000 integrated gpu.  While a faster i7 is available for a reasonable upgrade price, for most users there won't be much of a difference.  Coupled with the SSD, everything runs amazingly smooth and snappy.  Also, the i7 has the same HD 5000 gpu, so games won't see much benefit.  While this isn't a gaming computer, most modern games (not new FPS's) run well at low to medium settings at the screen's maximum 1440 x 900 resolution.  There are only 4gb of RAM, but that should be more than enough for the average person (you can upgrade to 8gb, but it is soldered on, so no post-market upgrading).This laptop is easy to fall in love with.  At around 3 lbs and 0.68" thick, it is extremely portable and comfortable.  Despite the lack of weight and thickness, it feels durable and does not flex easily.  The aluminum body is sleek and luxurious.  The screen is only 1440 x 900, but it looks wonderful (unless it's put directly next to a retina macbook pro) and while it is glossy, reflections  are not a problem.  While I still prefer my mechanical keyboard and mouse on my desktop, the Macbook Air's keyboard and especially the trackpad are easily among the most responsive and comfortable of any laptop.  The wireless always keeps a strong signal from any room in the house and the battery life is exceptional at 10-12 hours.Overall, we have been extremely happy with our new 2013 Macbook Air.  I feel like most other laptops have at least one or two annoying issues (and that's not including the bloatware).  So far, we haven't had any disappointments with this laptop.
