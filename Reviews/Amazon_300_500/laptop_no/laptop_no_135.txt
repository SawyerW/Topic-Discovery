This computer is really great. I did a lot of research on it before I decided to buy it, and this one seemed to fit all the requirement I want. The delivery itself was wonderful, it arrived two days before it said it would, and it is a good looking laptop. There is a lot of ASUS branded software on the computer, many would call it bloatware, but I find it useful. The Intel Core i7 processor is so fast that it uses up a lot less of the memory than most other processors would. The display and functions are really easy, it is like one click to turn off the bluetooth or the wireless, and one click to turn it back on. One thing I must warn is with the Express Gate. I had a lot of confusion with it, but I read the manual THROUGHLY, don't just skim through it like I did several times, and I found out that Express Gate only turns on when the computer is OFF. So that is something useful to know. Also, be cautious if you use the ASUS CopyProtect. Do not lock the CD-DVD Drive or the External storage drives (USB port) or else they will not appear on the computer. I had that confusion as well. The only bad things I could say about this computer may only be with my computer, but the computer display acted a little strange at first. When I first used it, I opened up the computer window and it said this computer had two hard drives. But when I had to restore the computer to it's factory condition (had nothing to do with the computer, it was all my fault) it was back to normal, saying it only had one. I still don't know what it meant, maybe it was just my computer. but I wouldn't consider that a deal breaker. Oh, and also, this computer runs HOT.I read that ASUS computers do, so I would get a good cooling pad with a fan or two, because it will help cool it down.....a bit. I have a two fan laptop cooling pad, and the vent STILL blows out hot air. But the bottom of the laptop is cool, it is strange.
