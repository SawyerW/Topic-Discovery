I did a lot of searching for a laptop and this is what I chose. For price, features and performance, this is a good deal.  I found this at a local office store on sale for $650 after a $50 mail in rebate.Pro's:*"N" wireless -awesome speed!  I am registering 150 mbps vs. 50mbps on my old "G"*14" screen*i5 processor*4 gb memory*320 hdd*hd output*built in, removable remote control for the dvd player.windows 7 - it is amazingly stable.  Not a single crash since I bought this laptop 6 weeks ago!*volume control uses a cool touch sensitive slide*mute and antenna buttons are also cool and touch sensitive*great plaid dark brown, almost black look*removable cd/dvd drive reduces the weight of the computer.  Also, may allow for easy blue ray upgrade?Con's:*battery life is fair at best.  Maybe 2 hours with a full charge.*unit is a little thicker than some of the more cooler looking thin laptops.*Cooling vent is on the bottom. This deserves some explanation.  First, I looked at this feature before buying and in my opinion, the new laptops with the newer "i" processors seem to run cooler than older models.  Also, there is a vent on the top of the computer directly above the bottom vent, to the left where the base and screen are hinged.  You can only see the top vent when the unit is open.  It seems that when the laptop is on a pillow for example and blocking the bottom vent, the top vent takes over releasing the heat but not quite as well as the bottom when not blocked.  At least it seems that way to me.*the unit does run a bit warm when using on a pillow and I am careful to monitor the temperature since my last computer dies this way.*hp should have put the vents on the side!My brother bought a Dell just 2 months before I bought this and he got a pre-i5 processor and g wireless.  In comparison, the hp is much better in performance and price.Highly recommended.
