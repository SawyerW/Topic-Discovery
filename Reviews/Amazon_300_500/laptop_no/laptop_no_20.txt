Wow,I recently just brought this small lab top and I'm so glad I did. Other then it being little this thing is powerful. I was searching for something affordable for about 2 years in a row and never found nothing that was worth trying but when I ran across this Dell Latitude for only 120 bucks I couldn't resist.I was so nervous the day I received this big ol box by Ups . My husband just looked in shock because I always chance things and they always end up bad lol , but when I did open it and saw how clean it was with not one mark on it we both started getting excited. I then turned to him and kindly said "we'll now that you seen mines , you better order yourself one because this one is only for my use"! (I know mean right , but you have to understand why I said it)So going on , I  had to order 2 more the same day.I must say my whole family loves this computer. Especially my son, At night I hear him in his bed room playing music and I have to go in and tell him to turn it down(another plus it can get very loud). One night I even had to take it away from him because I knew If I didn't he would've failed his test the next day. Honestly guys/girls this is really a good purchase. If I had to say anything on a neggitive side this would be my only complaint, NO WEB CAM! That's pretty messed up but I can always go and buy one for 50 bucks . That's a small problem to a giant. I hope that if you're wanting something Cheap but Good, you will take my advice and choose this. Trust me you will be happy you did I sure am!!!
