Just had to stop by and tell Apple how grateful I am for their effort to put out a product far superior to  all others.  It shows Apple!Would have given you 5 stars........but:Your rubber pads under the machine are not "grippy" enough.  I want my machine to stick to the table.Your aluminum body slides around so much that my precious MBP could fall from my grip.Your keys on the MBP have just a bit of tinny feeling to them.  Your separately sold keyboards (the white ones) have a better feeling to them.ALL AND ALL...........I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY MACBOOK!  WOW!  THANKS APPLE! I love this thing.UPDATE:  It is now July 2011 and I wanted to say that I am still crazy for this computer.  I use it everyday of my life.  I could go on and on and on about how cool this thing is but there is no need to.  I shopped for a laptop for months before getting this thing.  I bought and returned several PC laptops before finally settling on this.  I am glad I did.  The others are not close to these MacBook Pros.If you are a consumer who is contemplating a laptop purchase.......just buy the Apple even if you cannot afford it.  Worst case might be that Apple may finance it for you.  Just buy the Apple and get it over with.  If you don't you know you will regret it.  If you do I know you won't regret it.UPDATE:  January 2012: Revisited this to say that another major reason i bought the MacBook as opposed to another brand of laptop is the inclusion of Garage Band.  From all the pro music people I talked with Garage Band is the best and within an Apple machine is where it is........included in the purchase price!  What more could I want?  I play my keyboard every day and have already recorded a few licks.  It's a whole lotta fun!One other thing:  A few months ago I began thinking that I might have been happier with either the 15" or 17"....over this MacBook Pro 13".  I still love it though.
