I loved my M1210 and used it for 18 months but recently got an M1330 and I like it even better, except for a few things.I did like the 12-inch size and weight of the former, but the 1330 is brighter and the keyboard is a little larger, making for improved useability.BTW, the specs are almost equal: 2.2 GHz processor and 2 Gb. RAM;  with NVidia video card.So the speed is pretty much equal also.I put 4 Gb RAM into both, and the performance difference is negligible.  Don't waste your money:  2 Gb is plenty.The 9-cell battery of the 1330 is bulky and ugly, compared to the 9-cell of the M1210.by the way, about batteries:  that 9-cell from my M1210 is just about shot, even though the laptop was hardly ever run from only this battery.  When using the 1210 mobile, I used the 6-cell almost exclusively;  only using the 9-cell when the laptop was running on AC power.  Why would that wear out a battery?The 6-cell from the M1210 is still fine, having been used about 5 hours a week for 18 months.I liked the rotating camera of the 1210; the 1330 camera is fixed.The 1330 has better heat dissipation: there's a copper tubing setup that winds its way around heat-producing sources and wicks it over to the fan area;  new in this latest design.I hate the multi-media touch controls of the 1330 as compared to regular buttons (cooly lit-up blue) that you push & click to use, on the 1210.I don't like the fact that screen on the 1330 doesn't tilt back further than about 120 degrees,  as opposed to the 1210 tilting back all the way, flat to 180 degrees.the 1330 has HDMI port which the 1210 didn't,  but it only has 2 USB ports compared to the 1210's four.The HDD of the 1330 is more difficult to get at and swap out than the HDD of the 1210.The 1330 could have been made even a bit smaller, because there's a wide wasted-space frame bordering the screen,  but that would have meant making the keyboard the same size as the 1210.  Fine with me, but maybe users with big fat hands complained about not enough keyboard room.Overall a nice laptop.  I especially appreciate the MedeaDirect setup that both of these laptops have: a very nice & useful touch.This is my sixth Dell laptop and because of their excellent warranty service and great customer care support (especially XPS support)  I can't see myself buying anything else.
