This was purchased for my mother who very nervous about learning Windows 8 it turned out to be easier for her to use than her existing Windows 7 desktop.When we first got the system I upgraded it to Win 8.1 immediately.  Once this was done and the rest of Windows updates we were ready to give it a go.First the screen is very nice I was surprised by this as I thought it would be more in line with budget quality screens.  The colors are sharp and bright.  Mom was very easily able to read the screen and test while using her Kindle app was crisp and clear.The speed is very good especially after the Win 8.1 update.Some people have reported problems with the WiFi staying connected and at first we did too.  By turning off the power management setting for the WiFi adapter in the device manager it stopped happening.  Apparently the most current driver that Asus has out does not bring it out of sleep and make it reconnect properly even if the system was in use or asleep.Once I changed the setting no more problem.  Hopefully this will be addressed in a future driver update.  Because the is an easy work around I did not remove a star for this.Battery life on this is excellent she usually get in excess of 6+ hrs of constant use using the internet and working on documents.Adding a SSD in the future will make battery life go even higher and speed up an already quick system.It is very light weight which was very important to mom.The only real con is the touchpad.  It can be a bit finicky until you adjust in the settings to more closely match the way you use it.The shared left and right mouse bar can sometimes feel sloppy.Overall I would recommend this to people looking for a speedy, light weight, fast laptop with a good screen.Tip: definitely get the Windows 8.1 upgrade before doing much with it as it really enhances your windows experience.
