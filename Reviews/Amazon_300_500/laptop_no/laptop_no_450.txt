After 3 months and 10 days of using my Pc ,, some keys stopped working, I called the support, the brilliant guy told me i have to restore the computer because some keys may not be balanced, I told him this is a hardware problem and no need to restore,, anyway he insisted, I had no choice, I did restore it. The computer could not boot after restore at all, I called again another person said that I have to reset the computer to factory default or send it to them to reset it and I have to agree that I will lose data. I chose to do it myself and at least save my time, following his instructions the computer was back to its original factory default, and my keys are still not working, I could not connect to internet because some password items were among those non functioning keys. I called again they said I have to send it to them on my own expense but they will send it back to me on their expense, after one week of waiting they called me saying the computer is on hold for $199 because after opening it they found fluid residue and that is not covered under warranty. I refused to pay, I thought it is not worth it to pay $199 to fix a $340 computer.I would rather go for a new tablet. They send it 2 days later by FedEx in the exact same condition it was . End results I lost my data, I lost my time, I lost my money and I have a useless piece of electronics.Plus I don`t recall any fluid spells at all. Please think twice before dealing with this product. If there is no stars at all I would do that but I had to color that single hardly deserved star.
