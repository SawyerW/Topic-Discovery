I was almost going to pull the trigger and get an Apple MacBook Air 11.6 but my wife mentioned to me that a friend of her's told her about the "Google laptop for $249".  Well, I had to check it out.  Since I use many of the Google Services - Mail, docs, voice, etc, and I also have an unlimited dataplan on my 4G LTE phone which I can tether the device to, I decided to give it a try.  It works great for what I use it for.  It is not the speediest of machines but then again at $249 it is nearly a disposable computing device after 2 years of use, btw, I think I will get much more than 2 year.  Add in 12 passes for GoGo inflight internet coupons ($9 a piece) this thing was a bargain.  Simply turn it on when in flight and it verifies you are on a Chromebook and you are logged in with your Google account (email) and you are surfing at 30k feet.The battery does really seem to go the distance of 5hours and having no fan it is absolutely silent.  It doesn't get hot but just warm to the touch near the back of the notebook where I think the processor is located.  The keyboard is nice and very similar to the Macbook keyboards.  It's a bummer there isn't a backlight but at the price point it is understandable why there isn't one.One thing I am waiting for is a more mature upgrade/hack to run ubuntu ringtail.  Someone at Google already posted a version that is supposed to work.  It would make the device into a full blown laptop running the ARM Exynos Samsung processor.  It will be killer to have this as a really lightweight (literally) but powerful Linux laptop for $249.The only downside for this machine is that the surface scratches very easily.  Other than that, at $249, this thing has really exceeded my expectations.
