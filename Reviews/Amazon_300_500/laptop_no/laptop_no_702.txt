The MacBook Pro has many issues which is why I am rating it at 2 stars. There are much better laptops available. Be aware the price offered here at Amazon by third party dealers is not the cheapest available. Apple sells it for less than the current price shown. The strongest thing going for the system is it's operating system which gives a brief breath of fresh air from the coldness found in Windows. There is also a strong community of users who will help you out and a friendly customer service team.The main issues are a screen which is horrific. Apple can no longer be known for graphics. The maximum resolution found on the screen is less than other models sold by their competitors. This is how this system was designed. Investigate.The MacBook Pro screens have a defect affecting most of the production currently. The lower 1/3 of the screen will have a yellowish/golden hue. The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line. The tones from top to bottom are inconsistent. The screens background helps to mask the problem but you will see it if you ever do any work with the system.The viewing angle is very narrow. If your head leaves a 4 inch box the screen is almost unreadible and will be golden in color. This is due to the "LED" backlighting system. Investigate.If you are still intent on an Macbook look at the 17 inch model. You will notice the 17" is the most commonly reviewed model because the other ones will be horribly received. It does not use the LED backlighting and the maximum resolution is higher.The second main issue is something Mac users are referring to as "Kernel panic". It is the same thing as Microsoft's notorius "blue screen of death"except the cause is the hardware. Should your system have "kernel panic" you will have a locked up, unusable system. The work will have gone unsaved and you will be out of the notebook for 3 weeks as they repair the brand new system. Investigate this further.Yes, stick a fork in it. This model is a turkey.
