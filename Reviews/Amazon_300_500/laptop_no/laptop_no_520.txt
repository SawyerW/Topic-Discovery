Pros:-Zero chassis flex-Keyboard is solid (no flex)-IPS panel touchscreen-Decent CPU-4GB of Ram-Backlit keyboardCons:-Keyboard keys are a little small due to chiclet design on an 11.6" laptop-Battery life is mediocre- my last Acer in this price category had an 8 hour battery life-Mouse pad requires a strong tap to register a "click"-Screen is not as bright as it could be-No extended battery or dock available yetOther:-HDD is large but slow (like most laptops)- I switched it out for a 180GB SSD-Windows 8 is frustrating and unintuitive-Need dongles/adapters for VGA/DVI/HDMI outOverall I like this little laptop. My last Acer (Acer One) beat the pants off of it in battery life, but I knew that when I bought it. Windows 8 hasn't won me over yet either and the touchscreen is nice, but I rarely find myself wanting or needing to utilize it. Really want the extended battery and dock that was promised to be released, but it doesn't look like Acer is in any hurry. Overall this little laptop is great for what I use it for- a content viewer. For content creation I use a triple screen desktop setup with Windows 7. Adding ReviverSoft's Start Menu Reviver definitely helps adjust to Windows 8 and makes it more usable, but I'm still partial to 7. Great little portable though- after the One and the V5 I don't think I could ever go back to a 15"+ laptop (previous to the Acer One I had an Alienware m7700 17" DTR). The SSD and a $5 HDMI out dongle were the only additions I made.Pretty happy with this laptop and the build quality and chassis rigidity is spectacular- much better than the Acer One. The keyboard is better as well- but the keys are a bit smaller, so it takes some getting used to. Great price here on Amazon as the BestBuy model doesn't have the backlit keyboard.I definitely recommended!
