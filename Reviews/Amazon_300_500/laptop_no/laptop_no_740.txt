Ok I'm not going to repeat what everyone else is saying. this is a 5 star laptop in terms of value and performance.What I want to point out is that with 10-12 hours of battery life and a $629 price tag this might make (I haven't tried it out myself but would like to) an excellent skype laptop for those who have or need mobile broadband. Couple it with mobile broad band and bluetooth headphones/headset(with micro bluetooth adapter) and you might find a good way to save money on you cell phone bills (if mobile broadband is important/necessary to you).mobile broadband = $60/monthskype online number = $60/year (=$5/month)micro bluetooth adapter = $16+mifi battery extender (to extend the battery of your mifi modem) = $50-(minus)current cell phone bill($30 -$99/month)the drawbacks are that you'll have to carry your laptop in a bag or something everywhere you go (which I do anyway...) and if you need it for longer than 10 hours you would have to plug it in sometime or you'd be in trouble. You'd also have to learn how to handle the 5gb upload limit on mobile broadband which is pretty reasonable once you learn how to do it. Just don't play mmo's or use torrents and don't use youtube sparingly unless your in a hotspot and you should be well under the 5gb limit.Furthermore you should check out DUO touch which can turn you laptop into a tablet pc. it's actually only awkward looking but in someways better (definitely cheaper) than buying an actual tablet pc. you can turn you laptop upside down so that the screen is where your keybaord should be and manually invert the screen in control panel. Excellent for a thin and light like this. DUO = $120.I'll try these things and if they work well I'll update this review.
