I bought this computer in 2011 and have had nothing but trouble with it.  Almost every piece of it has been replaced at least once.  I have had three keyboards, and I still have trouble with typing.  I have had to reformat the hard drive three times, because Dell techs couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I decided recently that I wanted to upgrade the hard drive from 500gb to 750gb, and I thought I would be getting a faster hard drive.  Dell gave me the specs on one made by Samsung that they said would fit.  I ordered it from Amazon, and it didn't fit into the laptop.  So I ordered one from Dell and was told it would be delivered on June 5.  It wasn't.  The email they sent said to check for a tracking number, so I tried that and couldn't retrieve one.  I called Dell and got two different answers:  one, it must be in stock or we wouldn't have sold it to you; two, it isn't in stock, and we don't know if or when it will be, but we will find out.  Today I get a third answer; it isn't in stock, but the expected delivery date is June 12; since it isn't in stock we don't know when it will ship, but you have to wait until June 12.  One suggestion a customer service rep offered today is to buy a hard drive from Walmart or Staples who he assured me would know which brand and model would fit this computer.  I don't trust either place to have the right answer.  One option is to just buy a new computer, but this one was too expensive to discard after little more than two years.  Besides the OS is Windows 7, and I've read too many negative things about Windows 8 to even try it.
