We get a laptop with school. Our selection is the 15 inch Mackbook Pro. Its the latest and greatest version. Overall it isnt bad, its just a laptop that happens to run Max OSX. I was never a really big fan of Macs mainly due to they charge more then what it would cost to build it better as a IBM Compatible. So lets get down to the nitty gritty.Pros, figure it like any other laptop other then it runs apples OSX. Which mind you is not your only option, you can dual boot to windows if you want, which I do. Excellent picture quality. Its slim and light weight.The Cons, I can be really picky here but will just put in the majors. Battery life is not even in the same zip code as they claim it should be misrepresentation for an out right lie on Apples part. It gets hot and I mean really hot if you run it with any kind of a workload. So you will need a laptop cooler that blows directly on the bottom of the case. You also get hit with Apples proprietary hardware ripoffs. Anything and I mean ANYTHING you want to do will require an apple product and it will cost you an arm and a leg. DO NOT buy from any apple to mac specialty store. Amazon sells it for about a fifth of what they want. I run my laptop through my widescreen monitor, apple wants 30 bucks for the adapter I got it off amazon for 6 bucks.I could REALLY pick it apart but will go gentle on it it is reliable and does good for 3d work. But if given a choice I would have picked an IBM compatible over a mac without even thinking about it.Wish I could give it half a star would be two and a half, I am not impressed for the insanely over price they are asking. Pick an windows laptop for one third the price and do the same job. I just didnt get a choice with it being the schools laptop of choice. So save your money and buy three Dell Laptops for what this cost you.
