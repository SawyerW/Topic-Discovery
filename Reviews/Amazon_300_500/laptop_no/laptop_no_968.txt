This little computer is what I've wanted in a PC for years: fast, fanless, quiet, and compact.  It's all those things, and it's even better made than most Windows laptops that are twice the price.  Chrome OS might not be for everyone, but it has major advantages (simplicity, automatic upgrades, security) and looks nice, too.  I had initially been concerned that I would have trouble not being able to access Adobe or MS software, but the Chrome apps cover 90% of what I need to do, and for the other 10%, I can use Chrome Remote Desktop to connect to my PC and can run the software through the browser---it works amazingly well.The computer is almost perfect and for $250 ($330 for 3G) I am extremely satisfied.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them:PROS- Completely quiet: no fans- Ventless and therefore versatile: you can use the computer anywhere, even in bed, without worrying about the computer's ventilation/overheating- Fast: it boots up amazingly quickly, and I have a hard time seeing any performance difference between this and Chrome on my desktop PC.- Nice UI: clean and simple, with lots of very useful and quick keyboard shortcuts- Matte screen: no annoying reflections on the screen, and you can use it in bright rooms with no trouble- Great keyboard and Mac-like trackpad: these really feel like they belong to a much more expensive computer- Very good battery life: minimum of 6.5 hours, up to 8-9 with low screen brightness- The 3G connection is good, connects quickly and seamlessly when WiFi is not available; connection is surprisingly fast for 3GCONS- Can't run some software (but Chrome Remote Desktop can solve this problem if you have a PC or server running the software)- Palmrest is a little too short for my large hands, which forces me to type with more "curl" than I'm used to to avoid having my palm rest on the edge somewhat uncomfortably.  This could be an issue for "flat" typists, too.This is a superb value of a computer, and it's fun to be using an always-improving computer that's on what might be a new frontier of simpler computing in the cloud.
