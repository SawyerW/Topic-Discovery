This laptop is powerful enough to run Star Wars:  The Old Republic at a playable framerate, so its gaming capabilities are not too shabby.  Make sure you're running the latest drivers available for it before stroking out about non-functional devices.  In particular, the HDMI out can be finicky until you realize that it needs a Realtek driver specifically for HDMI audio out AND the ATI driver for the video.Major issues:The lid/screen:  I recommend getting a piece of felt or sliding the bag the laptop comes in over just the lid area to protect the screen from the keyboard when its closed.  If you don't, you WILL get scratches on the acrylic cover over the screen.  This is a design compromise Dell took, and a bad one if you ask me.Power adapter:  If you look around for reviews of this laptop, there are a lot of unhappy folks about the way it throttles the system back, often making games and media unplayable/unwatchable.  This is 100% due to the inclusion of a 90W power adapter as shipped.  The first thing you should do is find the Dell replacement 130W adapter for this machine, (or hammer Dell support to send you one, politely mentioning "throttling"). This will prevent most if not all of the CPU slowdown issues.  There are other solutions, just keyword Dell XPS 1640 throttling and you'll find them.Heat:  It runs pretty warm.  This is due to the CPU/GPU sharing a heatsink and fan. Simple solution:  Get a laptop cooling pad.  Really, isn't your shiny new computer worth less than 50 bucks to keep the hardware cool?  Of course it is.Fingerprint NUCLEAR ELECTROMAGNET:  Yeah, it develops fingerprints insanely quickly.  Be prepared to wipe it down A LOT.Unless you just have to have the Dell Dock, get rid of it as soon as possible as it really slows down the system after login.All in all, it's a really nice laptop that's really pleasing aesthetically with very good performance.
