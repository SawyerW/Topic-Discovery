I spent about $1,000 on my laptop several years ago. This laptop was $300.00 and several times better than what I was using before.I think it got a lot of negative comments, not because of the machine, but because of Windows 8. The first thing that I did was uninstall all of the software that I didn't need. There's a bunch of stuff from ASUS that is preloaded. I also opted out of a lot of Windows 8 tracking stuff. You need to go through custom installation and opt out when you first get your machine.One thing that is really annoying is the combination headphone / microphone jack. You can only use one device at a time. I tried splitting it with a 3.5mm splitter, EVERYTHING. I cannot get a microphone and a speaker to work simultaneously. However, I think if you get a microphone to USB adapter, you could probably get multiple devices to work at the same time. So, THAT has been very annoying.If you play some heavy duty games, the performance might not be great, but casual games are fine. What I REALLY don't like is that I can't read my kindle books on it because they aren't all available for Windows 8.1. I really hope this will be fixed.But if you're just doing normal Windows stuff and projects for school, working from home, etc. You shouldn't have any huge problems once you're set up.That being said. This is a deal! But you're have a few inconveniences for that deal.Also, registering for the warranty through Asus was a nightmare! Finding the serial code is a pain. You have to enter a bunch of information and then your computer doesn't connect to their server for some reason, so go STRAIGHT to their website, and do it there, because the autoplay wizard when you start your machine doesn't work at all.I could see why it is 3 on average, but I give it a 4 now that I've had it for a few months. The hardest part was getting used to Windows 8.
