I'm a software engineer and professional Linux user. I was a little nervous about buying this machine, because I have had bad luck in the past with hardware compatibility on very lightweight machines. There was no need to worry, practically everything works perfectly (see notes at the end of the review).** Fit and Finish **It looks nice. Actual metal would have been nicer, but it's close enough. The keyboard feels a little sloppy, and you'll notice odd clicking sounds in the keys from time to time. This is most of where the lost one star is. I wasn't expecting much from a chiclet board on a computer this thin, but I know that it could have been done better.** Battery Life **With low display brightness, but performing regular tasks, I was able to get about the advertised five hours of battery life. On Windows, I would expect about an hour less.** Graphics **The CPU and onboard graphics are very powerful, especially given the size of the computer. I was able to run Counter-Strike: Source with 60-200 FPS on the recommended settings. For a machine I don't expect to do any gaming on, that's impressive. Naturally, this allows for smooth video playback. Display resolution being 1366x768 on the 11" LCD, the pixel density is good. The viewing angle of the LCD is poorer than I was expecting, and may impact your ability to use the computer when it's not directly in front of you.** Audio **The speakers are absolutely awful. With how thin the computer is, this is not a surprise. You will need headphones if you want to actually listen to something.** Overall **It's a solid machine. Great value for the price, extremely portable and powerful. I would recommend this to anyone.Technical Notes: Tested Crunchbang Waldorf, with a Debian Jessie (Linux 3.10) base. I needed to modprobe a couple of modules in order to get the wireless card working correctly (see instructions at the bottom of the page here: [...] The touchpad may need a special input configuration file for xorg in order to enable right clicking/click and drag.
