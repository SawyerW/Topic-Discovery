I chose this machine for features for the price.  Nice IPS screen, backlit KB, decent build.  Even with the A6 AMD this thing is horribly slow.  Its torture to use it. It can't even open web pages worth a crap.  The processor just is clocked too slow at 1 ghz and maybe turbos up just a tad over but believe me, the APU is a major bottleneck for performance and you can't fix that.  SSD may help a bit but its not worth the price to upgrade to SSD with little gain in performance.  It shortly had a display failure and I sent it to ACER for replacement.  Note, ACER makes the customer pay for shipping.  Even if you pay 1700 dollars for their S7 and it DOA brand new, you pay for shipping.  After I got it back, the display worked, but the extended battery I bought will not charge now.  So obviously, they damaged the main board when replacing my display.  But they would not fix it.  They said call Acer and get new battery.  Acer accessories says they don't have the battery anymore and don't know if and when they will get them.  Even though I know the battery is still good.  I just needed another battery to prove to repair center that its not the battery but the device itself that won't charge the battery.  Anyway, don't listen to other reviews saying the A6 is good enough.  This machine is slow, I mean really slow.  Save yourself a ton of grief and pay a little more and get something with an Intel ulv or mobile processor.  This is one of AMD's worse APU's. Even my old HP DM1 with the AMD E-350 performed much better then the A6.  Again, this is a 1 ghz processor.  That's all you need to know.  And Acer support is one of the worst.  Its not worth it.
