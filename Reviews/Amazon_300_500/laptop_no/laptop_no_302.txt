I got mine at an big name office supply chain, it was only a few days before it started freezing and becoming unresponsive. I read the windows system logs, it had 100's of entries for drive/controller communication failure. It appeared the hard drive was defective. If a drive is going to fail, it will usually do it right away. I was thinking no big deal, Ill send it back in and get it replaced. Thats where Samsungs terrible support came in.I tried to get support from Samsung, they gave me live chat, they said I just needed to reinstall Windows with a system restore to solve my hard drive issue. I went ahead and did a system restore and of course it did not solve the problem and in fact it froze while trying to install Windows. I emailed them back, said I did a system restore as told by your support in a chat session and it did not solve the problem, can I get an RMA # to have it serviced ? The emailed back and said first do a system restore on the laptop that should correct the problem, showing they do not even fully read the emails.It took several more email and chat sessions when they told me to goto a web page and file a warranty claim. I went to the site, filled out all the info and hit send, it sat there for 45 minutes saying submitting and never got anywhere. I tried it again the next day, again the page hung and just said submitting for an hour. After a few more times I gave up, ordered my own drive from newegg and problem solved. Overall I spent about a week trying to get samsung to fix their laptop before I gave up, they must hope that's what happens.The battery also is much shorter than they claim, I think it said 5.2 hours, after 3 months of only being used 1 or 2 times a week it's only lasting around 3 hours now.Other than those issues, it's fairly fast, keyboard seems well built and less likely to loose keys than other keyboards Ive had.
