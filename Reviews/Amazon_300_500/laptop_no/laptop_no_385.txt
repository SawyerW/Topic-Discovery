The computer randomly turns itself off when I'm in the middle of doing something. This may happen 2-3 times in a row, and each time it takes at least 30-45 seconds for the computer to turn back on. I just get a black screen with a mouse cursor button and unable to get any response by pressing any buttons, including the power button. Just have to sit there and wait for the computer to come back from the ether...Second issue is the keyboard - although the thinness is pretty incredible and great for portability, this is the LEAST ergonomically designed computer I've ever used! After less than a minute of typing on this super flat keyboard, my wrists are KILLING me and I'm young! It physically hurts to keep my hands on the keyboard - the chassis is far too thin - the distance between the edge of the computer to the start of the keyboard is literally 1.5x longer than any other laptop - so almost half my forearm rests on the computer in order to type. I should only have to put my wrists and hands on the computer to type. I end up using my horrible, clunky Lenovo work computer to do any serious typing or even gchatting with friends because it's just not worth it physically to me to do anything but browse the net or watch videos on this thing. The pain is too much.Finally, the newly designed power adaptor SUCKS. You so much as look at the thing, and it falls out. You cannot use the laptop in your lap while it's plugged in because the power cord falls out of the side of the thing. It's seriously the worst design I've ever seen. I guess Apple doesn't think you should use laptops in your lap unless they're fully charged. The only redeeming quality is the batter life is long enough where I can afford to use it unplugged in my lap for a few hours. Even when it's sitting on my desk, if i move the laptop even slightly, the power cord falls out.
