I purchased a Macbook Pro 5 months ago (June 2011) and have it updated immediately to OSx Lion after it's release last July.Last November 7, I opted to have my Mac 5 software updates in the office since the internet connection at home is painfully slow.Earlier before the update, I was using it as normal and no sign of saying goodbye to me.As usual, I plugged my Mac though it still about 20% battery full. I left it for more than 30 minutes and I was shocked to see a non-stop static screen when I came back.I waited for a few minutes for it to stop but it won't so I press the power button until it shut down.It won't boot up after an attempt but the lid on the front that indicates sleep mode is still there and my Mac is heating up so bad.This is the first time that my Mac has heaten up this bad!Boot it up after a few minutes and dismayed that it won't boot up again.The apple icon was loading during startup but it will eventually lead to a black screen with yellow line on the right side.It is frustrating! It is only just 5 months old and I love my Mac so much that I am very much careful not to overcharged it or anything.I have it checked on a PowerMac center and was told that they will have the parts replaced for free whatever the defective part is and was instructed to follow up after a week. 2.5 weeks later I was informed that they have requested the parts to Apple already for replacement as part of the 1 year limited warranty of Apple. Now, after 3 weeks, I am still waiting of when my Macbook Pro will be back. I am very disappointed that this has happen in only 5 months time.Barely a month after I sent it to the PowerMac service center, my Macbook has been fixed and was told that the whole logic board has been replaced. When asked what was the possible reason for the circuit deficiency, they did not gave an exact answer since the technician did not tell what has been the problem. I ask the Solutions team and the closest answer I got was due to the firmware update that was not installed properly.
