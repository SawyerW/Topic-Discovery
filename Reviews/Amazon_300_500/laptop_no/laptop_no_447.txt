I've owned this laptop for at least 6 months now... I think it might even be closer to a year.Pros:It's fast, real fast.Lighted keyboard is handyIt's like having a macbook pro at 1/4 the price... especially now since the price has dropped.  I still feel like this laptop is worth more than they're currently selling for.I went ahead and bought a 256gb samsung SSD and a CD slide drive converter for the cd bay and installed that SSD with the 1TB drive where the CD drive used to be (I don't really need a CD/DVD drive).  and let me tell ya, this laptop is super fast.  It boots right into windows now in around 10 sec.  Installing the SSD wasn't too hard either, if your tech savy enough you'll be fine and there was a decent youtube video on it.Cons:The trackpad is the most annoying thing about this latop... I appreciate the multifinger gesture support but it's huge and often resting my hands to type I end up hitting the thing.  I just use a wireless mouse anyway and you can disable it with a fn button command in like 2 seconds so no big deal.The microphone was placed in the worst spot imaginable... It must be next to the cooling fan so when that thing kicks on your friends will hate you.  Also, if you rest your left arm for using the keyboard it covers it up!  I mean.. really?  Way to think that one though samsung.Anyway, I'd much rather take those two cons over spending 1000$ bucks to get a MBP.  My buddy has a mac with similar stats he spent much more money on and our two computers perform nearly the same in game, photoshop, etc.I'd buy it again no problem.  The SSD really helps make this thing even more beastly, I recommend getting one put in if your going to buy.
