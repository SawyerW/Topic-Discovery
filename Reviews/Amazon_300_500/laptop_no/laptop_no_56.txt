I can't say enough about how much I love my Macbook.  It is a beautiful piece of engineering.  The laptop itself is incredibly solid, there are almost no moving parts on the case, and it has no squeaking, give, or any other little annoyances that exist on other laptops (like weak-points in the case, seams that are coming apart, etc). The unibody construction is simple amazing.  This *will* sound ridiculous, but even closing the lid is more satisfying than with other laptops.  Finally, I am in love with the trackpad.  It is incredible.  I used to be unable to control a computer with a trackpad and I carried around a mouse with me everywhere.  The trackpad on this macbook, though, has eliminated my need for a mouse.  I don't know if it the gigantic size, the mouse button integrated into the pad, or all the awesome multi-touch gestures, but the combination of all of that has eliminated my need for an external mouse with this laptop.As far as the hardware inside goes, the computer is very fast, the graphics are great, and it has a nice big hard drive.  The screen itself is lower quality than the Macbook Pro's, but this just means that it has narrower viewing angles.  When viewed from straight on by a normal person (meaning not a professional artist or graphic designer) it looks just as good as the Pro's screen.The software is great.  It's a Mac.  There's not much more to say.  Just switch now and leave behind the frustration of computers that don't wake up from sleep when you open them, "driver incompatibilities", having to choose between 32 and 64 bit versions of your OS, etc.  I used to be a PC fanatic that thought Mac people were crazy, and now I'm a full-fledged Mac prosthelytizer.  Go figure.
