The backlight went out on the LCD screen 3-4 months into owning this computer.  I sent it back to Samsung for repair since of course it was still under warranty.  About 2 weeks later, I get an email that says that there was a bit of liquid damage somewhere on the computer and my warranty is completely voided.  Of course, they did not mention whether or not the liquid damage caused the backlight to go out.  They want me to pay for repairs which I am totally OK with but they will not tell me what repairs will cost.  They want to charge me $50 in order to give me a repair quote and if I decide to not repair, I lose the $50.  This is unacceptable.  As we all know, parts cost way more when doing repair.  I have no idea what the price will come out to with repairs but it could easily be more than the $250 chromebook.  I refuse to pay this money and they refuse to tell me what it will cost to fix.  After countless phone calls with the third party repair company that Samsung uses and Samsung themselves, Samsung is unwilling to waive this fee at all.  I made it all the way up the chain at Samsung Customer Service and they are unwilling to move.  All I want to know is what it will cost to repair, that's it.  They just apologize and say it is not their policy.  But yet, they are the ones who partnered with this third party company.I refuse to purchase another Samsung product ever again.  Their customer service is crappy and they have no sense of customer loyalty.  I have had Dell out to my house (to my house!) twice to repair their computers.  If I have an issue with any apple product, I just bring it back to the genius bar and even with liquid damage and a void warranty, they will at least tell me what it will cost to fix.  Samsung won't even tell me what it will cost.  Horrible horrible customer service. Do not buy this product.
