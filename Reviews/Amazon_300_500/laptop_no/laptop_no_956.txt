My background: I am in my final year of college and have used a unibody 15" MacBook Pro for the past 4 years. I am a bit of a tech geek and like exploring the different options out there, but certainly LOVED the premium feel and use of my MacBook Pro, however, it is no longer turning on anymore - so here I am at school without a computer.I have been using Google's 'Web Apps' for a while and I find docs/spreadsheets to do 99% of what I need. Otherwise I spend most of my time browsing, doing e-mail etc. The one thing I do use is Photoshop, which needs a more powerful machine than a small portable laptop anyway. Since I'm on a tight budget, and can't justify a MacBook Air (which really is not sufficient for much more than browsing anyway) I decided to spring for the Chromebook and get a desktop to use later on.I am very happy with my purchase, and find my experience to be similar to that of the reviews I have read. The hardware (specifically the excellent keyboard) are really 70-80% of the MacBook experience, with the track pad working very well and the keyboard being equally as good for my uses. This computer is excellent and does not disappoint at all - even when compared to the MacBook family. It is true that the screen is not as nice, but it is very usable, especially when considering the main uses of this computer (browsing, typing, reading articles).I have no problem with many tabs open and find pages to load completely satisfactorily. They do not load as smoothly as a brand new MacBook Pro - but I do not expect them to. I have not experimented with any video other than casual YouTube watching which has gone smoothly.I very rarely write reviews, but am so impressed with the value of this machine that I felt compelled to add to all of the great things people are saying.
