This is my first Macbook. I'm an IT person so I use a laptop every day for work. I usually get a new Windows laptop every 18 months. So most of my review will come from that experience.I bought the 13 inch version of this MBA with 4GB memory and the 128GB SSD for personal use. I travel a lot for work so I wanted something small so I could take both my personal and work laptop on business trips. Others in my family have the Macbook Pro. I went with the Air mainly for the portability, thin size, and weight of the Air. But the long battery life is what really sold me in the end. As far as choosing between the Air and Pro:- Everything is wireless now so I didn't need the physical network connection.- I bought a USB 3.0 hub to get additional USB ports.- I also go an external HDD for backups and movies, plus I got an external DVD writer.The SSD disk drive is really nice. New programs install in a matter of seconds. I have found everything quick and snappy, in general. Much better than my Windows 7 Lenovo.Other than the excellent battery, I think my most favorite thing is how cool this thing runs. My work Lenovo runs hot and I need a laptop pad to keep from sweating. Even with the pad, that thing still gets me hot when sitting with my feet up and the laptop in the lap. This new Air is hardly even warm. I always use it without the pad and have no issues. It really is a night and day difference.This is just a nice and sleek machine all the way around. I'm happy with everything. Performance, look, and feel. The only single thing I wish was better on this machine is the screen resolution. My other laptop has this one beat in that area.
