Well, I wish I could've given this more stars but...I actually returned it after owning it for only two days!  The first day, right out of the box, I kept seeing an "ASUS Live Update" alert and after pressing the OK button, the laptop proceeded to supposedly update and then reboot.  I knew there was an issue when the same drivers kept updating over and over.  I called technical support on day one and was told to "reset" the laptop.  Unfortunately that did not solve the problem.  I called technical support on day two and was told to send it back because the problem could not be solved and something must be wrong with the laptop.  I sent it back and ended up ordering an HP Pavilion g6-2260us.  That laptop has worked great so far but I just got it yesterday so maybe it's too early to say.Just a few other nitpicky things...(1) I didn't like the fact that the ASUS keyboard had no CAPS LOCK light.  (2) I think it's kind of annoying that ASUS feels compelled to place a large non-removable sticker right next to the touchpad with an "advertisement" of all the companies and features of the laptop.  I guess it wouldn't be so bad if it was on there while on display at your local electronics store but once you get it home, is it really necessary?  I know...nitpicky but it was very noticeable that the HP Pavilion did not have that obnoxious sticker!  (3) Last but not least...it was difficult to unscrew and remove the bottom plate to add more RAM.  I found it extremely easy to do on the HP Pavilion.Even thought this ASUS came with an i5 processor, I'm finding the HP Pavilion with a third generation i3 processor to be even faster than the ASUS.As always, Amazon was great about the return...that's the reason I bought a laptop from them in the first place!  Thank you, Amazon.
