Pros:* Fast, high-performance processor* Multi-touch pad* Good, loud speakers (4x)* Full keyboard, easy to type* Large screen, great for editing/watching videos* HDMI, USB 3.0, Multi-card readerCons:* Mine came with a dead pixel; eventually went away* Large and heavy, but still somewhat portable* Battery life is dismal -- not even 2 hours* No dedicated "home" and "end" keys* Windows key positioned on the right (takes getting used to)Description:This is a superb sub $1,500 laptop.  The video card (Nvidia GTX 660, 2GB) is better than the one in the 15" Macbook Pro w/Retina (Nvidia GT 650, 1GB) -- shame on you Apple -- and the processor is also amazing.  The screen is also nice, but as other have pointed out, it's nothing special.  Mine came with a dead pixel, which I was pretty upset about, but it eventually went away with the use of free software.I am able to edit videos without  any problem using Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5 and editing photos is also a breeze.  Using Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and other programs for creating and publishing content also works very well.  [UPDATE: I'm now using Adobe Creative Cloud and all apps work without any issues.] Frankly, this is a better buy over any Macbook.The design isn't something I was too excited about when looking at the pictures but in person it's actually not that bad.  I prefer the sleek look of the Macbook Pros, but the price tag and increased performance this laptop gives me is worth more than its looks.Upgradeability is an important factor in this laptop.  You can upgrade it from 8GB RAM to 16GB which I plan on doing, as well as adding a mSSD for caching purposes (for even faster performance) and, potentially, replacing the CD/DVD drive with a HDD bay. We'll see.Bottom line:Get this laptop if you want a large but powerful gaming/video editing laptop.  Not for people who want ultra portability and long battery life.
