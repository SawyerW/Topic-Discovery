It's lightweight and stylish, which go a long way for portable computers.  For someone looking for a notebook that is easy to travel with and is a very convenient use, this is one they should look into.  Sadly, style cannot cover over every blemish, and some of the laptops faults are issues one would need to really think out.For me, the biggest drawback to the computer is the battery usage.  The charge does NOT last very long.  Even when the computer is not in usage, the battery drains rather quickly.  In fact, after a full charge I put the computer up and got busy and didn't get to touch it for a few days.  When I turned it on it was completely dead and I had to recharge it again.  When using the computer it drains even faster, obviously.  Another issue I had here was the loading time.  The computer is very slow.  In this fast paced society, that is an issue and one that anyone using this for business may want to factor in.  I personally got this to use for work, but thankfully my job doesn't force me to be so quick all the time, thus the annoying wait time not being a giant issue for me.  I can live with it, even if I don't want to.That being said, the computer itself is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  There is a lot to offer here, and the many features are ones that I'm sure any tech savvy person is going to salivate over.  Some of it I haven't had the time to get to know better, and some of it I'm still trying to understand n concept, but there is enough to play with here to make the computer a fun experience.
