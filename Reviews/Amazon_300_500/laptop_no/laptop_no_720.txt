I bought one of these new in 2009, and am typing on it right now. I love this machine and am currently looking for another one for when this one does start to have problems. The thing with this model is that it was released with 2 major variants. the single core TF-20 1.6ghz and the dual core TK-42 1.6ghz. the single core one is crap stock, but you can buy the best processor for the socket for about $35 bucks now. these things were $450 or so new in 2009. be careful when looking for one. if your battery dies fast it is because it's worn out or it's used and someone screwed up the memory in it.  You can get new batteries and CPUs etc no problem. The motherboards and some of the other parts are starting to run out, and it's getting harder to find an actual new one of these now. If it doesn't come in it's box with clear plastic film covering the whole thing it is not new. If you can get a new one, upgrade the cpu, max out the ram, and throw an ssd in it, you will have a very decent laptop. The biggest bottleneck in this machine is the integrated graphics. the Radeon hd 3200 is not going to let you play new games, but the system is definately powerful enough for anything that is not too graphics intensive.  I like the asthetic appeal and overall design of the laptop. I have a sick gaming desktop and this does everything else. The bottom line though, even if you did get one new in box and spent another $150 bucks to max it out... that's like $600-$700. My newest phone is almost as powerful as this laptop, and $700 will buy something decent even if it's from the low end of a newer upgradable line with a decent parts pool. I'm only here because I have grown attachemd to mine lol. It's going to be sad when it dies, probably miss it more than my first dog. (knocked a star off because it is getting hard to find parts)
