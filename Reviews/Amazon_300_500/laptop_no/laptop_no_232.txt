I purchased the computer in January of this year.  The connection for the charger on the computer got lose by July and was unable to charge the battery.  We asked repair.  We needed to send the product to Asus, wait for the product to come back for 2 weeks.  When we received the computer back, we noticed that the original problem was repaired, but half of the keys on the keyboard do not work.  So, I called the Asus and waited for my turn for approximately 15 minutes on the phone.  When a human finally picked up the phone, I explained the situation, asked the possibility of in house repair or replacement.  The call taker took all information from me, including my phone number, serial number and so on.  Then the phone was disconnected.  Nobody called me back.  So I call them back.  Another person picked up the phone.  I asked if my information is already in their system.  The guy said no.  I asked if the original call taker would call me back.  The guy said Asus does not perform call back services.  He told me if this phone is disconnected, I have to call them and wait on the line of callers again!!  I asked the same questions to him, if they would replace my computer or send a repair man to my home.  He said they do not replacement and asked me the situation and all my information.  So I told the same information for the second time.  After that, he told me to send the computer in and it is the only way they cover manufacturing warranty.  If he told me the answer from the first, I would not have wasted the time on the phone!!!  Now, we will wait another 2 to 3 weeks for the repair.  Their product maybe OK for the money, but the customer service is definitely worst!!!!  I will never buy their product.
