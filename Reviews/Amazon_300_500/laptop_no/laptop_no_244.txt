I had a Dell Latitude D610 from college that just died a couple of months ago after 6 years. I spent two weeks researching different laptops and eventually settled for the HP G72-B66US 17.3" Laptop until I went to a local store and found out the last one was sold! The sales rep suggested this 2011 model, which has very similar specs and replaces the 2010 HP G72-B66US 17.3" Laptop. I was skeptical about making the purchase, especially since this was not part of my research.However, not only was it cheaper than the previous model, but it's also a huge improvement from the 2010 model. How so? The touch pad is not hard to use: the clicks are easy to push down, scrolling is easy with two fingers, and you can zoom in or out. I had always used a mouse b/c I'm not a huge touchpad fan, but this touchpad is great.  The exterior has a nice glossy finish vs. the 2010 model which looked like a cheap plastic exterior. Everything else seems to be just like the way the 2010 model is described.The only con is a relatively short battery life (2.5-3 hours), but compared to my old laptop where the battery lasted under an hour this is great!  The fan is on the side of the computer, so you don't have to worry about your lap burning or that you'll get cancer down there (lol).  This laptop is quiet and starts up easily and quickly.Considering how big this laptop is, 6 pounds feels like nothing. It's lighter than smaller models that are a few years older.  Speakers are average in quality, but can be turned up loud! And for laptops speakers, they are pretty good.  Overall, I'm very happy with this model and would recommend it to someone who likes movies, youtube, sports, photography, some gaming, music, recording software, business organization, etc.Feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to answer them.
