We've had this machine for a couple of weeks now and it's an excellent performer.  Excellent feature set for the money it's really hard to beat.  The ProBook line is oriented towards heavy daily use while still being reasonably priced.  Core i5-2410M processor, 500GB 7200 RPM drive, 4GB RAM, Win7 Pro 64 bit, Webcam, SD card reader, Gigabit LAN, wireless N.  Plus it's got a solid feel.  The display is nice and bright and very clear, but I wish it had more pixels.  1366 x 768 is really limiting so figure on plugging this into a larger monitor for extended home use.  A BluRay drive would have been nice too.It seems that all store bought machines are loaded with trial versions of a lot of different software.  It gets annoying until you get it all out of your way.  I guess that's how they get the cost down.  There was a Microsoft Office shortcut on the desktop.  I entered the serial number from my store bought Office package and it all just worked.  Never had to insert the disk.If you're in the market for a machine in the $650 - $750 range, I'd definitely recommend this one.  You're not out a whole bunch of money but it still feels as though it should hold up for 5 years or so.NOTE: I ordered this from one of the third party suppliers and they shipped me the i3 version poorly packed in a beat up box.  I returned it and ordered one from Amazon and got the correct one in a nice straight box.  Cost me $90 more but it was worth it.  Regardless of who you get it from, check it to be sure you got an i5.  I'm still waiting for my refund.UPDATE: Upgraded rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Yes I had a couple of minor gripes, but at this price point, it's a stellar deal.UPDATE II: Finally received the refund for the i3 machine I returned.  The merchant was Portable Guy and they were responsive to emails and courteous.  They took the time to explain what caused the shipping error.  I'd consider giving them another shot.
