This machine is great, provided you have realistic expectations for it.  The Samsung Chromebook is meant to be just a Chrome browser packed in a quiet, lightweight machine.  If you want to install Windows, Microsoft Office or iTunes (or any program), this isn't the laptop for you.  I think it makes a great secondary computer.  I have an older 13" Macbook that I use in clamshell mode with in external monitor as a desktop.  I have that for when I need to access websites that my Chromebook can't, like a school site the uses Silverlight.  For most of my web surfing and email, I prefer my Chromebook.  The keyboard is really good (a bit slicker than a Macbook, but still good) and the trackpad is responsive (not perfect, but good).  The battery lasts a long time, especially when the screen brightness is lower.  I can even use Remote Desktop to get back to my main computer if I need to do something I can't do on my Chromebook.  The Chromebook is ideal for times when you want to just grab a computer and browse because it starts up VERY quickly and has a good keyboard.  It is lightweight enough that taking it to school isn't a chore.  The computing speed is pretty good, there is no annoying fan or excessive heat to burn your legs.  If you don't like Google Docs or Chrome, don't get this machine.  Google Docs and the other Google Drive apps are the primary productivity apps and I have found them useful for my light word processing needs.  I feel that I am able to get a lot more work done on this than on a tablet with a keyboard.  I find connecting a Bluetooth keyboard to a tablet very frustrating because of the inevitable lag.  For the price and for fulfilling its intended purpose, I believe this computer is a great value and makes a great second computer!
