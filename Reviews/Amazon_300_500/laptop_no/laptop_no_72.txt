K ... I wanted a cheap'o slug of a laptop to install Solaris on - more on that later - This laptop arrived from Red Tag Computers in record time & the thing was MINT !!! ... didn't even look used. Best part was - it contains a Core2Duo - 2.5ghz - 4gigs of ram & came with a 200gbhd. First order of business was to download & install VirtualBox from Oracle - that went without a hitch - then I installed Solaris 10 in a VM environment - that went without a hitch. I then popped out the 200gbhd & dropped in a Kingston Extreme(which also came from Amazon) & I then attempted to install a clean copy of Solaris - that didn't go so well - not sure why - it's complaining about not being able to contact something on the network - which confuses the heck out of me - cause it installed flawlessly in a VM ... but anyway ... This Dell e6400 is one rocking solid little laptop ... oh ... did I mention it came from Red Tag pre-installed w/Win7_64 Pro (sweet !!!) ... so if anyone is looking for a cheap, solid little laptop ... & your on a tight budget ... I'd HIGHLY recommend picking one up from Red Tag - if your in the market for a solid, cheap, slug of a laptop - you can't go wrong in getting one of these - just remember - these babies came out in 2009 - so don't expect this thing to compare with a i3 or i5 etc - what you get out of the box is a solid little laptop to surf, some SIMPLE word processing etc - don't expect this thing to rock w/gig flop's in speed - it's a SOLID "little" laptop - beat's the other used slugs out there from misc manufactures ... mine even came with the extended battery !!! ... Red Tag really, really, really out did themselves on this deal. As mentioned, I'd highly recommend both this little beast & Red Tag.Thanks.
