Let me start with acknowledging that the screen size and the resolution is an odd one! BUT, it works fine to have both word and internet open next to each other, or two different internet browsers with multiple tabs. Movies look nice and the sound is great!It's packed with a very decent processor, memory and harddisk. Amazing they can do this for well under 600 USD and I think it has 2 year warranty - though not entirely sure. Windows 8 is getting used to, but I installed a little tool to get the windows button back and get rid of all the flashy app menus to the left and right.If you are used to a 13.3" laptop like some of the Vaios (like my wife had), then this one will look big. If you're used to a Lenovo T4xx series, 14" then this looks similar in that size. I've got a W530 of Lenovo (a pumped up version of the T5xx) and the Toshiba looks nimble in comparison.The rubberized bottom and half of the top is great!! It's like the glued a thin layer of a Teva shoe on it... It feels rugged, solid and very slip resistant. The other half of the top is aluminum look, which gives it a bit of a more business look. The rubber is great, but it does attract dust, and the aluminum loves fatty fingerprints. But nothing a wet screen-wipe can't solve!Feels solid, though as Lenovo owner I miss the clips that hold it closed, ie. close the screen to the bottom part of the laptop. But most consumer laptops don't have that anymore. The screen is great, though if you do a lot of Photoshop you would want to go for full HD 1920x1080. But nice colors, good resolution to have multiple programs next to one another, and a decent sound to watch a movie without the need for external speakers.Bottom line; great value for money (i5 / 500 Gb / 32Gb SSD / 6Gb RAM! and good screen).
