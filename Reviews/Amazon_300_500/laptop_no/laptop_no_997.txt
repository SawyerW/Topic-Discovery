This device is a tweener, and when evaluated as such, I love it.  I'm using it even more often than I thought I would.  I have a high end desktop with a linux OS, a Dell laptop with Win7, a Nexus 7 and this Chromebook.  So far, the Chromebook is getting the most use.  The form factor, long battery life, full-fledged browser, and instant on make this device more compelling than the others.  I had considered buying a MacBook Air to use as a "couch computer" but this one does the job for a quarter of the price.  Note that I didn't say it does everything the Air does, because it doesn't, but it does all the things I was going to do with the Air.I think it's better to compare this Chromebook to mobile devices rather than to a full-fledged laptop, even though I'm using it more like a laptop.  That opinion may change over time as more HTML5 capabilities are utilized on the net, but even as a mobile device, this beats every tablet out there.  It has a nice keyboard, a very nice trackpad, full-fledged applications (I'm so sick of truncated browsers and email apps on Android and IOS), and a large screen that's much better than I expected, given some of the feedback I've read.One other plus - the 100GB of space on Google Drive for two years is worth almost half the asking price of this little machine.The only downside I see to this is the limited capability of web apps.  Like I said before, that may change, but until then, I don't think I could live with this being my only computer.  I need vector and bitmap drawing programs, sound editing, desktop publishing, etc.  These are robust apps and while they do have web based counterparts, that functionality is limited by bandwidth and feature sets.Over all, I'm VERY happy with my new Chromebook, and I'm looking forward to the changes that will be coming for Chrome OS in the future.
