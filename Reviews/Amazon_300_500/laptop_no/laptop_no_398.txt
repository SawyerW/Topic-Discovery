I am one of those people who had the problematic 2010 version of the MacBook Pro. The ones that overheated and died an early death. Also based on my past excellent experience with mac computers I did not purchase an extended warranty. My MacBook Pro died about a month ago and I almost did not get another one. Unfortunately I had become a mac addict because when a Mac works it works very well. My Windows based computers were always crashing, usually about every three months. The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.My new Macbook Pro arrived yesterday. I normally DO NOT write a review until after I have used an item and on a computer I wait 3 months. I am breaking that rule today because there has been some IMPORTANT CHANGES that I feel people need to know about especially those folks like me who have had a bad experience with this line of macs.This Macbook Pro RUNS FAR COOLER than any mac I have ever owned EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW. This might be because of the new i5 processor. It might be because Apple re-engineered them and cured whatever it was that caused the problem. I don't know. All I know is that even my longest lasting macs always ran fairly warm and that 2010 model ran hot all the time. In my opinion this should make these new macs run far longer than the old ones especially if you get the solid state drive( I did not).This Macbook Pro has my other Macs beat on speed even when they were new.I will update this review and report any problems I come across. If you see no updates it's good news. One thing is for sure. With this Mac I am purchasing the extended warranty through Squaretrade. Apples warranty is too expensive and only runs 3 years. At one time they offered 5 years. The Squaretrade warranty goes up to 4 years and is about $50 cheaper.
