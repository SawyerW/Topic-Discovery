I've owned a few Macbook's & Macbook Pros, and this one is super-fast! It's as speedy as my 2008 8-Core Mac Pro, which is incredible. As an artist concerned with aesthetics & as a intensive user of 3D oriented Applications, I find that this is overall the best choice. The simplistic design doesn't "get in the way", as do other overly-designed notebooks. The highly-appealing aesthetics of Apple's design has reached it's all time high here, specifically with the unibody.GET THE ANTI-GLARE:******I highly recommend this notebook, but I greatly advise that you get an Anti-Glare display. After using a glossy display for a few years, I found that the consequences of using one do not justify the tad bit of benefits you get. Having to focus purely on what's on the screen is hard on your eyes, and can create lots of strain, as this display is very reflective. Apple's argument to counteract this is to put in an even brighter display, which works, but I found having the display be bright creates a lot of discomfort for my eyes; also think of the more power you'll need to keep your screen bright compared to just having a dim anti-glare.As a result of these high-res displays, everything looks sharper anyways, and this new type of matte screen that Apple is using is much more like a glass-surface; maybe think of it as a hybrid between a matte & a glossy. It is even supposed to be about 1/2 pounds lighter because it is using plastic rather than glass (But don't take my word for it).******Pros:*The Anti-Glare is super-nice, much better than standard Matte-displays*Wonderful display*Unibody & Glass Trackpad makes for an ultimate seamless design*Stay's relatively cool, even during intensive computer renderings*Great speakers*Expansion Card Slot*Super-fast Sandy-Bridge Processor*Has great aestheticsCons:*Only 2 Ram slots. Upgrading to 16GB for 8GB sticks is way too expensive*A better cooling system could have definitely been nice*Offering Glossy as the standard display*Lack of USB 3.0
