so this is the same computer as I have had, cept not broken... emphasis on the NOT part.  I purchased this computer to replace one I had which was on its death bed.  this was about 170 (prices vary on amazon I know, but bear with me).  I was soon made  aware the comp I had was more customized than what traditional rolled out of dells doors.  the screen was not the best, the finger print biometrics scanner was not part of the one I received, and it wasn't as fast.  The video card was also not Nvidia, it was Intel which on this model was notorious for kicking out at times which were most inopportune.So I needed it for class and it was 170 dollars, cant really beat that price, so I am using it to write this now.  you can watch some movies on it, play low graphics games if you choose I guess, but it isn't an all out comp, just a decent working comp.  so if that is what you need hunt for a great price on it.my only gripe is that the computer didn't have the biometrics scanner, I had asked specificaly about that when ordering, and the seller said "yes we will find one with that option and send it" as some of their pictures included models with the biometrics.  I didn't get one, but they did send an extra battery and a long extension cord... so minus one star for that.  minus another star for the pixels of the screen, they sold me one with the lowest resolution screen.ONE major PLUS is that this model is what you might call "out dated", and considered so by Dell.  But because of this, simply going to Dell's main page and looking up this computer lets you have access to the protocols for customizing and maintaining it that are probably the very same ones given to dell employees when you sent yours into get repaired.  Soooo... if you are looking for a computer that offers some customizable options, ease of customization, and a plethora of custom and spare parts in the on line market, then again, search for a decent price like I did and nab one.:) happy hunting
