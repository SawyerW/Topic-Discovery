I decided to go with this item because at the time of purchase $349 for a larger netbook with a better processor, 720p, HDMI out and up to 4GB ram supported is a deal.1.  Out of the box, its running vista home 32 bit.  there was a free upgrade to windows7, but it has since expired.2. not too much bloatware3. Kind of an issue:  recovery discs, they can only be made with an external DVD.  My old samsung netbooks came with a recovery solution that made image that were saved on the D drive. you didnt need an external burner4. Ok, another minor gripe. my other netbooks all came with 2 partitions: C drive, for the OS and my documents and a D drive, for the other stuff, and if you did a wipe, or revert back to factory settings, your stuff on the D Drive was saved.  Not the case with this setup5. Jolicloud:  it fully supported from what I can see.  But i did have to download and install Acer BIOS 4410 A_A .  this machine must also be re labeled and sold as an acer 1410.  When running this flavor of linux, its pretty good as well6. Speakers stink on this.  not very loud at all.  I use headphones almost all the time now.7. the LED backlit display.  its not as crisp with some video. you can see more pixelation.Vista home is not bad, but since i hear it supports window 7 64 bit, i am going to upgrade, and get the 4 GB of ram.but out of the box, it runs nice.overall for 349 bucks, shipped, tax free?  you cant beat this, when other larger netbooks all go for over 400 bucks, closer to 500.if anyone has a solution for the recovery disc work around to make iso files.. let me know.maybe a virtual burner drive?
