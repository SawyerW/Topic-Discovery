Overall I really love this laptop but, honestly, you can get more bang for the buck by buying from a different manufacturer such as MSI.  That said, the series 7 gamer is much more simplistic if you constantly want to switch modes, making it so you don't have to know as much about computers to do so.  I'll throw you a few pros and cons in an easier to read format.Pros: It is a fast and powerful beast. I was expecting a marvelous screen since this laptop is made by Samsung and I wasn't disappointed to say the least. It is very simplistic to switch between modes on this computer because of the dial.  Overall there aren't many cons, but there are a few.  Cons:  AT this price I would have loved to see an SSD and maybe a 3D display like the international model, but I cant take anything off for that because I knew going into it that neither of those were included.  As with most laptops the Series 7 Gamer, when unplugged, goes into more of a power saving mode causing the graphics quality to drop rapidly, but the solution is to just wright your own power plan.  It was a quick fix so no stars off for that either. I think it is ugly, but beauty is completely a matter of opinion plus all gaming laptops, in my opinion, except an elect few, are ugly.  As with all gaming laptops, it's heavy but I guess this could be considered a pro because then it saves you some time at the gym.. No more weightlifting for me.  Overall I love this laptop and would/do recommend it, but there are some cheaper alternatives with comparable specs.  If you're in the market for a gaming laptop The Series 7 Gamer is a very nice choice, but I would like to warn, at this point, against such a sizable investment because windows 8 just might change the PC world as we know it.
