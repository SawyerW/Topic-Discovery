I have a refurbished Black MacBook that I bought in 2007 from the Apple online store. I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about. 6+ years later it's still working just fine, but with a limit of 2 gig of RAM, it was getting a bit slow and behind the times.It's nice to see Apple still making a laptop with a DVD/CD drive. The price from Amazon was GREAT, so, I had to order it. The buying experience was good. However my experience with UPS was a 0 on a scale of 0-10. The driver did not knock on my door, left a post it note notice. I went to UPS that night. The driver had checked in and they could not find the box. I was told it would be at Pick Up the next day. I went back the next day, they could not locate it, and discovered that it was on the truck. I missed the driver by 3 minutes. He did leave it with a neighbor, and if I had not found the driver who was exiting the apartment complex, i would have had no idea where he left it. Bad UPS, BAD.Anywho, back to the MacBook Pro. While the screen is not Retina, it is still superb. Far superior to my MacBook. The build quality is typical Apple, solid, solid, solid. The SuperDrive is quiet. Sound quality is very acceptable.I haven't had it long enough to test battery life, but I will assume that up to 7 hours is realistic.The Intel i7 processor and 8 gig of RAM makes this a great desktop replacement.Based on my time with the Black MacBook I decided to take out Apple Care. It did come in hand once way back when and more than paid for itself the first and only time I used it. By the way, the Black MacBook is still running strong. All I needed to do for it was replace the battery in February 2013 as it had swelled.The MacBook Pro may look pricy at first, but due to the build quality, parts used and it having an aluminum body, I can see this one lasting 7 years or more. In that light, the 13.3" MacBook Pro is very reasonable in price and a winner in performance. And with Parallels 8 I am also using Windows 98SE, XP and 7 on my MacBook Pro. All run as if they were on a native Windows desktop machine. The 8 gig of RAM and the i7 processor make running virtual software a snap. With the latest MacBook Pro I actually have 4 computers in one. The latest version of OS X, and three versions of Windows. Combined with the SuperDive, great battery life, a crisp display and solid build quality, I am a very pleased user.
