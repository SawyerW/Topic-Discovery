I have the taichi since January 26 when it was first released in the US. The laptop itself is very nicely constructed with a few minor flaws.1) The software is kind of buggy when you try to switch from tablet mode into notebook mode.2) The taichi button is useless ( does not work at all for me)The product alone deserves at least 3 out of 5 stars, the biggest problem is the customer service.One day for whatever reason, the outer screen has a crack along the vertical surface and was not functional.I have never drop once but this is not what I am trying to argue.Anyway the screen cracks and I send it back to Asus in California.They did provided me with a return shipping label so I did not have to pay at all.But here comes the problem, the fixing process is never ending!!!The laptop arrived at their service facility on May,7, and here I come writing this review after 20days of waiting.Maybe this is common in the electronic industry, but I found this to be unacceptable given how little work you need to do fix a small product like that( 3 weeks= 15business day = 120 business hours!)The most annoying part is the fact that their customer support are deceiving.I have contacted them four times in totalEvery time I contact them, they will promise me to check on status and respond to me within 48 hours, of course in the end no one called me.Online Chat1st time: the item is taking a little longer than usual, but they are coming up with a quote soon2nd time: the item is still under progress and we will escalate the case for you and have an update asap3rd time: the item is almost done!Phone Call4th time: I am sorry for the wait but it is still in progress, in the end he told me that to be honest, he does not know when is it going to be done. (please be patient)I really like asus's product, I have their sound card, a wifi adapter and a monitor, their never fail me.But this time, wow!!!If laptop cost is based on availability hours, then I am already getting a 15% off discount at the moment.I am lucky that I have a desktop , but imagine if your car is broken for 3 weeks and you are not allow to get a rental.Update 6/16/2013: 2 days after I contact Mark who is in the Asus Customer Loyalty department, the status finally went from repairing in progress to shipped.So the whole process take about a month.  If you want better service, keep trying to contact them.
