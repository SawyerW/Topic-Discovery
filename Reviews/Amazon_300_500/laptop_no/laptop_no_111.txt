I now have this laptop, it is lightening fast and I highly recommend it. However, I had to purchase it again locally as my purchase through Amazon was a disaster.I bought this laptop from a seller linked to this page. The next day when I contacted the seller - because of a really lame lie he told - I fully understood at that time I had become the victim of fraud.However, because Amazon would not allow me to file a fraud claim until a full 26-27 days after the sale date, I did not get a timely refund, and I was forced to watch as the unscrupulous seller sold the same non-existant laptop repeatedly from this page.Now the seller's profile page has a long list of people reporting their own experiences of fraud. This weekend, almost 1 month after this purchase with Amazon, I am finally being allowed to file a fraud claim. Will Amazon delay reimbursement another few days while they attempt to contact the seller - this despite the long list of reviews (including mine) verifying that the seller is a scammer and has long since skipped? I certainly hope not, because doing that would indicate (I believe) Amazon is not capable of quickly assessing even the most obvious instances of fraud, but instead is pouring its energy into a slavish bureaucracy.The computer sales pages on Amazon have become so rife with scammer sellers that even me, a former entirely enthusiastic supporter of Amazon has to admit that this is no longer the place I had come to love.It is now not uncommon for me to find that after my order(s) won't go through the Amazon cart, I will later receive email invoices from the sellers (which look very much like the Amazon shopping cart) that tell me I need to pay by Western Union wire transfer to successfully complete the transactionI am discouraged. I no longer believe Amazon is a safe place to shop. I will add to this review in the coming days and describe my experience with the Amazon A-Z guarantee.As to the laptop, you will definitely be happy with it. The display is incredible, the processing power is considerable, and the graphics card is as good as you are going to find on an Apple.
