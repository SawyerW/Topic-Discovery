When I first got the laptop my GF was like "nice blue color, what is that a tiger claw on the top..grrrowl!" And yeah it looks like a prop from a bad 80's sci fi movie with the chrome and blue lights - but open it up and oh boy. I got mine on sale for 999 - I could have got the i7 version (there were the same price at the time) but I read some issues about blue screens with it and amazon having a great return policy I figured wth and pulled the trigger.The screen on this thing is amazing, beautful and you will not find another 1920x1080 laptop for this price save some sony ones...but then they don't get the 360m. The x3 plays every game I throw at it just fine. TF2, LFD2, COH all fine. I didn't buy it for games though. I work from home two days a week and run a virtual workstation at work. I have to use xp mode so I had to upgrade to ultimate (not a big problem). Let me just tell you the screen real estate is soooo much nicer at 1920x1080. I can have my full virutal open via xp mode and still be working in win 7 splendor.Yes..it gets a lil hot - if you play games it game get a lot hot but cram a gtx260 in a shoe box and it is going to get hot - price you pay to play games on a lappy. The sound is awesome if not a tiny bit to low for me but then I use headphones for most things so I am good to go. I would have liked to have seen usb3.0 and maybe sata III but hey you can't have everything.So yeah it looks like I am working on buck rogers space computer when I use it but I don't care...this thing could crush buck rogers, and the empire and all the other sci fi geekzors...overall a great purchase.
