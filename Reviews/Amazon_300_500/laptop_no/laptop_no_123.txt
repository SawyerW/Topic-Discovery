I have been a happy Dell customer for a number of years, but I had a very negative experience regarding an order for a Dell laptop.I ordered an Inspiron 17" laptop direct from Dell for Christmas on 12/6. I noticed on the Dell website that the estimated shipping date was 12/18. I thought, great, just in time for Christmas. My order was confirmed within a day with an estimated ship date of 01/11. Three weeks after the estimated ship time on their website.The real problems began when I called customer service to cancel the order. Four phone calls were made on 12/12 totaling over an hour to cancel the order (unsuccessfully). I was repeatedly transferred and eventually was told that the people that could help me had all gone home for the night. My second attempt to cancel the order was on 12/14. I asked for a customer service manager and was placed on hold for approximately 45-50 minutes. A regular customer service rep picked up the phone and told me that the order could not be canceled because it was "in production". I told the rep that the computer had not been manufactured yet (shipping one month from now) and that I needed him to cancel the order. I was placed on hold again for a few minutes and the rep told me again that he could not cancel the order. When I threatened to call my credit card company to refute the charges eventually the rep relented and told me that he could now cancel the order.I wasted two hours of my time just to cancel an order.In the event of an order cancellation, is it Dell policy to place someone on hold until they give up? I am disappointed in Dell after having good experiences with them over the years and I ended up giving HP the business instead. Dell has been known for good customer service, but after reading some reviews and having a bad experience myself I feel like this may no longer be the case.
