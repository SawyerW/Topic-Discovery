I first spotted this laptop being used by a classmate, I thought it was a a MAC.  When I seen that it was an Acer I had to look the prodcut up to see what pc was being made that looked so stylish and thin.  The weight was a big issue to me in looking for a computer beccause with carrying loads of books and notebooks around I wanted something light. I read product reviews and did my research for approximately two weeks. Being that weight and size were an issue to me, I read every review I could.  Not to discredit anyones views but I do feel some are a little over the top in things they do not like.  The review about the charger being 4 lbs is just not accurate in my opinion.  The charger is only slightly bigger than that of a netbook charger.  It is also not that heavy either in comparison with traditional laptop chargers.  This one could fit into my purse comfortably and I not know it.I am giving this review five stars despite it getting an Atheros wireless adapter malfunction in the beginning.  Microsoft will tell you that it is up to date in the Device Manager ,but apparently not.  If one is to get this error you have to go to the Acer website and download the update for it, which relaly isn't that hard. This is a spectacular laptop for those on a budget or just not wanting to drop $1000-1500 on a laptop.  I think for the price it is a great laptop.  For basic needs such as internet, email, papers, and presentations tihs laptop will fit your needs.  It's fast, thin, and comfortable to type on.  he arrow keys are a bit small but I cannot imagine who uses their error keys that much were it would pose a problem
