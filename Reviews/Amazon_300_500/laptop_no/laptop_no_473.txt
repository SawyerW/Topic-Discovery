This computer has all the specs of a real gaming laptop - quad-core i7, nVidia 660m, 8 gb ram, etc.So imagine my surprise and disappointment when I took it out of the box and it took 10-15 minutes to boot up, ran programs slowly, and continuously maxed out hard drive access.  Not only that, windows update didn't work, system tools didn't work and it was 10-15 minutes to reboot or shut down.After a few fits of rage about windows 8, the poor decisions of MSI engineers and a little soul-searching, I relented and actually began trying to solve the problem.  A few hours of research later and I found the needle in the haystack thread that had my solution.For those struggling with the GE70 or other similar MSI laptops, the holy grail can be found here: [...]The thread also contains a number of other things you can try to correct performance problems or other issues with the Windows 8 preinstallation image.  A key command to try in the command prompt is "sfc /scannow" without the quotes.Three days and sleepless nights later, the laptop is now running "as it should," for a machine with its resume.  Booting in just a few seconds, running games like the Witcher 2 at just about max settings, handling multi-tasking taboos like installing and running a game simultaneously, with ease.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is going to be an awesome laptop that will last me several years, as I originally intended.Had the laptop come out of the box as it is running now, this review would have been five stars all the way.  I chose four stars even though it should have been three, because it is still awesome despite of all the heartburn and the fact that some users may not be able to figure out the problems with the machine.UPDATE:  Six months later, it's still kicking butt and taking names, and has been able to handle just about everything I can throw at it in max resolution.  Upgraded to five stars, this laptop is my most prized possession.
