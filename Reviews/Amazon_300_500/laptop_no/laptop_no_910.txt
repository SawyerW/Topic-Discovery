VERY THIN (almost to a level of Ultrabook (but not really as it does not have the SSD Drive and the high endd Materials they use like aluminium)and LIGHT Laptop. I was so surprised of the thinness of this product and the specs that it has given (3rd gen 1.7 ghz i5) at a very competative price (got it for $499).PROS:-Very Thin for a 15.6 inch Laptop.-Has 3rd Gen i5 Intel Chip.-Surprisingly small power block/lightweight cord.-Screen has Great Colors (Not saturated like others).-Minimalistic Style (You have an option to change its appearance easily).-Heat and Noise transfer to hand are so Minimal (you just can't put a gel cover over the keyboard as they design the airflow  to go thru the "Keyboard's outlines" passing thru the left side where the fan outputs the airflow).-LIGHTWEIGHT compared to other 15.6 inch Laptops (Because the Structure/body is made of Hard Plastic.. which... also made the price of this item affordable).-HD Webcam is cool.-Suprisingly light and small Power Block to charge the Laptop.CONS:-Laptop Body is Made of Hard Plastic which makes the Hardware looks and feels cheaply (which made the price of this item lower).-TrackPad was good but not Great.-Dongle for Ethernet/VGA Monitor Port (which I understand to make the design slimmer).-A bit slower albeit it has a 6gb of RAM in a i5 Chipset 1.7 ghx turbo boost to 2.6 (which I easily fix by putting 2 X 8gb which equals to 16gb total making it more Responsive)-a LOT OF BLOATWARE (some useful; some not).-Keyboard is crampy so you may sometimes accidentally hit the TrackPad (but with a little practice; its duable).-Sound coming from the speakers feels too much Treble (but it is louder than my VAIO E and the Dolby Surround Works which is tweakable by the way).I GAVE IT A 5 STAR BECAUSE..-The Price (which some of the suspected Cons outweighs the Pros of this Laptop).-The thinness and lightweight.-It serves the purpose of why a purchase this item which is an affordable; on the go, lightweight computer without me worrying about the value of this item if ever it gets stolen (Not using this for any financial transactions which I use my home computer to do that. Only for Web Surfing/ some emails and some Picture editing).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR people who would want an affordable, thin lightweight 2nd Laptop on the go with the Internal Performance of a highly Spec. Computer. I haven't stop playing/using this eversince I got it so the fun factor is great.PLUS...A couple of people who saw me with this THOUGHT I WAS USING AN ULTRABOOK which is a great compliment (and I never corrected them...just for the fun of it)!!!
