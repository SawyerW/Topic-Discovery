I've been using my UL30Vt-X1 for about 6 months and I could not be happier. It's light enough to carry to class every day, it's big enough to comfortably watch movies and game, and the battery life is nothing short of amazing! On a full charge, I can use this laptop for a solid 8 hours with nearly full brightness, wireless enabled, and the integrated video. I'm sure I could squeeze another hour out of it with lower brightness and no wireless, but why bother?My only complaint is the touch pad. I like the "cheese-grater" style of touch pad, but this one is just a little too touchy. If I'm doing a lot of typing, I have to disable the touch pad to save my sanity. Those with perfect typing posture might not have this problem.This my 2nd Asus laptop (first was my Eee), and this one replaced my HP TX1000. The UL30 is better in almost every possible way. It stays reasonably cool while playing games, doesn't set my pants on fire, and has a very generously-sized keyboard, and cost about half as much as my tablet. This is the first laptop I've had with a chiclet-style keyboard, and I'm a big fan.I shopped for months before buying the UL30Vt, and not once did I find such an awesome feature set at anywhere NEAR this price.Pros:- This and light- Smart Logon is cool, works pretty well.- Quick-boot OS is handy, even if it can't connect to a WPA2-Enterprise network.- Huge 500GB HDD- Switch video cards on the fly! W00t!- Amazing battery life (8+ hours of real-world usage).- Nice aluminum top deck.Cons:- So-so touch pad, hard to get sensitivity dialed in.- Keyboard deck is glossy and gets covered with fingerprints easily. It's hard to avoid this from any laptop maker, though.[NOTE TO MANUFACTURERS: GLOSSY SURFACES SUCK! GIVE ME MATTE OR ALUMINUM!]
