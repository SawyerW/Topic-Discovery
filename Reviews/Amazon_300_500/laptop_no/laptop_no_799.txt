I'm using one right now, it works just fine with a big fan blowing on it externally, need to take the whole thing apart to clean the fan including the motherboard, too much work and it doesn't just unscrew there snap pieces, uncool, they put no though into it.  Without my external fan it overheats in about an hour or less if internet is used, especially streaming.  when I first got it, it worked running three apps facebooks, ie, and whatever else I was doing probably starcraft or something and I could switch between apps with no prob, now it has trouble just doing volume by itself, I've rebooted to factory reset, I've replaced the hard drive that died ( my fault), this computer can barely stream now is constantly doing something the little circle is always spinning, takes about a minute or more to load one web page, sometimes works for you tube videos not always that's how lame this three hundred and fifty dollar rip off is and it's just over a year old, I'd say avoid hp though others have said it's just mine but I just hate hp now, so buyer beware is all I have to say.  My uncle has the same one, one of his many comps, and he says his has slowed down now too, but last time I saw it it was way quicker than mine, maybe mc donalds just has much quicker internet than the high speed wifi I have but come on even without the internet like I said it freezes to a stand still just changing the volume sometimes what's the deal is what I say most the time, and yes I have always owned macs and now I say all comps are junk, was never that impressed with mac's they work great sometimes if you can get all your hardware to register and work at the same time without ext conflicts, oh don't buy this if you want to play starcraft wont work at all after about third month and all you'll hear is man your laggin us out.
