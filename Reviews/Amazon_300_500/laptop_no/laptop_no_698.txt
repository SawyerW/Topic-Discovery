People -- Do not buy anything from Alienware!  It was a huge mistake for us.  We bought the M9750 laptop about 18 months ago and spent a fortune.  My son had saved up much of the money himself and was excited to pick this one out.  It was sent in for repairs at least twice. On the 2nd time, they returned it and it still wasn't fixed, they had installed the motherboard improperly.  When we called to tell them, they tried to act like WE had done something to break it again.  Finally they agreed to fix it for the third repair.  At this repair, when they mailed it back to us, it was misplaced by Fedex! [...] I also found out that they settled with Fedex two months previously, but yet they still jacked me around for additional months.  Ok, so they picked a computer to replace our lost computer with, and it's not as good of a computer.  But there's nothing I can do, I have complained and argued and begged, but they are sending me a basic model laptop that doesn't even compare to the expensive one that we purchased.  They swear that it's even better than my old one, but this is only because technology has improved, it's not because it's a comparably priced computer.  Even the case isn't as cool as the one we originally had, but they don't care.  We don't have a choice.  They were rude, and no one ever once apologized to us that they and Fedex had lost our laptop -- they treated me like a thief and even admitted to me that my account was "flagged for possible fraud"!  What?  Are you kidding me?  We sent in a laptop for repairs back in April 2009 and have never seen it or a replacement product since.  Apparently I will be getting a new laptop this week, but it doesn't begin to fix the time lost and the aggravation of all these months. Oh, and the only time Alienware ever did apologize was when I mentioned hiring a lawyer.  Interesting.  Beware, from Houston, Texas.  [...]
