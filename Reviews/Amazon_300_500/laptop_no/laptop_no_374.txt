I replaced an early 2008 Macbook with this base-model Macbook Air.  The speed difference is astounding, and the battery life has me frequently forgetting my charger - and only realizing I forgot it when I see it laying on my desk when I get home.  Getting used to the smaller hard drive is a work in progress. I think that is mostly because it's nice to have all my movies, music, and pictures available on a whim, but in reality, I rarely access my movies and pictures, so they have made their way onto an external drive until I set up iTunes Match.I have had some pretty significant issues, though.Firstly, I am unable to connect my 1st gen iPad via USB cable. While I don't expect to be able to charge from the MBA, the inability to even set up wireless sync with iTunes, which requires a USB connection to set up, makes this habitual backer-upper very nervous.Secondly, connecting the 2007 Apple bluetooth keyboard and the 2009 Magic Trackpad interferes with WiFi, causing low speeds and intermittent connections.  These issues are experienced when one or both devices are connected, unless I am standing right next to the router.  Even adding a repeater does not boost the signal enough to solve the issue.  The suggestion thus far from Apple is to switch to a 5GHz router or to test all the channels on the 2.4GHz band. At this point, I am unable to practically use bluetooth devices with my brand new computer.I have been in contact with Apple Support, replaced the MBA, duplicated the issues on a fresh install (and after running software updates) and been back in touch with Apple support with the same issues.  It is frustrating because everything works with my older Macbook under the same conditions.  The issues are currently escalated and awaiting resolution.I am willing to settle for these issues for now with the hopes that they will be resolved soon by Apple with software updates.
