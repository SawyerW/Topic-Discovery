I bought this laptop for college, looking for something cheap and durable. After reading a few reviews online and getting the nod from my older brother, who was helping me pick it out, I decided to buy it here, mostly because this is the cheapest I found it. The machine is very lightweight--a plus since I'm a French horn player who has to carry her instrument around with her--and any issues I had with the mouse and keyboard just took a little getting used to. The screen was a little dark, but that was easily fixed when I turned up the brightness a notch. The buttons to play/pause/stop/etc. music and movies is really convenient, along with the volume control buttons. It came with Photoshop 9, too, which saves me the time of reinstalling CS2. Just some tips for potential buyers, though: It only comes with two USB ports (one on each side), so I would recommend buying one of those things that gives you 4+ extra ports if you need to plug in things. (These sell for about 2-3 dollars on Amazon, so it's not that much of a major investment.) It also doesn't have a DVD/CD drive, so if you want to use any sort of CD, you might want to buy an external DVD drive.My mum and her boyfriend were both really worried when it arrived (I was at my dad's for the weekend when it came) because the box came and it looked a little tattered, but we opened the box and it was protected very well (styrofoam, then a hard box that it came in, and then another very small amount of wrapping around it). It came very quickly, too--I ordered it on a Wednesday and it came on Saturday--but that may be because it was shipped from either New Jersey or Pennsylvania (I forget) and I live in the western area of New York.All in all, it's a great laptop, and the service was great when I ordered it. If I wound up buying a laptop again in the near future, this is probably where I'd buy it.
