I ordered this laptop from Amazon and received it quickly afterward. Once received, I quicly opened the box and this is what I found out about the laptop:The Pros:- It is fast. It ran all of the games I am owning with with ease (because of GTS 360M GPU, core i5, and lots of fast RAM, etc...)- True 1080p on a 15.6in monitor produces great picture quality; however, text can be a bit small (tips: do Ctrl + +sign in IE to increase the font size, vice versa Ctrl + -sign to reduce it).- 7200RPM hard drive. (The hard drive is the biggest bottleneck in laptop or any computer's performance for read and write, but this has 7200RPM, which is very good, boot up and shutdown time is great).- The material that made up the laptop case is good, the laptop feels sturdy.- Full keyboard with dedicated num pad and can light up in the dark helps with using it at night.- Audio sounds great (if you have a headset, plug it in and you will be able to hear the true sound quality of the built in sound engine.- Heat (to be fair, I have own laptops that are hotter than this one, and ones that are cooler than it, so the heat from this laptop is neutral in my opinion, neither hot or cool.The Cons:- For a 15.6in laptop it feels a litle bit bulky (ASUS could have reduce the height and width a bit)- The keys on the dedicated NUM pad are smaller than the normal keys (??? why, they certainly have spaces on the sides to make these normal-sized keys- the bezels around the lop are thick (again ??? why, they could have reduce half an inch off of each side and it will be perfect).Overall, this is a great laptop for the price; however, the GTS 360M is only a directx 10.1 GPU, now that Fermi is out, might as well wait for the mobile GPU from that architecture and upgrade.
