Performance and everything is great (after I removed some bloatware including McAfee and other Dell-provided unnecessary stuff, installed all updates and a better free antivirus and anti-malware program).The trackpad is larger than it needs to be -- it's quite a bit larger than the one I love on my Dell Studio 15Z which is basically the same size of case and keyboard.  There's no reason the pad needs to be so big, and having it this big is just asking for more unwanted thumb contact.  I don't personally have too much problem with it because I use the classic typing hand position and good posture, but my parents have been experiencing accidental thumb hits with effects like losing an email they were composing because of changing window focus or accidentally reacting to their window focus mistake by pressing Backspace.The somewhat smaller pad on my Studio 15Z gives more than enough fine resolution, so I can't see a reason to go larger and make the pad be such a large target and a large part of the hand rest area.  But otherwise this is a great laptop and a great value, maybe one of the best values available right now.I was very glad that Amazon still had the Windows 7 version in stock because I just don't agree with Windows 8 and the push to make desktop and laptop computers too similar to tablets and smartphones.  And I'm not one of those people who has always held back on OS releases... I was an early adopter of XP, Vista, and 7 because each made better use of my hardware.  But Windows 8... not going there.  (Plus on the business side I already do all my work in Linux and use Windows 7 only for Photoshop... Microsoft owes Adobe a big thanks for the millions of other people for whom this is true).
