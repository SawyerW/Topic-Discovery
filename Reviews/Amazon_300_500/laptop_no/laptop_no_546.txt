This laptop has the best keyboard of any laptop I've tried. I type (a lot) and so this is one of the most important features for me. I like how this particular laptop has a very basic keyboard (no extra keys on the right side of the RETURN key, like a number pad or useless media keys - these extra keys on the right side make touch typing almost impossible). I really like how it has a full size right-hand shift key (increasingly hard to find on laptops). Also, unique to this computer, it has slightly larger Esc and Delete keys, two keys that I use frequently.Here's the caveat: ThinkPads have the Fn and Ctrl keys reversed, and this particular one also has all the functions keys (F1 to F12) mapped to annoying media functions BY DEFAULT. That means, you have to hold down the Fn key and then press the desired function key (which is in tiny tiny print on the lower corner of each function key) if you want the "legacy" function to register.In the BIOS setup, you can reverse the Fn and Ctrl keys (if this option wasn't available, I would have never bought this computer - I use that left hand Ctrl key continuously because I use Vim as a text editor - but there are many other programs that rely on the Ctrl key being in that lowest left-hand corner that you are probably used to).HOWEVER, you CANNOT reverse the function keys (F1 through F12) to default to their legacy functionality. This is shameless on Lenovo's part, not giving its customers that option - especially since previous BIOS versions on older ThinkPads always offered that as an option! Maybe this will be fixed by a later BIOS release by Lenovo, but so far I've seen no response from them online, whatsoever, about this. So buyer beware!
