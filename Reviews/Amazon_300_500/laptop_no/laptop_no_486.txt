I waited in line at Black Friday for 2 hours for the laptop and the wait was worth it! This is my 1st laptop and it is amazing for the price! Setup was a breeze and within 30 minutes of boot up, I was already using it. Boot up time is lightning fast only taking 12 seconds! Windows 8 takes some time to get used to, but there is a guide with the laptop that explains the process to you. Battery time is decent lasting 5 to 6 hours of heavy use or up to 3 days in standby time. Wi-Fi works great with this laptop and the internet is lightning fast! You can also switch from a  Windows 8 to a Windows 7 mode by clicking this application called Desktop. I haven't had a single problem with this laptop in the 2 weeks I have had so you can tell that is a quality machine. Great laptop for only $179, and is highly recommended that you get the 2 year warranty from Walmart for only $19. The laptop itself comes with a 1 year warranty and with the warranty from Walmart, it will bump it to a 3 year combined warranty.Also, if you wish to upgrade the RAM, please be aware that there is only one DIMM slot for the RAM, and the RAM can only be upgraded to 8 GBS of ram. Happy laptop hunting and have a nice day!P.S. This particular laptop has a turbo-boosting technology that will bump the processor to clock at 1.20 GHz and above, when performing certain tasks such as gaming. This is extremely useful when performing many tasks at once.Update: I have been using this laptop for about 2 months, and still working like a champ! There have been zero problems with this laptop, except the annoying notifications for Windows updates, which just ask you to re-boot your laptop to start the update. Other than that, this laptop has been working great. I highly suggest that the upgrade the ram to 8 GBS, as this will pay off in the long run. Have a nice day.
