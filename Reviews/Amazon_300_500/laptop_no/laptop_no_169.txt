Pros:Intel processor, screen size, Thinkpad line, okay cooling, adequate graphicsCons:  First of all, my unit came with Windows 7 X64 pro on it, not exactly the same as this one-"Ctrl" key is NOT the left most one on the bottom row, for someone who uses keyboard shortcuts, it's a nightmare to always remind myself "it's the second to the last key".-worst motherboard ever, as you will have issues installing another windows 7 version or upgrading later on, because the storage drivers are not compatible and leads to BSOD or failure during system install.  At first I thought it was the CD/USB drive that I loaded Windows 7 x64 Ultimate onto, but installed Win 7 on two other PC's (laptop and desktop) without a hitch with the same disc/USB.  In all fairness Microsoft also to blame partly for this problem.  Common M$, keep the communications open with 3rd party distributors and ensure your valued customers does not have to spend days to figure out a simple 15 min system upgrade/install.-Cheap feel, mind you this is not a business class laptop albeit the "Thinkpad" line name, it does not have a metal skeleton inside the case such as the high-end Thinkpads or Alienware; you get what you paid for in this case.-Owned the unit ~1 year, used it infrequently since I have another HP from work, finally got Windows 7 installed by pulling out the hard drive and installed Win 7 onto it in my work laptop (yeah it installed fine), then placed the hard drive back into this unit.  Junked it at a local PC shop for $250 in return.  The unit runs Win 7 ok after all that nonsense, but still with errors.Other thoughts:Laptops are not like desktops, which you can easily swap out a motherboard if problems occur; such case is when my desktop's mobo died I just swapped out a new one with $50 and an hour of my time.  For a laptop, you either spend $300+ for labor/parts or you spend a day trying to replace it.  Hate to say it, since Lenovo took over the Thinkpad Line, those junky Asian parts just pollute this line of premium mobile computing.  My suggestion for Lenovo is to change the name of these laptops to "Unthink Pads", it certainly stifles encouragement of any further dealings with Lenovo on my end.  Changing to Toshiba Protege/Alienware.Alpha
