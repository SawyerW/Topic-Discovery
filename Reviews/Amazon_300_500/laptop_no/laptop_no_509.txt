I bought this laptop in july 2013. I even gave $28.00 for extended warranty. In Sept.2013 I turned it Off one night & went to bed. The next morning when I turned it on I got a screen asking for a BIOS password. I have never set a password for Bios. I could not get it on. So I called Toshiba support & told them about the Bios password problem. They had me try a few things while I was on the phone with them, but nothing worked. So they said I'd have to send it to their repair depot to be repaired. I had a choice of boxing it myself & sending it & be responsible for damages during shipping Or buy their box for $24.95. To be on the safe side I bought their $25.00 box. Four days after it arrived at their repair depot I got an email saying that repair was on hold because the main board had to be replaced & that it wasn't covered under warranty. I freaked!. I emailed the repair depot & ask them how could a 3 month old laptop main board not be covered under warranty. Four hours later they emailed me back & said I didn't send them a BIOS password & to either send them a BIOS password or $114.00 to repair it or it would be sent back to me unrepaired. Well I spent an hour on the phone with hump teen different people in Toshiba support. They all said that the BIOS password problem was not covered under the warranty even if I never set one. Bottom line..their warranty is useless. I told them to send it back to me unrepaired. LET IT BE KNOWN..TOSHIBA CORP.HAS GOT THE LAST PENNY FROM Don in Alabama. So if your thinking of buying a Toshiba product..you better hope you won't need the warranty. I actually have three Toshiba laptops but I will never buy a Toshiba product again because of this experience.Open this link  [...]
