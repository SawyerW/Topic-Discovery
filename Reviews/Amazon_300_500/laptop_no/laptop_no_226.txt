I tested this device at two different stores side to side with the 13" MacBook Air and I am now under the impression that this version, the 1.4GHZ, is too slow for most people. Maybe the processor is inferior or it does not have enough ram to handle multitasking or video playback, no one knows for certain. Alas, don't take my word for it, before you buy one, go to a computer store and play video at full screen, ie. like you would on an airplane trip. Open the "About this Mac" menu and make sure you are testing the Mac you plan to buy. Open a streaming video from a popular website like Hulu, play a movie in HD. Chances are it will skip frames or stop playing altogether. It tested Hulu on both models, the 11" and the 13" side to side, the 13" played impeccably while the 11" skipped frames till it would stop playing entirely, freezing up the whole computer. If the 11" MacBook Air can't play movies properly, then all you get is a fancy web-surfing/email reader, since the keyboard is not illuminated, I would say, you are probably better off buying an iPad for half the price.**Update**As it often happens with all all my reviews, Apple has finally admitted that there was a problem with Mac Book Air laptops and has released an update that is supposed to resolve the issue. I find it highly unlikely that a software update can fix what is clearly a hardware problem but at least there is an official admission from Apple that the freezing problem does exist even though is not as rare as they claim it is.The update is meant for the 11-inch and 13-inch Air and claims to resolve a "rare issue where MacBook Air boots or wakes to a black screen or becomes unresponsive."
