I'm using the computer right now to write this review. To get the cursor to move I have to HAMMER on the touch pad. The WiFi works sporadically. Although it indicates 5 bars pages either load or generate a "page not available" message randomly. Not available? Crap, that just means the computer's Wifi isn't working. My previous HP 2 year old laptop had a better touchpad and WiFi. Shouldn't things get better in 2 years?Further, this computer has Windows 8. More crap. Large scale arbitrary changes without any benefit. It will take me hours to learn to do things I used to do easily on XP or Win 7. Why does Microsoft keep screwing with things? Haven't they heard, "If it isn't broke, don't fix it"?P.S. I'm on my 3rd try to get this review to get thru the wifi connection.EDIT: With phone help after 45 minutes they were able to make the WiFi work properly. Now I have a solid connection. Thank you DELL.EDIT 2: Let down again. Today for the first time I tried to rip some audio CDs using the onboard CD/DVD player. Of 5 discs it read 2 ok, but several tracks on 3 of them wouldn't read. I took those 3 CDs to a portable CD player on another computer , Delland they read and ripped without problem. Screwed again, Dell! FURTHER: This Windows 8 (I hesitate to capitalize it. Too respectful.) is pure crap. Arbitrary changes with no benefit. As I'm using the touch pad the flippin' popups keep intruding on what I'm doing. I only want it to do so one in ten times that it happens. Microsoft, STOP IT!!!! Did you not user test this at all??? Whose dopey idea was this? Windows 7 was annoying enough. Let's go back to the XP interface that worked just fine. No wonder Google is embarrassing Microsoft. Microsoft has lost touch.
