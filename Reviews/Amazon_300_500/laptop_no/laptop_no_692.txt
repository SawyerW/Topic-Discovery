in the Jr. High school, they had a couple of these macs.  I worked with the IT dept/their website so I got one of them.  all I can say was that this mac was my best computer experience - ever.  Well, a MacBook pro I guess would be better, but anyways...Pros:-Amazing battery life, I usually got like 4 hours somehow-Really powerful, every app was very snappy, even if I had a ton of apps open-It's an apple (woot)-The screen looks REALLY good.  I had the glossy one, and it was like HD happiness every time I watched a movie-Keyboard feels really good-Mouse has great feedback, but not annoyingly sensitive (like when you're typing and bump it, it doesn't send the mouse flying opening Photoshop when you're trying to work on a something else and not in the mood to force quit photoshop before i got the activation screen of adobe death (I had a 30 day trial and forgot to delete it)-webcam / skype happiness-Mac OS X is really really really easy to understand.  I was a Windows junkie before I used a mac and i learned how to use a mac in seriously a day or 2, it's really intuitive.Cons-the underside can get kind of hot if you're doing processor-intensive activities, but that's true with basically all laptops unless you have a cooling mat/fan under itThe screen isn't great for outdoors, but neither is any other glossy screen.It might be a good idea to get a spare power adapter, because although the magsafe power adapters are really genius, what tends to happen  is the wire inside the sleeve gets untwisted, so you you get like twisting bumps on the wire... if that makes sense.  This isn't a real big deal but it could lead to a kink/break of the wire if you're not smart.  Plus, this didn't happen to me, but some reviews say on the Apple site that the wire can fry through a power surge?
