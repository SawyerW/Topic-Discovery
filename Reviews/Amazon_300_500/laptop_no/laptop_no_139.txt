The reason that I bought this was I have found HP Computers to run quietly and the Laptops stay COOL! I am very picky about laptops and I give this one ALL 5's in all of these areas below:1) BATTERY LIFE - This one is rated at 4.5 hours (no computer will achieve the battery life the manufacturer states). However, when I use a computer I have WiFi ON all the time and I am always on the internet. So I tested out this unit and with WiFi on ALL the time with 4 tabs opened, I had a battery life of 3.5 hours! I was so pleased. I believe if I turned my screen down to 25% and just typed in Word, kept the WiFi off, I would have had 4.0 to 4.25 hours! So I give it 5 stars. (My Acer Aspire (old) netbook only gets 4.5 to 5.0 hours, and my old 15.6 Acer (with Vista) only got 1 - 1.5 hours of battery life.2) COOLNESS: I have owned several laptops in the past and they ran so hot that I could have fried an egg on them. This one is 95% cool and now with my Thermapak Cooler, it is 100% COOL even with I run it for 12 hours at one time!3) QUIET - Cannot hear the HARD DRIVE and the fan is so quiet.4) Hard Drive does not spin much.5) Fast, fast and fast computer: Booting is in just a couple of seconds. Opening programs is very fast.6) Love the keyboard, so easy to type on this!7) Lightweight and small but not too small. Fits easily into my laptop backpack!8) The 14" is best for me and better than a net-book for travel because the screen is so much larger and this laptop has a DVD/CD read/write drive. I watched a movie on it and it was plenty large enough for me with beautiful picture and colors!I love HP and have used Dell and Acer, however, I prefer HP to the other brands!In summary: In my opinion, this is the best laptop for the money out there!
