The price is what first enticed me. I got this when it was on sale for $199. For a laptop? Can't be beat. I am a heavy Apple user. I have a 13" MacBook Pro, a iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an Apple TV. Needless to say, I love Apple products, but I needed a machine for work (I'm a teacher) and this fit the bill perfectly. And over the past week since I've owned it, I've actually been using it more than my MacBook Pro (can't believe it!)It's thin, light and easy to use. Of course you're not buying this thinking it does everything a Mac or a PC can do, because everything is web-based and in the cloud. Basically if you can't do it on the internet, then you're limited. However, like MOST people, I do simple word processing (use Google docs) and internet surfing. For work, I answer e-mails, take attendance and input student grades.If you're a heavy photo/video editor, gamer or a software developer or something, then this can't be your only computer. However, for everyday tasks, it's awesome.LOVES:* Fast, light and easy to use* Only $199 (I caught it on sale)* I can access ALL my iTunes music using Google Play Music (from my iPad & iPhone too, huge plus!)* Amazon Instant Video & Netflix works great* Printing is easy with a wireless printer.The things I don't love about it are all things I knew before I bought it and I can still do from my MacBook. I can even use Java apps or other things I can't do on the Chromebook by using Remote Desktop to access my MacBook. That basically solves all those problems.I would buy this again in a second. As long as you have your expectations adjusted and know exactly what you're buying, this machine is great.
