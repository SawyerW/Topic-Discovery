This is no technical review ... just one to highlight the user-friendly features (and quirks) of this laptop.(I have been using this laptop since November 2012)PROS:This is definitely a superior laptop screen - the specs say 720p but the display is comparable to a 1080 HD.  Reading text is almost as crisp as the iPad's retina display.The lighted keyboard is so useful for working in a dimly lit room.  I use the laptop to follow the Bloomberg editors on twitter while looking at the channel on cable tv, sometimes in full darkness.Long life battery allows greater portability.  I was pleasantly surprised to get 5.5 hours of use on battery power at default brightness!This is twice what I had expected as the AMAZON'S PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WRONGLY STATES: 'Up to 2.75 hours of battery life at default brightness with standard 4000 mAh battery'.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESThe Sony Vaio E15 laptop has one USB 3.0 port which is x 10 faster than the two standard USB 2.0 ports.The USB 3.0 port is handy for attaching an external drive so that data transfer can be done in a more timely manner.The DVD/CD optical drive's Cyberlink Power2Go software is very user friendly.Sony Vaio updates the computer hardware.  So far all updates have been seamless.A trial version of Microsoft Office 201O was installed on the Windows 8 OSI took advantage of paying for Office 201O  to automatically qualify for the free upgrade to Microsoft Office 2013(I downloaded and installed Microsoft Office 2013 on Friday 2nd February without any hiccups)With 750GB of Hard Disk storage and additional cloud storage on the Microsoft Skydrive, memory should not be an issue even if you're a data hog! :)CONS:Actually this a Microsoft issue rather than Sony's - Mastering Windows 8 is much too steep a learning curve over Windows 7.  So, be prepared to dedicate some time to re-learn this Windows 8 OSMY RECOMMENDATION:If you are pressed for time or, you don't want to 'figure' out how to use Windows 8, I recommend signing up for a crash course in course in 'Learning to Use the Windows 8 Operating System' :(With a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-3110M dual-core processor (3 MB cache) and 6 GB of installed DDR3 RAM, this Sony Vaio E15 laptop is adequate for running a small home office.Overall, this  Sony Vaio E15 laptop is a great little workhorse/entertainment device offered here on Amazon at a great price.Hope my review and photos weere helpful ...
