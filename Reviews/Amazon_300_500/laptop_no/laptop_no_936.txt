This is my first time purchasing an Asus computer, I usually stick with Toshiba or Dell and have never had any problems.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I love this ultrabook.  It's very easy to switch from one screen to another...it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how and I'm not a tech genius.  It's all I was looking for and more.Since buying the Taichi I have used it to watch movies and read ebooks or documents in the tablet form.  The battery lasts me about 2hr and 15min while watching movies.This was also my first experience with windows 8, still deciphering that but all in all with a little trial and error I get things done.Although in the description given by Amazon it does not say this; it does come with a protector sleeve, a stylus (AAA battery  included) and an Hdmi adapter.UPDATE: JUNE 4,2014So incredibly angry that I spent over $800 on this thing.  I should have bought the Dell xps which was the other I was looking at when I purchased this.  The whole switching to tablet mode stopped working.  The touchscreen on the tablet side is wonky at best.  I used the asus live chat to get help with the issues I am having. In order to get approval to have it fixed I chatted with a total of 5 reps in a space of a week.  Finally after being told by 2 of them to reset the computer to factory settings which did nothing to fix the problem, now I have to send it in at my own expense and they do not replace with new one. How dissappointing.  With my previous computer which had been a Dell I got a new one sent to my home with no hassle whatsoever.  For a company who claims to pursue perfection in their logo they fall extremely from their mark. Don't EVEN come close.Lesson learned and will NEVER purchase any asus product again.
