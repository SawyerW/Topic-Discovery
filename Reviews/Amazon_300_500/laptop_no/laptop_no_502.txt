I specifically bought this laptop for my wife to use for our small business because it was rated the #2 most reliable Windows laptop by Soluto in their 2013 reliability study (outdone only by a MacBook that cost more than twice as much--and which probably didn't clock nearly as much time running Windows as this Acer).What I like:- rated #2 most reliable Windows laptop in Soluto's 2013 reliability study- inexpensive- fastest CPU in its price range (according to CPUbenchmark.net)- power cord has a right-angle plug on the laptop end- speakers, though mediocre, are at least audible in a household environment and are better than I've had on past entry-level laptops- not overly bulky or heavy- decent battery lifeWhat I don't like:- hard drive is extremely slow, even compared to other spindle-based laptop drives (a faster hard drive or SSD would be a welcome upgrade)- touchpad buttons require too much force to click (they're not horribly stiff, but they did cause my thumb's existing repetitive stress injury to fire up again)- touchpad performance is inconsistent- glossy screen- low resolution (1280x768)- keyboard could be better- power connector on the laptop is wobbly (might be prone to failure...but I guess we'll see)- wireless connection is flaky (disconnects periodically, but turning WiFi off and back on always seems to fix it)- comes with some crapware/bloatware preinstalledThe bottom line:Unfortunately there are too many negatives for me to say I like this laptop out-of-the-box.  If you need a cheap, no-frills laptop and you're on a strict budget, then this is probably the best entry-level laptop you'll find based on the specs and Soluto's reliability study, but it does have its flaws.  If you're willing to spend $200 or so upgrading the RAM and replacing the hard drive with an SSD, you're probably better off stepping up to a slightly higher-end model with a touchscreen and more RAM (such as Acer's V5 series), and upgrading that laptop's hard drive to an SSD.
