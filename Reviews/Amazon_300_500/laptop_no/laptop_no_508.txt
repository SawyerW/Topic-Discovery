I posted this review originally on the other listing(s) for the Chromebook Pixel, but my review doesn't seem to have transferred across to this listing, so for the benefit of potential purchasers my original comments were...I bought my Chromebook Pixel direct from Google, fully expecting to return it within the 15-day return period once I had taken it for a spin. But, you know what? It was so good... I kept it! Despite the hefty price tag.Having used other Chromebooks such as the "cheep and cheerful" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch), and being more concerned with their function rather than their form, I surprised myself by falling in love with the potentially gimmicky and indulgent features that set the Chromebook Pixel apart from other Chromebooks:1. The display really is awesome, even when simply browsing the web and noticing the sheer sharpness of the on-screen characters.2. The sound is really awesome, nice and loud despite the fact that you can't see the speakers (which are hidden under the keyboard).3. The touch screen is surprisingly useful for scrolling up and down through web pages and documents, and I seem to be able to hit the right buttons on screen with less hit-and-miss than I have experienced (for example) when operating the Microsoft Surface (32GB) web browser in desktop mode.4. I love the solid feel and square simplicity of the aluminium casing on the Chromebook Pixel.As explained in The Chrome Book (Fourth Edition): The Essential Guide to Cloud Computing with Google Chrome and the Chromebook, all Chromebooks are born equal in the sense that you should be able to do pretty much the same things on all of them. But it's so much more pleasurable to do those things on this beautiful machine. And I didn't expect to say this!Why four stars rather than five? Only the price. But I guess that if you want quality... you have to pay for it.
