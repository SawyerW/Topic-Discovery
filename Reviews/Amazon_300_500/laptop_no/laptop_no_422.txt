The first one I ordered arrived in original computer box, with picture on the outside of what it was, just left sitting on my doorstep for the neighbors and passersby to see.  The box was beat all to hell.  Could not believe that it was sent this way, but decided to try it out since there is a 30-day money back guarantee.  Well, the computer did not work properly.  Could not even get it past the set-up stage.  I called Apple Care to try and troubleshoot it with them, and they were totally boggled about it.  I just think it got beat up during the shipping process and was messed up internally.So, I called to complain about it, to get my money back, and explained the way it was shipped and left.  Amazon rep I spoke with seemed surprised, and immediately issued refund to me.  In order to send it back, though, I had to prepare different packaging because it had to be insured (over $1000 item), and UPS would not accept it to send back the very same way it was shipped to me.  It cost $42.00 for UPS to insure and package it properly to send it back to Amazon.  I had to fight with Amazon to get that $42 reimbursed to me.  But they did.So... next chapter.... I ordered another one, thinking surely they would not send it the same way again.  But they sure did.  Except for not leaving it at my door and having me go to UPS office to pick up in person.  But it did not have any separate box/padding for shipping/handling.  Such an expensive piece of equipment should be better protected for shipping.  I did not even take it home the second time... just said return to sender immediately.I ordered a third laptop, of the brand new, not refurbished variety, still waiting to receive it.  I am hoping it will be shipped in a better manner.  If it's not, I will be returning to sender on that one, too.
