This is a nice laptop as stated by many, but it only deserves 3 stars for two reasons:1. The WD hard drive that it comes with has an annoying clicking sound. I have never noticed this sound on any other laptops I've used before, which worries me.2. Customer service at Asus... 1 star at most. I was on hold for no less than 45 minutes and was given misleading information and even "threatened!!!".If you are interested, the story:I called Asus to have my hard drive replaced because of the strange clicking sounds it made. The customer service rep advised me to use an "advance replacement" method to speed up the process. The advance method requires the owner to replace the hard drive themselves, and then send in the defective part. Sounds great right!?4 days later wondering where my replacement hard drive was I called Asus again. I was told this time that the "return shipping is NOT covered!!". I explained that the first customer rep mentioned that I would receive a shipping label via email but never received one. They not only refused to cover the return shipping, I was rudely asked "read the advance replacement form" again, and was threatened to be charged for the new hard drive if the defective part was not sent back.Sure I understand that they want to charge me for the part if I don't send it back, but the issue is I was never informed (included the form I signed) that shipping is only covered ONE WAY.So 2 year warranty... 1 year accidental damage... "free two-way standard shipping"... SOUNDS GREAT right? But, not included unless you send the entire laptop to them. Which takes forever to get back.Just beware of that!Isn't it cheaper to send a hard drive than it is to send a laptop?!?!
