It started out as a great laptop. After few months, I started to notice the screen behaving weird. It will flicker randomly when I resume it from sleep. Then I sent it for fixing to Asus service center. They sent it back without fixing anything saying they cant reproduce the problem without even contacting me. Now I have to figure out a way how to reproduce it for them to fix, which is very hard as the screen flicker on randomly. I did lot of research online too about the problem. Just google 'asus k61ic' and google will pop up with 'asus k61ic screen flickering' as one of the most searched terms. So I guess many people are having problem with this laptop model. I had high hopes on Asus service and expected Asus to know by now about this problem and also have a permanent fix for it. I have RMA'd my laptop 2nd time and sent it. I am waiting to see if they can fix it or not.Lesson Learned: No matter which brand you buy, reliability can vary widely depending on the model of the laptop - now i think, buying good car is lot easier than buying a good laptop.EDIT: ASUS was able to fix the problem and it is working fine after that. I think they replaced my LCD panel. I agree with the other comment - the dvd drive is finicky and springs out at unexpected moments - funny it doesnt get closed so easily too sometimes - its weird.. anyways, apart from that, the splendid utility wont work right, if you login as standard user - it needs administrative rights - another weird thing. Apart from those few annoyances, if you are persistent with ASUS, I guess they will fix your hardware problems. But its not fun to go thru the ordeal.
