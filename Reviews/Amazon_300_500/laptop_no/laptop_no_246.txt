This is a great lil machine. It is a used/refurbished laptop. I have a t-43 that got damaged so upgraded to this model for price and reviews. It shipped FAST from Link-Tronics Memory, well pkgd, clean, and exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend, or use them again. They totally get customer service, deliver what they say. They rated it a B+, well I think it is A-, and a bargain for what I was seeing locally for machines that were more expensive and not near as nice. These aren't fancy laptops, but they do what I need and easily so that is what matters to me. I have also have an HP nc6220, which I adore (probably because I had it first), but the Lenovo has advantages over it. This one I travel with and take places because it does well. I think it has a clearer image than my hp and is lighter-not by much but when you are lugging anything around weight matters. If you need a good basic laptop, I think this a very good choice. I have a computer geek friend that tells me parts swap out easily on these, haven't tried, but was a selling feature.**if you are purchasing a used/refurbished computer, please make sure that the seller has good reviews. Before making this purchase I got similar computer from other vendor. It wasn't as advertised, it had serious issues, it was rated very good and it wasn't on par at all with what I got here-no comparison. I returned it immediately, but am having difficulty getting a refund. The claim is I could just reinstall software and it would be fine-it didn't come with software, and I don't think that is the problem at all. My point is this vendor CARES about doing quality biz, and that makes all the difference! And I regret that I didn't find them first.
