I've had my chromebook for a couple months now, and I increasingly love it. I just pulled out my old laptop (heavy, slow MacBook) the other day, and I was really impressed by how much the Chromebook has spoiled me.Sure, you can't load your own 3rd party programs, and the storage is minimal, and the screen is not industry-leading... but you knew that all before you bought it!It's thin and super lightweight. The computer loads in seconds when powered on, and pages load faster that my old mac ever did. Not sure why everyone complains about the screen so much. Why is everyone looking at their screen from funny angles anyway?  Looks just fine when it's sitting in front of me.The Chrome web store has tons of add-ons which improve functionality. Memory hasn't been a problem for me at all; keep a flash drive around, and you'll be fine. Battery life has been at least 6-7 hours per charge, which is phenomenal. Completely silent while running, which is nice. Speakers are better than I expected. HDMI link to my 42" LCD TV has very nice picture. Keyboard has a very nice feel to it, and trackpad works well. 12 free GoGo in-flight passes almost pay for the machine itself.Crashed on me twice shortly after I got it; probably had too many windows/tabs open (may have something to do with combination of having both incognito and regular windows open... not sure). Software has updated itself several times since I first started using it, and now no more crashes. Couldn't open my dropbox files at first; after upgrades, it's working perfectly. I do wish Google and/or Citrix could develop a better app than their current Citrix Receiver, which is really my only complaint. That would really help make this a dynamite cloud-friendly computer.At $250, this is an incredible value. Really glad I stepped outside my Mac and PC comfort zone to make this purchase. Careful: if you lend it to your family and friends for a "minute," it may be hours or days before you see it again. :)
