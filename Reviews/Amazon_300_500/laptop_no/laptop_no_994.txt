I will start by saying that I have two desktop PCs that I use for the heavy duty stuff, but I've always had a laptop for mostly web browsing and chatting with friends.  I previously had a Macbook Air that recently died a bit prematurely, so I thought I would give this Chromebook a shot.Firstly, I really like the size of the laptop.  It's very small and lightweight, and yet the keyboard and trackpad feel really good.  I am very picky about my laptop trackpads, having been spoiled by my Air.  Most Windows laptops have horrible trackpads and I was very concerned about going to this one.  However, the accuracy is excellent and the gestures are pretty good.  I don't think they are quite up to par with the Macs, but for this price point the trackpad is better than Windows laptops that are three times this price.As far as the operating system itself, color me impressed.  I was a user of Google Chrome already and heavily invested into Google web apps, so that transition wasn't hard at all.  I did find myself looking for some viable Chrome-based alternatives to software that I used on my PC, like a VNC client.  To date, I haven't found a single piece of software that I need on a daily basis on a laptop that doesn't have a Chrome app for it.The only negative thing I can say is that the ARM processor in this guy can sometimes get a little sluggish on graphically intensive pages, but mostly it's smooth.  High definition video is just fine most of the time, but some pages can still slow it down to a crawl.  I have tweaked a couple of settings and blocked some web elements from loading and that seemed to improve it greatly.  I definitely recommend this Samsung Chromebook and Chrombooks in general.  I will probably grab another one when the Haswell updates come out.
