All apple products are usually amazing products they make many different things. Phones, Lap Tops, Computers, iPads, and iPods Even with a few glitches at times here and their all Apples products are reliable and durable.One amazing about the Mac is the light weight it has. Being a college student and always needing my lap top attached to my hip, I don not want a heavy 10 pound laptop. I want something durable and light that I can just throw into my backpack or purse and not notice the weight difference. With the light weight I can take is any where and everywhere and it barley takes up any space either.But one thing I love the most is the 12 hour battery life. I am able to do work all day long on the go and I don't have to worry about my battery life and loosing all my work I worked on. Being on the go and not always near a power source is hard when it comes to keeping things charged.A add on though for the Mac is the 2 usb sources instead of 1. Having 2 usb ports is such a life save when it comes to a college student or even just a person always on the go. I can charge my phone 24/7 while I put in a a usb to save and transfer all my school work.Having a Mac book pro is one of the most amazing things for being a college. I love having it with me to be able to always look things up. I can carry around a lap top with no problem at all. The mac is one of the most reliable lap tops yet, i would never ever trade it for anything else. My life is my lap top it is my savior at times. Apple is the way to go no doubt about it. It compares to nothing else what so ever.
