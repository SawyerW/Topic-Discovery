I bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 and 13 year olds so they would have their own device to do their homework with, play Minecraft and video chat. Found that there are just too many things I want to do that are incompatible with the Chrome OS.First problem was getting the unit to wake up. When I first opened it, everything was fine and U took a tour if the device. I then closed the cover while leaving it plugged in to charge. When I came back and opened the cover, it would not come back on, though the power light was on. I tried shutting off, unplugging, holding power button for several seconds... Nothing.Called Samsung support, tech had me hold power button for 15 seconds. Power light finally went out, and then I was able to turn on again. Tech said it was a "sleep bug" in the Chrome OS that they were working on. A month later and I'm still having the same issue.Converting Woird docs to Google Docs was not difficult, but adds an extra step. My son was unable to log in to his purchased Minecraft account as the OS is incompatible.Wasn't able to make the Google plus video chat work so tried to set up Skype. It would not work with Chrome.Bought a new wireless printer to use with Chromebook. Did everything they said to do but I'm unable to print from Chromebook to the printer. I can print wirelessly to the printer with every other device in the house, including the iPhones and iPod touches, but not the Chromebook.Set up a 20 minute intro call with the Chromebook staff. They were only able to review the most basic things, unable to solve any of my problems.I like that everything is web-based, but it us simply too limited in so many basic things I and my kids need to do for me to recommend.
