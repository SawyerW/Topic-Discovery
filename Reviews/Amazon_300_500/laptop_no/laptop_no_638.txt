This machine was my first introduction to Windows 8. I'm still getting a feel for it. I find it curious that there's a convergence in the software-distribution model on all the major operating systems: W8, iOS, and Android.This little guy weighs almost nothing, takes up almost no space, has a great battery life, can run all the applications I've tested so far without any trouble, and its GPU can handle running an external 24" monitor. It's highly functional, highly mobile, and for less than $300, it's a fabulous deal.My only real complaints are three: (1) no bluetooth (see more at *** below); (2) only three USB ports; and (3) the fans run quite loudly even when the machine is idling and both the laptop screen and the external monitor are turned off. Nonetheless, after roughly six weeks of ownership, I remain quite pleased with my purchase. By and large, it knocks the socks off a 13.3" ASUS I bought two years ago for more than twice the price of the X401U.--EDIT, 2014.02.21: Although the GPU *can* handle most graphic loads on a dual-monitor display, such a setup seems to put the GPU pretty hard and leave it running pretty hot. I've had issues with streaming video (including here on Amazon, as well as YouTube and other sites) where the hardware buffering and processing just can't quite cut it and video displays as anywhere from slightly choppy to devolving into unwatchable, disjointed frames.Still, this is a great $300 laptop with exceptional performance for a machine in its price range. Even if it's not ideal for graphics development or hardcore gaming, it does that vast majority of what I want it to.*** The lack of bluetooth support is more of an issue (at least for me) than I'd initially found it to be or thought it would be; bluetooth devices continue to gain in popularity, the mere 3 USB slots that this machine comes with just don't cut it. Fortunately, multi-port splitters are readily available, such as Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub (about $5) and 7 Port USB Squid Hub (also about $5 as of this review date).
