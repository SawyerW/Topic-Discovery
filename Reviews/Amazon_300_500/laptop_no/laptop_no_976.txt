I purchased the Samsung Chromebook for myself as a holiday gift after my first semester of college. Prior to this device, I was taking notes in a good, old-fashioned notebook, which was fine... I guess. My note taking in class was goodish, but during second semester my note taking was phenomenal. Using Google Drive, I could organize my notes into specific class topics, as well as certain units and class dates. Not only did this benefit me, but it was much easier to email the notes that I took to other classmates who had missed class than it used to be to lend them my notebook and get it back later that week. Taking notes in Google Drive is life changing even if it were only for one thing: the search function. If I'm supposed to study about the Renaissance in Europe, and certain things about Italy are spread out across the semester, I no longer have to page through my notebook and try to find Italy in my notes. All I need to do is type "Italy" into the search bar and it automatically shows me all of my documents that have Italy in them. It's incredible for studying.Schooling aside, this computer is amazing for simply browsing the internet. I spend a lot of my time on the internet (probably more than I should,) and this computer handles everything that I need to do in everyday activity. There used to be a problem with the video playback which caused the computer to be severely bogged down while watching YouTube, but it has been resolved as far as I can tell. This is the beauty of the Chromebook, also; the updates for the device are often so that they fix problems promptly, but they are very unobtrusive. I'm looking at you, Windows. There will never be scheduled updates/restarts. When there is an update, all you need to do is restart your Chromebook whenever you feel like it, and the update is applied within about 30 seconds. No more 30+ updates before shutdown. No more waiting 5 minutes for your computer to power up. This little guy is a beast.
