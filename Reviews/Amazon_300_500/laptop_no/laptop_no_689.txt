The Macbook is the best computer I've ever had. I will never own another PC again. The first thing I realized I loved about it was the startup time. My previous PCs took up to 5-7 minutes to completely start. This computer does everything virtually instantly. I thought the transition from windows would be difficult, but it wasn't at all. The entire system is extremely easy to use. It just takes getting used to. Everything from the address book, calendar, to mail feature is easier to use than the PC versions. I can sync my calendar and to do lists to my iPod quickly and easily. That is a great feature for being as active as I am. The only thing that took serious getting used to was the Microsoft Office applications. The layout is very different. And figuring it all out took some time. The note taking ability of Word is very different though. I like it better. It can actually look like you're writing on notebook paper and flag certain areas of the notes that are important. If that is too much for you to get used to, Macs can also run windows, so it wouldn't be a problem. Another feature that fits my lifestyle perfectly is the options with photos. With my old PC I felt like I was always uploading new software with every digital camera to make it possible to upload pictures and then other software for editing pictures. It got confusing. With the Macbook, as soon as I plugged my digital camera in it starting working. I could upload pictures, edit them, and they were never saved to an area of my computer that was hard to locate later. Everything is easier on a Mac and works in the most logical way. I love it and won't ever use anything else.
