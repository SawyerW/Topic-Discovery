As a convert from PC's, I can't say enough about how wonderful Mac's are.  They work flawlessly and the customer service and technical support are exceptional.  I have literally five PC laptops, all from the same manufacturer - a well known brand.  And while I would buy another one from this manufacturer if I was to ever get another PC, there is no way I could ever do that to myself or my clients.  Why?1. Mac's boot up quickly and consistently.  I had a one year old PC laptop in great condition.  From the time I booted up the computer to the time the document loaded into my email, 7 minutes passed!  On my Mac, it's about 30 seconds, even the one that's over a year old.  No issues over time.2. Battery life - PC battery life is about 2 hours maximum. I get 3 times that and more from my Mac, even one that I've had for over a year.3. Support - got a problem, take it to the Apple Store. I had an issue with the new one.  Took it in and within 8 hours it was diagnosed, fixed, and back in my hands for free.4. Impressive - the impression people get when they see me pull out my Mac is that I mean business, I've stepped up my game, and that I can get the job done.The other day, my wife was complaining about how slow her PC was after a year of ownership.  She was trying to place an order online and couldn't.  I gave her my Mac to try; within 2 minutes, she had the order completed.  It was her computer, not the website.So, if you want a computer that is problem free, impressive, and just simply works, get a Mac.  If you don't have enough stress in your life and have plenty of time to sit and wait, then get a PC.
