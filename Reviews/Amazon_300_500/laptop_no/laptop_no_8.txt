There are some really great things about this laptop. First, the weight (or lack of it). It is light and easy to carry in a bag, which will be a relief if you are replacing a nearly 10 pound laptop like me. The old dinosaur was doing well if it got 70 minutes from a battery. The V505DX gets almost 4 HOURS for basic word processing and surfing (closer to 2 and change if you're watching a DVD).I had read the complaints and had to buy my unit sight unseen, but I am very happy. I had heard bad things about the keyboard. They are, for the most part, not true. Yes, it is a smaller keyboard. Yes, the right shift key is small, but you can get used to it by using it for a couple of hours. The screen looks good and is a 12 incher, but you get the savings in weight.You will find when you get this laptop that it comes with no discs for the OS or bundled software. This is because Sony has partitioned to the drive so that the application software is in one place if it needs to be reloaded. In theory, all your data should be on the second partition (D drive), so if anything ever happens, you can restore your machine to functionality while saving your data. I moaned about this at first, but I know see the advantages of it. What it really means is that you are not going to be able to do a clean install of XP Pro and you are not going to be able to take the partition off the drive without risking losing the ability to restore your laptop should something go wrong.You do have to create your own recovery discs (9 of them!) or order a DVD recovery disc from Sony for about 15 bucks. If you are like me and like to format your laptop as soon as you get it, you will need to know that you aren't going to be able to do this (at least easily) with this one.I do wish the warranty was longer than a year, but every other laptop I have looked at seems to have the same.Love this baby!
