Like many here, I received this laptop as part of the nVidia settlement.  While I agree it was a very poor replacement for my old laptop (mid-quality 5 years ago, but it least it was a dual core), the reviews should be about this particular PC and not our displeasure with the settlement.With that said, this is a real piece of junk, IMO.  I work on computers all day long, repairing and installing new machines.  I haven't come across a new PC this bad in years.  It is EXTREMELY slow.  I do quite a good job at eliminating unnecessary startup apps and killing most of the unnecessary visual effects that sap performance quality.  Still, this thing just drags and drags.I gave it two stars (instead of one) because of its very low price.  It is probably adequate for those who use a computer for email and a bit of web surfing.  But this machine ships with only 2GB of RAM which is barely enough for a PC with a good processor running Windows 7.  I will probably end up adding a few more GB to the RAM and that will help the performance a bit.  But if I paid for this computer, adding the RAM would make it closer to $400.  For less than $400 you can get a laptop that is FAR better than this.  I think with a bit of smart shopping you can probably score a better laptop for $300 or so.One may think speed isn't important if all one does is email and a bit of web surfing.  True to an extent.  But you still have to update it and install some programs.  You will find these simple tasks take forever to finish.  (I'm not talking about the download time.  I have a very fast cable broadband connection.)I will end up giving this (or selling it very cheaply) to a friend who has no computer.  But I will add RAM before I can even do that as I can't in good conscious give this to anyone the way it is.My advice:  Steer clear of this laptop.
