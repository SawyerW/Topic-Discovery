I bought this computer because of all the great reviews. I returned it within the first 30 days because I just wasn't impressed with this laptop at all. MAYBE it could be argued that it's worth $600 but I decided that I'd rather take that amount and put it toward a better laptop.Construction leaves a LOT to be desired. It's made out of hard plastic, maybe that's the norm these days, but I didn't find it sturdy enough to be confident that nothing would damage it easily.In all honesty, this laptop was literally NO FASTER (and in some cases slower) than my 5 year old Sony Vaio laptop. I was pretty astonished by this and had expected that technology would have improved more in the last 5 years than this. My vaio has a single core, 2.0 Ghz processor, a 100 GB hard drive (5400 rpm) and 2G RAM. I haven't done anything on either laptop other than the normal web browsing and using common programs like Microsoft office, pdfs, play music and watch dvds.I also found Windows 7 to be INCREDIBLY resource heavy and slow! I even put it in XP mode - looks and functions like XP, no frills. And still it was eating up my memory and this thing comes with 4g RAM!I honestly am not happy with Microsoft, nor was I happy with this product. I'm one of those who never saw a problem with Windows XP in the first place to necessitate an upgrade. I think everyone knows that Vista was a huge fail and really, I think the only reason why people are so excited about Windows 7 is because Vista was so bad that 7 now looks like a life saver in comparison. I'll stop my rant now.If you don't have high expectations than you might be satisfied with this computer. It was very light, I can say that about it, and it did look pretty nice with incredible battery life. But otherwise I think it'd be wiser to take your $600 and put it toward a better system. OR get a cheap 12" netbook with XP or another less resource intensive operating system like Ubuntu or another linux distribution.
