We've had our G72 for about 3 years now.***Love*** the screen, big and bright.  Batteries last "ok".  (gotta run that big a** display...)  Like the soft-clicky keyboard, which would be perfect IF the space bar didn't keep falling off!! (and we do not abuse our keyboard!) Speaking of the keyboard, bought this type model so we'd have the 10-key on the right, (I use it ALL the time.) and lots of real estate for wrists.  We don't use inboard mousepads, they're too slow for us, so we just plugged in a standard MS Optical Mouse and it's worked instantly and perfectly since day one.Seems to want to overheat a bit so we bought a stand for it, helps a little.  Can hear it 'whirring' a little loud sometimes, like a plane about to take off, which seems worrisome but nothing seems to happen.Now to software:  came preinstalled with windows 7.  Meh.  I still miss the straightforwardness of XP.  Hard to find anything, settings changed just revert back so I've given up trying to customize.  Can't even get the toolbar to stay the way I wanted it, and MS online help is no help at all. Also, have to reinstall Word/Excel/MS Office Starter pack over and over and over and over b/c it keeps getting corrupted somehow.  With all the other junk preinstalled nowdays surprised it's as fast as it is. Kept up with IE updates, but had to downgrade back to IE8 due to downloading and document issues, prob not an HP issue tho.All in all it's a good laptop for home use, but a bit pricey for what you get/issues to contend with.  I might buy another one, but at a discount. We bought ours on sale for about $500, wouldn't pay more than $300 at the very very very outside all inclusive now. Thanks.
