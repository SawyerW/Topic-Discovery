I needed a new laptop after the hard drive on my 3 year old Dell laptop crashed a few months ago. Because I am a college student, I wanted a smaller computer to carry around campus or use comfortably outside of my room. The 14'' screen is a  widescreen and is excellent for viewing pictures, videos, and movies. My old computer had a 15.5'' screen. I prefer a larger screen, but the bigger the screen, oftentimes, the heavier the laptop. This computer weighs about 5 lbs with the battery (without it, it is obviously much lighter), but it feels like it weighs much less. The keyboard is also a good size and the keys are not raised, so food, dust, and hair are less likely to get caught in the keyboard. I own this computer in black and the photos are true to real life. Orginally, I wanted this laptop in white, but decided against that because it would get dirty very quickly. The computer uses Windows 7. My old one had Vista, so I'm still getting used to Windows 7's new features. I've had this for almost a week and it is very easy to use.PROS:Screen sizeKeyboardMemory (4GB included. Very fast! I can listen to music, be on the Internet, and run other programs without the computer slowing down)Hard Drive (640GB is more than enough space for me and the overall price is great.)WeightCONS:The lid is not fingerprint proof. Even in black, fingerprints are still visble. Not a big deal to me.The mouse is a little unrespnsive at times and the touchpad isn't very smooth. Not a deal breaker, however.No recovery software included.*Make sure to backup your files often on an external hard drive or CDs and make a recovery disc (instructions are provided). The computer does not have any discs containing the OS software or recovery information. *
