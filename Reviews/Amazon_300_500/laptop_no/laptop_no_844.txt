I got this laptop from a friend that came to me from his workplace, I have upgraded to 8GB of RAM and a 240GB Intel SATA III SSD. After that this laptop became magic. I render fractals in Apophysis, songs in Fruity Loops Studio, and videos in Microsoft Movie Maker and can multitask between rendering fractals and a song OR a video and running flash and other processes. I don't have any hiccups in performance and I leave almost everything open. I use two browsers with multiple tabs open. This laptop's processor kicks butt!!!! It doesn't even overheat on a hot day while using it with load.I had to buy a brick for this one, because it was missing. It wasn't the original laptop's brick I bought, but a generic one from the local store. It supports 85Ws. It uses quite a bit under that and this usage and the awesomeness of the processor plus the upgrades makes it desirable over a desktop computer, because of it's size and low wattage usage. I'm really surprised!The downside is the graphics, I can not play Morrowind TES III more than with just bare minimum graphics. I had to wait for minecraft to update in order to play it with medium graphics.I had an issue with the drivers for my wireless and wired. I can not use my wired at all! When my wireless adapter knocked loose, I could use my wired again, but as soon as I put it back in, the wired stops working.I also wish it had SDHC support!Overall, the processor, the wattage usage, and in addition to the upgrades, this laptop is great for everything necessary to compute other than gaming. I use my laptop on a TV table and an office chair, but when I have more space in my room, I'm going to hook up my TV to it which I did before and enjoy having a second screen.Enjoy!
