I purchased this laptop from Best Buy in early February for a great price and have not had a single problem with the computer at all. I mostly use this for schoolwork, which means PowerPoint, Word, Internet research and the occasional internet surfing here and there, so I may not be the ideal reviewer for this product under those looking for a gaming computer or something that needs to be blisteringly fast. But given the simple tasks I ask of it, it has performed much better than I could have anticipated.Pros:- Runs very cool and quiet (not even warm on my lap)- Power management settings, when tuned properly, have allowed me to work 5.5 hours continuous on a full charge- Smooth keyboard - I love to type on this computer. Its quiet and it glides as I type.- Nice widescreen- Fingerprint security is neat, and there is a security program to password protect the computer from any USB device plugged in. There is also a face recognition security program (have not used). All of these make this machine ideal for those concerned over privacy or those who live with immature imbeciles that think its funny to mess with someones computer :)- Charger folds up nice and tight for easy transport (compared to computers of similar size)- 4 USB ports, HDMI and eSATA ports- Full 10 digit numerical keypad on keyboard for faster number inputCons:- Edge on front of computer is not smooth and digs into my palms when surfing the internet, but not an issue when typing or the computer is on my lap (only happens when it is on my desk)- The full 10 digit numerical keyboard cramps the keyboard just a bit. This also pushed the touchpad left of center, so to use the keyboard and touchpad comfortably it means you are about 2 - 2.5 inches left of center. For some this may be annoying or hard to get used to, but since I rarely sit directly centered in front of my TV it was easy to adjust to.Overall the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I significantly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable laptop for business/school use.
