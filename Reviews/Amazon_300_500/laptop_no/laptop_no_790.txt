I have had this notebook about two weeks. I would rate it at 90%.Greats:It's light! I had a 9 lb laptop that this replaced. It's so light I'm always checking my back to make sure I put it in there.Battery Life! I've not run it fully dry, but I have run for 7 hours and still had 15% or so left. I figure this puts it in the 8.5-10 hour range when running in saver mode with wifi on.Color! I got the silver version and it looks great. It also hides the fingerprints so common on the glossy black versions.sGoods:Screen - Remember, I'm coming from a two year old laptop with LCD, but I think this screen looks much better than my old one. I was worried after some of the reviews, but I after playing with this I think it's great. I just wish all the laptop companies wouldn't make everything glossy!Video Card - My old laptop had a GTS 9700 go in it, so this one isn't in that range, but it's good enough to do my Solidworks and play some Starcraft II on, so overall, I'm satisfied. I would not trade battery life for more power. I think this is the perfect balance.Bad:The only complaint I have is about the keyboard. I love the chicklet keys, but my unit seems to have "loose" keys on the left side. The Tab, Caps Lock, and Left Shift keys don't feel the same as the rest and they give off a high pitched "rattle" when I type. This machine is dead silent, so it gets on my nerves. I did some looking and I'm not the only person who had experienced it. I'm waiting another week to see if using it works it out or not. Then I'll probably look into the backlit aftermarket Keyboards that are out there. I would have given it 5 stars if this annoying problem wasn't there. It's a shame that everything is so close to perfection and then something stupid like a couple keys on a keyboard messes it up.Overall, I would buy it again, but I would probably do it in the store where I could try to keys out first.
