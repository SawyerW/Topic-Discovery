Apple always knew the way of maximizing profit: 2010 model were a step up but drawn back on the CPU, 2011 model had a huge step up on CPU, but drawn back on its graphic.2010 model overview: 2.4ghz Core 2 duo, gt320m2011 model overview: 2.3ghz Core i5, Intel HD3200The graphic card went from a discrete graphic card to a on board graphic, which is a huge let down for me, as a fan.All the new thunderbolt technology is a step up, but think about this. USB 3 or Thunderbolt, I'd say USB 3 will be more popular and more useful. Another let down is the limited connectivity of Thunderbolt.Verdict:If you are using this for school, word, internet surfing, general school work. Go for it.If you are using this for designing, I'd say you get the 15" or above since the graphic card boost in PS and other designing software really do take effect.If you are using this to show off, GO FOR IT! You will receive envious looks when you take it out.If you are using this to Game, save your money and get a gaming laptop, not thisIf you are using this for music, save your money for HP Envy Beats(although it is recently sold out, but you can get it on ebay). Envy Beats is almost like a MBP copy, its got the feel to it. And the Black-and-Red design grants it a new style. The CPU, graphic, and sound is more well balanced on it.PS: Yes, I did buy this. The OSX is very well optimised, it is much better than Windows, but there is too many program that I use that does not support OSX, which compels me to dual boot with boot camp.Side notes: Look into the program called "Crossover". It virtually emulate windows for certain programs to work.
