My last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad so this laptop is gargantuan in comparison and I'm still getting used to the new size and extra weight.  Notwithstanding, I am really loving this new computer environment.  Beautiful desktop themes that change the background now and then, enough to keep interesting but not too much to be distracting.  I had already purchased MS Word so I could just download it onto this new laptop.  I'm disappointed that MS Word is no longer included with computers but that's been the case with every new computer I've bought in the last 6 years.Not sure what the deal is yet with some connectivity issues.  I have an external wireless device which I am now using for connectivity because the laptop won't let me connect to some local networks I could connect to on the other laptop.  Don't quite understand this and the troubleshooting application has not resolved this or lent much guidance into the problem.  Have not called customer service yet.I do love the large, clean screen with sharp definition.  Now I am finally able to just click on video links and watch them whereas I couldn't on my other machines because they would constantly be buffering.  You can really enjoy the screen quality on such applications as Google Earth.Also I love the large screen area when using MS Word; I can really zoom in or out of the document as much as I want and get different perspectives on my work.  There's a lot of cool games included too.This laptop, in the 2 days that I've had it, runs with the speed I am used to from my office experience and I really feel I can work professionally.  Seems to have everything I need.  Other people have mentioned this laptop is not the best for gaming but I'm not interested in gaming, just documents, internet use and music.  Works great for everything I need so far, including all my go-to programs.
