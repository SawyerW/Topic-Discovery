I had never considered buying a Mac because of the high price. However, after having several other Apple devices over the years and enjoying the lack of errors and problems with the devices and the OS's, I gave it more consideration as I approached buying my very first laptop (after having over 20 years experience on desktop PC's).  I saved about $300 buying it on Amazon rather than elsewhere (no sales tax, big discount and $3.99 overnight shipping with Prime). The machine is brand new and it came installed with the Mountain Lion OS.The screen is excellent, it boots up fast. USB 3.0 is very fast. The trackpad works far better than I had anticipated. The gestures are amazing. The OS is very different than Windows, but is not hard to navigate. I store my regular 'Work in Process' documents on Dropbox, so those were a cinch to pull over. I still have to migrate my pictures and music to the machine. All of my bookmarks in Safari that I created over the years on the iPad pulled over seamlessly. The integration with my other Apple products via iCloud is outstanding.Everything from the box, the instructions, initial setup, downloading and installing software, the navigation of the OS....it all has a consistent and polished look.  Before i bought this I felt like I was getting the 'low end' laptop from Apple. After using it for a few days I am in awe of the performance and design. The screen is the perfect size and everything pops on it. It is very thin and quiet! I haven't heard a fan yet. This is money well spent. Thanks!Update 1: I upgraded my RAM to 8 gigs and this laptop is blazing fast!!! I can't believe it had the impact that it does. If this machine continued to run just like it does now, I won't need to upgrade for years to come. I used the Crucial brand and recommended specs so I don't screw with the warranty.
