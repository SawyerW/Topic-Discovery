I'll keep it short. I've owned this thing for about 1.5 years now and it's simply the best thing I've spent money on in that time.Coming from a traditional netbook with an Intel Atom processor, I thought the SU7300 Intel processor would be a bottleneck. It's not a problem AT ALL. For most tasks, this laptop is faster than my desktop running a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 5200. The only thing my desktop beats it in is doing large video transcoding. Fortunately I don't do that often.Linux support:I'm an Ubuntu user, and at first Linux support seemed problematic, but after making a few minor adjustments to the config files I have everything working perfectly except for the NVidia 210 card. This has not been a problem for me since I'm not a gamer. The Intel video card is stunning. It's snappy 2d and 3d performance with full desktop effects in Ubuntu surprised me. I kinda wish I would have bought the version of this without the NVidia card since I never use it.Battery Life:The #1 best thing about this laptop is that I regularly take this thing to work and never have to worry about bringing the power adapter! I literally can use this thing for web-browsing and writing software all day and leave work with thirty-minutes or an hour of battery left (assuming I put it to sleep while I'm at lunch). I will never buy another laptop that can't do 9+ hours like this can.Keyboard:I've gotta give props to the guys who designed this. The arrow keys are in just the right spot, the home/end/pgup/pgdn buttons are in the right spot, and the size and spacing of the keys makes this thing a pleasure to type on. The only minor issue I have is that I wish it had a backlight for low-light conditions.Summary:It's a bit pricey, but I have absolutely no regrets. I'd consider this the best laptop I've ever seen.
