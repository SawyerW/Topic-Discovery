This little netbook computer meets almost all of my wife's computing needs: it is light, small, has almost a full-size keyboard, a decently sized hard drive, a readable screen, and performs as advertised. The Wi-Fi adapter connects easily with our Verizon mobile hot spot for good, reliable, and consistent wireless connections. The biggest negative is that it comes with only the bare minimum memory -- 1GB -- needed to run the Windows 7 Starter edition pre-loaded on the computer. To make it more functionally usable, we upgraded the memory chip from 1GB to 2GB, which is the most memory the computer will take. To do that, we had to remove the keyboard -- aaargh. We also upgraded, online, from the Windows 7 Starter edition to the Windows 7 Ultimate edition. With the upgrade to 2GB memory, and to the do-everything Windows 7 Ultimate edition -- which includes multilingual capability -- we can write, send and receive e-mails in Japanese, and run other programs simultaneously. It is still considerably slower than larger laptops, however. To partially offset that, we loaded a 2GB SD card to give it ReadyBoost capability; doing that lets the computer use the additional flash memory the same as an additional memory chip. So, with a relatively cheap upgrade in memory and with a reasonably cheap upgrade to the Ultimate edition, the machine performs quite well for Web browsing, e-mailing, and use of Excel. It does not have a DVD/CD player, however. That may be overcome by using an add-on, plug-in third party USB drive. We have not yet had to use that capability, as we have downloaded all needed upgrades. Thus, in summation, we can recommend this computer if your needs do not include steaming video or significant graphics use. And, the price is right: you should be able to find this computer online for about $260 or so. That's it for us.
