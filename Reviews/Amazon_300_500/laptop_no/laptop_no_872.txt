This is a great laptop first of all. The trackpad and battery are such great conveniences especially since I'm using mine for college. It looks great, runs great, and EXCELLENT customer service from Apple.Alright I've spent 30 minutes trying to think of other things that I like about this laptop. Now here's the thing, it's probably just me, but I don't see anything that makes this laptop better than a PC. My main reason of getting this laptop was to see how great it was, since everyone was talking about it, and recommending it to me. I've had it for 4 months now, and I have no clear idea of how it could beat a laptop that's half its price. I love playing Starcraft 2, but I have to run it on the lowest settings, while my PC with the same specifications can run it on high. So either right now, there's nothing different, or I'm not utilizing my Macbook Pro to its fullest potential. If I am, someone please comment so I could get a better experience with this.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great laptop, and I love the thing, but I do regret switching. I swear I'm not a troll looking to start a PC vs Mac war, I just want to state my opinions, and hopefully someone tells me whether I'm wrong or right with a reason why.EDIT: Let's make this clear, I didn't buy this laptop for gaming. I bought it mainly based on recommendations, battery life, and durability.Thanks Nathan and Geib, I just ordered the 8 GB RAM, and it should be here soon. I don't think I would've searched for them since, I didn't think they'd be that cheap (well... not cheap, but a low price compared to what I was thinking haha).As for viruses, I never got them with my PC, but it's nice to know that it's not just luck that I'm not getting them lol.
