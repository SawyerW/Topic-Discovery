I've had this computer for about a year now, so I can offer a review here without the bias of that initial haze of excitement.Pros:-The technical specs are good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've been able to run everything I've wanted to run smoothly except GTAIV (but performance-wise, that game is broken anyways), including WoW, The Sims 3, Civilization V, and the Total War series, all on high settings. Light modeling and Photoshop also ran with no issues.I've listed a lot more cons than pros, but keep in mind that the pro is an important one.Cons:-If you use this computer on your lap, it runs uncomfortably hot. I mean it.-The power cord comes off very easily. Moving it around almost ensures that it will fall out. Again, if you use this on your lap, I guarantee it's going to go unplugged unnoticed at least once.-Gets dirty easily.-The screen seems to make contact with the keyboard when the lid closes, so the grime from the keyboard occasionally gets on the screen.-Not recommended if you are the sweaty palm type. Heat + prone to grime + sweaty palms = very, very bad. I'm constantly cleaning the area to the left of the touchpad where my palm rests because it's constantly gross. I never had such an issue with my other laptops.-Too big to frequently carry around (I'm a college student). I had to offset this by purchasing a netbook.As neither a pro or a con, it makes a moderate amount of noise. It does get noticeable while gaming.In the end, I'd recommend this computer if you're only in it for the specs and the price. As for me, I wish I would have looked more into other factors, like size, heat, and comfort before making my purchase. It runs everything I need to, but it's uncomfortably large, hot, and dirty. Take this as you will; it would probably be fine if it just sat on a desk.
