I really love this computer despite the facts that it has some issues. I really like the finish, it's very thin, less than 1 inch, but by no means is thinner than the macbook air. The casing is very sexy, it looks very nice from all angles. The keyboard is amazing, the only problem is that it has a little flex but its not the end of the world I can type pretty well. The most annoying thing might be the touchpad, whenever you type and you have your hands positioned close to it, the touchpad might register some click while you type. A lot of people are talking about the battery life of this computer that it won't even reach 10 hours, I can confirm I get 11+ hours on this lappie, Windows 7 is much more energy efficient than Vista (note: I tested under wireless off, lowest screen brightness, power saving mode, word 2007).  I really enjoy the price point its less than $700, which is the perfect price for the performance.PROS: - Stylish, very sexy looking. - Keyboard feels amazing. - Multi-touch track pad works well - Fast compared to a netbook (C2D, 4GB DDR3) - Battery life 11+ hours - Smart Logon, very nice cool feature - Big hard drive 500GB - LED screen has nice viewing angles - Very light and portable - The charger is very small and portable too. - Loud quality speakers from small size - Warranty, 1 Year of accidental Damage - Price its a deal!CONS: - Fingerprint magnet (inside and outside) - Loud Hard drive (a little annoying) - Little flex on the keyboard - ASUS bloatware - Intel GMA4500MHD, where's the UL30A-VT? can't do gaming - It doesn't cook, do laundry, or cleans my room.This computer is perfect for students, and travelers.
