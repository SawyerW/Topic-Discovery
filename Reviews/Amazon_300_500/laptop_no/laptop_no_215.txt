Like several others, I picked up this computer at Best Buy for considerably less (they now are selling a newer model with a slightly bigger hard drive). At that price ($699) it is hands down the best value for an ultraportable out there. And it has an optical drive - which, if you've ever been in the market for an ultraportable, you know is quite hard to come by and especially in this price range. I was completely astounded to find out that this laptop had one - I was considering buying it because of its small size and weight even before that (really, this thing weighs the same as my 10 inch netbook). If you want anything comparable you are going to have to spend hundreds more.I've had it for three weeks and it's performed well for everything I need it to do - bit of photo editing, skype video, browsing, etc. Runs Windows 7 like a pro. It does heat up on the lefthand side under moderate to heavy use but nothing outside the norm. The fan is noisyish sometimes although I think what people might be noticing more than anything is that it's always on on its lowest setting. In fact the fan was what died in my last portege (I had the tablet a few years back) so I'm crossing my fingers - but I have no indication that there's any problem with it, it just runs at an audible level.The keyboard takes some getting used to and slightly more pressure than others, but seems very sturdy. Battery life is great - I'm getting over 6 hours with the wireless on, browsing, word processing, bit of video so obviously more if you use it more conservatively. All in all, it would be worth putting up with some real faults for the price point, low weight, optical drive, and attractive finish but I really haven't found any. If it holds up it will be one of the best purchases I've ever made.
