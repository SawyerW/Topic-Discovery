This laptop is really nice.  For the price I would recommend this as the very best laptop for your money and here is why.+It has the most modern SSD (released in Q1 of 2013) that runs 40% faster than Gen 1 SSDs.  The drive and laptop in general is amazingly fast.+It has the just released new wifi protocols which will future proof the laptop for some time.  The wifi on it is amazingly fast and out performs all other wifi devices using the some internet source that ive tested.+It has the legendary apple keyboard and track pad which are the best I've ever seen on any laptop regardless of price.  The track pad especially is amazing... if you've never used an apple track pad you have no idea what your missing, it literally controls almost every function on your computer except for typing and it's very intuitive and easy to use.+It has the newest integrated intel HD graphics (5000) which are faster, better and use less power than any other laptop.  Very few other laptop options have the HD5000 graphics chip.+It has Haswell processor.  It is very fast and very efficient.+It has 12 hour battery life (continuous use).  Its battery is nothing short of amazing.  I used the laptop off and on as I would normally use it and it took 5 days for the battery to die.-Screen is mediocre.  It doesn't reflect too much light though which is good and it performs well enough (but it's nowhere close to the retina display).-Quality control is lacking.  Numerous negative reviews on the laptop refer to specific manufacturing defects (wifi, laptop body defects, ETC).  If you get a good one, you're good, but you might not be able to notice a defect until the return period has passed.If you're on the edge, this is the laptop to buy if you want a light, portable machine that is fairly high powered.  If price is not a concern I would wait for the Q3/Q4 2013 MacBook Pro as that will likely be a nicer, more powerful machine with retina display and the same great features found on the air.
