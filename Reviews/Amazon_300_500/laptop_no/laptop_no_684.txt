Here's what I do with my laptop: I take it into Walt Disney World and write articles and reviews of attractions, restaurants and the like for a travel guide. I do much the same thing down here on Sanibel Island, where for another book I take my computer with me in my pickup, or on my bicycle, to dig up such details as beach parking lot spaces and hiking trail finds.As you can guess, I need good battery performance. And it's for that reason alone that I waited for this new-for-spring MacBook model, and the reason I'm so happy with it. For the most part I only use Pages, so I'm not much of a power pig, but this is the first laptop I've ever had that makes it all day in the field on one charge. Don't get me wrong, I'm not typing that whole time by any means, but I often leave my MacBook on as I walk around Disney or drive from one beach to another, often open it up to type in a paragraph or two, and usually get in a couple of solid hour-long writing blocks each day.From what I've read, the better battery performance comes from the brand-new Penryn processor these new MacBooks incorporate. I can't comment on that, as except for being able to install memory I'm not too knowledgeable about stuff under the hood. But I did test out the old 2.0 GHz model against this one at an Apple store, and I can tell a slight difference in speed. Visually this MacBook is identical to its immediate predecessor, model MB061LL/B.I chose this entry-level 2.1 GHz model (with simply the 1 GB of RAM) because, like I said, I really only use Pages, with an occasional Numbers spreadsheet or video-free Keynote presentation here and there. My 2004 iBook has been great except for its battery life; now there's nothing not to love. (My Apple store rep agreed with my choice. He thought the other new MacBooks, all of which come with SuperDrives, are worth the extra cash only for those who burn DVDs.)For what it's worth I've been a Mac addict since 1984. Over the years I've used 18 Macintosh models.
