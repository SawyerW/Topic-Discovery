I initially gave this product a great review, and also purchased the 13 inch laptop model in my enthusiasm.  but, five months later, I retract that.  I initially said dell tech support was top notch.  However, I did not expect to be calling them for months and months, and specifically, on both laptops the touch pad is defective.  It intermittently freezes.  I looked online and saw that this was a common problem.  Dell Tech goes through a series of very time consuming steps with the customer, involving updating the drivers, diagnosing the hardware etc and the problem is possibly temporarily fixed, it's hard to know, as it is intermittently malfunctioning to begin with.  However, at the end of the day, or many days, the answer is that depending on the tech you reach the options are to either send the computer back for Dell to re-install windows, which I am told by my IT department at my major university, is completely off-track (pun intended) or to send it back to them for them to replace the touchpad.  While the 2nd option seems fair, it really is not.  First of all, as there are so many inspirons with defective touchpads, odds are very good that the new touchpad will be no better than the original.  Secondly, this is 10 days with your computer away, and all your personal info having had to be backed up and erased and then reinstalled.  Third, by purchasing a mouse which is what I ended up doing, the problem is solved.  However, I should not have had to purchase a mouse, one of the points of a laptop is the touchpad.  I think if Dell has a known issue, such as defective touchpads, they should make life simpler for the customer by owning up to it, and figuring out what is wrong with their touchpads, fixing them, and then do a recall, or at the very least, mail out the new touchpads and allow 3rd party installation to be reimbursed by Dell.
