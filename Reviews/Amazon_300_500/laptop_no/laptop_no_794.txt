I picked this laptop up last night. It was the only high end brand I could find with HDMI and blu-ray under $800 that had good processing ability along with other specific features I wanted... and I looked... and looked... and looked... The white keys and bright display are helpful if you occasionally use your laptop in the dark (though having a back lit keyboard would have been a nice bonus). Compared to all prior, dark cased laptops, I can finally see the keys clearly. Ive had a Vaio in the past and it's build quality was excellent. I once again can say that it feels like a solid laptop and I am going to be quite happy with it. This laptop's design is straight forward and relies highly on the function keys. Advanced users might appreciate the simplicity and straight forwardness of this laptop more than the average or novice who may need things more specifically laid out (or if you are a big fan of buttons).It features a boot to internet button to quickly bypass its already speedy Windows 7 boot process.Blu-Ray looks great. The only disappointment ive had with it is the speakers, but I havent had enough opportunity to truly judge them yet. I put in a blu-ray movie last night and it was so quiet at full volume I had trouble hearing it. Granted, normal Windows volume had a decent projection so I probably just need to check a few things out that I havent gotten around to yet.The HDMI port along with the Blu-Ray allows me to connect it to my TV and gives me the option of removing the entertainment desktop I have next to my tv.Would I buy it again? Definitely.Side note: I love Amazon, but I found it for $730 in store. Sorry Amazon but you were a little too expensive this time around!
