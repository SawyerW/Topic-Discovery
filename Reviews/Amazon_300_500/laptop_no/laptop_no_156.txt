Great laptop for the money. My only complaint is the flush keyboard. Still trying to get used to it. Have been using my desktop keyboard with backlit keys. Wish Gateway could have done that. Love the bright screen and the massive 17.3 size. Great for these eyes of mine. I'm typing on the Gateway keyboard but I have to have good lighting so my fingers don't get in the wrong position. Damn!!!  Lots of great features. Bought an HDM connection for my TV and watched "Twilight Zone" from Media Center. Very sharp image on my Sony Bravia 32" screen. Oh, another complaint...the volume is not very high on this laptop. Any suggestions on how to increase volume would be greatly appreciated. I've tried adjusting the settings but it's still not as loud as I'd like.I'm on my 4th day of my 14 day limit from BB. Don't want to pay the restocking fee. Almost bought the Toshiba that was also $599 with same specs but it didn't have the gesture feature which I love. I'm still loving this little unit. By reducing resolution and brightness I can get over 4 hrs of battery life.Update: Have now had this wonderful laptop for 14 days. Actually went back to BB to see about upgrading to another laptop with an easier to use keyboard. Looked at the HP and Toshiba but they were $150 - $200 more for same specs. Wondered over to the Mac area and asked about the Mac Keyboard. The rep said it's compatible so spent $50 and now have a terrific, lightweight Mac Keyboard that connects via USB. I place it right over the Gateway keyboard and it doesn't uptruct or affect the Gateway keyboard at all. Love this Mac keyboard, very lightweight and easy to type on. Hope this laptop lasts a awhile. So far am very happy.Try the Mac keyboard if you really can't get used to the flush keyboard on the Gateway.
