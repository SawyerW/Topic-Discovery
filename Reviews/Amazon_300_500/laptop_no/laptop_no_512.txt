I bought this product on Black Friday at Best Buy for $499.99. I am glad that I didn't pay the price listed. Overall the computer is great, but there are a few things that bother me. It's a Windows 8 computer, and sometimes when I drag my finger across the touch pad, it sends me back to the previous app that I had open off of the main screen. I can easily get back to what I was doing but it shouldn't happen to begin with. Physically, the black surrounding the screen pops when I move it (like when I am adjusting the screen forward and backwards, I don't just randomly squeeze my computer).The computer is very fast and it's taken a little bit to get used to since I am going from a Windows 7 to a Windows 8. I haven't figured out how to put Microsoft on the desktop (or any icon on to the desktop) but I am sure I will figure that out sooner or later. The sound on this is great (especially compared to my old Acer computer) and I find myself only having it halfway and it's still a little loud for my taste! I didn't have any trouble setting up wireless or Microsoft Defender (the Windows 8 version of Microsoft Essentials) but Norton did get in the way from setting it up at first. There are a lot of available apps that you can put on the front screen, a lot of them being free!!I found it strange that all of the function keys are opposite from what I am used to; for example: before I would press F5 and the page would refresh, but now I have to press FN F5 for it to refresh and the other function (the backlit keyboard on and off) is the first function. I hope that makes sense!The keyboard is easy to type on, and the letters aren't having any problem with sticking. They are soft in a way and it's very comfortable.I set up my computer so that when I unlock it, I have to swipe my finger on the scanner and I haven't had any problems with that either. It's kind of fun having such a personal computer!I would suggest this product for someone else.
