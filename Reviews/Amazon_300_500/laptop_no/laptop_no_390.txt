I was so against going Apple. Years and Years I said, I am not caving in. Wow... I couldn't resist the great price and the 30-day Amazon return policy. After all of our unreliable/expensive Microsoft laptops failing and getting virus after virus, I gave up (even after purchasing the best "virus protector" out there). After reading the reviews on here and lots of research, I decided to take the plunge. All I can say is WOW! You will not be disappointed! I am continually impressed. I was surprised how user friendly the MacBook Pro really is. We have had our MacBook Pro for about a month now, zero complaints! The new MacBook Pro's don't have the DVD/CD player and we really wanted to have that so bought the "old version". I read some reviews that they received used laptops and that gave me a slight hesitation, however, we definitely received a Brand New MacBook Pro! The only Apple products we had before this is my husbands old iPod and an iPad2. We are already looking at switching to iPhones in the near future! Really couldn't be happier with our purchase.-------------------------UPDATE!! April 2014-------------------------We still absolutely believe this has been the best decision to buy Mac! We, as mentioned above, have both switched to iPhone 5s just because we've been so happy with computer. I still cannot believe I am writing this. Thought I'd never leave Windows operating system. So glad we did. Zero problems with new computer while my parents bought new MS and are in process off uninstalling and re installing programs due to some malfunctions. Boy, do I remember the frustrations of that. And I am reminded, now I am not wasting hours of my time doing that with a Mac. Still smooth working, works when you need it too. I mainly use it for internet searching, bill paying, shopping etc. while my husband uses Pages and light internet usage. I am so happy! Make the change over, you won't regret it :)
