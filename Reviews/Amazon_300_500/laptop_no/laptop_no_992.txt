I have read the other reviews and the product reviews on other sites.  I don't think they understand the Chromebook.The Samsung Chromebook is a great little computer.  It is lightweight, and it is tough.  The Chrome OS currently does everything I want.  If you have good Internet access, it leverages that into remarkable capabilities and blazing speed.  When you don't have Internet access, it behaves like any old dull computer.  It still does word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations and stores them locally.  There is no disk drive to fragment or to fail.Because the Chrome OS really lives on the Web, it is automatically updated without intervention from you.  It is invulnerable to viruses.  So you do not need to have antivirus software slowing you down and emptying your wallet.  It automatically saves all documents as you work.  You cannot fail to save something.  Software updates, both OS and applications, are free and automatic.It is not going to run your Windows or MacOS or Linux software.  So if you run your business on your computer, the Chromebook may not be a good match.  If you live on the Internet, like me, it is perfect.  It costs half as much as an Ipad, and it has a real keyboard.  It boots from "power off" to log in in six seconds and to operational in four more.  The case is plastic.  (I do not remember the last laptop I had that had a metal case, but I am not a Mac guy.)  I dropped it on my hardwood floor, and it bounced pretty well.  No harm, no foul.(As a side note, I am a PhD who teaches Information Systems and Software Engineering at a major university.  I have owned computers since the Apple II and portables since the IBM Portable (haha) PC.  Now I still have a Windows PC that runs my weather station at home, and one at the university that sits lonely on my desk.  I love my Chromebook.)
