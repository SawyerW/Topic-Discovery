Since your looking at this, can I assume that you have already decided that greater portability is more important to you then performance? Good so I don't have to get into that, so lets start by comparing the different 13" Macs available.Lets start by comparing it to its slightly better equipped sibling, the other 13" option. Packing a better CPU and added hard drive space are the only thing that separates the two models. Now does the 2.66GHZ and 70GB justify the $300 price increase. A 500GB laptop hard drive can be purchased for around $60 Seagate Momentus 5400 500GB 5400RPM SATA 3Gb/s 8MB Cache 2.5 Inch Internal NB Hard Drive ST9500325AS-Bare Drive (that hard drive has been reported to outperform similar size 7200RPM models). An extra 266MHZ for $300....no thanks.Now its albino step brother, the MacBook. Lacking 2GB of RAM, Firewire port and SD card slot. Dressed in a polycarbonate unibody opposed to aluminum, the MacBook is ever so slightly bigger. Weighing in at 0.2LBS more and 0.13" thicker then the Pro but weighing $200 less on the wallet, the MacBook is a contender. Now considering the extra 2GB for the MacBook can be added by apple for around $100 at time of purchase and the 4GB can also be bought for $200 after purchasing (cheaper alternatives do exist but those are the apple recommended RAM). I personally think the added RAM, ports, and aluminum case are a great package deal at $200.Last of the 13" is its anorexic cousin, the MacBook Air. Now the Pro is not MacBook Air light (1.5 pounds difference) or thin (0.19" thicker), but its still not heavy enough to be even a slight burden when lugging it around. Factor in the significant performance you gain (1.86GHZ vs 2.4GHZ, 2GB more ram, 130GB more space and better video card) along with the $350 less then the air the pro is easily the winner. Not to mention the 5 hour increase in battery life and DVD drive. Do keep in mind that the Air is due for an upgrade soon.I'm not going to talk about how it runs because after all it is a Mac. Saying that its runs fast goes without saying. My biggest concern for laptops has always been heat. Heat and electronics get along like Apple and Adobe...not good and with reports that bigger I-7 models can get hot enough to boil water, the 13" runs surprisingly and refreshingly cool. Even comparing it to my 3 year old 15" MacBook Pro their is a massive difference in temperature. I can leave it on my lap or bed and I can not believe that its not hot. The Battery is also amazing, its seems to last forever. This is a great example of what a laptop should be.
