For me, the Taichi is a glimpse into the future, but, alas, that future has not quite arrived. I very much wanted this to replace both my laptop (a very nice Toshiba Portege) and my iPad. I do most things on my laptop, but I love to read and relax with a tablet like the iPad.I really wanted this tablet to work for me, and I was willing to sacrifice some comforts I had been accustomed to in order to make this work; however, in the end, the battery life is just way too short. It's not quite 2 hours, and I have tweaked with not running WiFi (of course, what's the point?), putting on the lowest power usage profile, and turning the brightness down as much as I can bear. It still burns through a full charge in 2 hours or less.In fact, I have been on a flight and witnessed the battery indicator (unbeknownst to me at the time) erroneously become stuck at 60-something percent. Without warning, the tablet shut off. I didn't lose any data, but the point is that 3 hours is a bare minimum for any respectable portable to offer, especially if the relevant device is a touch screen tablet.The pluses are how beautiful the display is. Colors are brilliant and crisp. The stylus is about as close to using real pen and paper that I have used on a tablet. Just playing the simple card games that come loaded with Windows 8 is enjoyable because it feels so real to me. I haven't cared to play Solitaire in years, but, suddenly, it was a newly rediscovered old friend.There are some very positive reviews, and I cannot disagree with what they say, but, again, the battery life is well short of where it needs to be; consequently, I feel a 3 is the highest score I can give. Otherwise, it would be a 5.I am back on my Portege, which tends to spoil me with up to 5 hours of battery life.So, if you can work tethered to power most of the time, this could be the right tablet for you.
