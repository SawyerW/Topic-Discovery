**** I just bought this same laptop at Best Buy for $279!! ****Ok now that I got the price difference at Best Buy out of the way I LOVE this laptop!! It's great and you can't beat the price ( at Best Buy anyway!)I didn't love Windows 8 right away but I'm comfortable with it in less than 24 hours. It's pretty easy to figure out and you can easily switch back to the desktop you're used to.Set up is incredibly simple. It prompts you all the way so there is no guessing. It found my wifi signal and I didn't even need to connect it to the modem, or spend any time digging out the cord I haven't used in years! It also found my printer without connecting it or putting in the disk. I just got the laptop close to the printer and the prompts popped right up.I'm not completely tech incapable but I'm no tech genius either so this was great for me.I'm not a gamer so I cant say if this laptop would work for that. However, if you just want to do the basics like surf the web, check email, type word docs, etc this is a fantastic laptop.It powers up really fast, much MUCH faster than my old laptop. Customization is simple and fun.The screen is huge and the laptop itself is thin. I like that you can add your favorite apps to the start screen. I already have Pinterest, Amazon and eBay up there!The only things I'm not 100% thrilled with are there is no scroll feature on the touch pad, there is no light on the power button and the keyboard is not backlit. All in all those are small things and considering after taxes this cost me under $300 I'm incredibly happy with my purchase!!
