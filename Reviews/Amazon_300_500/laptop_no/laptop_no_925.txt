Ok, an Update...It's 8/30/13... I just got another RMA from ASUS to send back the TAICHI 21 with yet another failure.  This time another battery failure -- out of the blue.  I had begun to just shut down the unit after use due to uncertainty about the battery life and use.  Well, last Tuesday I shut it down with at least 90% battery power remaining.  Wednesday, it wont boot or charge... AGAIN!?.  Looks like another defective battery. This will be event #5.  I keep it only because it FAILED after the 30 day warranty and I've sunk over $1500 in it.  What a worthless p***** *f s***!Overjoyed when I got it back in Feburary.  That joy was short lived when I sent it in for repair when it wouldn't re-charge after less than one month.  Defective battery.  RMA #2 less than a month later - wont charge.  I sent it in, got it back TWO WEEKS LATER, dead tablet display -- not the same problem I sent it in for... broken during repair, also, defective charger (RMA cause).  I talked to ASUS support, who after about 20 min of unsuccessful driver installations, etc., recommended that I "refresh" it -- which in geek speak means wipe it to factory settings. This so that he may determine if the problem was software or hardware -- at which point I would need to RMA it ONE MORE TIME.  Now the This machine does not have a DVD drive... some software requires personal interaction with the vendor and a long time to port data images.  Yet I would have to wipe it to satisfy a troubleshooting step???VERY POOR ..My son had one and has had power supply problems with it as well. That's two for two!Dont buy this thing... it looks good, but is a brick headache...
