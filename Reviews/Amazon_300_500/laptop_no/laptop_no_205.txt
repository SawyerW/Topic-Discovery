I wanted a laptop that was extremely portable with a reliable battery, and this laptop is that. It's also pretty darn powerful, I don't run games or anything, but I'm sure it would work fine. The bluetooth has a good range and the wifi as well. The HP fingerprint reader is very responsive, the screen is nice and crisp. Windows 7 is really great too, I'm coming from XP, never wanted anything to do with vista. I prefer 7 to XP honestly, which surprised me, I've been pretty hardcore for a long time. Using the internet and typing word documents while using bluetooth headphones and wifi, the battery will give me 4-5 hours of life. If you adjust the power settings you could probably get a little bit more. The bottom is plastic but the top and inside are aluminum and the etching doesn't look too bad in person either. The built-in speakers are okay, not great but that's the usual I think. The keyboard is easy to type on, I'm coming from a Microsoft 4000 ergo-keyboard, so it's different but it's pretty nice and responsive. Not sticky or anything. The touchpad is good but kind of annoying, the mouse will jump around if you bump it with your palm or whatever, it's not terrible and I don't mind, someone with HUGE hands would probably hate it though. The HDMI port is convenient but beware, there is a good chance the resolution on your LCD/LED/Plasma tv will have different resolutions and so it will either be zoomed in a bit too close, or have a black bar around the entire image. It runs very quietly, doesn't get too warm, and is ultimately pretty good for the money.I'm just going randomly as I think about what I like about it, that's why it's so sporadic and random. Just go to your local bestbuy, like I did, and see if you like it, then buy this one because it's A. cheaper and B. has more features. Bestbuy keeps a different one in stock but it's the same keys, shell, screen. Just missing a few features.
