I've been trying to live with this machine for two years now and hate it.  It was a replacement for a Dell 700m which for its time was of a very superior design and was reliable in every respect.  In no way is this a worthy successor.  It runs hot, has a short battery time (2 hours if you are lucky), and basically just isn't reliable.  I can't count how many times it has blue screened on me (Vista Ultimate), reflecting very poor marriage between computer and OS.  Until 6 months ago, when MS released some patches, I couldn't even install software updates.  The fingerprint reader is a joke and the screen has picked up keyboard impressions even though I am quite careful about how I handle it.  Dell replaced the heat pipe to try to cool it down, but that only helped the CPU run cooler, not the overall machine.  I've taken to simply shutting it down rather than using hibernate since half the time if restarts in the case and fries things.I bought this as a long term, serious travel machine, paying a premium price for what I assumed would be superior hardware.  End result ... I feel that Dell ripped me off and will never buy another lap top from them (this was my fourth, so ta ta and good luck).  I'm currently considering purchase of an ASUS U35JC-A1 which with the same screen size is lighter, thinner, more powerful, and has a much longer battery life, all at less than half the price.  I'm sure Dell would claim their hardware has superior construction quality, but from my experience I seriously doubt it.  The company should be ashamed of itself.  Dell's management appears to be operating under the same philosophy that wrecked the American automobile industry, cutting corners to inflate short term profits.  I would like to know the inside story of how this once fine company has sunk so low.
