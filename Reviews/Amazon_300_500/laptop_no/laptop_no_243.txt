I have good luck with Gateways in the past and this one is another real winner from the value standpoint, with a fast, cool running CPU, plenty of memory, a spacious and fast hard drive, n-wireless, plus Blu-ray and Wimax built in, you cannot beat this laptop for the price.It's the only i3 laptop so equipped at this price point that I could find.Setup was a breeze, thanks to Windows 7's near painless setup procedures. Almost no crapware to get rid of beyond the ubiquitous Norton Anti-virus (use free Avast or AVG and save the ridiculous yearly fees charged by Norton et al). Exceedingly quiet, as most laptops tend to be, and good battery life....about 4 hours when new. Not the best but not bad.Don't need wimax yet but I tried it and it works. If you can afford the hefty monthly fees and live in area where this is available, it might but worthwhile. Nice to have if you need it in the future.Keyboard may be the only downside. As a touch typist, I don't particularly like the square flat chicklet keys, but for those who want a stand alone numeric keypad, it's there on this larger than usual laptop keypad.Screen format is 16:9, great for watching Blu-ray movies but shorter than the usual 15.6-inch screen. Screen quality is good but not great. There's HDMI out for connecting to larger screens.Some don't like the satin "espresso" (brown) finish but it like it better than the shiny piano black of my old laptop, which showed every finger and palm print.  Touchpad works OK, supports gestures.Very good built in speakers, best I have ever heard on a laptop. Special "social media" key for launching all the usual suspects in one keystroke.A good deal for the money.My 5 year-old core2duo Gateway is still cranking but decided to upgrade because the battery was toast and wanted to move up to Windows 7. Hopefully, the new one will be as reliable as the old one, which cost a third more and is a bit heavier.
