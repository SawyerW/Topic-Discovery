I purchased two of these at Christmas.  I really love these Laptops!.  They are very well made!.  They are easy to set up, do not crash, they're fast and a joy to use.  I can not beleive that Apple can put this much computer in a package as light and powerful as this.  Just to be clear on a couple of things, I and my family are long time users of DOS/ Windows operating based computers.  We all know that with a windows based poerating system, the user is always having to "fiddle" with a setting, defrag, clean up or tune up the system.  This does not seem to be the case with these Apple units. In fact I also own an I phone and the Air Port extreme, all with no issues.  I purchased a Mac Laptop for a family member ten years ago.  To this day it has not had the first hardware or software issue.  I have another family member that purchased a desk top and an I pad at the same time and again, not one issue.  I might add that when I purchaced the Mac Book Air, I was on my third Dell during the time the one family member was on and still is on the first Laptop.  This is what I have learned from this purchace.1.  Apple, well done on the MacBook Air!2. Apple, well done on the AirPort Extreme!3. Apple, well done on the I phone!  I have the 4S.4. For those of you who for some reason like to bash Apple, well...... grow up.  I watched other people use their products for years before I ever purchased the first Apple product.5. I would never ever buy another computer  that did not have a SSHD.  It makes a world of differance6. I have never had a lap top that will run seven hours continuiously off of one battery charge.  This Mac Book Air will do that.7.  I installed Office Mac on two Mac Book Airs, and I have not had any issues.Anyone looking at a laptop, should take a serious look at Apple's offerings.  Like me, you may be asking yourself why you had not made the switch sooner.  Again I say, Well done Apple!
