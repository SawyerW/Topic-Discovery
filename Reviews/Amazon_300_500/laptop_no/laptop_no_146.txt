I purchased this laptop 8 months ago. Since then Dell has replaced the LCD, and 2 new motherboards. Something just keeps going wrong where i get a completely black screen ... the vidcard goes bad, which is attached to the motherboard. BUT the Dell service is actually exceptional, they are fixing it as needed for free, and nearly the next day.That aside, its an amazing machine! Gorgeous display, the light-up keyboard is one of the best i have seen, and a very functional machine!My one complaint is that it heats up like crazy! Not even mentioning the underneath, i mean even the top of it! Where your wrist sits when typing gets very hot. This is a known issue with this machine. But in my opinion, its worth it. I have to question the life of a machine that runs this hot though ...I upgraded everything possible on this machine because im a frequent gamer (well, the only game i play is Warcraft...). Dont expect this machine to be a beast in there! I have to adjust in-game video settings to lowest possible, and even then im at around 2-5 FPS in 25man content ... to anyone who doesnt know, this is not even playable. The reason for this, i later found out, is the onboard vidcard. Its a very capable card for anything but gaming. Mine has the ATI Mobility card and it sucks.This might sound like a negative review but its not. Most people are not trying to game on this system, those people will love this machine to pieces.BONUS: when you buy this pc from Dell you get a "premium" level of service. Separate phone number and everything! Any issues, and they don't even question it ... within 2 days you have a repair guy sitting at your dining room table with new parts in hand.
