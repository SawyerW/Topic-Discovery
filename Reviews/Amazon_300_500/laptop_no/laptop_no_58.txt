My husband bought me this Mac for Christmas and I am absolutely in love with it.  I have been a life long windows users.  Well, never again.  I just can't see myself going back.  This laptop is super fast.  I feel like it can anticipate what my next move is going to be and it gets started on it right away.  The start up on this thing is so fast.  The programs open and close like a breeze.  The laptop itself feels really solid.  I love the look much better than the white one.  The built in camera is good.  I like the backgrounds you can add to your pictures.  The trackpad is great once you get used to it.  You really have to learn all of the finger motions or it's just going to waste.  The screen is beautiful.  I know some people complain about the glare.  I don't see this as a problem for myself because I am generally indoors when I am using it.  Right now I am sitting by a window and I can see a bit of a reflection but it's on the black part surrounding the screen.  The screen does get fingerprints on it.  I never see them when the laptop is on, only when it's sleeping or off.  I just clean it every few days with the Apple cloth they give you. I like the little details like the battery indicator on the side.  The iPhoto is great.  I am completely organized with my photos now.  I do wish that iOffice had came with it.  I will have to order it separately for school. I am glad my husband went with the upgraded model with the extra RAM and memory.  I believe I will be using this laptop for a long time.  No regrets on switching to a Mac!
