A couple of years ago I bought a Lenovo because I needed a Windows device to run statistics for a lab I was working in for school. Initially I hated it because it was I had always been an Apple user way back to the days of the Apple IIe. I eventually got used to it, but I was still happy to have an excuse for getting a lighter laptop. Returning to Apple, I can see that there are things I prefer about both platforms. I really can't wait for Chromebooks to get more established, because I imagine I'll ultimately prefer those to Windows or MAC so there's that.As for this device, I mostly love it. The screen goes dark for no reason once in a while, which makes me wonder if I should return it or see if the Apple store will do anything about it even though I got Squaretrade instead of Applecare. The device itself is very nice. I can't really think of much I'd criticize about. In particular, the trackpad is good as Apple's trackpads always are. I just find Apple to be very controlling and sometimes I get annoyed because there are so many limits to customization. Also, I got some cheap plastic cover for it, and it looks amazing. It makes me smile when I use it, just because it's so pretty.I wonder if I spent too much money on this, but I spent just as much money on that stupid Lenovo, which continues to give me headache after headache...EDIT: The one thing I've noticed though is that it's constantly dropping the wi-fi and not wanting to reconnect to the same signal. It's so stupid because even the stupid Lenovo I have has no problem with these wi-fi networks. And it's not just certain networks it's almost every network. It's a constant problem to the point where I'm considering returning it or something.
