I purchased this from another site, but rating here as I look here for reviews, doesn't everybody?Anyway, the computer has some nice specs and overall seems very nice.  I've named her Buttercup.  There are 2 major drawbacks that drive me nuts:1)  The touchpad has no buttons.  It is one piece that you click on the bottom left and right corners to click.  I hate it.  It is horrible.  I want to take it apart and cut it so that it works properly.  I am a huge computer user, on them all day long.  I'm a software developer by trade.  Using the clicking feature of this touchpad is torturous.  Triple clicking things is near impossible.  I never realized how much I triple click things until I used this computer.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I hate having a separate mouse too as I'm usually on the couch and there is just nowhere to use it properly.  I will figure out a way around this.  If I have to take the thing apart and manufacture my own touchpad, I will, this is ludicrously mind boggling.  I am very agile normally with my fingers and clicking and scrolling and selecting and all of that with a beautiful grace that can only come from experience.  I cannot do anything gracefully with this touchpad.  It is an abomination and whoever designed it should be fired immediately.  Even just surfing the web and scrolling is a horrible experience.  I cannot fully express how much I hate this feature, so I'll just leave it at that.2)  Someone else mentioned the keyboard flexing.  It doesn't prevent me from typing or anything, but it sure does flex and is annoying to see how cheaply it is made.  I'm sure it is this way to cut down on some weight or something, but I would consider it unacceptable.All other aspects of this computer seem nice so far, I haven't done any tests or anything, but overall I'm fairly happy.  I just super hate hate hate hate hate HATE the touchpad and will be looking for a way to fix it, or replace it, or something.  So annoying!!
