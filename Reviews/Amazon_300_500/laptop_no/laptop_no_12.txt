Too bad that IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad's have really slid downhill, they break down just for the sport of it, there is growing number of web sites and complainants reporting a growing number of bizarre problems espeically with these older models and the new ThinkPads are getting worse while Lenovo keeps mortgaging their old reputation to command higher prices.The T41-T43's have a particularly stupid vulnerability, the motherboards can permanently fry from inserting a USB device !Hard to believe, but is a known problem (link to the community WiKi in the first comment) and the fix is even stranger if you don't want to keep buying new motherboards, you take a heat gun and "reflow the motherboard" after covering most of it aluminum foil.Buying new or used replacement parts for any ThinkPad is just as bad as shopping for antique Porsche parts because the tight knit community overcharges for everything. Thinkpads seem to kill batteries faster than the Arizona summer because I've never managed to get two years out of ThinkPad battery before it reports failures. The fans are noisier than hell and growl worse than horny house cats in the middle of April and those go bad requiring expensive replacements.It's too bad, ThinkPad's used to have legendary quality, they were the only laptops allowed on the International Space Station, IBM made the first tablet computer in the 1990's, these used to be innovators but now they're just the wallet invaders and for most new customers, their first ThinkPad decidedly becomes their last ThinkPad never willing to reconsider the headaches and hassles again.The ThinkPad community is literally guarded by miscreant owners too embarrassed to admit they made a mistake and eager to attack any critic and I expect to see this review attacked and buried in negative votes, that certainty underscores my assertions.Review the immediate comment since Amazon allows external links in comments for the authoritative ThinkPad sites that sheepishly admit just defective these things have become.
