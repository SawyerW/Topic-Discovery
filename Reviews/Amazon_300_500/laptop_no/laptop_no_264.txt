It's super fast, powerful, and has everything I could ever have asked for.I'm a college student, who demands quite a bit of performance out of my machines. I'm a technology / Broadcasting major with a minor in graphic arts (I am a gamer as well). So a lot of computer power is needed, and this laptop gives it to me! I finally feel like I don't need to upgrade again for a long while.PROS:- Everything just works, no questions asked.- It's very solid, lightweight, and small (for portability).- Powerful, runs my video editing, gaming, and photo editing software with no hiccups at all.- Fast. Fast downloads, performance, web surfing... Everything is fast.- Sleek design, I love the brushed aluminum it's sporting.- 3 USB ports, i5 processor, 6 gigs RAM (up-gradable to 8), everything about this laptop screams superior!- The battery life is great! I average about 7 hours unplugged, sometimes I forget it's NOT plugged in because it works to it's fullest potential with max screen brightness at all times.- Spacious hard-drive, once again essential - and this laptop gives it to me.POTENTIAL CONS:- The mouse takes a little getting use to, but it works, and feels overall very solid! I use a USB mouse anyway, but when I need to use the built-in, it works extremely well. I saw a lot of complaints about it, but really. It works, guys, come on.- The USB ports take some breaking-in. I found it almost difficult to plug any USB enabled devices in my first few times. But, all in all, they're sturdy - and once broken in, cause no problems!There were a lot of complaints about problems that people encountered, and I gotta say - I have had nothing but smooth sailing, so you'll get the horror stories - but this is a VERY quality laptop, especially for the price!
