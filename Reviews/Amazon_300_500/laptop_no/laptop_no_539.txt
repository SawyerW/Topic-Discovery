First off, I bought this laptop from another vendor, and cannot comment on Amazon's shipping or service. However, after owning this product for about a month, I can comment on the laptop.Pros:-Top-of-the-line 4th gen Core i7 processor-Brand new, dedicated video card-absolutely massive hard drive-keyboard w/ backlight-Full HD touchscreen display with IPS technology (very wide viewing angles)-excellent build qualityCons:-hard drive is only 5400 RPM-keyboard backlight is not perfect-gets a little warm with heavy use-it doesn't make me pancakesConclusion:  This really is an excellent laptop, especially for the price. For a little more than $1000, it offers you a slew of high-end components inside a well-built, attractive casing. For some more money, you could get a laptop with a higher resolution screen (Macbook Pro Retina) or with slightly better components (Razer Blade) but there's really no reason to unless you're a hardcore gamer or have a need for ultra-high resolution displays. The touchscreen makes Windows 8 infinitely more enjoyable, and makes me wonder why people ever complained about it. The hard drive, while massive, is a bit slow, and seems to occasionally bottleneck the system during some intensive tasks. However, during most use cases, this is a non-issue, and is easily rectified( Just buy yourself a faster hard drive). It does get a little warm when under heavy use, and may require a lap desk or a cooling pad to remain comfortable at times, but again, the problem is easily fixed. The keyboard backlight is a nice touch, with one minor issue. At certain angles, light leaks out from underneath the keys, making them hard to see. But, when one is sitting normally, this isn't an issue. The keyboard itself is wonderful, and I'm not sure why people have complained about it. I suppose it's a preference thing.Overall it's an amazing laptop for the price, offering an excellent mix between build quality, aesthetics, and power.
