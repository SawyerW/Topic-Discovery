I have been very happy with this laptop.  I have had the laptop for a year now, and it is a great laptop.  I paid the extra to get more memory and a good CPU and I haven't regretted it.  It is a good laptop with many great features.The Pros:  It is a fast laptop with a very good picture.  The sound is pretty good for built in speakers.  Good battery life (although I upgraded to a 9-cell to get even more life).  It will run a good many processes at a time.  I work in a marketing and design firm and there are times that I have IM, email, several web browsers, Excel, and music all running and it does not slow down.  I have never had issues with the keyboard like others have mentioned.  I have used this to type many long papers and reports and it works just fine.  I like having a number pad on the side of the keyboard.  It makes it easy to do calculations and to enter numbers in Excel.The Cons:  It is a large laptop. This would not be a good laptop for someone who will be walking around carrying it.  It is not too heavy, but big enough to make it cumbersome for a classroom setting or a board meeting.  I have enjoyed having multimedia buttons at the top of my keyboard, but it would be nice to make them separate from the F1-F12.  Fingerprints can be an issue if that bothers you.Overall: This is a good computer for your average user.  Someone who does a lot of gaming or who travels a lot would probably find this a little disappointing.  Anyone else would find that this computer is a great machine.  It is big, but it can do what you ask it to do.
