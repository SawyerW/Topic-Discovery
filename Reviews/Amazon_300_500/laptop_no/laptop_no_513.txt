Cons:I have owned many HP laptops in my day. It just ends up happening. I do not like that they put in a bunch of HP software that I never use and perpetually gets in my way. Also, the first unit I purchased had some weird glitch where every 65 second the DVD drive would pop open. However, now that I have a working one I like it so much I felt the need to review it. Also, this computer is trying really hard to be an Apple product. It's silver shell and black back lit keyboard echo that of a Macbook. However, it is light and feels like a cheaper version of the apple product. Finally, there is a movement to change the design of the arrow keys so that left and right buttons are full sized but up and down buttons are half sized. I use these buttons all the time and the half sized buttons are annoying.So enough of the negatives. What are the things that make this a four star product?1. It is a cheaper product. It costs over 50% less than an apple product. I love the price. And I think for what is paid the laptop offers a lot.2. Backlit keyboard. It is a perk I have been waiting for. they seems to usually be reserved for ultrabooks. It is nice to see the price point drop on this feature.3. I am not much of a computer "guts" kind of guy. I just want the computer to do what I want it to. I do not need to know all the inside stuff. I do know that the audio quality is good and I am able to run my PC games well on it without issue. I have heard reviews saying the screen is cheap but I have no complaints. It is higher quality than the laptop it replaced and for that i am grateful. I do not think the average user will feel cheated when it comes to the display quality.Overall, I just like it. It works well and I feel comfortable using it.
