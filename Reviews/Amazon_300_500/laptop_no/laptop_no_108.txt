Before I was given a Mac over 1.5 years ago, I didn't understand what all of the fuss was about Macs. I felt Mac users were arrogant, and Macs were overpriced. However, it didn't take long before I joined the Mac side. I find the Mac advertisements on the Apple site a little over the top, but I do strongly agree that the MacBook is a superior laptop. A couple of weeks ago I started to have my first problems with a MacBook, and I came to find out that I was running out of memory. To solve this problem, the school I work at gave me a MacBook Pro. Once again, I am very pleased.The MacBook is expensive, but I think it is worth the price. My experience is that you get a machine that runs much smoother and faster than what other companies offer. My previous computers included a Sony, Compaq, and Dell. With a MacBook you don't have virus problems. The Apple programs are much more artistic than what Microsoft offers. Apple programs such as iPhoto and Keynote are quite easy to learn and extremely creative. All of this means you don't waste time with computer problems and wishing for something better.Before I started using a Mac, I was wondering if it might take me some time figuring out how to use a Mac. Using a Mac is definitely a different experience than using a PC, but I found it to be a fun experience and not at all frustrating. I quickly became acclimated to the Mac world. My only knock against the machine is the white color. I live in a city with a lot of pollution so that means I have a machine that looks a little dirty.There are a lot of cool features that a MacBook has that are not found on other laptops. Instead of listing all of the different features found on the machine, I highly recommend checking one out and playing on it for a significant amount of time. I really believe if you spend some time on a MacBook, you will think that Macs are worth the price. I highly recommend the MacBook.
