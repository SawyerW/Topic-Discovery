I've had this Chromebook for about 2-3 weeks now and so far it's been working out pretty great for me. I am pretty experience with computers, so I like to think I know what I am talking about, and this has been working excellently for me.I, myself, have a pretty powerful laptop,but it is also really huge, which i did not realize when I first bought it, but I quickly got tired of the size. I got this Chromebook to use in the times that I don't need a high power laptop and would rather use something more small and convenient and this is great. I also had bought a tablet in the past to try and this is a million times better.Pros:Starts very quicklyWakes from sleep quicklyConnects to wifi fairly quickly, and auto reloads your pages if you tried to go to one before it connected100GB free google drive for 2 yearsSmall, light, and very convenientlong battery life(6+ hours, much better than my other laptop)Keyboard and touchpad work nicelyFlash player built inturns on when lid is openedvery cheapCons:No support for things like silverlight or java(yet)Can only do browsing (not a problem for me since I have a second computer, but might be for some)You CANNOT install anything that isnt through the chrome web store (add ons for chrome)touchpad click does seem a little cheap, but still worksWhen it comes down to think and thin, it just matters if you need a computer that does more than browse the internet. I don't, because I have my other PC and all of my homework is on the internet anyways. I do need to use my other PC for things like programming and some other things, so if you don't have another windows or mac, this may be a problem.Other than that though, this is a very convenient, great device for the price. It loads web pages pretty quickly and can handle most things you can throw at it. For the price, I would definitely say it is a good purchase.
