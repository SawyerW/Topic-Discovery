I purchased this laptop rather hastily when my Sony Vaio laptops hard drive died after 6 years of service. Right out of the box this computers performance was mediocre at best mainly due to the vast array of HP programs (gimmicks)that come pre-installed. After about three months of ownership this HP product really started showing its evil and ugly face. It all started with what appeared to be a problem with the video/graphics card and/or its drivers. If you try to play streaming videos from the web with the sound on it will simply crash....every time! After several calls to HP and dozens of attempts to troubleshoot and fix the problems using the HP support programs, I have come to the conclusion that this laptop is really just that bad. Another problem that I have encountered that absolutely blows my mind is its inability to connect to other HP brand products. My wifes father gave her a really nice HP printer for Christmas and it takes 30 minutes to connect to the printer every time you want to print something. This is a prime example of how poor HP products really are, my Cannon printer works every time. After months of being angry at this laptop my wife took it for herself and made me buy a new Dell brand laptop. I am counting the days that it takes for her to finally loose her mind and throw it in the garbage. In a nutshell, this product may be just fine if you use it for simple web browsing and simple programs only. Be prepared for extremely slow product updates, extremely poor tech support, and an endless amount of crashes, reboots, and lost data. I know this review may seem a little harsh but if a zero star rating were an option I would have picked it. Learn from my mistake and save your hard earned money to buy a Dell or Sony.
