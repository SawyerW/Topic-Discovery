As I read the various reviews about the the Samsung Chromebook I must admit that I was quite skeptical. First of all, I have never really owned anything by Samsung. Actually, I thought Samsung was quite inferior to the other brands out there, but I will say that my opinion has changed completely. A month ago I was experiencing some problems with my desktop so I bought this Chromebook as a cheap solution...and I absolutely love it. It is very lightweight. I love that it doesn't have any fans, so there is no fear of it overheating. I've not had any trouble logging onto any websites. Believe me, I'll let Netflix play all night and I have not had any issues with the it cutting off at all. The volume is very very nice. The screen is average. The size is great for handling.The keys are soundless. Every now and then the Chromebook will shutdown on its own in order to update everything, but it's very rare and it saves absolutely everything. Unfortunately, my only real complaint about the Chromebook is that the cover must have been made out of very cheap material because I've only had it for a month and there are scratches all over the top. However, Samsung sells these really cool protective skins. I found some at Decalgirls.com for like 20 bucks and they work really really well. (AND NO, THEY AREN'T JUST FOR GIRLS< YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEM HOWEVER YOU LIKE). I would not advise an older, working individual to buy one simply because this is more fit for college students. It is no different from an Ipad, but you cannot treat it as an apple product. Samsung WILL NOT cooperate with Itunes, but you already know that. Of course, you need the internet for absolutely everything on it. As a college student, I need the internet daily anyways so that isn't an issue for me.  All in all, the Samsung Chromebook is cheap, yet has great features on it. If you're already thinking about it, my advice is to just go for it.
