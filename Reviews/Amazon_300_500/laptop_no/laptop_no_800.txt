I got this laptop at a pawnshop. I am SOOO glad I did. I was a little worried about getting a laptop that runs it's video processer through it's CPU, but after loading a few of my games, I found that this laptop is really pretty good! As others have mentioned, the sound is really low based on where Asus put the built in speakers. But I have found that the sound quality improves GREATLY when you plug in headphones or some other speaker device.It does tend to get a little warm when running a load for a period of time, but it is nothing to be really worried about.Another nice thing I noticed is that Asus has a website devoted to parts for their products, and the K52f is no exception. If you got the model with the DVD drive and later you realize you want the Blue Ray burner, you can buy it off their website. You can also buy another battery, power cord, recovery disk, and even the little rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop. I do not know of other companies that keep that stuff for sale even after the product is out of most main line stores.My only complaint is the company itself. I wanted to upgrade the CPU to the I5-540M. Some companies will solder on the CPU's onto the motherboard. I wrote Asus an e-mail asking them if they did that to this series of laptops. After 4 days with no reply, I called the Asus tech support to ask them. I was told that yes, the CPU is soldered onto the motherboard. Later that day, I got a response to my original e-mail, and in the e-mail I was told that no, the CPU is NOT soldered on. After doing a TON of research (the answer to this question is not easy to discover) I found out that the CPU is indeed not soldered onto the motherboard.All in all, I would give this laptop an 8 out of 10.
