The title of this article depicts 250 GB Hard Drive, but my Merchant clarified in their listing (and the specifications on this very page also clarify) that it is a 160 GB Hard Drive.That aside, my Merchant provided Windows 7, and I note that the Laptop had a Fingerprint Security Feature. Mine was refurbished, and no software was advertised to come with it, so I had my own plans...but they surprised me and preloaded one piece of software that I intended to load myself, Open Office.This is a solid, reliable product, the most sturdy Laptop I've ever touched.If you decide to purchase this Laptop with no software (I am an ex software tester), I would highly recommend that you go to OpenOffice.org and download their free Microsoft-compatible software that will edit and save in various formats, including Microsoft formats. I have experience with the makers of this FREE software from my software days, and I can tell you this is a great offering to the public--they do take donations if you're thrilled about it.If you desire better drawing software, you can also download Inkscape for free at Inkscape.org--this software will save into an SVG format, which is the clearest and sharpest image format available for the computer, and it can save into various other formats; this program takes a while to learn, but is well worth it--a big advantage is that you can open other formats such as the less clear BMP or JPG formats and trace the images and convert them into smoother/crisper images.  I also note that YouTube is invaluable for learning new computer programs!I also purchased a Xerox Travel Scanner 150 that came with a bundled Nuance PDF Converter program that rivals Adobe Acrobat and will also save in many formats ranging from Image formats (BMP, JPG) to document formats (Microsoft, RTF, TXT)--the list is long and I've only given a few of the formats it covers.The amount of RAM and Memory on this machine are more than adequate for most computing needs; as far as Hard Drive size, you can buy a 1 TB external Hard Drive to suppliment this Laptop's Memory for around $80 these days, and they are now a little bigger than a smart phone! It's a good idea to have one of these even if all you do is back up your data.
