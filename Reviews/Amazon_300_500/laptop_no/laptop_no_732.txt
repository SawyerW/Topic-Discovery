Having owned this laptop for about 3 months now. It is a nice laptop that fits well within your laps and its light for everyday portability. Its well suited for someone like myself who needs a light notebook to work on and do daily simple task: email, documentations, spreadsheets, surfing the wed, youtube and typing reports.The ul30a-x5 is not perfect though. Its not as elegant as a mac book pro but consumers you also have to remember that this laptop is not meant to be, not at the sub $700 price point! If you can overlook that fact and that it is not a powerhouse but a dependable laptop then you, along as with me, will be very satisfied with this purchase.The black outer case looks great and does attract plenty of finger prints (which can be also easily wiped down)The battery life is not 12 hours as it claims as i have used it. At most i have gotten 8 hours but i like to work with the screen brightness all the way up and multitasking at the same time. I dont believe in reducing brightness levels to bare minimum to converse battery power because i bought this laptop to do my work so i would like to see the screen as best as can be.The built in webcam is rather disappointing especially during skype video calls.The touchpad is probably the function i hate the most about this laptop, it feels weird, it responds weird with too much responsiveness at times and none at other (bought a notebook mouse but still you shouldnt have to for a notebook)However even with its flaws, considering the price i paid for such a laptop, i am deeply happy with the purchase and would recommend it to other peers.The specs are somewhat up to date and the processor isn't that bad at all.
