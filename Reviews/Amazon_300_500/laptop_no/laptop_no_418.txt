I was looking between different combinations of Dell and Apple. I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple. There is nothing wrong in Dell but I preferred Apple 13.4" Display 500 GB Hard Drive, 4 GB memory and Intel Core i5 Processor (3rd gen).. This is best laptop.Advantages:1. Although there  is a small learning curve for Mac OS to get some hands on - but as I am familiar with Linux I am very comfortable with Mac OS... this is the only thing I see difficult with Mac Book .... and this is advantage in other sense coz you will be amazingly in a new world of OS and features...... and even if you are too restricted to MS Windows, you still can have partitions and Windows installed virtually or through boot camp... with all native speed...2. Macs never crash... I never see any application taking too much to respond and going nasty ....and same applications I saw going goofy on my other laptop which carries Windows with similar hardware.3. There are no issues at all with internet security and virus attacks... I don't even have any anti-virus ...4. If you are restricted to Word processing applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, you can have MS Office on Mac just in $119... but if you are not restricted but still want this capability, Open-office can solve all your problems...5. You can make Mac virtually same as Windows if you are Microsoft fan.... I am also Microsoft fan and doing the same....6. Incredible display, laptop size and weight.... great battery backup...7. accept trusted content only e.g. tools, software etc.8. No other brand has touch pad like Mac .... you don't even need lot of keys from keyboard or mouse when you have MacBook touch pad with youDisadvantages:1. Cost is more as compared to other brands. Other brands can come with higher configurations in same cost.... but Mac is Mac2. learning curve for OS and other features3. less free stuff compared to other communities... accept programs from trusted developers only
