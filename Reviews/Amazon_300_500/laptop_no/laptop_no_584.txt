I've become an avid Mac fan in the last 1 1/2 years.  I have 2 Macs, for home and office, and I only bought this notebook because I discovered that some programs still won't run under Windows emulation on the Mac.My needs for the notebook are very humble, to run 2 simple programs, that I don't use heavily.  Beyond Windows and Vista being junk, my dislike for the Dell is the keys.  They don't respond well, and I either mistype a great deal, or they simply are not registering the keystroke at all, and so a lot of time is wasted. I've owned 2 prior notebooks, IBM's, but those were bought about 10 years ago.  I'm not up on what other current notebooks are like, but the Dell leaves me unimpressed.  For my simple needs, of occasional use, it's inexpensive and compact, and so I'll keep it.  But, having owned several Dell desktops for the last 10 years, the notebooks do not measure up.Other dislikes: the DVD tray seems incredibly flimsy and fragile. It doesn't eject well, and it can get hung up very easily with seemingly paper thin objects near its path.  The screen display has poor contrast, and I've yet to figure out how to improve on it other than dimming the brightness which doesn't fix the contrast itself.  Maybe that's Windows sloppiness, and not Dell, I don't know.The start-up on a cold boot also seems slow at least compared to my old Dell desktop, and especially to the Macs.  2 USB ports are stacked on top of each other and depending on the thickness of the gadgets can block each other.I also find it hard to open the case. Maybe I have too clunky fingers, but the other notebooks I've used had a more tactile latch and point to grasp.  And the shiny cover, all pretty and glossy for the first few seconds, is rapidly covered with fingerprints which detract from its appearance.Bottom line: it works, but attention to detail is not good, quality construction is missing (made in China, where else?), and performance is subpar.
