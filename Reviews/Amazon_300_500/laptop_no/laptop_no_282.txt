I purchased this computer a year ago after my other computer's screen blacked out on me.  At first I was really in love with this computer.  It is ultra fast and very lightweight.  I'm a soldier and I travel a lot so being able lightweight is a must for me. However after having it for a year, I've noticed that sometimes while doing my homework the screen frequently freezes, I'm unable to type anything, and sometimes when I completely shut down the system, I will get a blue screen and have to allow my computer to go through the safe-mode method to reboot itself.  Other than those issues, I'm still somewhat satisfied with this computer.My main purpose and use for this computer is schoolwork, so with that being said I am able to get my work done and it does serve its intended purpose. I would suggest if you want a better sound to use a bluetooth earpiece or some earbuds, otherwise the factory speakers suck.  As for the wireless card installed in the computer you have to play with it for a bit and eventually it will stop kicking you off the internet.Make sure you have some type of virus scan on this computer.  I'm not really sure why but it seems that this computer is prone to viruses.  I won't make any suggestions but it does come with a 30 day trial of McAfee that you can purchase at a very good price due to the deal they have with ACER.Again overall I am fairly pleased with this computer.  This is my first ACER product and I hate to say it, it may very well be my last.  I don't hate it, but I can't say that I really love it.  Do your homework and make sure you make the purchase that best suits your needs.  I would suggest this as an excellent first computer for your child that is in school.
