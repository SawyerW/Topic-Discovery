I bought thinkpad t420s from Lenovo website directly and also purchased extended next business day on-site warranty for $300 more...what was I thinking....-  Only a few months after purchasing it started to crash/restart when I touch the keyboard.-  Technician over the phone said it must be a mother board problem and told me he'll send a new MB with a technician next day-  Next day technician called and said he can't make it today.... but he can come tomorrow-  Next day technician arrived and replaced motherboard with a used/refurbished MB ...but issue remained...New diagnosis key board needs replacement- Next WEEK he came back with a used/refurbished keyboard.... ...issue remained....New diagnosis..  It MAY be the housing/case let's send it to depot to check out....- 2 days later Lenovo sends me a box to ship it... I dropped it at ups on same day and lenovo received it 2 days later...-  2 more days later there came an e-mail saying they replaced the mother board again and the case and attached excel with diagnosis report saying everything working.-  I got it back 2 days later and tried to switch on and it gave me a "Fan error"..... and wi wont go beyond bios screen....not cool to send a fake diagnosis report saying everything working.- 2 days later technician came to my home, replace the fan and left ...now the machine working...-  Same day I tried to connect it to the wireless...hmmm Now the wireless not working ....- called Lenovo and they told me to send it back to depot check...I told no way....I paid for onsite next business day support and I want that service ...and then they told me to call back next day between 8am-6pm and ask for issue escalation department- called back earlier today I was told there's no escalation department in Lenovo support..wtf??- Now 3 weeks later after the first issue I'm still waiting for the technician to come and replace wireless card or whatever wrong in there....This is my experience with Lenovo for paying $1500 for a laptop and 300 for onsite next business day support... so will I buy a Lenovo again??? Never.......not even in a dream...If you want to pay premium price for a crappy product with crappy support go for Lenovo....i will update in fewdays to give the latest update..
