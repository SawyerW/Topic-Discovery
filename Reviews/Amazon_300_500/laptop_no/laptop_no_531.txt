I bought my Acer Aspire V5 122 with the AMD 1450 processor and 6GB DDR3 memory at a local retail store.  I am writing this review only because of a couple of odd reviews criticizing these model laptops.One reviewer mentioned "This will not ruin AutoCad."  No. It will not. This is a sub $500 laptop. It sits on the shelf next to $1,400 to $1,700 laptops that probably will run AutoCad.  If THAT is the capability you need to have, open your wallet up further and get one designed for that purpose. This Acer Aspire will happily run PhotoShop, Illustrator, Word, Excel, Acrobat and 98% of the software 98% of the people need to run.  I even use PowerDirector 10 video editor on mine.  It is slower than when I run the same video editor on my desktop PC with the i7 CPU and a killer video card but the video card cost more than this entire little computer!I have a 6 year old Dell XPS M1210 laptop.  It was one of the fastest laptop PCs available at the time I bought it.  This Acer is very similar to it in speed.  Yes, there are MUCH faster and more capable laptops available today, but you need to start ADDING $200, $400, $600 or ever $1000 to get one of these faster ones.The touchscreen on this one is beautiful.  The battery lasts around 3.5 hours.  I've seen better battery lifes and faster laptops, but not everything at this low of a price.. The screen is exceedingly clear and bright.  Knowing this inexpensive little PC will run those two programs is probably more significant to 98% of consumers that having them be concerned that it will not run a CAD/CAM program.The build differences are quite noticeable. The Dell was built like a tank in comparison.  it had access doors on back for each item: battery, hard drive, memory stick, wi-fi and bluetooth cards. These new laptops are ultra light weight.  This Acer is trim, thin and elegant, built more like an Apple "air" laptop than the old Dell was.
