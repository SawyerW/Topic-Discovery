My configuration is:Intel Centrino Processor, NVidia Quadro NVS 135M Video, Wired / Wireless Ethernet, 4 GB Memory, 160 GB HD, CD/DVD RW.I've been using it about 3 - 4 years now.  With a 3 year warranty, the only problem I ever had (to be expected) was the hard drive going bad.  I replaced it for free near the end of my warranty.I'm running dual boot:Windows XP / Linux Mint 9 LXDEI spend more time in Linux Mint 9 LXDE than I do in Windows.When I'm not in Linux Mint 9 LXDE, I'm either test booting Linux Distros from CD / DVD, using Sun VirtualBox to boot test downloaded ISOs, or creating or booting from Linux USB.I've run just about every version of Ubuntu from version 9 up to / through version 10, Linux Mint (HIGHLY recommended - light on resources, user friendly): CrunchBang, Knoppix, Fedora 14, Puppy Linux, GeexBox, ZorinOS, Back-Box (Network Diagnostics, Network Security Toolkit also run without a hitch.It has problems with Gnome 3.0 / Unity, and the latest versions (11.*) of Ubuntu as well as running 3D graphics or for that matter HD video.But, for my purposes: Internet Connectiity, Basic Application access (Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Graphics, Audio / Video) LibreOffice, VLC, Audacity, Gnome MediaPlayer, ImageViewer, Feh, FSLint (for cleanup), Ubuntu Tweak, BleachBit (Cleanup / Config tools).  TSClient for remote connectivity, It does what I want, need it to do with a minimum of fuss.Ocasionally, I drop over into Windows when I absolutely can't get it done in Linux.But, ever since switching over to Linux - a majority of my Windows (Virus / Trojan) problems and the attendant performance hits went away.I print to an HP LJ1300 from Linux.  I use Document Viewer (built in) for PDFs.  I've ported basic documents / spreadsheets to / from Office 2007.The only thing it doesn't do well (if at all) is Flash Development.  There, Windows (specifically Adobe / Macromedia) Flash has an edge.  Haven't played with it much at all, but, for 3D develpment, there's Blender.Not intended to be a Linux Promo.  Just to let you know how my Latitude D830 is setup, what I use it for, and how it runs.I do tech support for a living and support Windows based systems primarily.If you're not married to Windows, this is a fine system for running Linux (besides the added advantage of it being FREE or Open Source.
