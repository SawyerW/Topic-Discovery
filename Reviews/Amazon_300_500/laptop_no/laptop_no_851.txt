Recently I found out that for college I needed to have a tablet for the Adobe Suite. Since drawing tablets are fairly expensive I figured I would just buy a tablet pc (since the price range is so close) so that instead of just a touch pad, I'd be able to Photoshop on the screen. So far this netbook is AMAZING!!!! I downloaded Photoshop and was dreading that it'd be all laggy or something based on so many of the comments I had read, but to my amazement it worked. There is absolutely NO lag when I am drawing on the screen (although I did have to tweak the tablet and pen settings). Honestly, I can't find anything bad about it. It is very well built and sturdy. It is a little heavier than say an ipad, but this netbook has all the capabilities of any computer and doesn't run just straight apps like most tablets tend to do. I am not sure how there are so many bad reviews with lag. I mean if I downloaded photoshop, and that program uses tons of ram and resources and works with no lag, then why are so many people having this problem? For graphic design and animation I cannot afford lag as it will slow down my work process, but I found the make of it, the speed, and the hard drive space superb! Also, the docking station works really well. It is great for viewing as well as editing with sound. The speakers are very crisp. Overall, this laptop exceeded my expectations and for half the price, could probably compare to a higher end graphic arts tablet pc. I do suggest that if you WANT it for drawing and art, get two different pen styluses, one with a larger tip and one with a ballpoint tip, for broader strokes (shading) and really fine strokes (lineart).
