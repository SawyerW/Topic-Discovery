I have had this laptop since Sept. 2011, (its a 2009) it has not giving me any problems at all I have read all the reviews and I would have to agree with the some of the negative things people stated but they are not things that I would consider to warrant a bad review. Yes the touch pad can be sensitive at times, but nothing that has bothered me to the point of bashing this product after some property adjustments it worked fine, and yes the lid does need two hands to open it... SO WHAT... stop being lazy put down the donut and grab it with both hands and open the thing, and as for the cover not having full range of tilt ALL once again... SO WHAT... it is enough for any normal person to accommodate their viewing needs! As for performance mine never crashed and boots up with in 1 minute, I maintain it with installed utilities, (such as Anti-virus malware defrag and disk check) that are automatically run on a monthly basis.  For the price this machine is well worth it! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE!P.s. I am sure that some people receive a few bad machines out of 1000's that happens with every product especially electronics these days, but bashing the product over feeble things such as cover tilt range, and weight of the cover, or because of the sensitivity of the touch pad, or even the tech support is pretty weak argument to make... tech support was great for me and even if it wasn't ... the reviews left here are for the MACHINE should not related to TECH SUPPORT.  IF... tech support was bad but the machine deserved 5 or 4 stars then rate the Machine on its performance and plainly state that "TECH SUPPORT sucked"!  That only seems fair to me, but maybe thats just me! That's like saying the performance of a car sucked because the dealership that sold it was mean to me, when the car drove great! See my point?BUY THIS MACHINE IF YOU NEED A GREAT LAPTOP!HAVE A BLESSED DAY!
