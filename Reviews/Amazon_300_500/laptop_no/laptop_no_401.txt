It has a amazing key board because it is back lit with fiber optics plus the sound system is so amazing it sounds better, crisper ,and louder than any computer out there and well i guess you pay for this but it is worth it and iTunes is really the worlds best computer. this also has a amazing track pad and don't get me wrong i used to use a mouse for ever but now i use this and i will never go back it is amazing and i will never go back and yes it is worth repeating twice. All of the features in this computer are top of the line and the materials like pure aluminum casing this is truly remarkable that they could put this into a computer and i promise you will like it and apple is so responsive if you have any questions they are there for you promise. this computer is really great but here is just a suggestion get the 13 inch one because the 15 inch is a little to big and i now this because my friend has a 15 inch and they wish they got the 13 inch like me but they still love it  and this is still awesome to so don't get me wrong this is a great computer to.  All I haft to say is go with this computer and don't regret it because it is awesome.
