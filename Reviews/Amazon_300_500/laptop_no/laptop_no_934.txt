Good afternoon to everyone that has purchased this FANTASTIC Ultrabook.I bought this Apr 29th and immediately found the same driver issues with the second touch screen like many of you probably have.I have just fixed all issues with the help of a great group of Taichi Owners over at the Microsoft Answers Forums.The bug seemed to reside in the Bios not meshing well with Windows 8.1, but worked fine with Win8.Microsoft Answers has a Forum with the updated 211 Bios, which as of now isn't listed on Asus's support site for the Taichi 21.Just give a search in Bing or Google for ASUS, Taichi, back screen not working, and the link to the BIOS update is on Page 31.I'd recommend giving a read though the Forum either way as there seem to be a few revisions of the Taichi 21, and some others have reported residual hiccups such as the second screen being mirrored, which wasn't a problem for me.Updating the BIOS is always a touchy proposition, especially for novices, but in this case for me, it was either fix this bug, or return it, so I'm glad I did it.I hope this provides some relief to those stuck on Windows 8, or those considering returning the laptop out right.As for the other areas of the laptop, everything seems to be working fine.This boots for me to the desktop in less than ten seconds on a cold boot.After the BIOS update, uninstalling various Bloatware, using only the internal screen and some system power tweaks I've got a reported battery life of 6hrs 13mins at 97% charge.I've got my CPU set to top out at 50% on battery, and the Intel HD4000 for Max Battery with 96 processes running.All other power Options are at default Balanced settings.I'll come back in the coming days or weeks with an update on how things have worked out.Thanks again to all those at the Microsoft Answers Forum!
