I did a lot of research, and this computer got mostly good reviews. It is very fast, and I like the keyboard and joystick-mouse.On the other hand, I have had numerous problems:1) The battery would not fully charge. After an hour of talking with tech support, I sent it in. They did fix the battery problem, however, they wiped the hard disk, and DID NOT LOAD THE DRIVERS. They sent me a letter telling me I needed to go to certain web sites to reload the drivers.2) The screen then began sticking upside down in auto-rotate mode. I called tech support, and they told me there was a store that could fix it about 45 minutes from my house. I took it there, and they were NOT a certified Lenovo repair center, and refused to touch it for fear of invalidating the warranty.3) I called tech support again, and this person asked me to reload the drivers. It was then that I discovered that the websites in the letter were WRONG, and that I had not reloaded all of the drivers I needed. He assured me that the drivers would solve my problem. They didn't. The screen still sticks and will not return to landscape.4) I went on the web and found other people with similar problems. I found that I can go to CONTROL PANEL to disable auto-rotate, but it resets itself to the on position whenever the computer goes into sleep mode or I turn it off. So I now have to go to Control Panel and turn off auto-rotate. Even then, it often takes 3-4 times of resetting before it will revert to landscape. At least I have learned how to read sideways and upside down!5) THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WOULD NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER AGAIN OR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!
