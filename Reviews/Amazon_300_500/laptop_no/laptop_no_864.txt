After doing graphic design work on PC's for over a decade I took the plunge to Mac.  Why the hell did I wait so long?!? I have only had my MacBook for about 40 hours, and had no previous Mac experience, and things are becoming pretty familiar already.  If you are concerned about switching operating systems, don't be.My last laptop was a Gateway and for the last year I have had an issue with the power supply.  I would spend as much time wiggling the damn power cord as I did actually working.  The Mac is well designed and shows a lot of attention to detail.  Form follows function so to speak.  So I really took notice while looking at something as small as the design of the magsafe adapter and power cord.  If Apple put that much thought into the cord (while most manufacturers treat that stuff as an after thought) then I have to believe that the really important aspects of the machine were in good hands as well.I also ordered a mini HDMI cable so I could plug into my flat screen TV.  So tonight I'm sitting in my recliner in the living room doing graphic design work on the big screen while running netflix on the laptop screen along with my email and about 4 other programs.  The MacBook didn't even break a sweat.Being a screen printer I was used to using CorelDraw for design work and was hesitant to switch to Mac since Corel isn't available in a Mac version.  No problems, I was able to set up a virtual windows machine using Parallels for Mac and can now run any windows program as well.  Sharing files between photoshop on Mac and Corel on windows was also very easy.This machine is a bad ass!Nothing wrong with pc's I will still be using one at work but if you are considering getting a Mac...Jump on in the water is fine.
