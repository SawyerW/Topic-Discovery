As a 2nd time owner of a MacBook (my previous MacBook Pro purchased last September) I am amazed at the huge package you get for such a little price. At the Apple Store, I was able to purchase a newly released product (3 days old) for less than Amazon (949.00 with the student or teacher discount, and they didn't even ask for proof) charges and until September 2009 it includes a free iPod Touch. (Or any iPod valued up to 229.00). I compared the specs side by side to my Pro and found it to be almost completely caught up, except for the video card and display screen size. Even the memory had a faster bus! My Pro is still working great, but my husband needed something mostly for school. The glossy display is gorgeous and the slightly smaller resolution than the Pro goes unnoticed. I have the Pro for photography and graphic design but this little MacBook can handle those as well if it really needed to, what with all the extra processing speed. (2.4 vs 2.13).Overall a tremendous value and a power packed little computer. For an entry level, I think it is loaded with a ton of power to stay ahead for the next few years. Even the Mac "pro" at the store recommended it over some of the more expensive ones due to my husband primarily using it for Office programs and internet based with some photos and music on the side. I'm confident there isn't anything this little Macbook white couldn't do that my Pro could.P.S. Play with all the menus in the apple icon on the LH top for the most personalized experience. This includes touch pad "gestures" letting you use finger combinations to scroll, right click, turn pages, etc; hotspots that let you make a program or app come up just by going to a deep corner of the screen; Spaces, which lets you have multiple applications running on several screens that you can hop between so your windows are more organized; and many more options. Don't be afraid to try stuff with menu options, you won't break it!
