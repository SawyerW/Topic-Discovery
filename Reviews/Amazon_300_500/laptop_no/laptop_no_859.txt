I have been a Pc user for all my life. I am an art major and I needed something that runs reliably with some of the heavy software that I would be using. I had used a iMac at school to finish up a a project with Photoshop (this was a public computer) and it worked amazingly. The first thing I noticed was the fact that there is only one clicking button, not the left and right click that you would see on a PC. The stability of the OS X 10.7.2 is amazing. I have never used such a quick computer before. The computer comes beautifully packaged and the shape of the laptop is just remarkable. I don't know how they were able to fit such a fine mechanism into such a drastically aesthetic design. It's like Apple thought carefully about ease of use, neutrality in color, while also being fully aware of the software. The finger swipes are addictive. You CANNOT do anyhing like this on a PC that I know of. The trackpad is revolutionary in my mind. It is just one solid gray square made of glass. It feels your fingers swipes and seemlessly manages to switch from window to window, screen to screen. The camera is high quality. There is no random, no-name software in here either. This is one of the main things that really almost brought be to tears. I didn't have to uninstall all the useless junkware. The computer turns on, welcomes you, and prompts a few start up questions. Then you have the desktop. I don't, in any way feel pretentious about having this computer. This IS a very expensive computer, but I know that it is a high quality computer, well worth the price. I spend very little time on forums, trying to figure out how to use it. I don't have to call up the geeks to do the things I want, which is nice. In the long run, I may end up spending less money on repairs. I am fotunate that this device is within my grasp, but the truth is, if I couldn't dish out this kind of money, I would have had to settle for a PC.
