The 17-inch 2011 MBP has a hefty price tag, but for those looking to replace a desktop or in dire need of a true mobile workstation -- look no further.  The performance beats my BTO 2.93 GHZ i7 27-inch iMac (late 2010), and the high resolution 1920x1200 display is worth the added cost over the high-end 15-inch MBP.Prior to biting the bullet I was on the fence over whether to get the entry-level or high-end 15-inch model.  Unfortunately unless you order from Apple there's no way to add the high-res display (1680x1050).  If you are a Final Cut Pro user, this could be important since Color requires the high-res display.  Of course you could connect to an auxiliary monitor, but that's another $999 (27-inch Cinema display) -- or $399 for a 24-inch IPS HP display.At the end of the day the difference in price between the 15-inch high-end and the 17-inch was just over $200 (1959 vs 2163 open box 'like-new' Warehouse Deals).  In everyday use I would have no problem using the 1440x900 resolution of the 15-inch model, but I really wanted the hig-res option.  Ordering the 15-inch top model + high-res option from Apple with a student discount still ended up being more expensive than the 17-inch MBP through Amazon.I was hesitant about the size and weight.  In the store I felt like the 17-inch model would be overkill, but now that I've handled and transported it for a few days I'm not bothered by the size.  With that being said, if Amazon was to offer the high-res 15 inch model I would probably opt for that instead since there's little benefit of going from 1680x1050 to 1920x1200 in terms of application compatibility.On a side note, if you are considering a Warehouse deal via Amazon, I highly recommend it -- just make sure you choose the 'like-new' model.  These things are sealed, brand new with just some minor cosmetic damage to the retail packaging (or possibly none). $2163.99 for the 17-inch MBP is a deal.
