Horrible Returns Dept, Horrible Tech SupportWe received the Inspiron 7000 series laptop in mid-December 2013. (It hasn't worked since I got it!!!)The Blue Screen of Death started immediately.We ran a diagnostic that showed a hard drive malfunction, ordered and received a new hard drive on January 6th, 2014.Continued Blue Screen of Death, but with new shaky then frozen screen feature!Re-seated the hard drive and connections, to no avail.Spent 3 hours on a Tech Support call on approx. January 13th, 2014.Continued Blue Screen of Death.Spent 1 hour on Tech Support call on approx. January 17th, 2014.I asked, "What if this doesn't work?" I was scolded by the Tech Support guy, and told, "It WILL work. This WILL fix your problem!!" And not told what would happen next.He told me that the OS is corrupt.I was told I would receive a disc to re-install my Windows OS. It's been over 8 days, no disc. Daily calls about a "technical malfunction in sending your hardware, there's a delay in shipping." (Whatever THAT means?!)I called Customer Service for a refund or exchange. They REFUSE, because it's been over 30 days since buying the broken machine..... OF COURSE IT'S BEEN OVER 30 DAYS! I've spent the whole time since I bought it doing repairs. It NEVER worked. The Customer Service Returns Dept Manager HUNG UP ON ME after lecturing me about the 30 day return policy.*****I will be reporting Dell to the Attorney General of my state. It's free legal enforcement of customer protections. All states have one, search the internet for your state's office. Sometimes you can report a violation online in only a few minutes! *****Second option, depending on how the AG handles things, may be to Dell for a violation of the Warranty of Merchantability and whatever else my attorney (we have one on retainer) can tack on. I'm a paralegal.  I didn't come to play.
