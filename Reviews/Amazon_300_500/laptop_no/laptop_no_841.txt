This is my last and final toshiba. It has been nothing but trouble. Turning it on to Windows usually results in going directly to BIOS. Then play around to find out what I need to do to open Windows. cannot shutdown or restart without receiving fatal errors. I am now running out to buy an external hard drive because Windows cannot back-up and I now have a warning that my internal harddrive is about to crash and I need to back-up to an external drive. I have done all the fixes Toshiba has put out. Toshiba shows a healthy hard drive....wrong. I have an alert that says:Your HDD has the SMART Predict Failure function which monitors the HDD operating status. Your HDD is experiencing a problem and SMART monitoring software predicts that the HDD will fail. Toshiba strongly recommends you create a back-up for your HDD data. Then contact an authorized service provider in order to check your drive and purchase a new replacement drive if necessary. Apparently a lot of the machines have this problem from the updates or fixes I have been sent. Piece of crap!!!!!!!!!The crackling/stuttering sound is almost constant. BBuy should be shamed for recommending this when it first came out. I HATE IT.My tech guy said I'd have to call Toshiba and send it to them for repairs. For a teacher, this is a disaster.UPDATE:10/21/2011 Sent it back to Toshiba. Had problem taking delivery because Toshiba wanted a signature. The hours of delivery were during my work week. I wasn't going to drive 50 miles round trip to the nearset pick-up facility. Fortunately FEDEX was willing to deliver at night. The computer is working well, but the sound is starting to screech again. Having to download my Microsoft Office, Nuance, iTunes and all the other programs again was a hassle. Now I have to pick thru my files to restore them.
