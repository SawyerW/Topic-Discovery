We bought this laptop for a student & we LOVE it!!  It is perfect for what we need it for.  We got it for $299 at WalMart.com & the extended warranty too for $29.I was a bit nervous about it because another reviewer complained about the volume, but we find the volume to be fine.  It isn't going to shatter any windows, but it is perfectly fine for listening to music while computing, etc.  I wouldn't turn up the volume to listen to music across a room, but like I said, it is great for listening to music, while surfing the net, etc.  I will say I HATE WINDOWS 8 100%, but that is not a computer performance issue... that is an OS issue.If you want to listen to loud music get some decent plug in speakers & there you go.  For $300 you certainly can't expect so much.  It is a basic laptop that serves it purpose well for those seeking champagne on a beer budget.This is a great laptop for those on a tight budget... it has a good amount of RAM & a decent hard drive for the money... PLUS the hard drive can be expanded to increase capacity AND the RAM can be beefed up, which is a big plus in my book because we can update it before we need to replace it.So far it is a WIN, WIN!!  I will update down the road after we've had it for a while.-------------------------------------------UPDATE: 4-29-14This laptop has still been a great buy & we like it.  Yes, it is a cheap laptop, but it more than serves its purpose.  I was able to hook it via wifi to our printer which makes it even nicer not to have to use wires for that :).I love the airplane mode to keep it from constantly sending out signals for wifi, which we always use unless we need to use internet to reduce our exposure to EMFs, which also helps to reduce battery drainage.Great deal & investment overall!
