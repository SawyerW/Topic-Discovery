Ok, i know almost everyone here loves this product. I USED to love toshiba A215 too, i have this laptop for 2 years. However, i've been taking this laptop for a while at toshiba's computer techs. My laptop kept on shutting down out of no where, especially when I am doing my homework. It pisses me off because there were times that it doesn't shut down on my but it shuts down whenever I do an important homework. I can't even turn it on right away. The computer tech that went wasn't helpful at all. Toshiba's customer feedback wasn't helpful for me as well. However, if I turn on the electric fan and face it toward my laptop, at least it lasts longer. It's not convenient for me though. there are times I want to bring it at school I couldn't because of this issue.I have already made system restore twice as well. It didn't help but only gave me head aches. Then there are weird stuff that suddenly pops out on my screen when I turn it on like "may application. restore and cancel." I click restore and nothing happens? Like what is that?Also, my mouse pad on the center, out of nowhere too, it tells me that it stopped working. I just wonder why it tells me that. I didn't do anything it just stopped right away. Weird.the good things though, I really love this product when I saw first saw this. I am jealous of you guys who just bought it last year and had such a good feedback about it. I love the softwares, the speakers, the screen, looks of it, how it works except for the problems i've been having. But, if i didn't have those problems. I will recommend this product.The company might have made a new good ones though.
