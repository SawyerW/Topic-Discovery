I'm a first time Mac user. I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years. I was skeptical at first. I thought the price was outrageous, still do, but I am glad I invested in it. I considered another Windows computer, I particularly like Windows 8 and I saw a lot of decent options from HP well under the Mac pricepoint. I visited a few stores to try them both out. But I decided since I have an iphone and ipad, it would be easier to link everything together if I got the Mac, so I did. You won't regret it! Its an awesome beautiful computer. It does everything I need, its fast, and its user friendly. If I ever run into a problem, I generally find my answer in the Apple support forums. They're extremely helpful. As far as insurance its costly, I wouldn't go with anyone besides Applecare or Best Buy's geek squad. Other cheaper options available on other sites are not trustworthy to me, plus they make you ship your computer out of the country and you are usually left without for weeks. No thank you. Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac! If not, HPs are an awesome option as well, but consider lifespan and what type of user you are. Do your research!UPDATE:Still enjoying my Macbook Pro...considered trading for a newer model Macbook Air or Macbook pro w/retina. But after spending hours in the stores testing them out and reading reviews, I realized that although this model is older, it performs just as well as the newer models. The newer models are faster with downloading, but not a huge difference. I realized I would have to sacrifice features available on this model for thinness and faster downloading. Not worth the extra money I would have to spend and I'm comfortable knowing I could upgrade my 4GB ram to 8GB and my i5 to i7 whenever I want, if need be.  For me, this model works very very well and is not as heavy as it seems being compared to the Air or Macbook Pro Retina. She's a keeper!
