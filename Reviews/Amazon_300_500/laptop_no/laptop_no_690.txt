What can I say?  I bought my first iBook in 2001.  It worked so well, never crashed, never caught a virus, that I can see no reason to own a PC, at ALL.  When it was time to get a new one (not because my iBook was gone, but because I wanted a DVD burner and a faster computer) I chose the Macbook.  I opted to go with the 160 Gig HD, but I maxed out the RAM.All I can say about this computer is WOW.  I'm as happy, or happier than I was with my iBook.I have used PC's all my life, until I got my iBook, and in fact, still use them at work, and my husband still won't give his up.  But I get frustrated, upset and it always seems to me that to get from point "A" to point "B" on a PC, you have to go around the block three times, to get to the same place you can on a Mac by going next door.  It's that easy.This computer is snappy.  It boots up, and down really fast.  I like the hard plastic case, it's very durable.  One of the things I really like about my new MacBook is the two finger scroll on the track pad.  It took me a few weeks to get used to it, but it's so natural now, and I really love this feature.The magnetic cord is very cool, we will see how long it lasts, since the one thing I did have to replace twice on my iBook was the power cord.  Wireless connectivity has been wonderful,and not only do I pick up my signal, I pick up all my neighbors as well and I live out in the country.  The battery on it seems to last about 4 to 5 hours.I've already done some tuning up to make it run even faster than it already did.I'm finding I am really enjoying the shiny screen.OSX is such a nice system to learn to use, if you are new to Mac's, it won't take you long to get up to speed.I never considered getting the Macbook Pro or Air because of the sort of computing I do, but both have their great qualities, but don't discount this little computer either, it's a well made machine that makes computing fun, not frustrating!
