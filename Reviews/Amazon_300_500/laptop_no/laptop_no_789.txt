I bought the UL30VT-A1 for use as a school/work computer. My current PC is a desktop that I built a few years ago and, consequently, has seen better days; I can't trust it to turn on when I need to crank out a paper or print an assignment. I'll keep it brief.The Pros:- Battery Life is as good as advertised. I get ten hours out of this thing easily listening to music, downloading over a wireless network and word processing. Simply and amazing battery/processor combination.- This computer is not just an energy sipper, though. It has enough graphics horsepower to run starcraft 2 on medium at 30 FPS without overclocking.- Pretty large HDD, even if it is only spinning at 5400 RPM.- Aesthetics: It's brushed aluminum cover, while not really solid feeling (Thin sheet of aluminum), makes it look pretty snazzy. Black chicklet keyboard set in the silver stock looks very reminiscent of a macbook pro. On a side note, it's pretty easy to buy a backlit keyboard and install it into the UL30VT so you can type in the dark.The Cons:- Glossy screen. I hate glossy screens, but this one seems to be particularly atrocious. Not only do reflections distract all the time, but the viewing angle of the actual LCD is pretty bad, too. Takes a lot of adjusting and fine tuning to get a movie to look good. Forget about showing a bunch of friends a video.- Built in webcam is poor as well. Resolution and frame rate. .3 megapixels in 2010? Really? My Motorola Razr could do that 6 years ago.-No support for graphics switching in Linux.. :(Really, though, it's a great computer. I don't take my power cord with me anymore 'cause I just don't need it. I'd highly recommend this computer. Even though it was released a long time ago (relatively) I think it's still one of the best laptops on the market. I have fun poking fun at my friends who lug their 5 Lb. 'portables' around only to have them die after an hour of being unplugged. Experience the freedom! Buy one today!
