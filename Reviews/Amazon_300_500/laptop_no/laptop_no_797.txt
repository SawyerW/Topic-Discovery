My laptops get a lot of use; they are my connection to work as well as my entertainment center for the most part.  So I go through a laptop about every year due to failure (Toshiba) or preventable damage (Sony).  I have moved away from the more expensive laptops due to not wanting to worry about being too rough on the thing.  Last year I decided to switch manufactures and try HP, again.  I had been using various Sony and Toshiba laptops in the six years since I had last owned an HP, which was also a Presario and nothing but problems.I chose the 615DX after doing a little research and determining that this was the best bang for the buck that would also fit my needs.  I am not a gamer, engineer, or rocket scientist, so I certainly didn't need a $1000+ laptop to simultaneously render streaming X-Files episodes while I play Warcraft with my internet friends.  The 615DX has been an excellent laptop.The video is solid for watching movies and television; the wide screen is great.  However, the video output is a little under powered to run to an external monitor or television for running split screen or whatever.  I have done limited video editing on it and haven't noticed any serious lag time.The touch pad is very user friendly.  I am not sure how I feel about the full keyboard (it has a number pad), but it is not a bad thing.  There isn't a storage device card reader, but I picked up a multi-card reader for about $5 that plugs into one of the three usb ports. Could use a volume interface.Battery life could be better.  Fan runs a little loud. But whatever. This wouldn't deter me from getting another HP like this.I don't remember how much I bought it for, but I do remember thinking it was a steal.
