I really disliked this laptop when I first got it. It was so different than the larger laptop I was used to. It's difficult at first to type on because the touch pad is extremely sensitive. You can turn the touchpad off and use a regular mouse by double tapping the top left corner of the touchpad. However, that feature wasn't working for me until recently. There are music controls that allow you to turn the volume up, down, and mute. There is also video controls (forward, play pause, rewind)You do have to hold down the FN button located next to the CTRL button on the left at the same time to use these controls. I also like the internet button located next to the wifi button at the top, it opens your default browser when pressed. Another plus is that this laptop doesn't have flat keys that will easily pop off. After 2 months of using this laptop It became easier to use. I chose this over my larger laptop because it's more convenient to move around and use. The battery doesn't last very long, just about 2 hours for me. I use it for music, email, facebook, and online classes. If you need a laptop that will have a good battery life (for traveling) I wouldn't recommend this one. Also, I had some compatibility issues with a game (Sims2) but the game still ran fast and with some adjustments it was fine. It's worth looking into the video card before buying if you play a lot of games. For basic home use it is great, I only use this laptop now. I would buy another one if I needed to. It takes some time to get used to but overall it is a good little laptop to have around.
