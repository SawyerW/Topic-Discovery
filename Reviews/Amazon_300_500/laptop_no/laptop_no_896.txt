I bought this laptop a few weeks ago for multiple reasons as a personal computer at home and one I can take around with me and a gaming PC. The Samsung 7 series does all of that, its fast enough to handlegames, run a visual c++ compiler while having many IE and chrome windows open playing streaming music from youtube, netflix and facebook. This laptop so far has been the best PC investment I have ever had.When I recieved the package the laptop plugged in and started up no problems at all, Windows 7 comes setup and ready to go I loaded my applications and software and I was using for all intended purposes right off the bat. The size of this laptop is big although its a 17" screen size they have done remarkably well putting the 1.5TB drive, exceptional graphics card and memory all on one package, offering such handy perks as back lit keyboard selectable modes, great sound and video performance. The display is awesome clear and bright, I was able to go into each mode without disrupting any programs or connections I had going.The layout of the keyboard is also handy in that its a full size keyboard very little signs of minimizing, although I dont see myself carrying this around the house I do see its easy to throw my bag and take on a trip with me.I was skeptical at first on the gaming side as I did not know a laptop could handle such a graphics intense game such as Battlefield 3, this game runs great better than my desktop and much higher than my expectations. Playing flawlessly on it, getting aroud 70FPS+ during game play, I am usually running one of the best ping times and even with programs running in the background I have not had an issue so far.The sound quality is very good, although I usually use headsets, when I have used the speakers they are ery clear and can be quite loud.One thing I did see as a nuisance was the placement of usb ports and the ethernet/power ports they were all on one side rather than centrally located which makes cable management a bit tricky.I have not used this on battery power or moved it around much so its been sitting in one place mainly for use so not much to report there.I have a laptop cooler platform so I am not sure how cool it runs.
