I'll start this review pointing out that this Chromebook had some operating system bugs back when it first arrived in January 2013. Over the first two months and many automatic updates later, I have a smooth operating, 6+ hour battery life, fantastic machine.The gap between Chromebooks and traditional mac/pc's is slimmer than many people make it out to be. Yes this machine cannot do much offline aside from watching previously downloaded video on the 15 gb drive or using the google editing suite as long as it is installed (docs, presentations, spreadsheets). Comparing what most people use their mac/pc's for when internet is not available, the typical user will have similar if not identical useability.My biggest highlight of this machine is the stability of the Chrome operating system. Malware, viruses, and other problems that bog down pc's (and mac's to a lesser degree) don't do a single blessed thing to performance of my Chromebook. I'll make a guess this is thanks to the unique cloud software setup from Google that keeps viruses at bay, and performance at a high and stable level.For $250, you will not find a comparable computer with performance or parts that can keep up. The 6+ hour battery keeps me up and working (or playing :p) much longer than I had before. This chromebook is a great jumping point as a second computer for the traveling professional, or even a primary machine for the typical internet browsing person.What this is for:- web browsing- word editing (through google docs)- use of web applications- online video up to 720p (1080p works but I notice that the frame rate per second is a little slow for my liking)What this is NOT for:- complex data editing (excel, access, other database software that is not available)- photo editing (again, not isntallable software)- games that require high amounts of RAM and CPU power
