I was very surprised to see current reviews on this machine! This thing was born over a half a decade ago!Well, I bought mine because I wanted a separate dev box outside of my 2011 Macbook Pro. I love my MBP, but I already have it setup with Bootcamp (Windows 7), I didn't want to load another OS on it (space is starting to get tight), plus I wanted something that would function as a sort of mini-server for my own personal projects. Finally, I wanted something I could lug around without worrying about breaking it, so I bought this thing.I really couldn't be happier! I decided to replace the existing HDD with a 50 gig SSD that I found at Micro Center (Denver)  for $39 on clearance. I also replaced the battery with an Anker battery which I bought here on Amazon for $40. I loaded her up with Ubuntu and this thing zips right along! ~$180 might seem a little pricey for a 6 year old laptop, but considering this total includes SSD and a brand new battery, I'm quite pleased. SSD is more energy efficient and Ubuntu is fairly lightweight (compared to Windows), so I get a little over 4 hours of battery life which is certainly acceptable for this machine.The display is surprisingly nice and has very little glare, so it's easier on my eyes when compared to the MBP. The trackpad is nice, but not as nice as the MBP trackpad (but what is?). I like all the clicking options - I can touch the trackpad or use the buttons above or below the trackpad. The red tracking button on the keyboard is great and was quite easy to get used to.This thing is a joy to hack around on! SSD is a must, so I recommend throwing a small SSD in it if you can. The 50 gig drive I have now is small, but it's perfect for my needs as I really only use this as a dev box (I use my MBP for things like games, media, etc). Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, the hinges do suck a bit.It's heavy and ugly, but that's how I like it.
