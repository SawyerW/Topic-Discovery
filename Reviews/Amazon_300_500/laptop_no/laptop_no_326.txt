I bought my laptop direct from HP.  I found the comments here while looking for something else for my g7, and felt I needed to leave a review.  I own a high end Envy and a tx2 as well, but my g7 has proven to be a work horse and is used on a daily basis.  The comments on upgrading ram are right on the money.  I immediately upgraded to 8 gb of ram which made this laptop even faster and helped it run a bit cooler as well.  I bought a high end Envy laptop for gaming, but haven't used it yet, as I'm still using the g7 because I've been to lazy to reinstall everything.  WANT TO MAKE IT EVEN FASTER?  I very recently bought a hybrid drive, but returned it because if you aren't always doing the same tasks, it will continue learning and wont be much help with speed.  I was turned on to loving an SSD Drive because my Envy came with duel drives ( 1 SSD, 1 HDD ).  I bought a SSD for my g7 and the speed is unbelievable.  The laptop was already very fast, but running the most taxing of games after the SSD install, is very smooth.  There are no wait times, lagging, glitches, freezing, or hang times.  Buy what ever brand you are partial to, but the point is that installing a SSD will significantly speed up this system.  For those who are wondering, this laptop will handle all the latest games such as Thief, Saints Row 3 and 4, COD-Ghosts, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, and so on.  It will also handle high end video software and autocad software.  And no, I don't work for HP and nor am I endorsed, I tend to leave good reviews on good products that are affordable but don't lack in quality.
