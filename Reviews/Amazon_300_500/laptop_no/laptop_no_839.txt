While I believe the Lenovo to be a reliable laptop, I am SO angry at being duped by Ocean Reef Electronics. I had a minor problem easily resolved, by Lenovo support, but when I casually asked them to confirm my three-year warranty beginning in April 2012 when I purchased the laptop, their answer astonished and enraged me. Ocean Reef Electronics is not a Lenovo Business Partner so Lenovo will not honor the warranty - at all. When I confronted Ocean Reef Electronics about this problem, here's what they responded. And, since I found out only now, four months after buying the laptop, that Lenovo won't honor the warranty, I can't even buy one from Square Deal because you have to buy it within 90 days of purchasing the laptop. I am SOL. Shame on Amazon for allowing these folks to market on their site.Let this be a warning to everyone - be sure to check warranty info before buying a computer from a third party!From: Ocean Reef Electronics - Amazon Marketplace [mailto:3fjnphl74tw6gvp@marketplace.amazon.com]Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2012 4:05 PMTo:Subject: Re: RE: USB portDear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting us.All orders have a 30 day return policy.
