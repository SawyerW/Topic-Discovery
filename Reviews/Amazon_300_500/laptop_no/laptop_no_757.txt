Why I wouldn't buy this PC again.Like all electronics, just because it happens to one, does not mean it will happen to everyone. I know that I'm not stupid, but a fair amount of things have happened to this PC that make me raise an eyebrow at it's hardware.Issues (in order-)1. The ac adapter died.After 11 months of good computer service, my adapter died. The replacement was roughly $95.002. The fan broke.After a year and a half (from the time I bought it) the fan broke and was hitting the side. Since I was still under warranty, HP covered it.3. The battery went badOver a year and a half the battery didn't hold a charge for more then 30 minutes. OH! And I had to talk to about twelve people from HP, and seven told me warranty covered it, the rest said it wasn't the battery was about $80 I believe.4. My computer had an error and would not respond.Exactly a week after my two year mark (warranty expired at that time) My computer had an error that made it not respond. When I called HP it would cost $300.00 to repair it. After slewing through countless internet help sites I found something that fixed it...in two minutes.5. My computer had a different error that told me my windows was counterfeit. HP put me on hold for an hour, but as soon as they had my information (telling them I was out of warranty) they all but hung up on me. I called Microsoft and I had to hold a little longer but my computer was fixed...FOR FREE.Honestly this computer has had far more problems in two years then computers I've had to five. I have a computer from 2003 that is a tank, but this computer is a cheap plastic imitation of what a "entertainment pc" should be. I don't know if I'd ever buy a HP again, but I know it would not be this one.
