The description says HP Webcam and Youcam software but it's no on the laptop. I am still satisfied with the purchase given I got it as a Black Friday deal and am using it more like a Netbook for surfing the Internet, networking and checking email. My more powerful tasks that require more memory will remain on another laptop, but this one is more portable and has better battery life.Likes:1. Lightweight2. Good battery life3. Nice 16:9 widescreen - graphics are HD quality.4. Windows 7 - it's nifty5. Number pad on the keyboard6. button to turn wifi off and power button are the only 2 buttons on this machine7. lightscribe8. Cost - got this for $197 during Black Friday!! That's the best part!9. Not filled with a bunch of crap software I won't use. Thank you HP. :)10. Easily connected to my wireless HP printer in one easy step11. Connected immediately to my home network with no problems12. Straight out of the box and was using it in 2 minutes!13. Slick integrated mouse pad design with lock button - easy to use.14. Appears to be expandable to 4gb.Challenges:1. volume is either controlled by the mouse on the tool bar or by using the function key and a volume key - no slide like other HP laptops2. no locking mechanism, the screen just folds down but doesn't latch to the keyboard like others3. Only one headphone jack, no sharing4. no docking station port! It will not fit my existing docking station :(5. no webcam for those who think it's on here.Also includes - 5 in one card reader (not CF cards though), an HDMI port, monitor port, 3 usb ports and the standard ports for ethernet and modems.All in all, a good value for what I paid for it and even a good value for the current price it's being sold at. Really only lacks blueray, the docking station port and the webcam to be more flexible but I can do without those things for this price.
