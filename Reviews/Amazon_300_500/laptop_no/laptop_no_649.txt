Acer Aspire S7-191-6640 11.6-Inch Touchscreen UltrabookI've owned this ultrabook for several months now.  I love it.  I have a big, fast desktop w/ a 30" Dell (2960x1600) monitor but find myself using this little gem.  It's kind of like a minicooper, i.e., fun to drive.I love the screen rez and the quickness. I attach the extra battery and leave it plugged in when I'm home.  That makes it ready to go on the road.I use Start menu 8 (making 8 look like 7) because Win 8  has little or no advantage for me and I'm not into relearning for no gain.I use a 64GB micro SD card (permanently resident in the machine), have a 1TB external drive (only plugged in when I heed stuff xfered from the big machine) and an external blu-ray player writer (just for fun).If I could only buy an extra add-on battery and take it with me when I'm not near power, I'd figure this was a decent work-around for the crummy battery life.Anyone know where to get such an extra battery?Found one here for $150! [...]  yikes!Bad stuff:The keyboard has shallow action which requires some getting used to.I've turned off the track pad (Fn + T keys) and use the mouse so that my hand doesn't activate the track pad when I'm typing.  Plus it difficult to impossible to choose a small item with the end of your finger. So, I prefer and use a mouse.The bluetooth mouse that comes with the ultrabook doesn't always connect quickly or well but I've learned how to compensate.Bottom line: I like the machine and am glad I bought it.  I'm hoping new battery technology and Intel's new lower-power processors will allow mfgrs to improve the time away from being plugged in.Extra comment: I wish MS would stop making changes that produce little or no user advantages but are just different.  I think we all know that they'd love to take over the world and have their system used on our phones, tablets and computers.  If they had a real one-size-fits-all system, that would be fine.  They missed that mark with Win 8.
