A fantastic machine with many fine qualities and only a few negatives.The good stuff:- That bullet-proof Thinkpad build quality- The ease with which you can accomplish any upgrade.  Add RAM, a 2nd hard drive, an mSata SSD, all easy as pie.- Fantastic support.  Keyboard breaks?  They'll ship you a new one and its easy to install.- Fantastic keyboard.  Simply the best typing feel, and the layout is near perfect.- A high quality trackpad that works properly, including palm rejection that MANY other PCs simply can't get right.- The fabulous red isopoint that you can use if you want- Very very fast- Decent battery life for what it is- Great screen- The machine stays cool and quiet under all conditions- There is a great dock for this machine available if you use it on a desk a lot.The not-so good:- The speakers are really quite mediocre.  Even in a quiet hotel room you might have trouble hearing some dialog on a TV show or movie you watch.- Some of the crapware included with these machines is just there to increase the boot time.  Spend some time and clean some of this stuff out.- It really is big and heavy, and the 170W power brick really is relatively gigantic- To my mind its time for ALL laptops to ship with small mSata boot SSDs alongside rotating media drives for your data.  The good news is you can configure this machine that way easily after you buy the SSD.  But there should be options to have Lenovo ship it that way.- Like others I really preferred the old 1920x1200 displays that you can't buy any more in the big 16:9 movement- The docks that Lenovo sells now are kind of crappy compared to the older ones.  Given the cheap plastic they make them out of now I'm not sure attaching a security cable to the dock really accomplishes a whole lot.
