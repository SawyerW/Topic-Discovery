This laptop is truly designed with ultimate quality and performance.You can customize the colors from top to bottom with each having the ability to have a different color.Performance is fantastic for anyone wanting to use this for games or use it for multiple virtual machines (which is what i use it for.I easily added another 16 gig ram giving me a total of 24gb.  The laptop supports up to 32 gb.  Coarse I may try pushing the limit one day to see if i can go above the 32gb as I have done with other systems that stated max ram of 8gb.It has 3 drive bays.  2 are 2.5 hard drive bays and the 3rd is a mSata drive bay.  I have always made sure i had 2 hard drives in order to use raid and I was astounded to read you could put in 3 256 SSD drives.This laptop is also a desktop replacement and has a full keyboard.The brushed aluminium that adds the quality all laptops should have and the palm rest is smooth but not glossy and if you do leave a finger print on the palm rest, it is hardly seen and you can easily rub them out by using 2 fingers over themLaptops that have glossy tops and palm rests really look aweful after using them one time.  You won't get that with this laptop.Oh and did i mention the backlit keyboard and the number pad can have a different color backlit than the rest of the keyboard.Almost forgot!  The touchpad will light up to any color you chose.4 usb 3.0 portsLed screen is easy to read.I am very satisfied with this laptop after only using it a few days.It's design is a piece of fine art.Kudo's to the designers and Dell for producing this well made laptop.Note:  the additional hard drives require a special mini sata angle adapter.
