I bought this laptop for work and after several months of owning it here are my impressions of it.In terms of external features, this laptop seems to offer a good bit, sporting an HDMI and VGA port, USB 3.0 port, multitouch track pad and a Webcam. Overall, the features are very good for the price you pay for it.Internal's on this laptop are on par with other budget laptops. Intel Pentium processor, 2-4GB of RAM and Intel integrated graphics wont hold up running AutoCAD or Photoshop very well but handle essential business apps like Outlook, Word and internet browsing just fine. Some apps like VLC can take up to 20 seconds to load but after loading, they run without issue.Overall construction isn't the best ive ever seen but its certainly not the worst. Laptop manufacturers these days have moved away from making laptops out of tough matte casing that lasts for years to shiny casing that looks good in-store but holds up poorly in day-to-day use. The casing on this laptop skips the gloss but still attracts some fingerprints and the screen is also glossy though a screen protector should fix that. Overall I've found the casing to be better than other budget laptops but still nothing compared to the casing found on proper business laptops (think Dell Precision and HP EliteBook). However you get what you pay for and for the money its not that bad.The laptop ships with Windows 7 Home Premium and there isn't too much to be said here in terms of features. The laptop is slowed somewhat by bloatware and the 64bit flavor of Windows 7. However if you're willing to get your hands dirty, re-installing Windows in the 32bit flavor and leaving out the bloatware should speed things up considerably.Overall you get what you pay for. For the money this laptop is one of the best deals on the market and with a few tweaks on the software side, this laptop will be a perfect companion for basic computing tasks.
