I have had it now for a couple weeks and for the most part it is a great laptop. I like the desktop wallpaper option that allows you to make it a slideshow of as many pics as you want in different time intervals. this computer boots in mere seconds which is awesome compared to some computers that take up to 10 minutes in some cases like my moms dell desktop which is so underpowered its crazy. she bought it on a home shopping network channel. trust me thats a bad idea on buying computers. anyway my computer is very fast and i like windows 7. its also HD so you can watch movies online or HD youtube videos that are available in HD actually in HD. only one complaint. when watching a streaming movie on DIVX it does have an issue with not completely stretching all the way to full screen on DIVX windowed mode when connected to a widescreen television. at least the one tv that i tried it on. thats not a huge complaint though as I dont usually use this computer for movie watching connected to a tv. I will be using it as my mobile internet laptop for work and elsewhere on the go. I also will be upgrading this computer to 8 gigs of ram although it really doesnt need it as it really is a fast computer but hey its going to get even faster. I love that it can be upgraded to 8 gigs.UPDATE: its only been two or 3 weeks now but now my internal speakers do not work. I redownloaded the sound driver from toshiba but they still do not work. the headphone jack works and external speakers will work to but it sucks that the internal speakers that are on this computer decided to stop working so quickly. I went online and it is an issue with Toshiba laptops.
