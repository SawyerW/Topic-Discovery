I've owned a few Apple portable computers over the years, starting with the PowerBook 100 through the MacBook Pro 15".  The MacBook Air with the SSD option is great.I love the thin profile, light weight and speed of this computer.  In the 2 weeks since it arrived from Amazon, I've been streaming my iMac's iTunes library (music and video) to the Air, watching YouTube, general Internet use, email, gaming (Quake III and Pangea Arcade.)The system is very responsive and doesn't really heat up much unless I'm playing a game or watching video (iTunes or YouTube) for a while.  The fan is pretty quiet and quickly ramps down when the processor idles back.  The LED-backlit screen is great as is the backlit keyboard.  Typing is a pleasure with this keyboard and I thought I wouldn't like it from the pictures.As many have pointed out, it would be nice to have easier access to the USB port.  I happen to have an extension USB cable that I use to connect a 32GB thumb drive.  The thumb drive casing is too large to fit the port otherwise.  I'm planning on getting the Air Superdrive soon.  However, using Remote Disc from my iMac was super easy and trouble free.Battery life seems fine, as I'm getting about 4 to 5 hours if I'm conservative with the backlight.  This is with WiFi on and Bluetooth off.  We have an Airport Extreme (dual network) base station and I'm getting full network connectivity throughout the house.I do wish the vents on the back/underside were a bit different, as they appear to be prone to getting covered up if not on a flat surface.  I'll be getting iWork and Photoshop Elements 8 in a few days and will see how those apps work.  I haven't connected my Canon EOS 40D camera yet, but expect the Air to be a great traveling companion to the camera.All in all, I'm a very satisfied owner of the MacBook Air.  Amazon was a pleasure to order from as usual.
