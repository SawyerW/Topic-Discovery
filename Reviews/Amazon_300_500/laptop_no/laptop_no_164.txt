There will always be less expensive notebooks out there, but Apple continues to provide laptops that look dead sexy and have enough power to back their looks up.  Could I have found a Windows computer with comparable or better specs for less money?  Yes.  Would it have been as insanely sleek as the Macbook Pro with the battery life to match the MBP?  Absolutely not.  Buy an extended battery to get 7 hours of battery life out of your HP lappy and it becomes twice as thick and close to twice as heavy.  With no aluminum unibody.The only drawback is of course that the battery is not removable, so you could probably buy two normal sized batteries for a Windows computer and swap them, but your still having to carry something extra to achieve the battery life.  I am happy with the battery life I get on it and since Ive never owned a second battery for a laptop anyway i don't feel like I'm missing out.Also, just a sidenote, the reported battery life for the new Macbooks is only 7 hours wheras before they were reporting 10.  I'm happy to report that my 2011 MBP gets as long of life as my Dad's 1mo old 2010 MBP.  I read from a few different sources that Apple is testing the batteries using a more realistic method.  I have gotten about eight hours out of it so far.Pros:StyleThin and LightLong Battery LifeHD webcam"chiclet" keyboard (this is pretty subjective though)durable aluminum unibody (when they initially came out with this style in 2008 I thought it sounded gimmicky, but it is actually a solid way to build a laptop)giant trackpadCons:non swappable batteryprice stayed the same as 2010 model.  I was kinda hoping they would come down a little bit now that they have had plenty of time to perfect manufacturing processes/quality"glass" trackpad and screen (really some kind of compound material) can crack if you do something stupid, but just dont abuse the computer and it will be fine
