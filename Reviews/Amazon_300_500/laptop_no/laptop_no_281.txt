it is unfortunate that i've had similar problems with alex (1 star review)it was a nice and light laptop. thin, sleek. many people complain about the cheap feel or (see youtube) build but this wasn't an issue for me. i really really liked it.unfortunately, the first issue was wifi connectivity. within an hour or two of usage at home, my connection cuts off so i had to restart my laptop. the funny/weird thing was that ever since i had connectivity issues with my laptop, my roommate also had connectivity issues (maybe the card transmits and jams the signal? i don't know for sure...) but this was something i could live with. anyway, rebooting the laptop is a very very quick process (no exaggeration)!the second issue was that when i turned it on to watch netflix, my laptop took more than an hour to turn on. previous to this, it was working normally, so what happened was just bizarre to me. windows was trying to fix itself and then it later resumed normal operation. that same night i made sure to reboot it to see if this issue would occur again but to my relief at the time, it was working well again. however, the morning after, the same issue surfaced again. i was advised by the acer support team to perform a recovery; however, this didn't work out so well either. the recovery failed. the os was supposed to be stored within a partition in the hard drive but upon recovery, it couldn't access it anymore. i just didn't want to go through the hassle of buying the cd and a cd drive to try to fix something that got broken within a month.if you are the owner of a working acer aspire s3, that's great. it's just unfortunate that i received a defective product.
