Before I purchased this one from Amazon, I replaced my desktop computer with a very similar Dell Inspiron that I purchased off of Craigslist from someone that found it was just too big and heavy to be lugging around as a laptop.  I killed that one by accidentally spilling a bottle of PowerAde all over it (PowerAde doesn't give more power to computers :-))  So, obviously I like the computer, since I've purchased it twice.  Here's the ups and downs from this one that I purchased on Amazon.LOVE/STILL LOVE:- Big screen, with clear picture- Full Keyboard with numbers pad- Great space-saving alternative to a desktop- Good audioNOT SO GOOD:- I miss my old one - this one came with Windows 8, which I absolutely hate. Not intuitive, everything is automatically linked to make MSN and Bing your main portals (email, search, people, news, etc. buttons --- all going to their sites.  Looked for a way to change it - but couldn't find one.  It's just a pain, and I don't know why Dell let Microsoft's desires win out over customer ease of use.- I generally always hate setting up a computer with the software I use, apps and bookmarks all over again... (thus, buying them from people that have already loaded them with MS Office, etc.)  The lack of easy user interface on this one, made that process even more painful.- It's big. It's heavy. To me, it really is, for the most part my home computer.  Easy enough to move around the house, and occasionally take on a road trip - but, I wouldn't ever plan on using this as my regular "carting it around the world" on a regular basis laptop.BOTTOM LINE: Great computer with all the features, speed and a nice big screen for movie watching that make it worth the cost, brought down by Dell putting Windows 8 on it and making the user interface so difficult to use.
