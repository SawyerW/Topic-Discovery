I custom-ordered from the Lenovo/Thinkpad site.  My configuration:Thinkpad X230 Tablet+ Core i7 2.90 GHz Ivy Bridge processor+ 8 GM RAM+ 128 GB Solid-State Drive+ 1366x768 Matte Multi-Touch Screen with Active Stylus+ 9-cell extended battery (sticks out the back and adds a bulge at the bottom; the 6-cell battery just sticks out the back)+ Windows 7 Pro+ Ultra-Base 3 with DVD/RW optical drive- No discrete graphics card optionI've been a long-time Thinkpad fan--including 600E (late 1990s), R40 (early 2000s), T42 (mid 2000s), T420 (late 2000s)--for the rock-solid dependability, non-nonsense styling, and in particular the king-of-them-all keyboard. I mistakely tried a Dell Latitude E6400 for a couple of years, and I truly hated it, despite its own pointer stick and solid construction. When I decided to get this X230 Tablet, the only thing I was worried about was how the new keyboard was going to feel. Well, have no fear. I am a big fan of the new keyboard. It's got deep travel, its motion is the perfect blend between smooth travel and pleasing resistance, and the contoured surface actually feels comforable. This new keyboard is a winner. Other than that, there really isn't anything that needs to be said about this machine that the prospective buyer wouldn't already know. I loaded it up to the gills with the fastest and best of everything, except a 3G cellular card--totalled over $3000 MSRP before a the Ultrabase 3 and extra power adapters. On paper, the only thing the X230T lacks is discrete graphics, but the Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics that comes with the Ivy Bridge chipset is good enough for my occasional Engineering analysis and 3D modeling work--just make sure to get a least 8 GB RAM to share with the inegrated graphics. Plus, the Ultrabase 3 is able to support dual monitors via its dual VGA+DisplayPort ports. Just one final tip--get the Multitouch screen; you'll be ready for Windows 8 Pro when it's released.2012-11-24 UPDATE: I installed Windows 8 Pro upgrade on this computer the week Windows 8 was released.  On the first boot-up, everything worked.  I the installed all the Lenovo-provided Windows 8 drivers for this machine, and everything continued to work fine.  Windows 8 works very well on this machine, as if it was designed for it.
