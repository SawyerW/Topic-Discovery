I would guess you are either a fan of chromebooks or not, or perhaps you are just curious about what they are and how they work.  I bought my first chromebook used off ebay summer of 2012 and it became a staple around my house.  It took a while for it to catch on with all the family members. but once it did, it saw a lot of use.  There is currently 4 of us living at home and we have 7 other laptops in the house as well as a 7 inch android tablet and 4 large screen android smart phones.  Even with all these other internet access tools handy the chromebook is very well used and loved by all.  It really does do most of what we want and it is quick and simple to use.  If fact, my oldest son who is away at college needed something to take to class with him, so I offered to send him the chromebook since I could easily slip it into a padded envelope and send it on it's way.  I woke up the next morning regretting my decision so much that I immediately started looking for a new chromebook.  I just found everything else such a bother that every time I wanted to do something on the internet, I just didn't, becauseI did not have my chromebook handy.  That's when I bought this one.  My first chromebook was the first series Samsung, so I stuck with the Samsung line, and I am very happy with it.  I just love the form factor and simple design.  Everything on it works just the way I want it to.  I've had a lot of laptops over the years and I do not know that I have ever had one I enjoy as much as my chromebook.  It cannot do everything my full featured laptops do, but it does do most of what I need and what it can do it does very well.
