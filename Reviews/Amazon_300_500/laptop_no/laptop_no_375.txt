Longtime mac user here--over 20 years. I use PC's too (only when I have to, lol!). My first laptop was a Macbook Lombard purchased new in 1998 for about $2,800. This new MBA is 10 times the machine for about a 1/3 of the price. FWIW, my Macbook Lombard served me well for over NINE YEARS, and is still is use by a good friend!! Try that with a Windoze machine....I currently own a 2010 Macbook Pro 13", a 2011 Macbook Air 11", a 2012 Macbook Air 13", and just a few days ago I got the newest MBA 13" with the Haswell chipset. The battery on this newest version life is astonishing! They are not exaggerating when they say 12 hours--I get that and more! Seems like twice the battery life of my 2012 MBA.Other noticeable differences between my 2012 13" and my 2013 13":Screen is better (brighter/crisper)Speakers are betterWifi is fasterGraphics are fasterThe only thing close to a downside is that some tests show the new Haswell processor is about 5-10% slower than the previous i5 processor, but, I don't see a performance  difference at all (I think this is largely offset by the much improved flash drives in the newest models) and even if I did, it is a price I'm more than willing to pay for the amazing boost in battery life. If you're buying an Air, more than likely it's because you're highly portable, and having a highly portable laptop with less than great battery life doesn't make much sense. These new Haswell processors solve that problem.I like my Macbook Pro 13", and for a long time I thought the Air's were kind of an expensive novelty that didn't even include an optical drive! However, these days I place a high value on portability, and nothing comes close to the Macbook Airs. I picked up a superdrive for $75, even though I rarely use it. (I also have an iMac 24" for burning)Lastly, for those who are agonizing about whether to get an 11" or 13", as someone who owns both, I can say this: get the 13"!At the end of the day, they weigh about the same (the 13" only weighs 6 ounces more than the 11") and the 13", while it's only 1" wider and 1.4" deeper than the 11", the difference in usability/visibility of the screen is HUGE. I really wanted the 11" to be enough--its small size is awesome (being about the same size and weight of an iPad but it's actually a real computer) but I finally had to admit that the 13" just has soooo much more screen real estate for a very small increase in footprint/size/weight. Both fit easily into a laptop backpack or shoulder bag and they're so light that you hardly notice you're carrying them, but the larger screen of the 13" easily wins out over the coolness of the 11"'s smaller form factor IMHO.
