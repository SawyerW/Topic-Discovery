I bought this laptop just a few weeks ago from a different seller but returned it back just after a week's use. This laptop is having numerous issues with it. I found it nothing more, but just an upgraded version of Compaq Presario CQ62-410US 15.6-Inch Notebook.1) Its a bit heavy than other laptops in its class which makes carrying it a pain.2) The mouse-pad feels too clumsy, sticky and irritating while using it.3) Out of 4 GB of total Memory, the system uses around 1.5 GB of Memory just for graphics which actually slows down its performance while doing multiple things at parallel (Multi (3-4) window internet browsing, Skype Chatting, Powerpoint Slides etc.)4)5200 RPM Hard disk drive further adds up to its slow performance along with number of unwanted and useless programs installed on it.5) The most important issue, that I faced with this Laptop was its wireless/network card. Just after 2-3 days of use I started facing problems with its wireless connectivity as many times the wireless wouldn't work while starting the laptop and it took around 2-3 re-start for the system to actually detect the wireless card. Sometimes after 2-3 hours of use the problem of wireless connection dropping would re-surface again and required re-start. I tried to figure out if this issue was due to my router, but then my Old Dell laptop was working fine using the same wireless router connection. Sees to me that the wireless card on this laptop has some-sort of compatibility issue either with hardware or with windows 7 itself.6) I also experienced heating issues after a prolonged use of 3-4 hrs also with the king of usage that I have the average battery life after full charge came out to be 3.5 Hrs.To sum up, if you count on my experience with this laptop, then avoid buying this Laptop and go for other brands. At $399 its NOT A WORTH, you can find many other alternatives below $400 here in Amazon itself.
