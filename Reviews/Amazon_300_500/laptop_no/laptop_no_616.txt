Like most of the reviews, I purchased this during the $200 lightning deal and thought it was a great bargain. I wanted a laptop that could handle simple word processing tasks and online video/music playback, primarily YouTube and other flash sites. This thing struggles worst than my older single core Pentium laptop with 1gb of ram. Did I get a defective unit? is this a Windows 8 issue? Well I thought it was Windows 8, I was wrong. Ive tried installing Windows 7 and Ubuntu, both show horrible CPU/video performance. I am not talking about 1080p video playback, it struggles on 360p videos on YouTube with no other applications running. At 720p, CPU usage spikes to 100% for the first 30seconds and remains steadily at 60-75% after. This is my first experience with an AMD APU processor, and would never consider buying a laptop with one again. My friends netbook with an Atom processor can handle flash, I am still unsure if my unit is defective.Cons:- unable to handle video playback without choppiness- screen is too dim even at the highest setting (for my preference)- single DIMM slot, Lenovo site states it has 2 :(- comes with Windows 8 and no media backup or software to create a disk- BIOS options are very limited, even for a laptop (no way to increase shared video size, also Windows 8 license references?)Pros:- can handle word processing- good weightOther:It does indeed come with a 320GB drive, model: WD3200BPVT (this one WD Blue 320 GB Mobile Hard Drive: 2.5 Inch, 5400 RPM, SATA II, 8 MB Cache - WD3200BPVT). Windows 8 and the recovery partition, just take up a lot of space. Wanted to see if swapping out the drive for an SSD would help, helps a little. Going to try my luck with Lenovo support, but I have a feeling there is nothing wrong with the laptop itself, its just a very very slow CPU.
