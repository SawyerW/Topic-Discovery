Wow, I'm very disappointed to say the least. Not only is this laptop cheaply made, but I have had nothing but problems it ever since I got it (and I assure you, I'm not computer illiterate). I bought the laptop in January of 2013, and it became pretty much unusable by March 2013. I had it for only three months when it broke down on me, and I only used it to go online (I don't download anything, I really just come here on Amazon.com, Facebook, and the occasional browse). I have a security system on it as well and ran full scans on it every few days.Well, it has been giving me a completely black screen immediately upon initial login, making the laptop completely unusable.What is most frustrating about this is that DELL Support is absolutely useless. I have called multiple times, waited on hold for hours just to speak with somebody that can hardly speak english to gives me a useless canned response. Not to mention they also give me different responses every time I call, and they've tried to sell me one ($150-$270) "miracle fix" after another, after of course insisting that the issue isn't their problem. Oh, not to mention these "fixes" are inconsistent- it's always something else I should purchase to fix the laptop that I've only had for about 3 months.Yes, it seems like a good deal, but at this point, to salvage it, it's looking like I would have to spend more money on these "fixes" than I spent on the laptop in the first place.If you buy this laptop and it doesn't work, you're pretty much SOL unless you can return it to the website/store you bought it from. Unless of course you want to pay for a fix- but then you might as well get a better quality laptop.Not worth the time, not worth the frustration, and CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!Plus, Windows 8 is absolutely horrid. Not user friendly, just a pain in the butt really (but that is just my opinion).
