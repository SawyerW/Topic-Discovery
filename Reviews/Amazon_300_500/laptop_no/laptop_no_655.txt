Hello all, As I'm writing this, my mouse touch pad has stopped working, consequently I'm using a mouse. There are many issues I would like to state here that have ruined my experience with Dell as a no. 1 computer manufacturer. Remember I bought this laptop on Thanksgiving of 2013, so it is less than2 months and a half old:1. Long time to turn off.2. When you put sleep mode, you are supposed to turn it back on using any button, instead, here you have to press the power button, deleting anything you had open.3. Many times the power button doesn't work, you have to press it real hard.4. A very irksome thing was that many times it would not catch the internet, I had to restart it. Causing problems especially at the beginning of lectures.5. The quality isn't good. The name on the front started to peel off, and the mouse touch pad got stained for some weird reason, even though my hands are always clean when I use it.6. The windows loading got so much slower and slower after just 1 month from using it.7. The touch mouse buttons make a loud noise which is very inconvenient especially if you are in class or in the library. It is very sad that all this happened. I would not recommend Dell anymore not just because I had these problems, but because my brother ordered a Touch Screen Dell for $1100 at the same time I ordered mine and he is not happy with it at all. He is a pharmacist and I am a medical student and Dell did not live up to its' reputation. Our experience with Asus was way better, I still have my old $1500 Asus which is much better and stronger, and I regret leaving it for this Dell which I thought was a good deal, but it turned out I was wrong.
