This is my first Apple computer and without a doubt the best computer I have ever owned!  The keyboard feels amazing - I actually type faster and more accurately.  The variable keyboard backlighting is also great.  The trackpad actually does what I tell it too (imagine scrolling without fighting your computer!), the display is great, speakers are surprisingly good, wakes up almost as fast as an iOS device for quick note taking, and the App Store has great free or inexpensive utilities (like Better Snap Tool so you can easily do the half-screen split introduced in Windows 7, but better, of PDF Toolbox Star for splitting up and combining PDF documents without having to buy Adobe Acrobat Pro).  Office 2011 works great and is more stable than Windows versions of Office.  In the future I may switch to iWork, we'll so how that progresses.  SolidWorks ran better on this using VMWare Fusion than on campus Windows machines.  The battery life is just unreal and doesn't die unexpectedly - you always know exactly how much charge you have left.  iMovie and GarageBand are excellent bonuses (I don't do photo editing so I can't speak for iPhoto).  Having iMessage on here is fantastic and it does FaceTime amazingly.  One of my absolute favorite things is getting frequent and meaningful OS updates and NEVER having my computer shut down on me because stupid Windows update doesn't shut down my computer in the middle of working on something.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get over that, I'm sure you'll never want to go back either.  I also recommend getting an external hard drive for backup (about $70 for an awesome 1.5TB pocket hard drive with USB 3.0) and since the 128GB isn't that big anyway.  You know you should be doing backups anyway, right?  Files transfers are often instantaneous when using a USB 3.0 ready hard drive.  Buy a MacBook Air!
