I purchased this as a replacement for a Toshiba laptop I purchased a few weeks earlier that was too noisy for my liking. This was a huge improvement in the noise department, the laptop is fairly quiet in regular running mode, only when benchmarking it was the fan really noticeable. The other improvement was the touchpad's multi-touch scrolling, it was more accurate than other Laptop's, although I did have to disable the "pinch-to-zoom" feature as it was problematic when web-browsing. The downside was the processor wasn't quite as powerful as the laptop it replaced, but that was a mostly an unavoidable tradeoff to get something less noisy without a significant jump in price. The other drawback was size, the laptop case is just under 15" in length making it a bit bulkier than I would have liked as I would be carrying it with me quite a lot. Because of the size, I ended up going for the 14" Lenovo Z480 instead, it has all the same basic specs as the 580, but in a smaller case size. The Z480's other tradeoffs (aside from the screen size) were a smaller hard drive (500GB vs 750), smaller keyboard (no numpad), and a slightly louder running noise (maybe a decibel or 2 higher). I kind of regretted returning it, if the ~15" length isn't an issue for you this is a very good machine.Pros:* Low noise emission, includes Lenovo's "smart fan, noise control"* Full size keyboard with numpad* Separate mic and headphone jacks* HD, 1.2 MP (1280*720) webcam* 4 USB ports (2 usb 3.0 and 2 usb 2.0)* Descent built in speakersCons:* Size (near 15" in length, common for this screen size)* Screen resolution (1366*768, common for this screen size/price range)* WiFi/ethernet (works ok, but can take up to 2~3 minutes to make a connection)Overall, not a bad laptop for the price.
