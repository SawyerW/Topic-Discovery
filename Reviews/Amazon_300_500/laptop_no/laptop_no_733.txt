I already own a Samsung NC10 and an Apple MacBook (the old black version) and was looking for something in between - faster than the NC10 and lighter than the MacBook, essentially a very portable (thin and light) 13" laptop that I could use to work on Ubuntu (dual boot) as well as Windows 7 for iTunes, movies, Kindle book reader, etc. At first I considered buying the more expensive "Vt" versions with dual video cards (native Intel and dedicated Nvidia) but I opted for this more basic laptop with the Intel graphics and it's been a really pleasant surprise. Movies and YouTube look great (no jitters), and Ubuntu runs with all its extra visual effects. The screen is very glossy and bright and fine for outdoor use, the 500GB disk is large enough to dual boot Ubuntu and also carry a copy of your iTunes library, and the 4GB RAM is more than I'm ever likely to need.Unlike other reviewers I have not found the keyboard to be bouncy or have any unwanted travel - in fact it's nicer than my old Apple MacBook keyboard. Also, I really love the trackpad and find the 2-finger scrolling to be exactly like my Apple laptop (except it could do with being a tiny bit less sensitive). I'm getting about 6 hours of battery life but I'm not using any energy-saving features. For me 6 hours is enough, but if you need more then check out the "Vt" models which include 5600mAh batteries, e.g. the ASUS UL30Vt-X1 which also includes Bluetooth. (I guess not having Bluetooth is a bit of a pain for cellphone connectivity).I also love the multi-card reader which works fine with both my Sony Cybershot and my Canon Sureshot cameras. This is a real benefit because I don't need to travel with all those USB cables.All in all, I'm super-happy with this laptop and expect to be using it for work and play for at least the next 2 years. Awesome!
