Build Quality:Feels high quality (for a $250 computer). It is super thin and extremely light (lighter than most all laptops including ultrabooks), and has a nice keyboard and trackpad that feel very Macbook Air-ish.Software:The software on the Chromebook if you don't already know is Chrome OS. It is built around the Google Chrome internet browser, so everything you do is online, with the exception of offline Google docs. Chromebooks are used to be cloud computing devices. With that being said, if you don't use the Google ecosystem you might not be the most satisfied with Chromebook, because Chrome OS relies deeply on Google integration (Google Drive, Google Chrome, Google Play Music, and pretty much everything Google).Using this Chromebook:My experience with the laptop has been very good so far. This Chromebook is good enough for most daily tasks on the web. (And is as a mentioned above, is a great piece of hardware for the price). If all you want to do is go on the web and you want something simple, and easy to use, then this is a good device for you. The fact that it awakes from sleep so quickly and is instantly ready to go is really great. What you are giving up with a cheap device like this is, is performance. Since it is a lower end device, and the specs are not as beefed up as something like the Chromebook Pixel, you don't get the fastest web experience. Don't get me wrong, websites load very quickly and it is a stable experience, however, the web performance is not quite buttery smooth. Scrolling thru content filled web pages can be a little choppy, and YouTube videos can be stuttery at times, but for the most part, when streaming HD videos from YouTube and other sites such as Netflix, the experience is good enough. Also, Chrome OS does not support full PC or Mac programs so if that is something that you were expecting from this Chromebook, then I would suggest you look elsewhere. I would also suggest this Chromebook as a secondary computer.
