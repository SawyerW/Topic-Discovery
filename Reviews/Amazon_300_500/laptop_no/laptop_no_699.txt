Bought an alienware laptop computer, never moved it because it served as my htpc. About 10 months after purchase the screen stopped working. Turns out the graphics card died. Tried to get a new one sent to me to replace it but they(alienware) wanted the whole computer. Sent it in and received it back via fedex 1 month later. 3 weeks using it it went kaput again;( decided to sell it on ebay, the auction ended and I had $500 so I did what I should have done all along, bought a Mini Mac to use as my htpc & have been happy-trouble free since!!!Please learn from my mistake & avoid alienware. If you do purchase one you will only regret it. I even called the president of alienware and never a call back from anyone!!!-BillyPs. Check the YouTube videos with the search alienware problems-----then do the same for MacBook pro. Worlds apart!!!!UPDATE=============More Alienware/Dell Problems===========Poor Design=====Bad Hinges====Lack of Cooling===FAILWell, it looks like at least some Alienware M17x laptop owners just can't catch a break. While the previous so-called DPC latency issue has apparently finally been resolved, a number of users are now reporting another issue that's only become apparent after the earlier problem was fixed. As it turns out, the symptoms are similar to the stuttering caused by the DPC latency issue (hence the confusion), but the new problems are being blamed on power issues -- namely, that the GPU is drawing more power than the laptop can provide. Worse still is that it seems like those with the highest-end configuration are the most likely to experience the problem, as they're effectively maxing out an already maxed-out system. For its part, Dell has apparently fixed the issue in the most recent revision of the laptop, but users on the Notebook Review forums are reporting that the company hasn't exactly been eager to dish out replacements for everyone affected (which seems to be the only surefire "fix" available).Source:  Notebook Review
