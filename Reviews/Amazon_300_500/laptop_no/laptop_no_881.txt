Let me start off by saying I've been a Windows user for 10+ years, and "thought" windows was the best out there and the easiest to use.  Ask me a day before I bought this computer, and I would swear nothing was better than Windows when it came to operating systems.  About a week after getting the system, and I'm seriously considering never buying a windows PC again.  If you are looking for your first mac then the MBA is perfect.I've had a iphone since January 2010 and its the best phone I have ever had.  Bought a iPad 2 last year because I wanted a travel device to watch movies on and play games on.  Then decided I'd like to trade in my iPad 2 and maybe upgrade to a Macbook to give it a try.  Loved everything Apple has made before then so I thought its only fair to try the OS and a computer from them.BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE.  There I said it.I will admit for the first few days, I hated it, everything was backwards from windows and just seemed so foreign.  Some reason thought never crossed my mind to send it back though.  Keep struggling with the OS but slowly starting to become better at using it and then after I got most of the shortcuts down and how everything works down.  I started to slowly like it then started to love it.  Everything on Mac is about being as user friendly as possible.  Once you get it down, I doubt anyone would really given the choice go back to a PC.I bought this not only to try but to replace my iPad 2 as i've said above, I wanted something with high portability while still performing extreme task and staying quick and smooth when I needed it to be.  My main computer is a Alienware
