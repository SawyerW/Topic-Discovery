My wife bought a Dell Studio 15 and what a hunk of junk this thing is.  Less than two months old and Dell has had to send out the on-site repair man twice.  The system freezes unexpectedly several times a day and the display goes bonkers periodically without warning, sometimes even going completely blank.  The system can even suddenly stop and shut down (and I do not mean it goes through the shut down procedure; I mean it just stops as if the power disappeared).Dell customer support is a total joke.  First there is the customer run around issues.  Then they sent the repair man the wrong parts and he called Dell directly from our house and had to argue with them as they couldn't figure out which part they were meant to send.  The repair man knew the part but the Dell operator did not know what they were doing.The case is absolute rubbish as well.  The plastic is the thinnest plastic I've seen yet on a laptop and it appears to not be very durable.In addition the keyboard is not good either as already the 'M' key is not registering correctly when you press it.  Sometimes it works and sometime it doesn't.The cooling fan is permanently stuck on full now as if the system can not cool down or something.Dell, replaced the motherboard and the speakers in my wife's Studio 15 already and the system lasted all of one day and is back to it's old tricks.  We've concluded the only way to fix this computer is to get a full refund; which we are in the process of doing now.STAY very FAR AWAY from DELL now.  They used to be good but they are worse than garbage now.  If you buy a DELL you might as well light your money on fire.  Nothing but made in China garbage to fill up a landfill with.If I could rate them a zero I would have but the minimum rating on Amazon is a 1.  Dell deserves a negative 5.
