First, I have a 15" and 13" MBP as well as a netbook and two imac desktops. Also an iPad and several generations of iPod touches. But this 11" MBA is fast becoming my favorite. This machine is fully loaded (4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz) and motors along with the speed I'm used to in my 15" MBP (also loaded).A few notes: Yes, there is not backlit keyboard. Not a big deal for me, but would have been nice. There is also no battery life indicator. Not a big deal but a feature I use much more than a backlit keyboard. Of course there is no SD card slot in the 11" which is a bummer since that is something I could really use. The sound is tinny but I usually use an external speaker like the Altec Lansing iML237USB ORBIT Ultra Portable USB-Powered Speaker which I love (even if only mono. I also have the HP USB powered set and logitech's V20s).Something else I noticed is that this machine does not seem to work with the Apple IR remote.The tolerances for the USB connections are very tight. If you are used to the slop of most PCs, you will have to be a little more careful inserting connectors.The battery life seems as specified, and the bootup/wakeup speed is magical.I was working with this MBA along side a 15" MBP and was surprised at just how small this wasn't. The wide screen is a significant piece of screen real estate. I moved my dock to the right, and turned on hiding. Works great. The only issue I have noticed thus far is when editing some webpages with fixed widths and columns, I have to use a horizontal scroll bar to move about the page.Over all, this MBA all but makes me forget my iPad. I would buy this MBA again in a heartbeat!
