I've been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention:1)  The battery life is horrible.  When you unplug it, it may tell you that it's going to last two hours, but even new, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes of just websurfing (if you are watching a DVD or anything like that, you'll be lucky to get much more than 5 minutes from the battery.)2)  It gets too hot.  I've found that different programs cause it to heat differently.  I tried running Seti@Home on this laptop, but that caused my lap to almost get burned.  You have to be very careful with that.  Also, the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop have come off because the heat of the CPU melts the glue on the bottom.  This has made a mess of the various tables I've put it on, as well as some pants when I've used it on my lap.3)  The sleep functions don't work right.  Every other laptop I've used has had a function to make the laptop shut down or go to sleep automatically when the battery gets too low.  This laptop doesn't appear to have this.  When it feels like it, it will just shut down with no warning.  This has happened at random times when I don't have it plugged into the power.4)  The drivers stink.  There are various problems related to Windows hotfixes and some of the specific hardware drivers.  I forget which one but there was a hotfix for XP that conflicted with the mousepad driver and caused the laptop to freeze up.  As far as I know, Sony never fixed the driver so I've left the patch off.I doubt I'll ever buy a Sony laptop again, but it's not the worst I've used.  I'll probably buy an IBM Thinkpad next time, because they are the best laptops you can buy.
