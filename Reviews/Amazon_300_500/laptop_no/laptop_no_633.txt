I've only had the laptop for a few days now, but so far, I have no complaints.  It came quickly and was well packaged. It set right up out of the box with no problems. I also liked that it came with Win7 Pro installed, with the option to install Win 8 yourself, if you want it, which I did not.  It comes with CDs for both Win programs, and with accompanying Recovery CDs for both programs. There were quite a few downloads from Windows Update for Win 7 to take care of, but no problems with that, other than some time.I too liked the raised keys.  The screen resolution is very good and adjustable.It comes with very little in the way of added software (unusual), except Windows Explorer. It has its own security protection system, which I have not delved into yet.I will echo the complaint about the sorta flimsy CD/DVD slot, but I found the easy way to open it was to just click on it from "My Computer" and it pops right open.  I just try to be real careful with it because of its seeming fragility.  Aside from that slot, the computer is very stoutly built, but not too heavy or inconvenient in any way.It connected to my router right away and so far everything has been great.  Will update, if that changes.  I appreciate those that posted their opinions before me, because I relied in part on those reviews in making my purchase.I especially appreciated those reviewers who "alerted" to the issue of the "language setup" choice at the beginning of the setup program, because if one is not paying close attention at the time, and just hits "next", one can easily end up with French as the default language, since French is the first language listed in the choices, and I noticed that it states just below on that screen that the choice cannot be changed thereafter.  I presume that you can uninstall and reinstall since you have the CD, but it was because of that alert in the previous reviews, that I made sure to pay special attention for that particular question.
