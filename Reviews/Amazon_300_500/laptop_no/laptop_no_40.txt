I anxiously awiated the delivery of a Sony Z to replace my older TX series, and use my notebook as a road warrior and have always enjoyed Sony products.  However, this one disappointed me upon receipt as instead of spending an afternoon setting my computer up, I spent it on the phone with Sony Support.  If you look at the original listing/advert you see XP Downgrade listed about 3 times, however, a disc is NOT included with the computer, and after placing 3 phone calls to Sony Support, Parts & Accessories, and then Customer Relations, I have learned that one is not currently available with a delivery estimate given of November (it's currently August as I write this!).  This should be clearly noted in any advertisements, as many folks still use and rely upon Windows XP for work and I would not have ordered this computer at this time if I could not downgrade straight out of the box.  VERY disappointing.  I was angered enough to *not* find the downgrade disc included, but to learn that it was not contemplated to meet the release of the computer is negligent and misleading especially in light of the advertising.Other than that, computer looks nice, and reminds me of the TX/TZ with that extra inch or so that I always wanted without going to the size of a full notebook.  The power adapter is quite bulky and heavy compared with previous Sony Vaio power bricks and comes with a beefy 3-prong cord as well -- a lot of weight to add to an otherwise svelt computer.I am certain that others will buy and enjoy this computer, especially if you are OK with Windows Vista and don't require Windows XP for business.  But for those who do, it's a show stopper...and I would recommend that you wait until sony rectifies this and/or it is properly advertised.Software, especially an Operating System, is as important to the product as the hardware component.  Inasmuch as Sony didn't (and apparently cannot) currently deliver all that was clearly advertised, I am only giving the Sony Vaio VGNZ570N/B 1 star.
