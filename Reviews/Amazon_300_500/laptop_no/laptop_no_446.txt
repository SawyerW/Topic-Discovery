Count me in as another very satisfied customer.  Setup could not be easier.  Hardest question asked was probably my time zone for setting the time. (LOL)  Incredibly easy and intuitive, connected to my wireless network in a breeze.  Took maybe 10-15 minutes total.Can't think of a single negative thing to say.  Touchpad is textured, which is a little weird, mostly when I go back to my old machine, which is smooth.  (Old laptop is a Sony VAIO, running XP, and only 2G).  Other thing that takes some getting used to is that this one has a number pad, which my old Sony doesn't.  It may well come in very handy, but I'll have to get used to shifting my hands left a bit when I touch type, but a few days and I'm used to it.  Also had to adjust the brightness, which I found blindingly bright, but that's just a few clicks on the brightness key.So now comes the hard part... customizing and tweaking.  Biggest headache is just getting used to different software (like Windows 7 vs. HP, and Office 2010 vs. 2003), but the headaches of trying to find where MSFT hides places to change settings is always the same hair-pulling adventure! (That's not related to this machine, just venting at MSFT.  Glad I opted not to get a Windows 8, which is all that is sold in stores these days.  Hard enough to customize when I have a clue how the OS works!)All in all, I love it.  Excellent machine for a great price!  (I have watched as the price hopped around over the past few days.  I got it at $545 on 12/27, and have seen it go up as much as $100 in the past week, and then slip back down.  The seller changes, tho, so that's probably why.)I also paid extra for 1-day shipping (fulfilled thru Amazon, not the seller), and it was delivered on time!  All in all, I am a very happy camper!
