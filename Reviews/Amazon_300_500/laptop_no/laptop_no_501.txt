Upon receiving this laptop I added an additional 8GB of RAM and an additional 1TB hard drive for data.I love the initial setup.  No bloatware.  My first impression upon opening the box was - wow, this thing is a beast.  It's quite heavy and feels far more sturdily constructed than the HP DV-7 I'm replacing.  The exterior has a textured rubberized coating that looks really cool, though is a bit of a headache when putting it into my backpack for travel because of how grippy the rubber is so it doesn't slide in smoothly like another smooth exterior laptop would.  Very minor issue.  And that and the overall weight are literally the only criticism I can offer.I love the 2nd hard drive bay.  I love the HUGE capacity for RAM - ships with 8GB and has two easily accessible slots for more.  I love that I can open this up and clean out the fan filters.  The fans are whisper quiet even when running fairly hard.  Screen is crisp and clear, and the video is the best I've seen on a laptop.  I haven't yet bench marked mine, but I'm expecting pretty impressive numbers.Keyboard is very comfortable for typing - offers no flex at all.  Back lit keys is a nice option as well.  The only thing I think I'd add is a physical button above the touch pad to turn it off for when I'm doing a lot of typing. My hand regularly brushes the pad and it is incredibly sensitive.Now that I've got it set up and adapted a bit, I do actually like Windows 8 that it ships with.  Takes some getting used to, and with a bit of modding I've managed to make it look more like the Win7 that I'm more familiar with.The integrated camera is quite clear and the microphone(s) pick up sound very well for things like Skype.All in all I think this is a great deal for a whole lot of laptop!
