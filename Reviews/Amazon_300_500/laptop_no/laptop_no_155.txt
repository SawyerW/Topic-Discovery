I'm a techie and own 9 other computers.  6 of the 9 are Sony's. I also own Toshiba and MSI.  I always thought I had to purchase the most expensive to have the best, but after purchasing the Gateway, I see now that I was wrong.  This laptop is absolutely phenomenal.  The screen is the most crisp, colorful and sharpest display I have ever seen.  It literally blows everything else out of the water.  I have it sitting next to two other laptops right now that I paid at least double for and there is really no comparison at all.  Windows 7 runs smooth as silk, there is very little bloatware pre-installed.  I'm simply floored by how good this computer is at this price point.  Don't think twice about getting it.  After seeing it in action, I really feel that it's a steal at this price.  One downside for me is that the memory isn't upgradable beyond 4gb and it doesn't have a pc card/expresscard slot for my wireless modem, but since I'm using it primarily at home for photo editing, those things don't really matter to me.  I'm considering purchasing a 2nd one now for my wife.Update: Windows 7 on this computer continues to amaze me too.  Today, I had 8 apps open and they all ran as if I only had one open.  I didn't intend to do this, but I had Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Outlook, Word, Navicat, Hypersnap, Explorer and Microsoft Publisher all open at the same time and there was no lag or anything that would have let me know that I needed to close some apps to free up memory.  The system ran smoothly as if I was just using one app, so the 4GB limit makes more sense now since there doesn't appear to be a need for more.
