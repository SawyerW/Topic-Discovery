UPDATE: The first MacBook Pro they sent was apparently a lemon. I took it to my school's tech department and they couldn't find anything that tested bad but they said the computer just wasn't working right and was running way too slow. Plus there was an intermittent issue with the battery not showing a charge. They encouraged me to ask Amazon for an exchange. Amazon agreed to send me an exchange for free and even refunded my Office download that got wasted. Anyways, the second MacBook Pro they sent me is working much better and so far hasn't bogged down like the last one would do all the time.I would have happily given Mac 5/5 except it is just so slow even after all the updates finished installing compared to my Windows 7 machine with less powerful hardware. There are many design elements of the MacBook Pro I like from the laptop itself to the software. But once again, it's just so slow compared to Windows 7 (at least in my experience, I am expecting this review to get flamed by hardcore Mac users regardless). It seems like I spend a third of my time looking at that little colored pinwheel, which seems especially bad since I have the i7 processor. Honestly, if the Mac was faster, I would probably use it more than my Windows 7 machine. I'm going to try upgrading it from 4GB to 8GB RAM soon to see if that helps. I want to like the Mac so bad, but when my Windows 7 computer does most activities literally 2-3 times faster... Anyways, PLEASE don't leave me comments about how fast your Mac is unless you have tips on how to speed mine up. I am just stating MY experience and not the experience others might have with Mac.
