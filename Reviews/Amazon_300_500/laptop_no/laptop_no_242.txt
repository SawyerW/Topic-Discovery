I have probably been through a dozen or so laptops over the last 19 years so believe I have a little experience.I purchased the Gateway a little over a month ago.  It is for personal use at home, not business.  Primarily for web browsing, email and as a mobile media center.  Overall, I give the Gateway high marks.  It appears to be reasonably well constructed with a good feature set and represents a good value.  The blue ray player and HDMI were important to me and appear to work fine.Saying that, I would probably return it if it were not outside the 30 day policy. It is a personal thing but I find the ergonomics to be lacking.1.  The keyboard does not feel right.  I am a fairly proficient touch typist (50-60 wpm) and continually hit the wrong keys.  I haven't pulled a ruler out but believe they are oversized.  Anytime I place my fingers on the keyboard, I have to search for the little nubs on the "F" and "J" keys to confirm my hands are in the right place.2.  Mouse / Touchpad - Again, I can't get this right.  It does not fall naturally to my hands so the use is awkward.  It does not feel intuitive to me and, in fact, is counter productive.If I had to use the laptop for an extended period of time to actually do work, an external keyboard and mouse would be a requirement.Another personal preference I have discovered while using the Gateway, what is ideal display size.  This is the first laptop I have had with a 15.6" display and it will likely be the last.  It is just too large and bulky for a laptop.  My wife (who has a Compaq with similar display) tried to tell me this but I disregarded.  Wish I had taken her advice to heart.  I think a 14" is just about perfect and that will be my next laptop.I don't want to sound like I am bashing the Gateway because it is priced very competitively with the features I wanted and has been completely trouble free.  It just doesn't feel right and will probably sell soon unless I can find a way to adjust to it.
