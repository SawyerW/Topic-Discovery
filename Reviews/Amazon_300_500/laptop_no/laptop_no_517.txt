I bought this so that I could work on school papers and assignments while I was waiting for classes. I needed something that didn't weigh very much. My back was stating to hurt from carrying my laptop around campus. I also didn't need a ton of storage since I would just be editing word documents and sometimes checking school email. So I bought this cute little computer.When it came in the mail I hooked it up right away. It started up VERY QUICKLY. After set up however, it started to run slow. I am a little disappointed with the speed and that word freezes about every 15 minuets.What I do like:-It's super light!-runs quietly-the keyboard is small, but not too small. (I don't hit wrong letters very often.)-the screens light does not make my eyes hurt.-it has a good amount of storage-it downloads videos quickly (when it works)-batterylife is great! The charger is one single cord unlike a normal laptop, so if you do have to plug in it's not a pain.-what's not to love about windows 8? It's extremely easy to use!-small. It is about the size of a spiral notebook. It's thin too. I could probably fit it into my messenger bag if I needed to.Things I hate:-mouse pad is annoying. When I touch it to move it around it brings up the side bar. I catch myself trying to avoid using the mouse altogether.-Internet is VERY SLOW. I will sometimes look up info online with it, but just the homepage takes 5 minuets to load most of the time.-Programs keep crashing. When I open a word document it immediately says "Not responding" and I have to wait for a long time for it to fix its self. This is really frustrating!! I have even tried having only one program open at a time... no difference. In all I really like it! I recommend it to any college students who need something that won't add extra weight to your already heavy backpack. I hope that the problems I am having with the computer can be fixed because if it wasn't for that it would be perfect!
