You have to be extremely careful when buying this product, the one that is advertised  and u think u are buying is not necessarily the one that u would get.....u have to read the FINE PRINTS to make sure ......ITS FRAUDULOUS!!!!!!! I wanted one with a CD drive, the one that I saw had everything including the CD drive but when i got my pc there was no CD drive. When I revisited amazon website where it is sold I saw in the very FIIIIIINE PRINTS that this model doesnt have a CD drive. So they are fooling customers, showing u a ":model laptop" with everything for an awesome price, so u think u are getting a "great deal" when in fact its not that way. Should I BE FOOLED BECAUSE I WANT A "GREAT DEAL" in this hard economic times. SHAMEFUL!!!!!To make matters worst when i got the pc, the battery stopped working ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTER.....it just stopped hold charge, i figured been new it may take awhile but after about 4 days  I realized the problem  was  NOT resolving. I contacted the seller through Amazon( approximately 11 dys after delivery), the buyer took about 10 days to respond and when he did his advice leaned towards me loosing my warranty LUCKILY I READ MY WARRANTY CARD BOOKLET so i didn't "tamper" with the computer as he wanted me to do. So when i responded with my concerns and told him that i wanted to return the product I WAS TOLD THAT THE LAPTOP WAS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN B/C 30 DYS HAVE PASSED SINCE DELIVERY and me initializing the "return" before the 30 dys DOESNT HELP THE SITUATION. So that's why the seller waited soooooo long to repsond the first time....hoping that my 30 days would run out.I cannot believe that this has happened and I will continue to write BAAAAAAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND THE SELLER. AMAZON NEEDS TO SCRUTINIZE THESE SELLERS. I did business with amazon for many years because OF quality service.......SO WHAT IS GOING ON!!!!!! This product DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR RATING.
