I read a lot of laptop reviews before deciding to purchase this computer. I was deciding between this and a much more expensive Lenovo model and decided to go for less money and more battery power.I've had the laptop for about a week and keep encountering problems. I'm disappointed - usually when something has reviews this great I tend to like it a lot. But I keep encountering glitches, and fresh out of the box! Here are some of the problems I've encountered:* Express Gate - this is a nice feature, you can boot up fast and use basic utilities. BUT, the screen resolution is set wrong, so the screen is stretched. I've searched user forums and there doesn't appear to be a solution that doesn't involve hacking into linux.* Express Gate skype - the microphone works fine when I access skype using the regular operating system, but it doesn't work in express gate. Again I searched user forums and found that no one seems to have a solid fix for this. How could the manufacturer ship these computers with skype installed in express gate but without the microphone working???? That makes skype useless! Apparently it works with a microphone plugged in (so I have read on the forums) but not with the built-in microphone.* Some documentation about how to utilize the power to get maximum battery life or performance would be nice. I haven't dug around the internet for this yet but will soon. When I first charged the computer and then unplugged it, it said less than 5 hours of battery. Fresh from the box! When it's advertised as 11-12! I had to search online to find out how to change settings to get it up to about 8.I've had a number of other glitches too just with things working... but the express gate stuff is a real disappointment.
