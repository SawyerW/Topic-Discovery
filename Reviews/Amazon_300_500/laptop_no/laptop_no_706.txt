Short and sweet: You really do get what you pay for, especially with computers. The customer support is in North America and you can take it to a Genius Bar with questions. Sandy Bridge processor is a quad-core monster (8 with HT) that only gets better with an 8GB RAM upgrade--it makes iMovie cook 1080p video in nothing flat. I've had my MBP for several weeks, it it's a screamer with iMovie videos.Lion Upgrade: I bought mine a few weeks before Lion was released so I was able to get the free upgrade. The upgrade went very smoothly, took approximately 30 minutes (not including download time).Three things I love....a) Everything works as it should, boots quickly, and has killer battery life. (Free upgrade to Lion was a nice touch)b) Fit and finish is top-notch. The display has the best contrast I've seen yet. Sound quality blows away the "Beats Audio" I had on my DV7.c) Relatively cool to the touch. Will warm up under heavy load. Not suitable for using on your lap, get a coolpad or put it on a table.Three things that are neither here nor there....a) Thunderbolt port. No major accessories on the market yet. 10Gbps up/down is nice to have as future-proofing.b) Unibody construction, very few things to take apart. 10 screws to remove the bottom and upgrade the RAM. Built like a Swiss watch inside.c) Backlit keyboard is a nice touch. I generally turn it off but it's handy when you're in a dark room.Things that I didn't like....a) Apple only supports Windows 7 for Boot Camp on this machine. I realize XP is now out of date but I still use it for some things. VMWare Fusion 3 runs it fine, though.b) USB ports are only on one side.c) SD card slot only. Sucks for those of us who use MemoryStick or MSP.
