First off, I love this computer.  I bought it because i wanted a portable DAW and i had some tax money left over.  Coming from windows was not an easy transition however. Macs are confusing as balls. You download something and it dissapears forever....until you find it. You try to drag a file to your desktop screen and all you've accomplished was creating two of that file. Which is terrible if your moving 34Mb raw audio files. Once i figured out how everything works (about a week) i found that working on a Mac is just waaaaaaay faster and more productive than working on windows. From the DAW perspective, Mac doesn't support VST format...so thats kind of an issue. Your plugins have to be AU format and theres not many of them out there. Sucks. But...this computer comes with iLife or whatever its called. Basically Garageband, and some photo and video editing software (dont care). Garagebands not bad. Its like a super dumbed down version of Logic, which is Mac only anyway, so probably a good place to start. It comes with pretty much everything you'll need to start recording. Got a guitar, and that rocksmith game? well, macbook pro recognizes that cable and you can record directly into your usb port into garageband. pretty cool. No driver install necessary...like on a windows computer, where you would need ASIO4ALL or something. Performance wise, its not the fastest laptop in the world...but theres an i7 core model that probably runs like lightning, and people are putting extra memory in these computers anyway. $100 from crucial.com. Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it. it was right in the middle of recording tho, so that sucked. So far, only 1 hiccup, no viruses still got plenty of memory even with buttloads of plugins and software installed. runs smooth. 4 out of 5.
