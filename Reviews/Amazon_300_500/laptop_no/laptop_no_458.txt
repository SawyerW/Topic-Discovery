Back when I was eyeing this on amazon i imagined it being the perfect hybrid. I believe it is one of the more interesting ones. But i couldnt give it a perfect score for a few reasons. First off let me just state I got the i5 version and i got it used for around $680 with shipping. Because it was used it came with a few minor issues such as barely noticable scratches and a hard to see light area on the touch screen. but i'm ignoring these issues when writing this review.This is a very capable machine with a fairly sturdy and solid feel. Ive managed to game on it (eve online), use virtual machines on it, transfer large files etc. and it seems to have the power to do all of these without any problems. It is a great all around machine. And looks nice too. I love the size and weight, design is awesome.The reason its a 3 star product instead of a 4 or 5 star one is simple: in my experience its kind of buggy. Annoyingly so sometimes. I could be in laptop mode with the touchscreen completly off and out of no where its like a ghost is using the touch screen. Moving stuff around, closing windows etc. its difficult to fix without just turning the power off.I have a windows 8.1 pro dvd and yes i reinstalled several times and made sure to download any drivers it needed. It may be i missed a few drivers ( i hope) but this is a serious problem to me. Another issue i have from time to time is the trackpad stops recognizing gestures. So the Asus Taichi isnt all the way perfect, but if its your first windows windows 8 hybrid/ultrabook you might just fall in love with it.
