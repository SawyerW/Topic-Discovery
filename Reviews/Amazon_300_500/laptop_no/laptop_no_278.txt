Recently bought this and have been using it 10-12 hrs a day for about 2 weeks now.My opinion is that all the 1 or 2 star ratings are most likely because of defective units. ALL computers/laptops will have a percentage of defective units. Acer is no different.All other reviews on S3 have touched on various pros and cons. So, I will just focus on my experience with "cons" that were mentioned by other reviews.Keyboard works fine for me and I type 40-50 wpm.Touch pad is surprisingly the best I've used, very responsive to a point that I can understand why some would think it's too sensitive.  It's just a matter of adjusting one's own touch.Screen resolution is more than adequate on a 13" screen.  I was a bit hesitating about this but now I have no issue with it.Battery drains fast if you crank up the screen brightness all the time.  If you adjust it so it is "just bright enough" when lighting condition changes, you will get a decent 5-6 hours of use easily.Metal/plastic construction is MORE than solid.  A little give here and there on plastic parts when pressed hard...nothing to worry about.  Personally, I'd choose light weight materials over metal.Finally, the most talked about compromise of SSD+HD combo in term of performance.  To me, this is just debating between a car that can do 0-60 in 5 seconds and another can do it in 7 seconds.  98% of normal driving in daily life does the 2 second performance really make a difference?  Minimal.  I have a SONY with i7 core and SSD.  I don't feel my SONY is that much faster unless I am running some serious applications and I time it with a stopwatch.  That's the only time I see the performance difference.This is the best bang for the buck Ultrabook to get now.I took 1 star off because out of the last two weeks when I put it to sleep roughly 20 times each day, I've experienced about 3 incidents that it became unresponsive and I had to reboot.
