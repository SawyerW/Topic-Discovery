To tell you the truth, I was just about ready to pull the trigger on the purchase of a Dell XPS 15. But, I couldn't resist the $575 trade-in that Apple gave me on my old MacBook Pro 13", which only had 4GB of RAM.As a software engineer, specializing in web applications, I need quite a bit more power and performance out of my development laptop. I have to make sure that my web applications will perform well on various operating systems and across all the major browsers. So, it is not uncommon for me to run three OSes at the same time. Currently, I run Mavericks, of course, and I also run Parallels, which allows me to have Linux CentOS and Windows 7 running concurrently. And, it does so without any sluggishness in performance.I run IntelliJ as my IDE (interactive development environment), configured for a max memory footprint of 4GB. Within one of my three concurrently running OSes, I often have an instance of Tomcat active, and possibly an FTP and/or SCP server to test code designed to upload/download files. All of that is in addition to the normal fare of Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and a variety of other tool/utility software.Whether you go with this machine, or another, it's important to not only have enough RAM, but the SSD is vital for eliminating wait times. This machine performs better than my work desktop, which has 64GB of RAM and a set of Raid 0 HD. In spite of the massive amount of RAM, I still experience performance bottle necking, which is due to the hard drives. The SSD makes all the difference in the world.Anyway, my purpose here is to basically say that, if this machine can handle what I cited above, and do so without any noticeable latency, I' pretty sure it'll handle most users' needs.
