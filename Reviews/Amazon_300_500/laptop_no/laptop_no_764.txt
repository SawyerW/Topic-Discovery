I looked for like a month before I bought this laptop (not sure what the difference is from the laptop on this page other than the color scheme).Pros:14" screen.It has an impressive amount of features, including the intel i5-430 processor.  I've had it less than a week, so we'll see how it holds up.FastNo problems with stuck-on pixels.Nice keyboard.  The DV4 has a full sized keyboard with full sized arrow keys.  It actually has LEDs next to the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys.  The num lock feature almost made me re-install the OS because I didn't realize it was on, and I couldn't log in.  I had just used the windows easy transfer, and rebooted, and I was unable to log in.  Lessons learned here:  make sure you make a password reset disk, and make sure you make a second account just in case your first one gets locked out for some reason.  Also burn your DVDs for system restore.LED backlight for battery conservation.Looks cool.  The volume control and WiFi on/off switch above the keyboard are more of a proximity sensor, and are cool.Comes with windows  7 home premium.Wireless works well.Cons:The far right corner is dim, about a square centimeter area right in the corner.  If I move my head to look directly at it, it's not very dim.  You might not even notice unless you move the task bar like I do.The screen is glossy.  All laptops have glossy screens except for a few Dell business laptops.  HP might have one too that you can special order.The hard drive is a little noisy (but I believe any noise is too much), and a little warm.  The fan spins constantly, but you can turn it off in the BIOS (it still cycles when it needs to).Other:The touchpad seems like it has a lot of friction at first, but it got better, and if I use the tip of my finger with light pressure it glides just fine.  The touchpad screen scroll feature works well.  Has a button to turn off the touchpad if you don't want to use it.
