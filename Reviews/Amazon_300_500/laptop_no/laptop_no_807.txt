For those who have said this model is bad I have to say if you take care of these they should serve you well. I run alot of asus hardware including a custom tower with an asus motherboard, graphics card, and two hd monitors that are lcd and bought around the same time which is about 4 years now! Asus build quality is amazing on this machine I have ran every old game as well as new games that I want to play on max which includes Far Cry 3 and this machine does the job. If you are looking for a older refurbished model gaming laptop this is one that I would recommend as it stands up to most new mainstream 600 to 800 dollar laptops in terms of performance and beats them up! I will say I dropped mine and it still works all that needed replacing was the front and back bezel for the monitor due to damage and just looking bad. Not a problem with the lcd screen has occurred even with a drop taken. I will say the battery life is terrible but when you buy a performance computer you learn to expect this. Honestly I work on computers for a living and also refurbish computers in any form factor and Asus gets an  A+ in build quality plus customer support. I have always recommended their products and will continue to as long as I don't see any problems with quality which I haven't. Most of the problems people face are abuse of the things they buy anyway so if you do have a problem whether you are a electronics expert or just a normal user then you may want to take care of your equipment. I just had to add a review as some of these reviews are clearly just people who have a beef and want to vent. But seriously for the price you can't go wrong!
