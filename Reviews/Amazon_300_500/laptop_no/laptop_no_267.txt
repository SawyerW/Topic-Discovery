I received my DV6 6110 last Friday from Amazon.com and I must say I'm impressed. My main machines are Macs and my 8 year old Mac Mini's HD is finally showing signs that it's dying so time for a new machine. Since my 2006 Macbook is still going strong and the new Mini does NOT have an internal optical drive I opted for a new laptop with Windows. Now I have to say, I am NOT a Windows fan. I have been Windows free for 16 1/2 years now. I bought this HP knowing that I will eventually put Linux on it but for now I'll play in Windows 7. Setup of this machine was a breeze. The set up program walks you right through it. I was online in no time flat. The screen is clear and crisp and the machine is pretty fast. Plenty of USB ports and the overall layout of things is nice. HP put in plenty of help if you need it. Things you don't want (those bloatware programs) are easily removed in the remove programs menu. I ditched Norton right off the bat and downloaded Malwarebytes. I also use Microsoft essentials. Until I switch it over to Linux that is someday. One bug a boo is that several times the battery came out when lifting the machine up. Needs a better/more sure locking mechanism. Battery life is great though! Better than most at 6 hours. Another bug a boo is my older Lacie HD was not seen by Windows (A Windows problem not an HP problem). A look around Lacie's site was no help. Windows did see my WD Mybook though. This reminded me one of the reasons why I left Windows, Macs and Linux see and let me access my Lacie drive with no problem at all. Hmmmmm. The HP DV6 6110us is a great laptop and a VERY good value and I recommend it but just remember, it does have Windows on it. Expect Windows type behavior.
