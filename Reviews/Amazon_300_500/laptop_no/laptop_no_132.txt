Studied long and hard before I bought this laptop (over a year).  This was exactly what I was looking for.  With laptops, you always have a compromise ... power, weight, battery life, price, size, etc.  If any area is great, it is at the sacrifice of another.  I wanted the smallest laptop I could find (for portability) that offered the most power imaginable.  This was the first laptop with a monster i7 CPU, USB 3, under 17", and a tough graphics card to handle my demand.I needed a portable machine that I could use to demo enterprise class systems.  I put the stock hard drive in an external USB 3.0 enclosure and dropped in a new SSD hard drive.  2 higher performing sticks for 8GB of total RAM found their way in as well.  Even running Windows Server with SQL Server, MOSS, Dynamics CRM, and multiple virtual machines, the boot time was wicked fast and tore up everything I could throw at it.  When the server powerhouse was no longer needed, Windows 7 Pro transformed it to a killer gaming rig dominating StarCraft II, SWTOR, & Diablo III all with maxed graphics.This much power comes with tradeoffs.  16" is still heavy for transporting.  Maybe this is due to having to also lug a spare power cord to compensate for the very short battery life.  High power = high battery drain.  Period.  The i7 power goodness also generates a lot of heat; serious heat.  Enough to keep you warm in the winter.  The screen resolution was lower than I wanted but there was nothing on the market (or custom) with this processor or size that was better.  I couldn't justify going up to the 17".I still brag on this machine all the time.  I can't believe it has already been out for over 2 years and still blows all my friends machines out of the water.
