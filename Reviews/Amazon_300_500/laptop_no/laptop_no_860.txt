Mac Book Pro 13 (early 2011 and late 2011) are excellent laptops. It works really well. The pricing is very competitive. You will fall in love with it in no time. If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk. I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times. So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.Issues I have encountered so far on the Late 2011 Edition (new one):Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background. So, I took it back to the apple store and they  narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is. I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer. Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed. I will be patient for few months.Overall,at this point I feel for 100 bucks more you will get a newer hardware but it is not drastically different and you will not miss anything if you want to save some money and want to stick with the Early 2011 edition.Enjoy your mac book pro !!
