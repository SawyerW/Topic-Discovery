This thing is excellent! The UL30VT-A1 hits the sweet spot for me in terms of power, industrial design/look, battery life, and weight. I'm a mobile application developer, so my office is wherever I can get access to my development environment, photoshop, and a few other tools. The new Asus runs everything I need perfectly!The battery life claim to around 12 hours is, of course, somewhat overstated, but that's the rule with laptop specs, at least as provided by the manufacturer. I do, however, easily have hours to spare on a single charge with this baby! I don't even bring the adapter with me when I head out to work! I do, however, tend to work in chunks that don't often exceed 6 hours.Performance-wise, this guy is very snappy right out of the box. You may have to kill some of the bloatware, but most of it isn't terrible. I can't speak to the performance of the higher end graphics chip in there - I haven't played any games on it yet. It's a slippery slope for me to install a game on my work laptop...Design-wise, this laptop seems to be the best, out of Asus' new offerings. That is, I actually like how it looks! The chicklet style keys are nice, and the brushed metal top looks good/resists fingerprints. The screen is competent, with fairly good contrast and color. You can read text on it in full daylight as well - I have no clue what technology that is, but I've seen it in other Asus laptops. The glossy coating isn't ideal, but I'm able to work with it.Anyway, overall, this is one purchase that I'm EXTREMELY happy with. It fulfills all of my expectations, certainly. I'd recommend this without hesitation. As usual, you have to choose based on your own needs. I like to travel to work, and this provides almost netbook-like portability with serious horsepower and battery time.
