Where to start?  From day 1, the machine had some glitch where 7 out of 8 GB's of memory were being consumed for no reason.  I spent at least 30 hours with Dell Pro Support trying to get it fixed, when eventually the tech told me, "this is just a waste of time, we need to get you a new machine."  (Pro Support is generally pretty good, btw, I have no complaints with them.)  That machine's display also had lines across the bottom disrupting the picture, and the fan was replaced because it was overheating.  And it had the annoying trackpad issues that a lot of other purchasers seemed to encounter (Google it).  There was another reason they sent a guy out to replace a part, but I don't remember what it was.  I figured it was just a cursed machine and was happy they agreed to replace it.Then replacement machine had the same trackpad issues and now has a failing wireless antenna.  At least that's what the tech told me is happening, and that there's nothing he can do.  Their engineers are "working to solve it" but it's supposedly a known issue and beyond the scope of what Pro Support can rectify.  So in the meantime my case has been kicked up to the NSA of Dell's Customer Support team and in a few days I am supposed to find out whether they will send me a free external wireless card, replace the machine, tell me to go to hell, or who knows what.  The tech can't even contact this top secret division- a special requisition must be made by his manager and then the Star Chamber (the REC is the name, I think) will determine my fate when they can get to it.  I just have to wait for a phone call.Again, I don't have a problem with Dell's tech support team, and over the years I've bought more than 25 different Dell desktop, laptop and server models.  So I like the company.  But my personal experience, validated by various issues you can find by looking around the web, is that this model is a piece of crap.  Save yourself the headache.
