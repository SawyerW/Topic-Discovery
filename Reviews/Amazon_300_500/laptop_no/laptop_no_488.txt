When I saw the rave reviews for this laptop, I thought this would be an amazing deal, and would be a laptop that could last for a long time. Sadly, this machine is plagued with problems that add up as time goes on. I actually purchased this particular laptop last year, but had to return it right away (less than 30 days) because of a faulty hard drive. Now almost a half-year later, many issues have arisen. I was no longer able to view pictures at first, and there were many software issues. Now not only is the mouse severely malfunctioning, but the sound card is completely out, and like the previous commenter, the HD is having major issues, and I've tried every possible way to fix it, and I consider myself pretty tech-savvy.The previous HP laptop I had lasted me over five years, and that machine serviced me very well. That one had minor malfunctions, but they were all fixed just fine at little or no cost. However, this m7 has turned out to be a disappointment, and just managed to begin to majorly malfunction after a short time. Sadly, I will have to purchase another laptop that is not an m7. That is a real shame because there are so many quality features that the m7 has that most other HP laptops do not have like the backlit keyboard (which is a GREAT touch, but I can now live without it), the extended battery, the Beats audio, and the advanced Core i7. However, all of those features are overshadowed by the phenomenal failures that happen over a short period of time with this particular product. I really gave this laptop a chance, but it has now failed me twice.If you want a top-of-the-line computer with amazing features that may only last you less than a few months, give this a shot. If you want a durable and longer-lasting laptop, then you are much better off looking elsewhere.
