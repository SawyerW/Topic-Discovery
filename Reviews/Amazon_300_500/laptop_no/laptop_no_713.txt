I have bought two of these Laptop's one for me and one for my wife. First thing I did was replace the LED Screens and the inverters , to improve the quality of the view of the Laptops. Then I replaced the fans and upgraded the 1.73 GHz Celeron to 2.0 GHz T7100 Intel Dual Core CPU's for my wife's and Intel T8100 Dual core 2,2GHz  on my Dell and upgraded to 4 Gig of Ram on the Memory. And used a excellent quality of Thermal Paste Cooler Master G7, and replaced the keyboard with a better quality keyboard that interchanges with other Dell laptop's, and then I also replaced the power jack's, so the AC Adapters would be nice and tight,when you plug it in and power it up, and this has been the best laptop I have ever reconditioned. It is blazing fast and I upgraded the Hard Drive to 1TB Western Digital, and purchased a Hard Drive Caddy and mounted a 500 Gig Hard Drive in the DVD Bay, and I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, and Vista Ultimate 32 Bit on the same Laptop. No issues or problems at all. So for the buck it was worth it,and I have a laptop that,is kick ass. And what I love is the HDMI port that comes in handy to hook up a LED TV Monitor it helps for those with eyesight problems like my wife. So, for those who have negative things to say about it it would help if you do some research on the product and see what the Pro's are instead of focusing on the Con's. I like this little laptop so much I plan on tweaking another one". for what I have done to mine alone just upped the value of this Laptop from $299,00 brand new with just the 1.73 Ghz to $999.00 with two OS's and the upgrades and including new paint job's in reconditioning these Laptop's. So, for those who want a reasonable priced Laptop that can be upgraded and improved over time I think Dell has done ok since the laptop was introduced in 2007. So for us Geekazoids who know a good thang,when we see one.
