Instead of writing a long narrative, I'll just provide the list of pros and cons that I wish I would have seen prior to purchasing this computer.  I got it about 10 months ago (just before last Christmas; it was one of the first produced) and have been using it every day since.Pros:* Price point.  Can't beat that.* Weight.  It honestly feels like I'm not carrying anything - I once picked up the neoprene case and almost didn't realize it was empty.* Battery life.  I kid you not, I have gotten 7 hours out of the battery.  That's 7 hours of use, not 7 hours with the monitor off in sleep mode.* Boot speed.  Almost a year in, boot speed is the same as it always was, and it gets me to the login screen in 3 seconds.  Full login in under 10 seconds.* Crash recovery.  When the computer or a window crashes, Chrome reopens everything the way it was.Cons:* The body is made of plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal, but if you pick it up by the palm rest (like most people do) it causes the touchpad to click.  Likewise, if you rest too much weight on your palms, it causes the mouse to click spontaneously.* As an extension of that, the SD card slot has a door on it.  The plastic on it is total crap.  I can't pinpoint any abuse that would cause this, but mine broke off.* Video capabilities.  The computer can't handle youtube videos in high resolution, much less if you load an AVI onto the machine.* Remember, no executable files.  Everyone should know this already, but you can't install programs on this machine.  Just Chrome extensions.* Processor power.  As best I can tell, for tabs containing mild graphics, the machine maxes out around 5-8 tabs.  I think it may have a memory leak as well, as windows left open for over 24 hours have a habit of crashing.Basically, this is a great computer at an unbeatable price, but you need to go into it being aware of its limitations or you will be disappointed.
