I will start by saying I don't know if you can purchase the B575 any longer, but after the experiences I have had with it I will not purchase a Lenovo anything ever again. I have hated it since day one, being conned into purchasing it at Best Buy in lieu of a Toshiba (they were sold out the day the ad came out). I had my previous cheap Toshiba (the cheapest version) for 4.5 years and felt I got a good run out of it. I used it for web surfing, emails, and downloading/editing pictures. Since this had twice the RAM I thought I'd give it a try. I have hated it since I turned on it and it took 2.5min to open to my desktop. It asked if I wanted to optimize, and I did. I have now optimized 6 times in the 8 months I have owned it, as it has never booted in less than a Min and a half. Usually taking around 2 min. That was irritating, but the touch pad is the WORST. I have had entire pages written in an email or Christmas letter, only to accidentally brush the pad with my right hand and lose EVERYTHING. Don't even know how that's possible. It also re-sizes the screen constantly. Recently I was traveling and assume my screen was damaged/cracked in transit. I have contacted tech support and did live chat on their website, and received no answers on what my options were. Apparently their one year warranty covers everything EXCEPT the screen. Each rep referred me elsewhere, and not to the same place. Turns out my instincts were correct, I feel like I have been ripped off. I don't have crazy high standards or high demands of my laptop, but this particular computer has caused nothing but grief.
