This is my first time to leave a review about a product. Unfortunately it is a bad one.Here is what happened. I have been using a Kensington lock for the last five years for my previous laptop. After I bought this laptop, I started using the lock for the new laptop. I could feel that the lock slot didn't fit the lock in the first few times I used it. And then when I used it the last time a week back, it got stuck and I am not able to pull it out ever since.I used the same combination for the last five years and my colleague have several of the same locks and we use them over the years without any issues until this thing came up. I talked to Amazon and they asked to talk to Acer first, which intended to blame the lock. But I am pretty sure it is the problem with the design of the lock slot. Otherwise, I would have problem with my previous laptop and my colleague would also have problems as we switch laptops all the time.Anyway, Acer doesn't want to be responsible for this issue and I will see if Amazon will eventually stand behind the product they sell.Besides the lock slot issue, the laptop is a bit slow even with a 3rd generation i5 and 6 GB of RAM. It got frozen a few times already within three weeks of usage.The thing I dislike most about the laptop is its keyboard, which is very sticky and so awkward to use. I thought I could get used to it after a while but I still can not after three weeks. One of my co-workers complained about the keyboard when he just tried to type one sentence. "I hate it" was his original word.The viewing angle of the laptop is also so narrow and I have to change the screen from time to time to have a clearer view.I will have to return it to Amazon and hope they can give me full refund as the purchase was made less than a month ago.Some pros:  light and thin with a decent price tag.
