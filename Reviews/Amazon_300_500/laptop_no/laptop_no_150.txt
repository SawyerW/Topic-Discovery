well i come from an old dell inspiron 1505 from 3 years ago, with some upgrades like c2d 2.13ghz and 4gb of ram, when i ordered it it cost me 1400$ it came with 1.8ghz 1gb of ram and x1300 gpu was great laptop heavy and big but fast.so when i started looking for a new laptop i wanted something thin light and well fast, but anything with those characteristic are pretty expensive and this time i didnt want to spend a lot of money on my laptop, just when i was about to buy the msi xslim, i found about this asus UL80VT and i thought wow asus is pretty smart the 1.3ghz is nice but overclocked to 1.77ghz is better and with the 210m you have decent graphic power and if you need battery life just use the integrated intel video.so i was convinced and i bought the laptop, wow what a surprise when i got it, its fast light thin and pretty looking, it also have amazing battery life, its a finger print magnet but i can live with that, i can play my games like cod4mw and dodsource i can surf the web in battery mode for hours and my lap doesnt burn anymore.i love the keyboard but i hate the touchpad the gestures function works as the one of the reviewers said just when you move the fingers straight which is almost impossible.the speakers a pretty shy but they dont sound badthe screen is decent ive seen better but for 830$ with the 100$ gc i paid i wont complain at all.build quality is ok, the screen have some flex, there is some rough edges but nothing deal breakerasus have a great laptop lineup with the UL series they just need polish it a little bit to make it the best line up ever
