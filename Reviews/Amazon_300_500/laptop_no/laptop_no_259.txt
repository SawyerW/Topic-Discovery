The Envy 14 has a lot going for it. It's a great size, has a backlit keyboard that's a pleasure to type on, and is built very well. Further, HP has released a BIOS update to address the issue of 3D applications and games not working properly with AMD's automatic graphic switching. The solution essentially reverts back to manual switching where the user has control of which graphics processing unit (GPU) he or she wants to use. It can also be set up to run on the high-performance AMD Radeon dedicated GPU (dGPU) when the machine is plugged in and switch over to the power-saving Intel integrated GPU (iGPU) when running on battery. This is basically how graphic switching works on older Envy 14 notebooks (model number 14-1xxx).Regrettably, I had to send this notebook back for a pair of deal-breaking issues. First and foremost, the trackpad (or clickpad as it's dubbed by HP and part supplier Synaptics), is awful. HP has tried to emulate the Apple MacBook Pro in this area, and having previously owned a MBP, the Envy fails miserably. After trying many different drivers and settings, I simply could not get the trackpad to perform and respond smoothly and predictably. The final annoyance is the orange light that activates whenever you disable the pad, either on its own or by plugging in a USB mouse.The second major problem is the screen itself. The resolution of 1366x768 isn't a huge issue for me, but at one point, HP did offer the Envy 14 with a high-resolution (1600x900) "Radiance" display that was of excellent quality and color reproduction. The screen in the current model, though not the worst I've ever seen, is sub-standard for something that's marketed as a premium product. Even with a lot of tweaking, the colors are pretty dull. It's also more reflective than other glossy notebooks I've seen and used, which makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to use outside.In the end, a couple missteps in overall execution make it a less-than-ideal choice for my use.
