I've had my Samsung for two months now so I'm here to tell you about it!What I like:Screen is bright enough I usually just leave it at minimum brightness and it is sufficeThe backlit keyboard and the spacing on the keyboard as wellQuick start-upWebcam is decent-not amazing but better than my prior computerSpeakers are great-you get a lot of sound at a relatively low settingNot too heavyThe screen isn't flimsy, after I got it I had to open my old computer for something and it felt so flimsy compared to the SamsungThe machine loads fast (although for the first week after I got it I would've said differently but after some updates that was fixed)What I don't like as much:The vent-it's in the hinges where screen meets machine so it can get hot but more so on the top so as long as you have some heat tolerance and don't go sticking your hand above the vent you'll be fineIt came with Skype installed but it was the 32-bit version so I had to get rid of Skype and download it in the 64-bit version-took about 20 minutes to fix but 2 days to figure outThings to know:CD/DVD player is a slot you slide the disc into (I have no negative opinion on that)1 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0 (I would have liked there to be one more, but I can settle for two)Microphone and headphone are combined into one hole for bothMouse pad has clickers built into the pad-beware, the clickers only work if you click on the fourth of the mouse pad closest to youIf you think you can't adjust something try googling it, I've learned a lot through doing so-For example the machine comes and it will change screen brightness to compensate the amount of light coming through the light sensor, but you can disable thatSome of the bloat ware like Youcam (similar to photobooth on Mac) can be very useful, others like Mediasuite I have no use for and it may pop-up when working with song files rather than iTunes (which you'll have to download if you want)Be sure to do updates!  Otherwise you'll feel like you got robbed, but it moves swiftly as soon as the updates are onOverall I have enjoyed this computer so unless I update (if I do I'll post the date I do so) I'd have to say it might be a bit overpriced (I got mine on sale though) but overall I am happy with mine.  I would recommend this as a personal computer, if you're mainly doing work I think you'll find a better price that will fit your needs but I'd defiantly recommend this to a person who spends a good bit of time with their machine!
