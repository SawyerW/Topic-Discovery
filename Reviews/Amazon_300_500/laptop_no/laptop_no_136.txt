I recently purchased this laptop(arrived 07/28/1987) and have had a few days to play with it.First of all I think this laptop is very nice and has a couple of nice features as many have said such as the i7, antec lansing speakers, cost, etc but what I will write about is are the cons I have personally experienced from the usage of this computer.First off if you are buying this computer for gaming just note that the Radeon HD 5730 has many issues to many of the modern games.Starcraft 2: It crashes very frequently on this computer. The default drivers just won't do. Upgrade the drivers to the new 10.7 catalyst drivers right away and then if you are lucky it might not crash as often. I wouldn't blame this entirely on the graphics card since Starcraft 2 is have a multitude of problems with ATI graphics cards at the moment.Dragon Age Origins: Same with Starcraft 2 works but crashes from time to time. Make sure to upgrade your dragon age to the newest version and have the 10.7 drivers. I played this game for 5 hrs and it crashed about 3 times. ATI issues same with SC2.Mass Effect 2: Runs very smoothly. No Problems (but have heard on many forums this game had many issues with ATI cards.)Others:FN key not working. Volume/Mute Keys are not working. I had this problem at first but after updated with ATK drivers they worked fine.These are just a few of the problems I have personally encountered so far. Perhaps I just got a lemon iono, but after the updates to the drivers the problems seem to have either been fixed or lessened. In regards to the games. It might not necessarily be the notebook's fault, but just a few things to keep in mind. This was from my personal experience hopefully others are luckier and don't experience these problems.
