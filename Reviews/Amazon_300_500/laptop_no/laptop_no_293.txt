So I had purchased this laptop a while back, and got it around feb 23rd. It was all very neatly boxed up, and the laptop bag and mouse that came with it were pretty nice.The laptop itself was very nice, and most of the pro's that people mentioned were true, (powerful gaming experience, being practically silent, effectivly cooling itself down, etc.) but that didn't last long. Initially when I started it up for the first time I had a odd red pixelated shading effect on my screen for about 10 seconds, but the computer fixed itself and I thought little of it.I ran Skyrim at high settings with a little more than 30 FPS and was stable. So when it came down to gaming it was pretty dang powerful for more recent games.The problem I had was that on the 6th day of owning it, I started it up and let it load up normally, and I noticed that some of the pixels on the Microsoft loading screen were really weird. Then I noticed I had yellow pixel shadings everywhere, and I had no idea what to do. I reset it, and it did nothing, if anything more yellow shading popped up.I called Asus support, and was able to talk to a human. Unfortunately I was not able to fix the problem with me, and one of the first things he recommended was to send it to Asus to be repaired, and that would take roughly 12 business days he said. Why send it there if I had the option to also send it back to amazon in 2 days and get my money back ASAP?Regardless, the conclusion is that it WAS a good computer. Having read the reviews, it seemed like a hit or miss item to get, but we gambled it. It did prove itself to be a powerful computer and was quick to use and had a number of performance options available. It just stinks that it died so quickly, and not being able to fix a screen problem. All I can say is that it was good while it lasted, but just avoid it because of what other people have experienced with it.
