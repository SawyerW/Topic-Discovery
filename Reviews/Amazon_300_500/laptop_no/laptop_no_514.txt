I bought this laptop on sale at Best Buy about six months ago. My old desktop PC was dying, and I decided to go with a single computer for both home use and travel. The HP Envy M6 had the specs I wanted, and even though I didn't want Windows 8, I'm learning to use it. So far, it's been a great computer, except for one serious problem - the screen failed after only a few weeks. Since the laptop was still under warranty, I took it to Best Buy, and they returned it to HP. The repairs were made, and the laptop was returned to me eight days later, which is pretty good service.I like most of the features of the laptop, but the one that stands out most is the backlit keyboard. My eyesight isn't the best, but the backlighting makes the keys very visible, so much so that I don't know how I ever got along without this feature. The USB 3.0 ports are great, and I've replaced some of my older USB 2.0 devices to take advantage of the greater speed of USB 3.0. My wife has an older HP laptop that lacks the backlit keys and USB 3.0, so I know how handy both of those features are.I'm running MS Office 2007, Google Chrome, and other miscellaneous software with no problems. The laptop boots very quickly, and I have to thank HP for not loading it up with crapware like some manufacturers do. The Beats Audio has good sound for a laptop, but I usually use earbuds when I'm listening to music. Weighing just over five pounds, the laptop isn't much of a burden for traveling, and the case seems sturdy enough.Overall, I'm very pleased with the HP Envy M6 laptop. It has the computing power and speed of many desktops, and I'm enjoying using it as my primary computer.
