I wish i could keep this notebook. It seems well made, is  powerful and most importantly OS X is a much better thought out OS than Vista and generally better supported than Linux.  It has a few shortcomings such as just 2 USB ports, and it gets too hot due to the metal frame. I could live with these but I have struggled fruitlessly to get decent wifi internet speeds.  (My friend's Thinkpad is 10 times as fast to download and render pages on my wifi system side by side.  Ive spent ages searching the web for the solution and found loads of people have similar problems (Just Google for "macbook pro slow wifi connection" if you don't believe me.  There doesnt seem to be one  single problem and people have come up with a range of solutions.  Some people  say its WEP keys  that are the problem, other that its something to do with the N wifi card. I do get geat speeds if i take it to the Apple store and use their non encrypted Wifi connection. Probably I could eventually get it to work, but I want this laptop to travel around the world with so i cant afford to take  kiyt thats going to take 6 hours of headaches to get cproperly working each time I get to a place.The other  issue is working within a mixed Mac/Windows enironment.  Boot  camp and parallels are very helpful, but I still have encountrred annoying issues  eg that it doesnt like NTFS formatted disks, that it tries to format Ipods wit MAc  filing system so that they cannot be used on PCs  without special downloads.Bottom line its  a lot of hassle.  If you live in a completely Mac environment than this is  a great laptop, if  you want to interact with a wide range of non mac equipment, it may be  more  trouble thatn its worth.
