I am rating this Series 3 Chromebook with 4 stars. The only reason for this is because playing Angry Birds and a few other games in the App Store is a little choppy. Also I tried to play a 300mg video file locally instead of via the web and it took 4-5 min to load. After that it would only play sound and not display video. For those 2 reasons I could not give it 5 stars.Having said that, am I no way disappointed with this device, as I am currently driving down the road connected to my phone writing this review. (I should prolly clarify say that I wasnt actually driving. My wife was and I was in the passenger seat. Apparently some people are dumb enough to think otherwise.......) The touchpad is great, however it did take me a few min to get used to the gestures that I am not used to. (2 finger swipe and the touchpad actually clicks) This is a very nice compact machine. I will feel so much more comfortable carrying this around school as opposed to my 2000 Alienware laptop...Much more portable.I have heard people complain about the display and it not being bright enough, however it is a sunny day as we drive down the road and I can see the screen very clear.The Keyboard is top notch and the star of this device. While made entirely of plastic it does feel cheap at all. I am comfortable picking it up by the corner without a fear of it breaking. Connecting to a TV via the HDMI is as simple as plugging it in. If Google can fix the local playback issue and get the few games such as Angry Birds to play better, then I would for sure give this thing 5 stars.If you have a need for portability and a cloud based device, this is the device for you, especially with it being priced at $249.
