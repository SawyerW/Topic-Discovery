I think the majority of people who have given this notebook poor reviews are ignoramuses. I am a college student who has owned this computer for a few months and I love it. It is the perfect marriage of power, portability, and price. These qualities, combined with its professional aesthetic, make it a perfect choice for students everywhere and I highly recommend it. There are some imperfections, but the cons are far outweighed by the pros.***PROS***-PerformanceThis computer is fast and powerful. The i5 processor handles any task I have given it very well, including light gaming, video editing, photo editing, HD video content and more. I attribute this speed and power to the 4 logical threads of this processor, along with turbo boost, fast memory, and an SSD/HDD caching system.-WeightThis was a serious consideration for me as a student. I am always going from one place to another, and much of my travel is on foot. I needed something that was light, which is why I sold my ASUS N56VM (which was much more powerful) in order to get this. The ASUS was a fat lard, but this computer I hardly notice is in my bag.-PriceI purchased the Windows 7 version of this laptop for $650. Can't beat that price for this amount of performance in an Ultrabook form factor.-AestheticThe look of this computer is very nice. It is thin, and has an gray aluminum lid. The inside is plastic, but it is of sturdy construction and made to look like aluminum. Overall, a very good looking machine.***CONS***-ScreenScreen resolution sucks and the panel itself is nothing to write home about. However, the low resolution helps with battery life (I get several hours out of one charge).-Internet(?)Some people have mentioned problems with the internet on this computer, which is a perfectly legitimate reason to knock it down a star. However, I have not experienced any serious issues beyond some minor connectivity problems. Be aware, I must be connected to the internet for 90% of my computer usage; if this was a big problem I would say so. Note also that you can purchase an external wifi dongle for ~$10, so no reason to rage about the internet anyway.-KeyboardKeyboard flex is very noticeable. It does not make typing really uncomfortable, but I can't imagine why it's so difficult to make a sturdy keyboard.***CONCLUSION***Overall, very nice computer. It does exactly what I need with minimal problems. 4 stars. I would also like to note, that after I bought this computer my friend bought the U410 and my dad bought the U310 (Win 8 version) and they are both very happy with their purchases.
