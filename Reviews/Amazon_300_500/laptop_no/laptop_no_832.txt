I have been using the Asus G73SW-A1 for almost a full year now and found it to be an excellent system and haven't had any major reliability problems with almost all of the hardware. With the 8GB of DDR3 RAM(up to 16GB), two 500GB hybrid drives from Seagate, i7 proc, Nvidia graphics makes its specs nice and high for the cost of the machine especially now that it is a year later.  The only down side I have had is that my BD combo drive started to fail within 4 months and now one of my hybrid drives failed just a few days ago. I do not count these failures harshly against the system things like that happen with hardware every once in a while. I figured it gives me an opportunity and reason to upgrade them to something more my style like a SSD and a full Blue-Ray writer. I did think that the wireless card should have been a better type like one that can do both the 2.4 and 5.8 gigahertz spectrum. There are a few that Intel makes that I like however you will have to install another wireless antenna to gain the benefit. The two true CON's that I would say it has that is it comes pre-installed with a lot of extra software that I would consider bloatware (which I removed) and that support can be less than great. Overall I would say that this system is again excellent, well made and even to some extent upgradable. I give it 4 of 5 and I would have gone 5 of 5 but the minor things with the Hard drive  (to me) brought it down just a little.This system did come out during the Intel Sandy bridge chip-set problems but it has the REVISED version of the Sandy bridge chip-set so no need to worry.
