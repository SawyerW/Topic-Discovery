I purchased the HP dv4-2160us so that I could have a personal computer that was 'hands-off' to the rest of my family.  I debated between this computer and the dv4-2167sb, which were similarly priced.  It basically came down to whether I wanted a fingerprint reader or a better processor (Intel Core i3 vs. i5).  In the end, I chose this computer with the more powerful processor, and I haven't regretted the decision at all.This is my 3rd HP laptop, and definitely my favorite.  I like the look of the Digital Plaid design, and I honestly don't even notice the smaller (14.1" vs. 15.5") display.  This has the best speakers of any laptop I've seen; I actually have to turn it down sometimes.  This system also stays noticeably cooler than my older dv5. I was surprised to hear about the issues with noise some reviewers mention, as mine is as quiet as a mouse.  I was also very glad that HP didn't put all those annoying Quick Start buttons above the keyboard on this model.  They might work for some people, but I was always accidentally sweeping them on my dv5 and waiting for Quick Play to open, just so I could close it back down, really bugged me.This laptop also features the Smart Bay, which allows you to lighten up the laptop by 8 ounces by removing the optical drive.  I gotta say:  I'm middle-aged, and not a perfect physical specimen, but this laptop is no back breaker.  I carry mine with me all the time, and  I've never been tempted to removed the drive.  Somehow, the wear and tear on the drive doesn't seem worth saving a half-pound.I'm not really into all the advanced specs, I only know about whether it does what I want it to quickly and consistently.  The Windows Experience Index on this laptop is a 4.5, which is a considerable improvement from the 3.4 rating on my dv5 model.  For everyday web surfing, uploading photos and video, and Windows Office, this computer does a great job.
