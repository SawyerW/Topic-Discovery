I bought this product as an affordable replacement for my older laptop that was beginning to give me problems (constant humming noise that made it difficult to focus).  For web based browsing activities, this device is perfect.  I like the fact that it weighs so little (about 2 lbs) and is therefore very portable, unlike some laptops that basically are like lugging a "desktop laptop".  Unlike my previous computer, this computer stays relatively cool and warms up only when the outside temperature is warm (~80 F).There is one major limitation of the chromebook:  the relative incompatibility with Microsoft Office files.  While the chrome browser allows reading of these documents, you cannot edit them with this laptop.  Luckily there are two ways to get around this:  SkyDrive and Chrome Remote Desktop.  SkyDrive is the Microsoft version of Google Drive and as you can imagine, it allows you to store your Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, etc) in the cloud and edit them.  With Chrome Remote Desktop, you can control one of your Windows or Mac machines that has Office installed.Storage is minimal on the device, but since Google Drive recently consolidated both Gmail and Drive storage, you now get up to 30 GB of cloud storage, which is probably enough for most web based and document uses.  I personally have a 1 TB external hard drive for physical copies of my documents as well,The battery life is amazing, by far, for any of the laptops that I have owned to this point.  I always used to have to worry about bringing the laptop charger around wherever I brought the laptop.  Not with this chromebook.  Battery life is at least 5 hours, though this is highly dependent on usage patterns and whether or not you have USB devices plugged in, as these draw power from the computer.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase of this device. I highly recommend it for those who use their computer for web-based and document processing activities
