I paid $275 for this zippy little Chromebook, extra $$ for the next day shipping and it was WELL WORTH IT, WOW AMAZON, you continue to amaze me, ordered this thing at 2PM on a Monday, picked it up by 11AM on a Tuesday. Like my title says, it's somewhere between a Netbook & MacBook Air. The keyboard and silver back style is totally a mac knock off but it works. I think it's got a great little build to it. Keyboard flows amazingly, I have been typing documents & emails and it's a tremendous quality for how small it is. I'm a big dude, 6' 4'' with huge oaf hands and fingers, it still feels comfortable to me. This is a great little machine if YOU LIVE ON THE WEB. You're not going to do anything crazy with this. I had some skips while listening to a 30 minute clip from a radio show on YouTube and trying to do other stuff. I also had a little bit of trouble watching HBO GO. Then again, my network isn't an amazing connection, it's mediocre speeds at best. I bet with a better connection the video experience will be just fine. But for $249 you get a Samsung quality machine, with a mac feel, and a netbook performance. Display isn't going to blow you away but for $250 it's definitely passable. I also hear Netflix is making its own App for the Chromebook, which sounds amazing, I have a Netflix app will work great on this machine. I Love Google Drive storage and love that this thing boots up like a tablet. Its small enough to literally take anywhere and have a laptop-esque experience, without the booting up & Windows/Mac desktop booting for 15 minutes.I hope I continue to see more Google & Samsung combinations. I have a feeling the third version of this chromebook will be out of this world. They're certainly off in the right direction.
