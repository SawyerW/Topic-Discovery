I bought this computer on sale through Staples about 1 to 1 1/2 years ago.  At first I absolutely loved it, and for the most part it is still a very good computer.  I really like the finger print security because it makes signing into a lot of things much easier and quicker and because I have client confidential material on my computer, so I don't have to worry about someone signing on my computer and being able to access that information.However, my last cheaper Acer laptop lasted 4+ years before finally giving out (the AC adapter port quit working and it was going to cost more to have it fixed than the computer was worth).  This computer after only a year or so has the following problems:1) The keyboard misses keystrokes at times, particularly the space bar.2) The letters on the keys have already worn off on several keys.3) The fingerprint scanner will sometimes just quit working and I will have to restart to make it work again, same goes for the touch pad.4) It is sometimes entering the wrong character when I hit a key, for example I will hit the letter 'W' and it will put in the number '8' so instead of 'what' I get '8hat'5) The USB ports do not always register something being plugged in, sometimes I have to unplug and replug to get it to register or plug it into a different USB port6) The SD card reader only works periodically, most of the time I have to use a USB adapter to read SD cardsI will say that my computers get a lot of use, we're talking several hours a day nearly every day, they also travel very frequently on long car rides and through airports.  I do however try to take good care of them with regular cleaning and a good padded travel case.So, all in all, its a decent computer.  However, if you're someone who uses a computer a lot don't expect great durability.  I will continue to use this laptop until it totally gives out, and for the price I paid it has been worth it...but I will probably try something different next time.
