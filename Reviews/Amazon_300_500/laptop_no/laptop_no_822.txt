I purchased this product and it took a few days for it to actually ship.  Which they ended up sending 2 days after the estimated shipping date from Amazon.  However, after I contacted the seller, I was informed the original computer broke in shipping.  They replaced it with a different one which shipped direct from the manufacturer to save time.  Without solicitation, the seller upgraded me to 8GB of RAM from the original order which included 6GB RAM, for the lost time.  After receiving the computer it has worked great.Wish I had known a few things prior to purchasing however:The 'warranty' is not a year from the date of purchase, mine will end in January even know I just purchased it in December.  It is based on some date, maybe when the dealer purchased it, IDK.Also, it does not come with startup discs and for someone not familiar with computers this can be very confusing.  I did not have a problem but had my dad purchased this, it could have been a nightmare for him.  I spent $850-, include the darn discs.Finally, it does not come with Office, which I thought was a very basic program that should be on there. It of course has a 'ghost' copy of Office which clicked on will promptly take you to a place to buy it.  Luckily, I have a copyI gave it 4 stars because the computer works great, is very fast and has a great webcam.  The gaming runs smooth and has lots of storage.  Just a lot of the secondary things could be better/smoother, and the information of what is available on the computer, such as the warranty, should have been much, MUCH clearer.  Actually, if I had known, it would have influenced where I purchased the unit from.  They did have good customer service though, regarding the repair and were quick to get back to me when asked questions.ONE YEAR LATER: computer has worked brilliantly since purchase.  Would highly recomend a upgraded version to anyone.
