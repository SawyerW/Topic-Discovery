Making this simple:Pros:Looks like a newer model laptopChiclet keyboard that many likeClean lookingCons:Dell Customer is a joke, more later...Build quality is okKeyboard feels loose and flimsy, this is not screwed down.Speakers are on the bottom, facing down.To replace the hard drive you will have take the laptop apart, remove the lcd display and then the motherboard.No SSD compatibility according to the Dell support (laptop crashed when installing Windows on an SSD drive). This does not seem likely since a SSD drive is supposed to work in the same configuration as a hard drive. Maybe a firmware update is needed.I took this apart so I know this laptop a little better than most.  I had to do this to upgrade, or try, the hard drive to a SSD drive.Runs fine for the most part, but have concerns of build quality and durability and the design flaw to replace the hard drive.***Updated my review***I had quite a few issues with the Dell support and customer service. However, after getting through to the US Customer service I was able to get my restocking fee waived. So I moved this up a notch.EDIT AGAIN!Dell Customer service is a joke.  If you have any problems don't expect Dell to step up.  I was called saying they were going to refund my restocking fee, however they didn't.  I called them to ask when this would be credited back and they said they didn't have any notes on this and I would not get the restocking fee waived.The first time I called to get the SSD drive assistance I was tranferred to 5 different departments, most of them incorrect.  Then when I want to return the laptop, they transferred me to about 4 more departments, 2 incorrectly.  I spend about 1.5 hours on that ridiculous call.Now they are saying their customer service didn't call me to waive the restocking fee, even though I have the voicemail still.  They aren't replying to my emails now about this.  WHAT A JOKE DELL CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!
