the price and feature of this laptop blew me away and i had to buy itI was in need of a new PC and was in quite a dilemma as i needed a fast and powerful laptop (because i couldn't get a desktop) with lots of space and with a decent graphics processor but i was on a very limited budget.After much searching i decided on this one and I have been madly in love with it ever since it arrived (although it did take me 10 minutes to find the on button )I have abused this thing and it has taken everything in strideI overclocked the CPU to 2.2ghz and on top of that i leave it running nearly constantly to seed torrents and when im using it I am running graphics intensive games like Oblivion (YES , THIS THING CAN RUN OBLIVION ON NEARLY FULL SPECS) so needless to say i should be in constant danger of overheating. however I bought an cheapo cooling pad from amazon (the one that has 3 fans and a blue LED http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032R858C/ref=oss_product) to compensate and neither the fan or the laptop have given me any problems.It also survived a pretty major drop and is no worse for the wear.My one and only grievance with this laptop (which is a problem i would have had with any other laptop) is the keyboard and trackpad. I immediately realized i needed to buy a mouse for this thing (the mouse and cooling pad were about $30 be prepared to factor that into your budget) because the trackpad is dreadful. The keyboard just takes some getting used to because its nearly flat and I rely on feel, more than sight to type and the added numpad really takes up a lot of space that i would have preferred to have been used giving the other keys some extra room or spacingthe last thing i want to mention is the battery. I cant speak to its battery life as i've never used it for more than an hour without it being plugged in but i think two hours would be an accurate guess as to its battery life. SO if unplugged time is a major concern to you you may want to get a different laptop or consider buying an extra or extended life battery to compensate.
