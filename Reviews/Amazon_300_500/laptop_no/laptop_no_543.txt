The first one I received had faulty wireless.  I expect the wireless antenna was disconnected from the connector as the adapter worked but was very sporadic in being able to connect.  Having disassembled many laptops, I know the wireless antenna connector is very touchy, and not having it connected securely would likely cause this kind of an issue.  In any case, I returned the defective one for a new one, and am writing this review using that one right now.Let's get a few facts straight.  Having read the other reviews...  It absolutely is a touch screen, and the screen works flawlessly.The 5400 RPM disk may be governing the overall "snappiness" of the machine, but the CPU is a 3rd generation i7 with a max speed of 3.8GHz.  It will throttle down to 1.8GHz *when.it.is.not.being.fully.utilized*:  Version: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4500U CPU @ 1.80GHz  Voltage: 1.2 V  External Clock: 100 MHz  Max Speed: 3800 MHz  Current Speed: 1800 MHzThe 8Gb of RAM is furnished in two 4Gb DDR3 1600 MHz SODIMM, with maximum RAM of 32Gb using 4 x 8Gb SODIMM.As I have little use for Windows, I opted to reload the laptop with Linux Mint Petra 64-bit, and found the installation and configuration to be absolutely turnkey.  The wired and wireless networking is flawless, as is the dual-screen capabilities, as I am using an Asus VS247 connected via the HDMI as my second display.  I've just done some scanning using my Epson perfection v700 photo scanner, and have found that a 4800 DPI large format transparency scan completes in less than 3 minutes.  These scans were taking upwards of 12 minutes each on my old desktop, so this is a vast improvement and very portable to boot!I am absolutely delighted with the V551LB-DB71T, and have only taken away 1 star due to the defective initial unit.
