I have always thought most apple products were overpriced, with a few exception. I thought no different of this mac book air, until i used it. I was in the market for a computer that was light, worked flawlessly, with a long battery life. I searched for the right computer but was never able to find the right computer. When i decided to try this computer i was hooked. Here are some of the reasons why:Most of the computers i encountered did the not have such a good battery life, or you needed to get a bigger battery (which adds weight) or a battery sheet (which adds costs). THis computer easily gets 8 hours of heavy duty use, but has gone as high as 15 for me depending on how you use it.Another reason is that comparatively , it is not that expensive. To get a similar thin, lightweight computer would be expensive even if you bough a windows based one. The mac just looks and feels like a quality computer.It is so easy to use. I thought it would take a while to get use to but after a day i was already using it it like had been for years. Right out of the box everything just seems to work. NO wifi problems, no freezing, no anything. It just works. If you value your time then this is the computer to get.THe keyboard feels great when typing. I always wanted to have a similar keyboard for my windows computer at home. I just love the way the keyboard apple feels.I love the gestures. It makes multitasking and browsing a breeze.I truly suggest you go to a store and try this product. I would rather spend the money for a quality product that will last me years instead instead of saving a hundred dollars for a mediocre product. I really was not an apple fan, but i give credit where is due and they have done an amazing job with this computer.
