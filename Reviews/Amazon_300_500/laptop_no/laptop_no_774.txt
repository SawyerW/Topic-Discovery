I love this laptop its extreamly fast and does it all I cant say enough about it I'm a Toshiba girl at heart my first laptop was a Toshiba and served me very well so I was a little nervous about getting this but the deciding factor for my husband was the HDMI port which would allow us to view media on out HD flat screen the deciding factor from out computer nerd friend was the i3 processor which to me was like Huh? But I trusted him and brought this laptop I gambled and boy did I win I absolutly love this laptop its light and sexy not a eye sore and so functional. Also the battary life isnt bad either it last 4 hours and that even while I'm burning dvds and surfing the web or watching youtube videos. I actually brought mine fro, officemax because they have it cheaper and the shipping was free 2 day as opposed to 2 to 4 weeks on amazon. This laptop is nothing short of amazing and super fast in everyway the only con is the sound and that can be fixed with speakers or headphones it you need to be blown away.The keyboard is perfect not to big not to small meaning its not too tightly pushed together and thats always a plus for me I love my Toshiba but that was one thing I hated the keyboard was aweful. Listen do youself a favor and buy this laptop its an HP and thats obviously a good thing another great thing about HPs is the customer help line when I first got this I wasnt able to go wireless in my home network so I called the Hp number and a wonderful woman was able to remotely fix the problem I didnt have to do a thing which was awesome because I have never seen the mouse moving on my computer and witnessed someone actually taking over my screen from god knows where and just fixing whatever was wrong with it. Again this laptop is amazing and I would suggest it to anyone also if you have a old laptop and want to transfer files I suggest the Belkin Easy Transfer Cables I got one while I was ordering this laptop and it made moving my files flawless and easy it copied everything I wanted even my desktops are identical now and all I did was click a button. I'm a happy camper!!!!
