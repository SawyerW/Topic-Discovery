I ordered this back in November as part of their Black Friday deal from Amazon. I then went about setting it up and personalizing and used briefly before putting aside to due traveling. When I got back I went to start the computer and it asked for my password. I could not recall adding a password, and if I had done so, surely it was something easy right? Well, I put in everything I could think to no avail.So since I had yet to register the computer I went ahead and did so and while on the phone with tech support (I was able to get one free tech support call), I asked about accessing my computer without a passwrod. Well, I was informed by Dell that I had to have a Dell USB flash drive to do a system recovery (just for a password??) They overnighted one and then called two days later (I missed that call). They called back this morning and walked me through the process of a recovery. But during the call the computer indicated it could not do a recovery because there was an error. The tech support guy said it was the hard drive (this is a new computer remember) and they will send me out a box with a paid for mailing label - I was to mail the laptop back, they will fix it and send it back. WTF??Seriously there had to have been a better way. I really don't think the computer is bad, but I guess you get what you pay for and I paid only 350. Goes to show you. I would recommend going on Dell's site instead and read all reviews and find a better computer. But then come to think of it, I did that years ago and that Dell laptop tanked after a few years too (and could not be recovered at all). Maybe don't buy a Dell. Buy a MAC instead.
