After using this MacBook Pro for a little over thirty days, I have lost complete access to my very expensive (by comparison) notebook.The notebook worked well for roughly 30 days after I received the MacBook, installed all the updates Apple Store informed me to install and Apple's "Parallels" Windoze bridge VM to read/create Word/Excel documents.  Then, after an Apple Store update, the system started panicking during a normal "Shutdown."  I submitted all "reports" the MacBook Pro asked I booted back up for about a week.Then, after yet another panic during shutdown the MacBook Pro was rebooted, the user and passwords prompt would no longer recognize ASCII keyboard characters, i.e. a-Z, A-Z, 0-9, etc.  It would, however, allow me to enter Ctr-A through Ctrl-Z, and Alt-A through Alt-Z, just not A-Z and numeric keyboard keys are not be recognized.  I opened a Apple Support ticket, but they are clueless, with two representatives provided divergent  advise.I don't know if I just got a lemming, or if this is a know BUG in Apple OSX.  The only good comments I can say about Apple Support is that they immediately take inbound calls and keep to their call back schedules.  The bad news, they seem unable to correct any but the most simplest, generic issues like a novice computer user's question as to "where the any key" is located.  (I am a thirty year plus hardware, network and software engineer.)*UPDATE*05-19-2013: After spending my entire Saturday either talking with a CS rep or downloading an update from Apple I can report that Apple technical support was able to fix my issue.  The exact cause of the failure remains elusive, but after being escalated up to higher, more experienced technicians I am once again happily using my Macbook Pro.  Stuff happens and it is never fun when it happens to ourselves, but with patience and persistence one shall always prevail.
