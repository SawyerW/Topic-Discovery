This is my first laptop that I purchased new in 2008 for school. What I needed was a computer that could run mainly AutoCad and other heavy programs with ease. I've always enjoyed this laptop, one for it's design, and the other for it's ability to accommodate my flexible needs. This is currently still my daily computer, it is definitely reaching an age where purchasing a new computer is going to be a reasonable option. Never had to many problems, vista was a joke i'm operating windows 7 now and LOVE IT! Computer is much more responsive than before. A super recent upgrade I did was upgrading to the maximum amount of RAM and now I see I should have made the switch way earlier! With my recent upgrades including maximizing RAM and increasing HD disk space to 1tb this computer should last me at least another year and a half if not longer. I have noticed it's a little bulkier than products hitting the floors recently but the design really keeps people guessing. Quickly would like to touch on the "MediaSmart" bar located above the keyboard which has been mentioned in other reviews. It does have issues time to time, I make sure to have the correct updated drivers installed and usually I don't have problems but sometimes using these "touch" buttons can be a real hassle. Umm lets see, computer gets pretty warm during use and what you have it set on. I now have a 12 cell battery which lifts my laptop off whatever resting surface by about 3/4 of an inch which increases air flow. It was noticed a lot using vista but with windows 7 I haven't had anything worth too much concern. Overall I enjoy this computer, It's been used  A TOONNNN during the last about to be 5 years! and yet no major problems. Obviously as my first laptop I do not have much knowledge to compare it too from other brands per say, but I can say it worked for me and was very reliable .. upgrade that RAM!
