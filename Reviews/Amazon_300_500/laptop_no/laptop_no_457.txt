I love the concept - but for me, this hybrid has a lot of problems* the native resolution (1920x1080)makes thing VERY hard to see.  Sure, you can change it...but ASUS will not let the changes stay.  so you have to do it every time you log in.  and when you change it below the "recommended" setting there are constant errors and your pointer will go missing from time to time.  if you have eagle eyes...you might be ok - for us normal people this will be a huge problem.* CITRIX does not run well at all on this machine.  due to the ridiculous native resolution the CITIRX window is about the size of a coaster...and the font is smaller than any contract fine-print I have ever seen.  I literally need to use a magnifying glass at time...BEWARE IF YOU USE CITRIX* the brightness will self adjust at random.  very annoying* the charger is a little bulky and will fall out of the wall socket quite easily* the "tablet" screen has also STOPPED WORKING all together...in ANY mode!  ASUS says I have to reset the entire system, deleting the progs I have loaded.  this is a huge pain especially since there is no optical drive and all progs have to be re-downloaded.  I am looking at 8 hours to do this now.BOTTON LINEI love the look, feel, speed, and flexibility of the Taichi.  it is truly sexy, light, and frankly...really cool.  but I do not trust the ASUS mngt program yet.  Sadly, I have little confidence when using it now.  maybe they will have fixes to download later...maybe the next gen' will improve.  Until then...I would look at other hybrids first if I were you.to add - I have also been very frustrated with the ASUS support and the WINDOWS support.  this is very disapointing as I am a pretty big PC fan...and learned to love ASUS from building computers using their MBs.UPDATED 1/30 - I do want to add that I bought the Taichi from Buy Spry and the customer service was absolutely awesome....very professional and personal.
