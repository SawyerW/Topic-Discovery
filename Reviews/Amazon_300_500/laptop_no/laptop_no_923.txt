I ordered the G75VW-DH72 just a few days ago, expecting it to be a powerful gaming laptop, but a little unsure of it, because it came with Windows 8. Received it today, and after a little poking around and installation of a few games, I have come to the following conclusion: This laptop rocks!Guild Wars 2, with graphics set to Ultra, runs smooth as a baby's bottom. Not choppy at all, zero graphics lag, just absolutely beautiful! Rift, again with the graphics cranked all the way up, shows zero issues at all, even in crowded areas. I am currently in the process of installing The Secret World (my most graphically intensive game), but after Rift ran so well, I anticipate no issues will arise with TSW.But besides gaming purposes, how does the machine handle overall? Like a champ, actually. I wanted to know how fast it started up, assuming this would be quick due to the SSD, and my friends and I guessed it would be about 30 seconds from totally off to logged on and ready to go. I've had previous laptops with an SSD primary drive, and 20-30 seemed reasonable based on that experience.We were wrong: Eight seconds. 8. Ocho. VIII.That, my friends, is a fast boot.So, is the Asus G75VW-DH72 worth the money? For me, on the limited experience I have with it thus far, I would say absolutely yes it is. The only regret I have is that it does not come with a Recovery disk, nor does there appear to be a way to create one yourself, which is annoying. Luckily, you can create one via Windows 8, and now I have a nice backup on a thumbdrive, in case the worst case scenario ever happens.Update - I've been using this laptop daily for the last couple of months, and it is still rock-solid. All of my games load ridiculously fast, it works great for creating and editing my podcast, and I have yet to have a single issue. I have worked the poor thing to death, put it under strain other "gaming" laptops would have buckled under, and the Asus took it all in stride.
