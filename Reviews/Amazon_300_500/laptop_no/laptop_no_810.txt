I bought this notebook and it was great... at first.  A few a months into owning it the lcd backlight and speakers started to go out.  I sent it to ASUS and they repaired and sent it back in less than a week.  One night during a LAN party, I had to set the resolution in a game.  I couldn't it it to go higher than 1366x768.  After trouble shooting in windows I determined that they had installed the incorrect LCD screen.  I called support at ASUS and they said that this laptop did not come with a 1920x1080 screen and that Amazon.com must have installed an aftermarket screen, I thought that was a bunch of BS and they gave me another RMA number anyways. After thinking about it I called back and had the issue escalated to make sure something was done.  It's been 2 weeks since then, and the received my notebook, but no sign if they reinstalled the correct screen.  At any rate it's been about a month since I've been able to use the notebook I paid fourteen hundred dollars for. /review ---addition---This is not a particularly isolated case, I sent in an EEEPc for a couple of issues including the battery, and they sent it back without a battery.  I had an ASUS Motherboard in a 4000$ computer that didn't work correct for months until they finally released a bios update.  I used to swear ASUS products but it seems like they are made with less and less quality control.  My girlfriend has an EEEPc that makes a terrible fan noise that needs to be sent in, and my mother has an ASUS notebook she wont even use any more because it has a bunch of issues and she's too busy to deal with the RMA process, I feel bad for recommending both of them these products.
