I did research before choosing a laptop, and this one seemed to have the features I was looking for: 15" or larger screen, good processor and plenty of RAM, and a brand that consistently gets good customer reviews.Positives first:  The LED screen is very vibrant.  It is not one of the top-of-the-line screens that is equally vibrant from any angle, but this is an excellent screen for the price range.  The laptop itself is sharp-looking and light-weight.Negatives: The touchpad is infuriating.  I appreciate that it is set up like a Mac so you can use two fingers to scroll or zoom in or out, but it is very spotty in its sensitivity.  I found that I have to click two or three times before it recognizes what I'm doing as a click.  This in spite of the fact that the pad actually moves and makes an audible clicking noise when you click.  I have read some other online reviews that mention the touchpad specifically, and it seems that this is just the way this model works. [...]  A driver can be downloaded to improve the touchpad function, but even after that I still had problems.The shift and arrows keys also have an untraditional placement on the keyboard.  The shift key is significantly smaller than normal, and the up arrow is to the right, leading me to occasionally hit the up arrow instead of the shift key.I am typing this review on a different Lonovo laptop, a ThinkPad Edge, and the touchpad on it is great.  The primary physical difference is that the ThinkPad has two distinct bars for left and right clicking, where on the Z580 it is one large pad.I am returning the Z580 for a different laptop, because even after updating the driver for the touchpad, I find it less frustrating to use an older computer with a lower grade processor than to put up with a zig-zagging cursor that rarely detects when I'm clicking.
