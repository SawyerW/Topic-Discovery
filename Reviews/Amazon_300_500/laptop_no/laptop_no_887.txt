Overall, I love this product, though considering the last computer I had was a 12.5" <1GHz joke my expectations were easy to surpass.Processing speed is excellent. It has no problems with multiple intensive programs like Illustrator, Photoshop etc. running at the same time, and I assume it would work as well with games. Surprisingly little bloatware.The camera is nice for basic skyping; I have my own, so I don't use it enough to have much of an opinion other than that it's about the same quality as a lower-mid range one at Best Buy. Software for the camera has some fun stuff like frames/avatars that integrate with a plugged-in camera as well.Size is GLORIOUS. Dwarfs any other laptop in the room. Makes Macbooks look like toys. Awesome for multitasking.Shipped on time, box was huge with the normal Dell box inside, I assume for protection, which clearly worked.She's pretty too; I guess I didn't look hard enough at the pictures to see it before I ordered, but rather than a solid black the whole deck and backing is a  varied-size stripe pattern with a few shades of black/grey, maybe the tiniest bit of brown-black/blue-black. It's sort of like woodgrain without knots, more attractive that I'm probably describing it.Sound quality is, well, quality. Noticeable difference between it and my last laptop, though again, the bar was not set too high.Of course, there is a catch. Within a few hours of starting it up the mouse started to stick, jerking back to the right edge of the screen every time I panned left. It goes away within a minute, but comes back every few hours and is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I don't know if this is a hardware or software problem, or if there is a way to fix it. If someone has any idea it would be very helpful. I doubt this is a problem with this entire model; more likely a flaw specific to this computer or some percentage of the models. It's probably just my punishment for the thousands of helpless orphans I torture and kill each week.
