I went ahead and got the red one and saved $20, only thought about that is the red on the lid is pinkish pending on light but the red aluminum  palm rest is red red.Came with Windows 8 pre installed so i thought id keep it and partition to run 7 mainly. I've tried to get used to it before and hated it, if you don't have a touch screen device you're better off with 7 in my opinion.Build quality is very sound in comparison to my previous ASUS K53E. Everything feels very solid physically. The palm rest and area around the keyboard are metal the keys and screen bezel have a flat feeling finish. The touchpad is large but unfortunately has rocket buttons and has a dry feeling, which to me gives you less pointer precision and is slightly uncomfortable. Screen is brilliant and bright. Something very important to me is that while the power jack isn't the ideal type it is VERY sturdy, also getting ~4hrs battery life.Physical things i would prefer to be different: glossy screen back, rocker bar on touch pad, and differently finished touchpad.When it comes to power this computer is an excellent value. A 2.5Ghz hyper threaded dual core processor and 4GB of 1600 Mhz ram should be plenty for most application. Drop $25 on another 4GB and you're be running anything you want with ease.The integrated hd4000 graphics were a delightful surprise compared to hd 3000. Enough gpu power for moderate to light gaming such as MMO's and some other less demanding games. Don't expect to play battlefield or crysis smoothly on this. Also nice to be able to change dedicated VRAM in bios to 512mb.Other thoughts: low rpm HDD, considering replacing optical drive with an SSD. Wish screen back was metal, but that would just bump the price.Would definitely buy this again and recommend this model to others
