Regardless of the make or model of Toshiba laptop you possess, good luck getting any action out of Toshiba customer no-service.  After a solid month of dealing with them I have concluded that they have no intention of honoring their agreement, made that the time I purchased my laptop to repair or replace my laptop, a Toshiba Satellite L675 D,should it be defective.  My screen started blinking and flashing less than one month after I purchased it.  After following Toshiba's instructions to do various things to address the situation, I started getting hard drive failure warnings, followed by the dreaded blue screen.  At that point, I dutifully shipped off my laptop to the repair depot.  After ten days turned into 3 weeks, I called to see why my machine was still in limbo.  I was informed that they had put it on hold for parts.  My subsequent phone inquiry elicited an excuse that a parts hold extends their repair time frame by 7 to 10 days.  The rep was actually counting off the days on his fingers.  When he got to 10 and realized that his excuse no longer held water, he apologized and said that he would e-mail someone to find out what the delay was, and he would "call me back immediately."  Ten days later, after nothing had changed, I called again. I was informed by a supervisor that my laptop was put on a new hold on December the 5th, and that there was no other remedy available to me. Basically, if I didn't like it, tough.  there's no-one else to talk to, and if I complain to Toshiba corporate or post on a board like this one, they could care less.  I told him that he had lost a customer, and he basically kissed me off and hung up.  Please take this under consideration when you consider purchasing any Toshiba product.  I am going to.
