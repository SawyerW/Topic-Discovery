My reference point is from the use of Thinkpads for 10 years (t-20, t-40, t-60) and the Dell Latitude series for another 3 (both brands are premium business laptops).This is my take on this deal: This is a fantastic buy for $399! And stand-alone, not a bad computer!The outstanding: - Great built in camera (2Mp - most others have 1.3 or just 0.3) - Faster HDD than most other laptops (7200 rpm, most others have 5500) - Fantastic connectivity for this price class; HDMI, eSATA - Durable design using polished metalThe good: - Quite good speakers for this price - Processor is reasonably fast, graphic processing also - Keyboard is water proof, HDD has shock absorber functionThe bad: - The touchpad buttons are part of the touchpad, making them difficult to use as the cursor will typically move when you click. I use an external mouse, so it is not really a problem. - I find myself mistyping more often when using the keyboard than on my Lenovo Thinkpad or Dell Latitude - and my fingers are not particularly fatThe ugly: - Adding more ram was NOT a cakewalk - dissembling the keyboard and top panel was easy - putting it back together again was a nightmare, eventually had me using a kitchen knife to modify the plastic panels (if you do this be very gentle not to bend anything, so you don't have to bend it back like I had to...).Would I buy it again? Definitely! I love this thing!------ Additional observations added on August 1st, 2011 ------ - The wireless antenna is awesome. In locations where my two-year-old Thinkpad achieves just one or two bars from the wireless network (or sometimes none), the HP achieves four. - The web-cam works extremely well in dim light, better than that of my Thinkpad and on par with that of my Latitude 4300. - I've had no issues whatsoever concerning stability after nearly 3 months of usage. No hang-ups, crashes or freezes! I think this is the most stable computer I've ever owned.
