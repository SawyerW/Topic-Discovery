I purchased my MacBook almost three months ago based on the reviews. My mistake. I admit that I did expect to find the change from Windows to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.4) a challenge. What I did NOT expect was that the support personnel at Apple would be so poorly trained that their help was almost useless. The standard solution after 2-3 hours on the phone was to reinstall the operating system. Big mistake. I downloaded Adobe, and it would not work properly on this laptop. I could no longer open simple pdf files. So, I called Apple support. Two hours later I was told to archive and reinstall the operating system. After doing that I still couldn't view pdf files, but finally used spotlight to find that there was still a small adobe file that needed to be deleted. That whole problem should have been a 5 minute phone call.  Unfortunately now  the printer would not work. Two more hours on the phone, and the "support tech" told me to remove the printer and then add it back. Bingo, the printer now worked. But again, more wasted hours. The next day I tried to access the Itunes store. Nope, couldn't do that either anymore. Three more hours on the phone, and I was told that it isn't possible to access the Itunes store from a managed account. Interesting that I have been doing just that for the past three months. Bottom line, don't expect decent support from Apple. If you buy a Macbook, you are really on your own. If you are familiar with Apple computers or have superior technical skills, you should do OK. But if you are coming over from Windows, you will only find frustration and misery. I will attempt to force Apple to take this thing back, and give me a refund. If that fails, I will try to find someone who still thinks that Apple is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and sell this MacBook to them!!!
