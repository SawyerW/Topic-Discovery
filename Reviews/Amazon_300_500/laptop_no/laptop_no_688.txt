To summarize this product, the MacBook is an amazing laptop. My previous laptop, a Dell, caused me problems the first month I purchased it. It was terribly slow, had a battery life no longer than an hour and a half at most, and often would freeze up while I was using it. After having it only one year, the battery was shot and the computer wouldn't even run unless it was plugged in at all times. Eventually it blacked out and never turned on again.After all this, the MacBook makes my life so much easier since it runs extremely fast and isn't able to get the viruses that plagued my PC. The programs it comes with are easy to use and have more features than Windows programs. For example, iPhoto will automatically take your imported digital pictures and separate them into different events based on the time they were taken. This saves a lot of time when uploading photos because you don't have to manually select pictures to separate into an album. iChat is a smoother, more professional version of AOL Instant Messenger. Also, the built-in webcam takes surprisingly detailed photos that can be easily edited with the Photo Booth.The MacBook is a sturdy, dependable computer and is well worth the extra couple hundred bucks since it will save you a lot of the hassle PCs come with.  If you need to check something quickly, you can have the computer turned on and the internet running just a few seconds after pushing the power button. It is able to handle multiple programs running at once without slowing down or freezing.Many people are afraid to purchase a MacBook because they are unfamiliar with it and believe the programs are difficult to run. This isn't true at all, since I've found that the advanced design of Macs is much more simple to navigate then Windows. My dad has the same computer I do and feels the same way. I am always telling my friends to make the switch and get a MacBook.
