First of all - it's BIG .. it's big and heavy .. so if you're looking for a laptop you can carry around - just know in advance that it's really big, really heavy, and you'll need a really sturdy bag to haul it .. mine will mostly be stationary on my desk so the size/weight is not an issue for me.I've had it about a week and so far the laptop is great.  I've bought Asus laptops in the past (4 of them) but in the past 6 months I've gotten some Samsung products that made me want to get the Series 7 Gamer.  I've gotten the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 and a LED-TV.  Two things that are common in all of them - the screens are BEAUTIFUL.  I don't think anyone makes a more beautiful screen than Samsung!  And the quality of the finished product is really nice.  For the comments from others that are put-off on the design of the laptop lid - it's intentional - it's a design feature - no matter how many times you send it back you're going to get the same thing.  I think it looks pretty cool.Another reason I got this is 'cuz I love Windows 7 - and I'm not really looking forward to Windows 8.  I normally jump to the newest version (of most things in general, Windows in particular) but I'm not jumping this time.  I needed to update my laptop - I wanted to do it before Win8 comes out later this year - and the Series 7 Gamer, for me, was the way to do it.It's got enough memory to make everyone happy (16gb), it's got 2 big hard drives (750gb each - the C: drive is multi-partitioned to hold the recovery files), it has a BluRay drive and a good Nvidia graphics card, good sound .. exactly what I needed.  So far there have been no issues with any of it. I'm happy with my purchase!
