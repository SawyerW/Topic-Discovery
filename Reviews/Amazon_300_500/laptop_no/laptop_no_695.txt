i absolutely love pretty much everything made by Apple,especially their laptops. i really wanted  either a new 15 inch MBP or a 13 MBA, but didn't have $1500. so as i do with everything i buy, i researched it excessively, and figured it would be great for pretty much everything. i got it, and it was advertised as in "good" condition, well the whole front of the keyboard/trackpad assembly was cracked, which is very common on these non-uniboby MacBooks. what somewhat angered me was that it looks like someone tried to fill in the cracks with super glue, and if i were to replace the assembly, it would not sit flush. but thats ok, since i ended up getting it for just the cost of shipping anyway, since it arrived so late, the seller (totally on their own, btw) gave me a full refund and didnt want it back. so now onto the actual device, it does all i want it to do and more! it plays 1080p video (which i was very surprised about since it has a non-HD intel GMA), it even plays call of duty!(the older ones) i upgraded the hard drive to a 7200 rpm 160GB, i was thinking about getting an ssd, but realized that i still need windows for school(i go to a technical high school, i take CADD, and all the programs that we use are windows-specific), so i am going to order this also, ASUS 1215N-PU27-SL 12.1-Inch Netbook (Silver) and take the hdd out of that, put it in this, and put an ssd in the asus. (yes, now i realize i am spending close to $1500, but not really, since i got a refund on this. once i get the asus, this will still be my primary laptop, i just need something to take to school since the computers in CADD suck
