In a few ways, the new metal MacBooks are actually an improvement over the last-gen MBs... aluminum is nicer-looking (IMO) than the previous white plastic, there's a more solid-feeling keyboard, new LED-backlighting on an all-glass screen (highly glossy though- reflection-and-fingerprint-city), new multitouch gesturing (like the iPhone) on a new all-glass trackpad that IS the button now (the whole trackpad 'clicks'- some will like this, some won't), and somewhat better graphics performance (though still far from hardcore gamer standards).But Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the high price point. Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and various Firewire-to-whatever adapters or hubs, present or future, are not solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can.These folks are now stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000 & up), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Book model, still around at $1000, with FireWire- though these will likely be discontinued pretty soon.The screen is also a bit disappointing, with a very limited viewing angle and far-from-the-best blacks and contrast.Bottom line: It's a quite pretty new MacBook with some nice minor upgrades and clever touches, but a less-than-great screen and one huge downgrade that didn't need to happen. Also, at $1600, it's quite expensive, even for the MacBook line.If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's certainly fine. But, isn't much of the reason why MacBooks are WORTH the price premium the fact that you can do darn near ANYTHING with 'em? Not anymore.Prosumers will be especially disappointed, as Apple is expecting them to shell out quite a lot of money for a notebook that doesn't really support what they want to do anymore.
