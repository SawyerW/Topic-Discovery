This is my saga of attempting to use Dell's extended warranty.My saga begins in January of this year.  My Dell Inspiron Notebook began to fail.  This resulted in four technicians visiting my home.  I waited for one technician on three different days until he finally showed several hours late on the fourth appointment.  The first replaced my video card, the second replaced my video card but when this did not work, he phoned and another technician came and replaced the LCD.  The third replaced the video card, the LCD, and the motherboard.  There was still a problem.  I might add that with three of these, there was a long conversation on the phone.  I am now quite good at understanding Indians speaking broken English.When my computer failed again Dell finally agreed to replace my computer.  While very frustrated, I felt at least I was making progress even though this meant I would have to reload all my programs.  My refurbished computer arrived and it was an upgrade over my old computer.  I reloaded my programs but quickly noticed a problem with the hard drive hanging up.  I could not believe Dell would send me a computer with a bad hard drive but after talking to Dell again and running a long test, the hard drive was indeed found to be bad.Dell then told me they would send a new preconfigured hard drive and it would arrive in ten working days.  I phoned again in fifteen days and they apologized that there was a technical problem and the hard drive had not been mail.  They guaranteed I would receive it in five days.  I phoned again the next day and the person could find no action had been taken but he agreed he would send the drive and it would arrive in three days but it would not be a preconfigured drive.  I would have to use the restoration disc.I phone again and they said I would receive it in two days.To be continued.
