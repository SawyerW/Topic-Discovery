My oldest son works in the Performing Arts and most of the software they use runs on Mac. The raw specs of every Apple notebook are sufficient to run the specialized software he uses, so it just comes down to individual preference of "battery life, portability and price" vs "screen resolution and hard drive space". In my analysis (see below) I came to the conclusion that 128gb is fine when supplemented with the SD card slot,an external drive and cloud storage (iCloud, DropBox, Box, etc).I also came to the conclusion that the $300ish price premium for the retina display would be better spent on a very nice external monitor and/or a  large external hard drive. The HD5000 video supports up to 2560-by-1600 resolution and with a tiny Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter you can use any HDMI monitor  (Tera Grand - Premium Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt to HDMI Adapter). We also owned notebooks with screens 11" and larger and have come to the conclusion that 13" is the minimum size needed to do "real" work.Here are the Accessories I recommend:Apple Magic Mouse or other Bluetooth MouseMini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt to HDMI AdapterMini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt to VGA AdapterExternal Hard Drive (examples 1tb, 4tb )Apple USB DVD Superdrive or other USB External DVD DriveSDXC or microSD Cards (there are some adapters on hte market that let the microSd sit flush)Office for Mac 2011[::: 2013 13.3" MacBook Air vs 13.3" Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A :::][+Air] 2.96 pounds vs 3.56 pounds[+Air] HD5000 Graphics vs HD4000 Graphics (40% faster)[+Air] PCIe based SSDs Drive vs ATA SATA drive[+Air] 17.3 mm thick vs 19.1 mm thick[+Air] 12 hours battery vs 7 hours[+Air] 802.11ac Wi-Fi vs 802.11n[+-Air] 128 GB SSD vs 500gb SATA (faster but less space)[-Air] 1440-by-900 pixels vs 1280-by-800 Resolution[-Air] no FW 800 Port[-Air] no Gigabit Ethernet[-Air] 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 vs 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 [::: 2013 13.3" MacBook Air vs 13.3" Apple MacBook Pro with Retina MD212LL/A :::]*** See above plus differences below[+Air] $1099 vs $1419[+Air] 128 GB PDIe SSD vs 128gb SATA SSD (slower interface)[-Air] 1440-by-900 pixels vs 2560-by-1600 Resolution[-Air] 4gb RAM vs 8GB Ram[::: 2013 13.3" MacBook Air vs 2012 13.3 MacBook Air MD231LL/A :::][+] Faster PCIe based SSDs instead of SATA SSD drive[+] DDR3L to LPDDR3 for faster RAM memory[+] 802.11ac Wi-Fi for faster wireless[+] 12 hours battery life vs 7 hours[+] HD5000 video for better graphics and supporting DirectX 11.1, OpenCL 1.2 and OpenGL 4.0.
