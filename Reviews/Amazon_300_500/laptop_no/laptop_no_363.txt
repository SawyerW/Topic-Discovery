This is my 3rd Apple and sadly, each new one I buy has more problems than the previous. It feels like Apple is riding on it's reputation at this point. The pro with this machine is of course its portability, and its SSD is nice and quick. On the downside, mine has been horribly unreliable. I had to bring this laptop into support a few months after buying it. The issue was so bad they had to wipe the entire computer and re-uploading from my time machine didn't work, so I had to add everything manually. I've had chronic problems with it ever since, but each time I take it in, they put a bandaid on the issue and run the software and hardware tests- never finding anything, and yet things KEEP going wrong. And this is a NEW machine, not refurbished. Apple doesn't seem to care that there are chronic problems, as long as the immediate ones are fixed. Which basically means that as soon as my support package runs out, I'm going to be left with a very unreliable machine that will need expensive repairs or an entire replacement after just a couple years. Maybe that's ok for people who have money to burn. I'm not one of those people. I need a reliable machine that doesn't require me spending hours on the phone with support or leaving my laptop for days at a time in the Apple store. Frankly, unless you are a dyer Apple fan and are married to the Apple OS, I would look to a good PC- especially considering most of them have touch screens and there's not a single Apple computer that does. Believe me, I've used Macs for over a decade and I used to love them. The quality just isn't there these days- at least not in my experience, You take your chances.
