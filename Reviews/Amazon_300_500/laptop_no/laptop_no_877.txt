Sitting around typing on my macbook air, with a mac mini near and the newest macbook pro nearby,...Ive used this Macbook air now for nearly 2 years, believe or not, its speakers are louder and clearer than the MBP (unless you install the BOOM application to boost volume), and the screen is far superior, not in my opinion, but apple inc. itself admits that even a 2 year old Macbook Air has a superior/sharper screen (samsung made) than the screen on the NEW non-retina Macbook pros. If the SSD 6 seconds to boot doesnt impress you about the MB Air, then the fact that its a SMOKING FAST computer that weighs in right at the level of an IPAD, ....if you want to turn on your computer and do something REAL FAST and do a shutdown and run along in life, then ONLY the Macbook AIR is a go.All the power of a desktop, but FASTER (ssd drive).....lite as an IPAD, easy to pack around without bruising your shoulder. I must have heard at least a 1000 people lament "jeez, I wish I'd bought an AIR instead of my MBP!".  No optical drive? Who cares, stick your torrent movies on a $70 1TB HD and pack it around.Its pathetic and laughable that anyone complained about 128GB of HD space when a 1TB portable drive is now around $65! Insanity. Just get a Macbook AIR, you'll be glad you did.The Macbook AIR really is the 'all future laptops will be somewhat like this'., and thats a fact. Conventional HD are slowing dying out as SSD become cheap, and the notion of a MBP in ANY flavour, even the Retina, is a joke. The Retina MBP is useless unless youre a pro photographer or plan on video editing, since it has NO optical drive, you have absolutely and utterly NO purpose in owning a Retina display laptop, NONE.And as far as relative to the MBP retina: As many new Retina MBP users have recently lamented "hey, my old macbook air is running faster than my new Retina MBP!?"
