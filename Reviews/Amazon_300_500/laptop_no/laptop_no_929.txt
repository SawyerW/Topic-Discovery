SO MUCH TO LOVE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this computer after much research, seeing as this is the best ultrabook/touch screen windows 8 computer on the market. The hardware is amazing. I love the 1080p screens. I love the large mouse pad. I love the backlight, chicklet keyboard. I love the inclusion of two USB 3.0 points. And I especially love the great audio coming out of this small package.SO MUCH THAT ANNOYS ME:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The two screens are recognized by Windows 8 as a main screen and a secondary monitor. This means that there is no easy built in way to adjust the brightness of the touch screen with Windows 8. The built in adjustments only work for your primary screen.2. Additionally, my ASUS smart gesture driver keeps randomly failing. I've reinstalled it multiple times. I've tried reinstalling Windows. But every other day, the driver just randomly quits out and I love my two finger gestures and those crucial Windows 8 swipes.3. The glass on the touch screen feels to flexible. Writing for hours a day in classes, I can feel the glass deform under my palm when writing and it really worries me. I previously owned a Fujitsu Lifebook tablet for 4 years and the glass touch screen was much more solid and just felt more reliable.4. The two screens packed into a thin lid make the computer unbalanced, and fatigue the hinge too easily. After a brief period of desktop only use, the hinge barely held the set position. The heavy screens always wanted to slip further back.SO MUCH THAT I HATE:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. A had to return a Taichi because the touch screen kept registering false taps in the top right corner. This was stupidly frustrating since it messed up my gesture password and would randomly close programs. Imagine browsing the internet when randomly 10 blank tabs open. Having to return a Taichi for this reason just makes me question the outside glass surface even more.2. I had to return my second Taichi because the battery kept losing life. After two weeks of use the battery wouldnt charge beyond 89%. The charger's LED indicator never went green. Windows would always say "89% charged, and not charging" even though it was plugged in. I'm sure this will just get worse until the battery is completely dead. The Taichi doesn't have stellar battery life to begin with, but issues like these are inexcusable.IN CONCLUSION-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall there is much to love. Physically, this computer is one of the very best to launch with Windows 8. Unfortunately, this line of ultrabooks seem to be plagued by issues. The time and effort I've spent setting up and trouble shooting two malfunctioning laptops has really hurt my opinion on ASUS PCs.
