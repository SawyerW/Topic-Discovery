I am an apple fan and enjoy using the macbook but I just cannot recommend this laptop at the moment to others based on what you are getting for your money.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, then you should unfortunately look elsewhere.  In the midst of economic trouble apple has decided to increase the cost of their new entry level aluminum macbooks by 20% over early 2008s models with marginal performance gains from the additional front side bus.Pros-new trackpad has cool factor (although buggy)-new graphic card has made this a decent gaming platform-design is smooth and polishedCons- Overall performance based on price has decreased.  Now instead of getting a 2.4Ghz dual core for $1300 you must shell out an additional $300 @ $1600 to acquire this performance. If you checkout macworld's benchmarks the performance gained over the additional FSB is marginal at best.  The only gains come in frames per second during game testing.- graphics card is nice but most ppl are not even into hardcore computer gaming and the macbook use to be a nice alternative to the pro models hefty price tag for us non gamers....wish this could have been an option.-160GB or 250GB hard drive with only 5400rps!  At these price points I expected at the minimum 7200rps.  I know this can be manually changed, but who wants to shell even more money after buy such an expensive laptop.Overall this computer performs well but the price is even becoming to high for some of us apple fans.  The macbooks have always been a top of the line luxury laptop but now they are widening that gap even further with design not performance fueling the price increases.  My recommendation is to wait at this time b/c come mid 2009 the prices will hopefully fall and Apple's new and improved SnowLeopard OS will be out.  With Steve Jobs you never buy the first iteration of a new product, unless you are willing to pay top dollar for something that will decrease in price by 20% in 6months.
