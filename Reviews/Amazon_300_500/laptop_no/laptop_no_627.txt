I started a new job in January and they gave me the Lenovo S230u Twist. My new boss said it would be great for presentations and it's very flexible and that the company will be giving their sales people this product in the future. Do not buy this machine! Yes, it does rotate and you can make presentation with it but you can do the same thing with a normal laptop for less money!The keypad is the worst in the industry. It's upside down where the left and right buttons are near the keyboard not your thumbs. The corners of the mouse pad can be pressed but the pressure is inconsistent and the cursor is constantly moving around by itself.I own a Samsung Note 10.1 and it outperforms the twist hands down. The Note's screen is too small for more than one-on-one presentations however. But I have eliminated my paper notepad and do everything electronically.The Twist has a touch screen but doesn't offer a stylus for handwriting, something I love about the Note. All you end up doing is getting the screen dirty touching it. The screen resolution is poor as well. If the Twist did handwriting recognition I could live with the warts it has, but it doesn't.The Twists case has a matte black or grey finish and it sucks up finger oils and constantly looks dirty. Don't eat or snack while working because whatever you eat will end up on the case or mousepad. Bad design.The Twist can swivel. So what? Turn a normal less expensive laptop around and you can accomplish the same thing.The Twist crashes randomly. I don't know if it's because of Windows 8 or the unit itself but it's feels like the old school pc's that would just crash for no reason.The keyboard is weird as well. The delete key is above the backspace key. Not well thought out at all.This machine gets an "F-" for form, function, and price.Buy something else.
