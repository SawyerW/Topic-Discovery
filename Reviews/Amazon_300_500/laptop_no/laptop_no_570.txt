Apple's products are great..if that is what you want to know, read no more. And that is true, only you have to remember one aspect of that: they are great WHEN they are working properly.Mine has had three serious problems in just one year. The first happened right out of the box, the logic board came with some kind of malfunction and Apple had to change it. Two months after that the problem was with the internal microphone, and again bring it to apple to fix it...now, just as the one year guarantee ended, another important problem, this time with the magic pad. This time, however, not even apple knows for sure what is happening, and if you browse on blogs, you will see that a lot of people experience the same as I am now experiencing, and no clue to how to solve. I am sure that whoever read this and had not experienced any problem will say I was not lucky with my equipment, that they NEVER had any problem, etc...but the fact is, apple does have a lot of problems, with a lot of its customers and, what is worse, the problems in a Mac, when they do happen, are ALWAYS harder to fix than in a PC. That is the reason they so strongly encourage you to  buy the apple protection plan, for another 200 bucks.But I have to confess. When everything is ok, the product is nice to use it, has great performance and great looks. Perhaps you are lucky and will not fall into the negative statistcs as I did, but if you do, you will agree with me that their products are good, not great and their support is far from great, if the problem is not easely fixed. Good luck with yours...me, coming back to a PC...
