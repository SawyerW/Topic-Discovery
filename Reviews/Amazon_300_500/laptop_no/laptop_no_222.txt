So I bought this MacBook air last March 21 2011. I've been trying it out at Best Buy and I liked it, but I bought mine of Amazon since it was cheaper.I have always used to Windows laptop and I wanted to see what was good about Macbooks.First thing I'm going to comment on is the design. The design is very sleek and thin. It can feel a little fragile on the hand, but it's really good in build. I found it difficult to open the macbook at first, but it got easier after awhile. Definitely looks very expensive ( Well, it kinda is) and most definitely a head turner. The silver is really nice and makes the apple logo really pop.I must say, running the macbook is very fast. While it takes a couple of minutes for Windows to set up, the macbook took like 20 seconds flat. Very fast and I appreciated that for someone who is quite impatient. When you close the macbook, it automatically turns to sleep and when you open it up again, it starts running in just seconds. No more waiting.I can't say much about the software as I had no experience with macs before to compare it with, but I think it has the same features as the other mac. For a windows user, it takes getting used to how the mac works, most especially when installing items and opening and closing applications. But overall, I love how quick the applications open up.The mac does have some major flaws though. It doesn't have a disc drive. Not that I used it all the time, but I would've appreciated it if it came with one. I guess they took that out in favor of the slim design. It also doesn't have a memory card slot. I can't upload photos from digital cameras without having to use a usb cable.Overall, I love the performance and design of the mac, but for its price, they could've atleast offered it with a disc drive and memory card slot
