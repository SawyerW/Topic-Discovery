After a couple of lemon PC products, I chose to try out a Mac hoping that it would provide a quality experience on par with its price. First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on. But about a week after I got it, it started to randomly lose wifi... sometimes once a day, sometimes five times in five minutes. I contacted Apple Care 3 times about the issue. They did what they could (which was nothing except tell me that they would fix the problem over and over without ever admitting that there was a any "real" problem). Though friendly, Apple Care was far from truly helpful. I looked up online and found that this is a persisting and common problem with Macs. Apple refuses to admit that there is a problem and maintains that even though there are thousands of bloggers with their own angry stories. Macs are sold and marketed as a business and school laptop... but it fails miserably since it cannot be relied upon for a business transaction or a online test (my sister bought the same one and has the same problems... she prays every time she takes an online exam it doesnt disconnect). On top of that the track pad is now randomly becoming unrsponsive to trying to click a selectioin and sometimes even just to move the cursor. My sisters has similar problems to include "losing" the cursor and spending a good thirty seconds messing with the track pad to get it to reappear. 1200 bucks for a laptop that cannot do the simplest things correctly... on top of all that, I have been restarting it at least once a day to keep it working... eg skype camera won't work unless I have just restarted it and my internet when connected will not work until I do the same. GOOGLE these problems and YOU WILL SEE that I am not alone.... What a dissapointment.
