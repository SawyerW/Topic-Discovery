Apple never ceases to amaze me with the products that they put out. Every time I turn around they have a brand now version/model of a laptop or desktop that is simply amazing. I know that when I purchase an apple I am buying something that is made with quality that I can trust. The Macbook is by far the best laptop that I have ever purchased. I made 2 other purchases towards laptops before getting my Mac, and yes they were PC laptops. Something always went wrong with one of the PCs and after a while I was tired and just wanted something that worked. I never really gave the Macbook a second thought after messing with one in the Apple Store.Macbooks seem to have everything I need, and some. As a student it is very important to have a computer that I can trust to not crash on me while I am typing up a 20-page document for one of my research classes. It's also important for me to know that I can take my laptop to class and not be worried about the loss of too much battery. The Macbook's battery life is very impressive compared to my other laptops I have owned. I can get at least 3 hours of battery life off of the charger. IT'S AMAZING!!!  I am also into graphic designing, and with the Macbook's fast processor and AMAZING Adobe Photoshop CS3 software, I can makeup something that some can only dream of. The Macbook's pristine 13.3-inch glossy screen display makes all of my graphics, along with movies and other visual items, to pop out of the screen.If you are in the field of searching for a new laptop, I strongly encourage you to check out the Macbook, it will be a worthwhile purchase!
