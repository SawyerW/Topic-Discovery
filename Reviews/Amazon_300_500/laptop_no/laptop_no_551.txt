I have had my Acer Chromebook for about 2 weeks now.  Like any device, there is a learning curve and I am still learning about the capabilities of my chromebook.  So far, I have found nothing to dislike.  OK, one thing I dislike it that the battery lasts only 3 hours tops.  Other than that, I have hooked this up to my TV and watch Netflix with the hdmi cable, I have downloaded pictures with my flashdrive.  Use Pixir app to edit photos.  I can't figure out why anyone gives the chromebook one star unless they didn't read up on this first to see what it can and can't do.  It does everything I want it to do so I love it. It has a cool adjustable (yet blulky) plug so you can adjust it depending on what angle to plug it in. My advice is to understand what it is you want from your "computer", do some research and if you decide a chromebook is for you, then it is perfect. If there is something I can't figure out, I just youtube my question and I can usually find easy short videos (such as turning on the mirror screen to watch Nexflix on my tv).  Start up takes seconds! I bypassed paying $50.00 more for the Samsung because I didn't need bluetooth, the one extra port wasn't needed and I wanted a glossy screen (the Samsung is matt).  The Samsung does have a longer battery life and looks a little more sturdy, so those are things to consider.  The Acer is perfect for my needs.  The only other negative that has nothing to do with my chromebook is that UPS delivered my box to the wrong apartment (again) and I had to search for it.  I hate UPS and I tell that to Amazon every chance I get!
