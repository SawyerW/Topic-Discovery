This is one of the best laptops I worked on. Though many people think 12.1" screen is smaller, I do not think so, it gives you an 1024x768 resolution which is very good, unless you are expecting your laptop to be a TV replacement to watch movies. I am a student and use my laptop for heavy software development and I never faced any problem with the CPU performance. Till now my experience with this new centrino processor is awesome. As for the battery life issues, it cant be better than this. Though compared to the other centrino machines this machine is bit expensive, but I pay for the style and brand and the quality of the product. Its been 3 weeks since I bought this notebook, and I never repented for paying the extra buck..AS for the other side,You have to make your own recovery CD's, which is very important step before you do anything with the laptop.. And I could not upgrade to windows XP professional, it gave me some virtual memory low message and kept on restarting after the installation was done, So I had to do complete installation of XP Pro. If the XP pro upgrade is not successful for you also, do not worry. You can put the recovery CD 1 and get all the software installed back on the clean XP professional. So there is a way around to keep the software which came with the machine and have XP pro.. And I am little disappointed SONY did not provide us with a third party CD writer software, we are forced to use the inbuilt XP writer, which is slow compared to NERO cd burner software or Roxio easy cd creator.. Overall you will get the value for your money..And I do not understand why Amazon display's different specification on this website than what we see on sony. My laptop has an L2 cache of 1MB, but amazon displays here it as 512 KB which is very confusing. I didnt buy my notebook on Amazon becoz of that confusion..
