I purchased XPS M1330 on March 2008. Based on a year of usage, I do not recommend this product.Let me layout the good things about this computer first. The screen quality is very good and shiny (I bought the Slim light-LED display for additional money). The colors are very good. The system does not come with a load of unnecessary software and does not slow the performance.  The keyboard feel and comfort is excellent.However, the hardware integration of this computer is weak.  In less than 8 months, the graphics card was completely dead. The mother board was replaced by Dell.  Worst of all the problems is the audio skipping and stuttering during just about anything, playing DVDs, listening to music (either from the harddrive or from an external harddrive), or just working.  If you search the web for XPS M1330 audio skipping, you'll notice that many other individuals have the same problem.  There is a resource conflict between the sound card and the other components of the computer.  Dell is aware of this, yet, they still ship out the computers with this problem.  Apparently, the Sigmatel, the sound card for Dell, and its drivers are responsible for this. Even if you remove the Sigmatel drivers, you'll hear the audio skipping.  My motherboard was replaced second time after consistent errors by the sound card. Still, I hear the audio skipping. I tried all the temporary workarounds that were suggested by many people in forums. But to no avail.In sum, I do not recommend this product. This is one of the premium lines of Dell products.  It is supposed to be highest quality, because it is the highest in price. Yet, the hardware integration is sloppy and poor in quality. I personally regret going with Dell. Next time, I will seriously consider other options, such as HP, ASUS, Apple, etc.
