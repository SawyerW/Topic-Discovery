27 August 2011 Update:I've had the computer for a year year now and it just started overheating and shutting down randomly.  The terrible part is my warranty is expired by like 2 weeks.  I will never by an HP again.Original Review:This is by far the worst laptop I've ever owned.  Right out of the box the box the multi touch mouse features didn't work nor have worked since.  At two months of owning the laptop, it locked up and I couldn't fully start Windows.  The silver lining to this was that there was a feature that allowed you to backup the computer even if you couldn't fully start the computer.  This did save it, and almost temped me to up the rating review on this laptop.  So I was able to restore my laptop, and restore all my documents, but still frustrated that I had to do it.  So now 3 months into owning the computer my lcd screen is malfunctioning.  Half the screen is dark and grainy.  I've talked to customer service, who to their credit, was very helpful, and I'm sending in my laptop.Now I suppose I could be having these problems with any laptop but there are other features I just can't stand with the laptop.  Probably my biggest complaint is the mousepad.  I hate the way it feels, the pointer is stiff, the mousepad is slow and at times unresponsive.  A number of times I've accidently shut the whole mousepad off, because I've accidently kept my hand/finger over the little whole on the mouse pad.Now to the computer's credit there are a few things that have been good.  The keyboard is comfortable, the laptop itself is pretty light, and it's nice having an hdmi port on the computer.  Also as mentioned earlier, it was great to still be able to backup the computer after it crashed.  If I hadn't had the problems with my mouse, screen, and computer crashing, then I probably would give the computer 3 stars.On a side note, my wife loves it, doesn't mind the mouse, thinks the laptop is cute, and loves the built in camera.
