This laptop is more appropriate to be classified as netbook because the size and merely 1GHz processor. The general performance is pretty like Toshiba T215D with 1.3GHz dual core CPU with some plus:720P IPS screen. This is a nice surprise such screen is found on such price netbook. The graphic is pretty good with this screen (wide viewing angle without color degradation). The touchscreen is OK with some strange behavior (it doesn't work well with FireFox and PowerPoint 2007), but, indeed, touchscreen works better than mouse (faster).My model came with 4GB (2GB on board and 2GB on the slot), so I bought an 8GB DDR3L (note: you must buy 1.35V model or it won't work) to increase RAM to 10GB. After adding to 10GB, it works much smoother with multiple applications.It comes with 500GB HDD which should be more than enough except you want to put a lot of videos (720p is recommended because the screen).The "square" port is indeed Mini Display Port which some Apple laptops are using. HDMI works fine with MiniDP HDMI adapter, but the resolution is limited to external screen's maximum supported resolution.Battery life is on the short side. I upgraded Windows 8 Pro with Media Center in order to use HD HomeRun. It just works fine without any hiccup, but battery does not exceed 2 hours with HD stations (SD can last a bit longer).The speaker is loud enough for a kitchen, but don't expect it has any deep bass (you can use bluetooth speakers if you want. My model has bluetooth built in).Here is a warning: if you'd like to tweak the screen to fit your taste, you MUST use Windows Color Management. Using AMD Vision Center to tweak the white balance and gamma screen will mess up the system and the screen becomes black which requires factory reset.This laptop is indeed a netbook with nice display with touch support, and it achieved the balance among price, performance, feature, and screen.
