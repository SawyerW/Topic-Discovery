CRAP CRAP CRAP. *laptop was purchased at Best Buy in early February 2011*Listen up, folks. If you're having the same issues I've been having with this PC (Piece of Crap), go to Toshiba like I did. If they don't respond (like how it happened to me), give them notice that if they don't take steps to solve the matter, you will contact the Better Business Bureau in your area to kick start a settlement (like I did).If they contact you after you file your formal BBB complaint and you still have not reached a proper settlement (complete refund for the lemon and all its costly repairs) select the option to file another complaint.Then, contact your retailer (Best Buy). Let them know what's up. Send them screen shots and the link to this forum so they can see for themselves what a hunk of junk this laptop actually is.Look up your state Lemon Law and how it pertains to electronics. Contact your area representative telling them every step you've taken thus far and that you need to bring attention to Toshiba's crappy service. And a proper settlement.Regardless if you're out of warranty, if you've pursued the matter since it began in 2011, that issue becomes irrelevant.We need our voices to be heard on this company's faulty product and lack of customer service! Don't just think it's your tiny little voice versus an entire company!As part of the recognized one percent, we deserve proper customer service from a globally involved company. Not some lame excuse saying to take it back to the store and pay for repairs that shouldn't be needed.I encourage you to take this review and put it to good use! My fight has been months in the making, and being a student, I need a reliable laptop! I will NOT stop until the issue is resolved in a way I see fit!
