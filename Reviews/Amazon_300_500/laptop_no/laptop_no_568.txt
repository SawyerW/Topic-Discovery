I had this computer for only 2 months.  A cup of water got spilled into the keyboard, thus destroying the logic (mother) board.  Apple offered to fix it for $800- thanks, but no thanks.  I called Apple because I still need a new laptop.  They suggested I buy a keyboard cover next time- perhaps that would have saved it.While I had it, it was a nice computer, but I had some issues with migration- moving my data from my older laptop to this one.  The time got messed up- it wanted to stay on GMT.  I called Apple and they figured out that a folder with local time or something had to be trashed to fix the problem.  It took some time, but trashing the folder they told me to trash fixed the problem.  So if you're migrating information, call Apple if your date/time doesn't set properly.My main reason for writing this review is not to say what a great computer this is.  In fact, the newer one is out with more RAM (3Gb) and more HD storage  (250 Gb), for the same price that I bought this one 3 months ago.  I love Macs in general- mainly the fact that you don't have to worry about viruses- the hackers don't seem to be able to get into the OS system- and I think Macs are easier to use- more  intuitive than PCs.  But my reason for writing is to help someone avoid the problem I had and to encourage them to buy a keyboard cover.  The logic board sits just beneath the keyboard and water is "a kiss of death" to the computer, as my computer expert friend likes to say.Apple does not currently offer damage protection, so if you spill water on it, you may very well have to replace it.  Perhaps the keyboard cover will protect it.  I certainly plan to buy one for my next computer.
