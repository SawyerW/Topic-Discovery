My experience: I have owned this ASUS Taichi since July of 2013 and in almost a year of ownership, I have hardly used the computer at all. Immediately upon receiving it, the touchscreen lid was pushing too hard into the ordinary notebook screen and it had to be sent back not once, but twice to try and fix it. The next big issue came when Windows 8.1 was released. Long story short, driver conflicts between Windows 8.1 and the Taichi caused the touchscreen lid to be unusable. A BIOS update was released FOUR MONTHS LATER to fix the problem. However, attempting to update the BIOS from the touchscreen caused it to freeze during the process and render the machine unusable, and so it was sent back to ASUS for a THIRD time. After the release of Windows 8.1 Update 1 (an update that made it easier for desktop/mouse users to use Windows 8.1), neither screen would boot without Safe Mode. In the end, another BIOS update was released and the problems seem to have finally gone away.My Thoughts: There is no laptop on the market like it. The true and original ultrabook with the ability to have 2 screen at once and flip between them with ease. I had owned an ASUS Vivobook X200 and felt I wanted something more tablet orientated. Many laptops that came out around the same time period and some laptops that have come out today offer far less for equal if not more money. A similarly priced $1000 laptop wouldn't have things like a solid state drive or a touchscreen, let alone 2 screens that you could use simultaneously. While still starting with Windows 8 and being $300 cheaper than it's release price, it's worth every penny compared to what others give you for much more money.Conclusion: It is a wonderful laptop and feels very professional. But with such uniqueness comes a price. Make sure you update it to the latest BIOS before upgrading it to Windows 8.1 or you'll encounter some problems that just ruin the experience.
