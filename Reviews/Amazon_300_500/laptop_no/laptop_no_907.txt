The good- unlike retina MacBook this one is still user upgradeable.- comes with 750gb HDD I upgraded to a 512gb SSD ( the crucial m4)- user upgradeable ram comes with 8gb up can put up to 16gb in. Personally 8 is enough for me (for now)- the screen is super clear and crisp. I have a retina display iPad and I can't tell the difference.- if you do any gaming I would suggest you get this over the retina because they have the same GPU but the retina display has more pixels to power so you'll get better better frame rates with this one.- the retina display may be nice for photographers but this model has an edge for basically every other task.- when your watching video you won't be able to tell the difference between this and the retina.- built in DVD drive! I still love this feature call me old school but I still use it, and I'm not old either I'm in my twenties.- if you no longer have a use for the DVD drive you can take it out and put in a second SSD OR HDD. They make a kit you can get really cheap on Amazon. Can't do that with a retina.- with bootcamp you get the best of both worlds OS 10 and windows.- great for gaming I've been running Far Cry 3 and Fallout New Vegas and it has plenty of power to spare.My criticisms- I really can't think of any. I wish apple would add a touch screen that would make this the perfect laptop.The bottom lineIf your looking for a mobile powerhouse that is user upgradeable, and the quality that can only come from apple this is the computer for you. This is still the real MacBook Pro in my opinion. If you want a design that is tried and true and don't want to spend your life savings on a maxed out retina model (because you can't upgrade them) still like having a DVD  drive and other practical ports give this one serious consideration.
