*** After 1 month, my AC Adapter stopped working. Gotta buy a new one.Before this laptop i had the Asus g73jw-3de laptop. I love my Asus in every way but i was looking for something more portable this time. If the Asus g46vw were refreshed (hardware) i would have bought it. Anyway, since they had the 3rd generation processors, 600 graphics card series, also a 720p screen, i decided to try the alienware (400 dollars more than the asus).So far i'm having a good experience with it. Its heavy, but as everyone should know, its a gaming laptop. It doesn't make lot of noise, and i didn't had any heating problems so far. It came really well packed, and everything is working. I think the V style of the asus is alot more comfortable while using the laptop, but its not something that would interfere in my rating. Another thing is that this laptop didn't came with blue-ray player... I don't know why laptop developers insist on not putting it directly from fabric or saving space and not putting the cd player at all. Anyway, over all, it has a great processor and graphic card, a full hd screen, a great customized color keyboard (the keyboard is great), for a price that i think its ok.One thing i cant understand, and is the reason i removed 1 star from the review. Well, i hate the touch pad light and their software DOESNT let me turn it off. It has a way to turn it off, it took me 1 hour to do it after checking some forums with people with the same problems, but because of alienware stupidity, bye bye 1 star.I hope they start making touch screen gaming laptops. I have a surface pro and windows 8 with touch screen is GREAT.Any questions, just ask.
