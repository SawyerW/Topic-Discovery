I bought this laptop for my wife as a lightning deal on Cyber Monday and picked it up for 329.99.  For this price point, I really felt like I couldn't do better.  The laptop seems to be pretty solid with good hinges (sounds like a dumb point unless you have had a laptop with crappy hinges).  The only part that seems kind of cheap is the keyboard, but for the price I can't complain too much.It comes with an intel core i3 processor which is what really sold me (I could not find the core i series processors at this price point on any other laptops), as the HD and RAM can be upgraded at a pretty inexpensive price.  My wife was adamant about having windows 8 so I purchased the pro upgrade at a reduced price through MS (after rebate from Dell, the upgrade is free). The upgrade went fairly well, however I had to do a bios upgrade in order to get the laptop screen to work with win 8 (the upgrade would seem to freeze after a certain point on me, but once i hooked it up to an external screen i was able to complete it, then found on the dell website that this is a known issue for this model).I did a clean upgrade to 8 so i  can't speak to the performance out of the box with all the bloatware, but for my wife's purposes (viewing videos, pictures, facebook, youtube, etc.) it runs great and is very quick on win 8.Just a note on the weight.  The 8lbs reported by amazon is the weight including shipping materials.  The actual weight of the laptop is around 5lbs with a 15.7" screen and we are happy with that size/weight.  We have not had a need to really test battery life so I can't speak to that aspect of it.Overall we are very happy with this product and would consider buying it again.
