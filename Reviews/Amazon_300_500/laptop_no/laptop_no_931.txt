Neat concept. A bit pricey.Came loaded with Windows 8. Ignore the "alerts" form ASUS telling you about the free upgrade to Windows 8.1 unless you really want an expensive door stop or want to spend a week trying to get it to work again!"VIP SERVICE"  from Asus is a joke ...I am still waiting (for over a month) for an answer from them...NO HELP AT ALL!I really like some of the features in 8.1 but ASUS did NOT have their poo together on the drivers for the TAICHI.After 8.1 upgrade the system became very unstable, screens flashed and/or did not work at all. Dual screen "Taichi" mode is still flakey even after reverting back to Windows 8.At this price one would expect better support from ASUS. Wish I would have waited for one pre-loaded with 8.1 (Have they done that?) After messing with this for several weeks I took it to a computer store to get it working again. (At my COST). It took the "experts about 10 hours to get it "somewhat" working again. Love the machine but hate the company "support". (I use the term loosely). WiDi for my "push to TV" still does not work, "Taichi button" intermittently works,  screen brightness has a mind of it's own.Bottom line: ASUS needs to spend less time trying to sell me other products and more time coming up with a fix for a machine they promoted with a "free upgrade to windows 8.1". Doubt I will ever buy another product from them.Added 12/20/2013:One thing I meant to mention and forgot:For the life of me I don't understand how they (IMHO) blew it on the camera. The Taichi has two, but they are both "front facing". Great if you want and/or need a expensive mirror. Would have made (again IMHO) more sense if in tablet mode the camera would have been rear facing for making videos! In notebook configuration front facing for Skype would have be fine.
