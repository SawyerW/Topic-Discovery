This is my first day with the laptop. I am just a general user (music, video, MS Office, web browsing), so this is just for the feel/ease of use: - Track pad is nice. Good position and just sensitive enough. It does the Mac scrolling thing (2 fingers). - Feel of keyboard is great for me. I saw some complaints below, but it all makes sense; keys are a good size, it's not squished. I like that there aren't any touch buttons. Those things suck (had some on my HP Pavilion and they rarely worked right). - It never specifies, but the entire computer is matte (including screen) and black - Really fast start up and resume, with that Samsung sleep to wake thing. Seems to work well. - Samsung usually loads its products with tons of crap (I have the Tab too), but didn't do much of that with this laptop. - Comes with an OS recovery CD - Don't know about battery life yet, but other posts have good options for maximizing it. - It does get a little hot, specifically on the left side (right by where you plug in the power adapter). Kinda strange, but maybe it's b/c I'm installing/uninstalling a bunch of stuff right now. It might be that my entire Dropbox has been syncing for a while. - Isn't heavy, definitely not an Ultrabook/Air but good option if you want a 15" screen. Feels compact. - Charging it now, and it's going up pretty fast. - Speakers are nice, nothing fabulous. Sounds comes from a long bar extending across the entire laptop. Doesn't get that loud, but what do you expect...I'll change this review to a 5 if I love it after a few weeks, or knock it down if anything bad happens. Overall, I'd say for under $600 this is a great deal. I can see this thing lasting me a while (I don't game though). Will update later.
