I bought this laptop 5 months ago because a friend gave it great reviews.  At first there was no problem with the computer, but after a month there was a problem with the batteries getting charged.  I've owned many computers in the past and I did all I knew to trouble shoot before getting support.  After a while, I couldn't figure it out, so I went to their website for support.I've been to so many websites for support in the past and thought it would be simple to get some type of customer service.  Boy was I wrong!  I left an email about my problem, but after a couple days, I got tired waiting for a response.  I tried to find an authorized local repair service for my laptop through their website but the page where I was supposed to find an authorized repair service kept on saying that there is no local repair service in the area even if the drop down menu lists at least 3 in my state.So I finally found a phone number to call. It was their 24 hour hotline. I called and was directed to the right extension for laptop repair.  I waited 20 minutes before someone answered the phone. The customer service rep took my number and e-mail, and while I was trying to get him the serial number, I got cut off.  I could hear him but he couldn't hear me.  He apologized that he couldn't hear me and told me to call him back!  He took my number in the beginning of our conversation but he didn't even try to use it to call me back!  Now I had to call back and wait another 20 minutes!  But this time, I just got cut off after 20 minutes!I will never ever ever buy an ASUS again!  This is the worst computer company I have ever dealt with!
