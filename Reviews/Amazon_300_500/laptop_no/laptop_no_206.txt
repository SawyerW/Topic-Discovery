I got a good deal on this around 500 and something dollars. It is pretty light and this is a good thing because I carry a lot of books around. The screen is great at 14" and it contributes to the overall portability of the laptop. At the highest brightness, it is almost blinding (which is a good thing). lol. I LOVE the keyboard but the mouse is a whole different story. The click buttons are a bit loud especially when you're in a quiet place like a library. The trackpad can be random sometimes. There are certain gestures that zoom in and out of pages. I am unaware of these gestures and because of that, accidentally placing two fingers on the pad can cause pages to zoom out or scroll to the bottom. It doesn't happen too often but happens enough times for me to notice and can be a pain sometimes. You get to live with it though.Battery life is really great in the first few months. About 4-6 hours depending on usage. Over time it drops to about 2 hours on a single charge. I guess this is normal with most laptops. The one thing I really like about this laptop is the fingerprint reader. You can customize to open certain programs with the swipe of a finger. For example, when I swipe my index finger, it opens up my browser. My middle finger opens up word processor and so on and so forth. I also use the reader to unlock and lock my laptop. Might be a gimmick for some but I find it really useful and cool.Only giving it a 3 out of 5 due to the so-so battery life and trackpad. Other wise a great buy if you can get a good deal on it.
