As a student, I've been trying to find a well-built computer for under $1000.  For me, the MacBook is a perfect fit.Pros:-The touchpad is incredible for web browsing. I have been using PCs notebooks for years, and I have never liked touchpads, but this has proved to be an exception.  I can easily do two-button clicking, scrolling with two fingers, and going back and forth through pages with three fingers.  I find I no longer do I have to lug around a USB mouse (except if I want to some gaming).-The computer starts up in 20 seconds without having to wait for background processes to load up (unlike windows).-The build quality of the MacBook is unmatched for its price.  The unibody does not creak at all when handling it.-Multi-tasking is surprisingly good for only 2GB RAM.  The only hiccups I have had were at the first couple of seconds of playing movies on iTunes with a lot of other programs running.Cons:-No HDMI port-Battery does not last 10 hours (about 4-6 for me with iTunes and Wi-Fi running). Still, it is much longer than the competitors for the price range and size.Even though the build is solid, you may want to get one of these covers if you worry about scratching:Speck Products See Thru Satin, Soft Touch Hard Shell Case, for 13-inch MacBook Aluminum Unibody/Black Keyboard (Black) - DOES NOT FIT WHITE MACBOOKThey snap on in seconds and look great.If you are a student who is not looking to do any graphic design I highly recommend getting the MacBook instead of the MacBook Pro if you want to save money.  Sure it only has 2 GB RAM, but you can easily upgrade it now for $100 Crucial CT2KIT25664BC1067 4GB 204-PIN PC3-8500 SODIMM DDR3 Memory KIT (2GBx2) or wait a year and do it for about $50.
