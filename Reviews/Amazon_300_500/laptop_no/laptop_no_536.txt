I bought this laptop for a few reasons: it's some of the best processing power available for the price, it's a Samsung, and, as a student, I wanted a 14" laptop that doesn't weigh 100 lbs, so I can drag it to class.Firstly, I cannot speak to the processing power because I didn't use it for very long before deciding to send it back.  Windows 8 is a mess and is clearly meant to be used with a touch-screen.  The ATIV Book 2 is not that and it leaves you with a feeling like, "Then, why does this thing run 8?"  From the moment you turn it on, the fan kicks on and it's not what I would call loud, but it is noticeable.Secondly, by buying a Samsung, I was hoping for something I knew would be reliable and quality.  This honestly feels like it's made of cheap plastic.  It isn't a $1200 laptop, but $550 isn't terribly cheap and I expected something much nicer for the money.  I didn't like the display quality, the touch pad, or the feel of it.  I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and know that something is going to last a little bit longer.Lastly, the reason you'd buy a 14" laptop is portability, but, it's laid out in a ridiculous way.  The keyboard isn't placed effectively.  It has a "centered" feeling on the bottom part of the laptop with lots of wasted space on either side of the keyboard.  For being one of the smaller, full-powered laptops out there, it felt massive.It seemed nice as far as processing is concerned with the brief browsing and web surfing that I did while I had it, but if you buy it, make sure you buy it running Windows 7.  Windows 8 just isn't meant for this machine.
