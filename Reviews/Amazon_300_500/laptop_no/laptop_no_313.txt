Received in a timely manner and package was superb , I got this through warehouse deals and have always been please with their service and product conditions .  I fumbled with this computer at first until I realized that this was truly like new and started fumbling around on the Dell help website to figure out I needed to download some drivers . Dell has a place you can go and it ananlyzes your system for you and then gives you a list of drivers that you need to download  . After that I was up and running . My webcam looks great . My touchpad is disabled and my remote mouse is working . I am watching videos , blogging and taking pictures . It comes with some virus protection and you can download more from the site . the graphics rock . I realized the only other computer I ever bought was an HP notebook and I got it from best buy. I bought then they gave me a pick up day and now I know why . On a brand new computer they have to charge that battery for at least 24 hours the first time and download the drivers , and it is a good idea  as that assures that you have the latest versions of the programs no matter how long that computer has warehoused. . i am still learning but so far I am very happy with amazon warehouse deals and this product.[...[...]These are websites that will come in very handy if you decide to purchase this product . It exceeded my expectations . Thanks again Amazon.  Very disappointed , having trouble with webcam , cannot get support . Dell support site does not detect my service tag, when I finally found a number to call I am referred to some foreign call center , tech support was very condescending and could not solve my problem for under 300 dollar annual tech support . Now I have bought this computer , and feel I have a right to expect the features to work properly . Anyway . Would not reccommend a dell because , tech support is inferior
