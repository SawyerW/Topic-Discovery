After having my Sony Vaio SA2 stolen I was forced into purchasing a new laptop. The things I loved about the Vaio were: dedicated graphics card, battery life, weight, hdmi output,backlit keyboard,screen resolution 1600x900, and appearance.However there were some things that I didn't like; build, materials, noisy fan, and slow hard drive speed. So sense I had to buy a new laptop I wanted to make sure to address some of the issues I had with the Vaio, but maintain the things that I did like about it as well. Thus I came across the Samsung Series 7 NP700Z3A-S06US Laptop.This Laptop addressed every single issue I had with the Vaio, its better built(screen is solid not flimsy like it was with the Vaio) has a bigger and faster hard drive(1TB, and 8gb of ssd),more ram(8gb vs 4gb on Vaio) and it maintained all the things I loved about the Vaio(speed, graphics card, backlit keyboard, screen resolution 1600x900, and size) .The only very small, almost not worth mentioning difference, between the Samsung vs the Sony, was that the Sammy cost $150 dollars more, and it weighs about 1lb over the the Sony. Either way these minimalistic differences didn't stop me from making the switch and not looking back at my Vaio SA2I also want to reinforce what the previous reviewer said, the picture that Amazon has is for the z5a and not the z3a. That being said if your looking for a well made, good looking, portable power house, BUY THIS LAPTOP!PROS:Speed - processor(dual core i5 2.5 up to 3.0ghz speed)Hard drive - 1TB and 8gb of SATA(SSD like speed)Screen - 1600x900Dedicated Graphics Card - AMD RADEON HD 6490MRAM - 8GB DDR3Build - Screen Lid is solid, brushed aluminumHDMI - If you like to watch movies, play games, and stream videos on a larger screen this is a must.Back Lit Keyboard - Helps allot in low light situations it became a must for me after experiencing it.Cons:Weight - Over 4lbs tends to be a little heavy(subjective)
