For the money, you really can't beat this computer. It came down to this laptop and the Asus G75VW. The main reason I went with this laptop is because of the mixed reviews of the Asus. This had very good reviews and had alot of neat features. So far I've played Mass Effect 3, Civilization 5, Minecraft and Eve Online and it has played all the games at max settings without a flinch. The ability to control the fan is nice too. After I'm done playing the game I turn the fan on to help cool the computer down faster. The turbo button is nice too, but after some updates mine stopped working. I looked it up in the forums and it said to just reinstall the device driver and it will be ok. Havent done so yet. The keyboard is awesome. Several different colors to choose from and in several configurations. The brushed aluminum that surrounds the keyboard is nice. It stays cool during game play and doesnt heat up your hand. Windows 8 is a trip. Very different from Windows 7 and others, but once you get used to it, it's nice. Some cool features that aren't in 7. The Sound is amazing. I played a video and I thought I was in a surround sound setup. I definatley felt as though I was in the movie. I did however have a hiccup, proably fixable. When i plugged in a set of headphones, the speakers still played. I havent looked into yet, but I'm sure theres a setting I accidentily pressed. Will update later. It is big and a little heavy, but I don't mind. It's what I wanted and I love it. Well that's all I can think of right now. I would definatley reccomend this laptop to anyone.
