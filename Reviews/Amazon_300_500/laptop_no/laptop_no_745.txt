I got this laptop in the summer of 2010 for college. It was good for maybe a year, but as of late it's been crashing non-stop and depleting itself of battery in less than an hour. Its main issue is video. If you're thinking of watching HD youtube or just simply anything of finer quality, don't even THINK about getting this product. It freezes, turns black, and reboots with a green screen over the thing you intended to watch with a warning message. This flaw has been present since the laptop was fresh out of the packaging. Even if the video is not HD, or played on WMP, it will has a significant amount of lag and force you to watch things at 50%.If you like making videos yourself, don't get this product. I have Sony Vegas 8.0 installed on it, and it won't get as far as an 8 second render time before flashing a message that the system doesn't have enough memory and crashes. This is when I have 223 GB free of an 287 GB drive.There are also technical things that have been disappointing. One of the USB ports has stopped responding. The sound quality is tinny, and barely audible at its highest volume without headphones. The paint on the left click has completely worn off and looks hideous, and both clickers and touchpad have gone completely disoriented in the past to where you couldn't use them. The battery will only last you a little less than two years. The glossy screen also causes bad glaring.Its redeeming quality is that it gets the basic job done, which is writing and looking at stuff of the internet. Its gaming capacity is poor, and its video capacity is even poorer. If you're someone dependent on digital media like me you're better off tossing this thing out a window. If you're a digital artist, DO NOT buy this product.
