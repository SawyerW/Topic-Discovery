From the reviews, I expected my new Duo to be slow. It's not. It's much faster than other netbooks I've used. I didn't get it expecting lightning speed, but I haven't noticed it being much slower than my 17" laptop that has twice the RAM and a faster processor. I also haven't tried doing anything I knew it can't handle. I originally intended to put in a SSD to speed it up, but I don't think it's necessary now.I've heard bad things about the Dell Stage (what happens when you switch to tablet mode). Mine updated right away, so maybe that's why it doesn't lag. The only thing I had to remove right away was McAfee, to install my preferred anti-virus. Windows has been updating a lot, of course. I hope it isn't one of the updates that slows it down. Service Pack 1 hasn't.It's also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that isn't a bad thing. It isn't the same size as an HP Mini, which is about the size I anticipated. Not sure why, but I just pictured it smaller. I feel much better about the price after seeing how huge this thing is.One last thing. The dock is really great. The sound is much better than the Duo's speakers. It's nice to be able to put the netbook into the dock at night and just let it charge. I don't trust the power cord for the Duo itself. My last Dell went through several of those cords because of the weight-like thing that goes right by the power jack, and the jack itself ended up separating from the motherboard because of the weight. Netflix is good on the dock, too. The only thing I'd like to do that I haven't found a way to do is change the background for the dock clock thing.
