I am a college student, and this has been the best investment that I have made in my almost 4 years in school.  I use my chromebook to view notes that professors post as well as to take notes of my own in google docs.  I also use it for web assignments and to browse the internet.  I have personally used multiple computers running windows as well as macbooks and this is by far the best computer I have had for these purposes so far.  Although it is not a very customizable/powerful computer it gets the job done for these purposes.  I can shut my computer down in between every class because the boot time for me is less than 7 seconds!  It took me about an hour to get used to google docs and after that I was in love with it.The computer is so fast and the hardware (keyboard, ports, touchpad, etc) are also excellent.  The touchpad is every bit as good as an apple touchpad and the keyboard is nearly there.  Although the screen is small, I love it because the computer fits on my desk easily in class and I can also have a notebook or notes packet along with it  After using this product for about a week, I could not be happier and could not think of anything that I did not like about it.Also, I find that I regularly get 7 hours of battery life taking notes, browsing, etc.Like the title says, best electronic purchase of the year - and its cheap!  Also, Amazon and google both have great customer service that have helped me with my chromebook.  My advice is that if you only browse the internet and mildly use "word" and "excel" documents, there is no reason to blow $1000 on a mac when you can do the same things on here - only faster!
