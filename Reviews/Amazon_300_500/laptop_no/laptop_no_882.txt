The current "Ivy Bridge" Macbook Air line is hard to find fault with.  As long as you keep the SSD configuration at 128GB it's not significantly different in price from a comparable quality ultra book on any OS.  If you want a precision metal case, long battery life, and a fairly hi-res display (1440x900 on the 13-inch model) in under 3 pounds you're looking at $1200+ on Windows too.Having USB 3.0 now is nice since hard drive sustained transfer speeds have long outpaced USB 2.0 and Firewire.  If you're planning to use virtualization like VMWare 5 or Parallels I recommend going with the 8GB RAM option which only adds $100 to the price.Note that you can't change anything in this computer yourself - hard drive nor memory, and there's no optical drive so buy what you think you'll need even if eventually.  For those so-inclined, the battery is user-replaceable after your warranty runs out but that's all that may ever find its way onto the table.  There's no wired ethernet on this model but you can get an external gigabit interface for about $30.  The built-in Wifi works on 2.4 and 5 GHZ and maxes out at 300Mbps because it has two antennas.Compared to my previous Macbook Pro 13-inch, this provides about twice the computing power using half the energy (=almost no heat) and 1/3 less weight.  An optical drive isn't something I think many people get much use out of any more so giving it up wasn't a sacrifice.In daily use it barely gets warm, the lit keyboard feels great, the sound is good - especially considering how thin this computer is, and the trackpad works great and doesn't ever make your cursor jump while you're typing.  Battery life is excellent at around 7 hours.  I'm not necessarily a fan of Apple the corporation, but I am a fan of great quality hardware and a solid UNIX-based OS.
