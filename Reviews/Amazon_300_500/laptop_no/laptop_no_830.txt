I had been using Fujitsu laptops for more than 10 years and after my last one was damaged due toan electrival over-voltage during a thunderstorm, I decided to try something new.That was about 4 years ago and at that time I bouth a HP Pavilion DV 2000.Reason was that I moved to Southamerica where HP supposed to have a great service-network.Note: this equipment was purchased in Colombia!I only had problems with that machine (DV2000) overheating nvidia graphic chip; repairs every few weeks - and the HP service in Colombia was absolutely USELESS!!!U S E L E S S!!! Treating its customers with ignorance and in-acceptable response-times!Finally I exchanged the AMD board and put an intel board in - and the machine was more or less OK.At least I managed to survive aprox. 30 months this way.This year - I found the DM4 1265 at a Bestbuy in the US.I was fascinated by the slick aluminim design; some good ratings from other users.And although the vendor told me that HP would stand for "Having Problems" - I purchased my 2nd HP laptop.A very bad decision!!!The mousepad is extremely lousy;the harddisk failed after aprox. 4 months (Toshiba drive)and the equipment tends to get very warm; the fan runs all the time now.HP Latinamerica - in my case: Colombia - does not cover ANY warranty for equipment purchased in the US!So I bought another harddisk- which is working fine so far.And in the meantime, another HP device - my dsekjet F380 printer/scanner also broke: the electronic board is damaged and its repair would cost more than a new printer.Dear HP management: I will not buy any more of your equipment.  I had enough.Even if you give me a piece of equipment for FREE - NO thank you!Poor product quality in combination with a useless after-sales-service (technical service) are the reason for my decision. Such an arrogant customer service... - unbelievable!In terms of printers, I already got an Epson TX220 with continuous ink-support (wow - this is a great think; one colored page is aprox. 1-2 cents!) and my next laptop will be Fujitsu again - or a Mac.
