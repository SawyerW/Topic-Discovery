I really liked this laptop a lot but unfortunately received one of the pieces with a faulty BIOS. If you put the laptop to sleep, upon "waking" it, the systems starts (you can tell that by the sound of the hard disk whirring and other system sounds) but the display does not resume and remains dark. I tried reinstalling the display driver but that didn't help. Apparently, the solution is to update the BIOS which should be done by experienced users only (which I am not) to avoid bricking the laptop. Having said that here are the pros and consPROs:Quad Core Processor: I bought this laptop for $430 and that is a great, great price for a quad core. I was apprehensive about buying an AMD based machine at first but upon comparing it with an Intel core i3 2350M machine; I found that the A6 is a much better processor.RADEON HD 6520G: The highlight of this machine is the 6520G GPU. For a low end machine this GPU gives amazing performance. I am casual gamer so buying a machine with a dedicated card wouldn't have been cost effective for me. I was happy to discover that I could play graphics intensive games like Crysis, Crysis 2, Modern Warfare 2 & 3, Battlefield 3  at 1366 x 720 resolution with 30 - 40 fps easily. The Intel HD 3000 sucks at all these games.CONs:The only con was the nasty BIOS bug. I think Toshiba got a batch of faulty BIOSes and some of the laptops are acting up because of that, which is shame really as the performance of this laptop at such a low price point is really nice. But thankfully Amazon came to the rescue here with their wonderful return policy and that is one of the reasons I gave 4 stars and not lower. With such great service, Amazon has a lifetime customer in me.
