I will keep this short. I used a PC my whole life. Finally I used my brothers mac, and wow I was impressed. So I bit the bullet, coughed up the extra $$$ and got a mac. The one thing that really stands out is how sturdy and well built this MAC PRO is. It's just solid. Runs smooth, and really fast. It's just built different. I'm still getting used to it, it's def a little different then a PC but pretty much the same. Right out of the box the set up is a breeze, maybe takes 5 minutes and it's done. I kid you not a first grader could set this thing up, no joke.Pros - It's fast, sleek, beautiful picture, good camera, and you can use it outside in the sun and it's still pretty clear. It just runs like a clock. You can literally feel how smooth this laptop is. Also it's almost impossible to get a virus!!! That was unheard of with a PC.Cons - Although not a con for me, I can see spending another 100-200 bucks be a con for you. That's about it. But, in my opinion you get what you pay for, and spending a little more for this machine is well worth it......Think long haul, the reason I always get new laptops is because all the viruses I get, and the performance decreases with PC's I've owned in the past. Obvioulsy this is a pretty new laptop but, I have a good feeling it will last. Oh yeah the battery is way longer then 7 hours, it's more like 9 hours, I put it to the test. It charges pretty quick to.Finally, and I am going to write this in CAPS because I just can't believe it happened......I ORDERED THIS LAPTOP EASTER SUNDAY AT 10AM, SELECTED THE OPTION "SAME DAY SHIPPING" (never thinking it would ever reach my house until the next MORNING AT THE EARLIEST)AND I RECEIVED THIS MAC PRO BY 4PM THAT SAME DAY, EASTER SUNDAY!!!! COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!!!! I never heard of the shipping company but, none the less I was in disbelief that I could order something on a sunday and receive it later on that same day. Not bad, not too bad at all......
