This computer was bought for someone who was just beginning to adopt the Apple computer family. Assisting this person in learning the Apple system I was forcefully reminded about the differences between Windows and OS X. Accessing resources in Windows, by comparison is quite clumsy, and the ready access to OS X resources is so in-your-face that it's confusing to someone who has limited their use of their PC in the past from the lack of ease in finding what they wanted. Although Microsoft and Microsoft-based computers have replicated many of the interface features of the Apple system, the native functions of an Apple computer running Apple software is remarkably more intuitive. This person needs to unlearn many of their Windows habits, just as I did when I moved to Apple.2/23 Addition - After reading a few of the five-star reviews on this product, I feel I should apologize for my wimpy review above. About three years ago, I bought my first Mac, a MacBook Pro 13" and experienced the genuine thrill of using this excellent machine. I assumed most of the reviews would be from confirmed Mac users, but was pleasantly surprised to find that most were like me, converts from Windows. So I want to join the chorus of praise for these excellent machines, dictating this review from my 11" inch MacBook Air, my constant companion. Of course everything I do on my Air is shared with my MacBook Pro "portable desktop" as well as my iPod Touch, perhaps the most important thing about the Apple system. For you newcomers, welcome home.By the way, I lied. My first Mac was actually a Mac Classic II, the little box that ate the lunch of all the PCs that existed in 1992. My work "converted" me to Windows laptops until 2009.
