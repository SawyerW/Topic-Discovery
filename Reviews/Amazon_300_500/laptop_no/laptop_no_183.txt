Like most great apple products, there's already hundreds of well written reviews covering everything from it's wonderful backlit keyboard, to the beautiful aluminum unibody. There's really nothing else I can add, besides the fact that I AM LOVING IT! This Macbook Pro 13 is simply sublime. I recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a new laptop.Pros: EverythingCons: No matte screen option from apple, but there are 3rd party solutions.moshi iVisor AG 13, Anti-Glare Screen Protector for Macbook 13" UnibodyOther: The battery will last 10 hours if you don't use it, but average usage will still give you a very generous 6-8 hours, depending on what you're doing.Try it out in person at bestbuy if you have any doubts, but I can promise you won't regret buying this wonderful piece of engineering.One last thoughtInstalling windows 7 with boot camp is as simple as you could make it. Having the ability to run windows 7 along with OSX makes this computer extremely useful. I have my hard drive split 50/50 one partition for OSX and one for windows 7. While I love using OSX, there a many games that require windows to play. I have a few games installed on windows 7 to test out the NVIDIA 320m and was very surprised at how well it performed. I play Left 4 Dead 2 at the native resolution with medium to high settings and still get 40-60 frames per second. Needless to say, i'm impressed.This Macbook Pro is the first Apple product I've bought. Never owned an ipod or anything else made by Apple. In fact, for awhile I was what some would call an 'Apple hater,' but this computer has completely changed my perspective. And if this is the first Apple purchase for you, I'm convinced you'll feel the same way.-Jeff
