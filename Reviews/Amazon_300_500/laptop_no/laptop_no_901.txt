I would have given this five stars, too, for the first ten months or so that I owned it.  Then the hard drive failed.  No problem, it's still under warranty, that's what I thought.  So I ship it to them to fix, and they replace the hard drive, and we're good to go, right?  NOPE!  The second hard drive failed within 4 weeks.  But once that one failed, the machine was out of warranty.  Even though the hard drive was essentially brand new.  Did they do anything to remedy the situation?  No.  They refused.  I pursued it as far as I could, they refused to "escalate" my claim, meaning that whoever manages the people in the Philipines that I spent way too much time on the phone with decided I wasn't worth the trouble.  I pulled the HD out at one point, by the way, to verify that it was bad- and it was a no name piece of junk that Maxtor would probably reject.  And in case you're wondering- the machine was never dropped, mishandled in any way, nothing was spilled on it, no bad software ever uploaded to it...  Nothing.Toshiba is an embarassment of a company, and I sincerely hope that this review inspires everyone to avoid anything with that brand name.  Not just to punish the company for a complete failure to do something right, but to save others the hassle and complete waste of money synonymous with "Toshiba."  They do not stand behind their products, they do not care if their customer was ripped off by their lack of functionality, they do not deserve anyone's business.Trust me on this people- spend the extra fifty bucks and get an HP, a Dell, or something to that effect.  You won't be sorry.  Buy a Toshiba, and you just might...
