I have had this laptop for almost three months now. The only problem I have had with it was when I was streaming video and using the HDMI out to a TV for about an hour, which caused the computer to start overheating. This isn't uncommon for any computer when you are demanding so much from hardware in a compact area with only a small fan to cool everything. I happen to work for Geek Squad so I had a good amount of research before buying this computer, including advice from an Apple rep trying to get me to buy a MacBookPro. Thanks, but no thanks. I am happy with this computer and I am still in college, while Macs are great, they are also expensive. Yes they happen to be less likely to get a virus or malware, but it is still possible. I have seen this happen. The processor on this computer is great for my needs, and the memory can easily be upgraded to 8GB total at a high speed of RAM for a decent price in case you are running programs like AutoCAD.  I like the fact that there is a eSATA/USB hybrid port so I have options when transfering data. Also, the newer version that is now out has USB 3.0 so you can actually get the speed promised out of your new 3.0 capable external HDD.What I love about this laptop is the weight. When I first bought it I was suprised as to how light it is. I describe it to everyone as how a normal laptop would feel if you took all the guts out. I did find out part of the way that Toshiba got rid of some of the weight. The laptop has very small speakers, but if you are buying a laptop with a screen size of 13.3 you probably are not buying it to watch movies on anyways.This laptop is definitely built for someone who demands performace from their machine, but also ultra portability. The only thing that would make me love my laptop more would be if they had included a backlit keyboard. Other than that, great product!
