I received this on 7/20/2013. I paid $671.00 which is a good price for the specs. I use it now to surf the internet and anticipate using it in the near future for class assignments.Well I was going to give this 4 stars until the computer shut down only a few seconds after giving me a warning that my battery life is at 10 percent. It's plugged in now so here goes...Well, this thing looks good. It's sleek, light weight, runs fast, fits in a large purse and has great screen resolution. It stays pretty cool to the touch. But battery life is a pain, especially since its overall design would make it a wonderful little mobile computer. I adjusted the screen brightness to below 50 percent and it still only worked for about 3.5 hours instead of the 5 hours stated in the specs. (My cel phone stays on longer than that after being charged.) There is an extended battery, and although it's not bulky, I really don't like the idea of having to screw the thing on to extend the battery life. I seriously considered returning this and paying more for an ultrabook with a longer battery life that doubles as a tablet. There is a touchscreen keyboard but I don't really see the use of it unless it can be flipped back like a tablet. You can't have everything you want at a certain price point but the battery life should definitely be better than it is.Update 12/17/13I've given in to using the extended battery and enjoy using the computer a lot more now. It stays up and running for about 6 hrs or so. The battery is simple enough to attach and actually gives it a little bit of an incline which makes typing a little more comfortable in my opinion. Although, I think it detracts from the overall sleek design. Overall, I don't regret my purchase.
