I love this laptop in a lot of ways, but there are some annoying to downright frustrating issues. The day I got it I walked around the office making the Mac people envious. The double screen element is great for work because I show a lot of powerpoint presentations and can do it across the table now rather than on a projector. I have to tilt it in an uncomfortable way for me when I do this, but that's not a big deal - I can see the presenter mode and that's enough. In other meetings I keep my logo or my client's logo running on the outside screen. I installed Windows Classic Shell to run over Windows 8 within a week.Battery life yes is dismal, but what do you expect for such a small and light laptop with two screens? I bought a backup power source.As mentioned earlier, the auto-brightness is very annoying. Even if you have it on the brightest setting, if the (default) auto-brightness is on, it may dim it and you're unable to make it brighter. You have to disable this, frequently.The main issue that I have is that the internet drops ALL THE TIME, and the wifi signal is possibly less powerful or only handles a lower bandwidth. I can't use it in my bedroom or porch anymore, and can't trust that the internet won't drop at any time. It once dropped in the middle of an online exam. I've now seen this as a known issue on their site, with a possible fix to disable the option to let the network adapter sleep to save power. I've turned that off but am yet unsure of whether it's any better. I know I should have (and still should) call and complain, but I hate the idea of spending fruitless hours on the phone then having to rebuild everything, so have just whined and worked around it so far. They ignore the Facebook page and don't answer any questions sent in that way.Overall a great laptop, but they need to fix some things with it.
