This laptop is great. I love the keyboard and the overall size. The new trackpad is very cool, but sometimes it doesn't seem to recognize clicks. The new unibody case is a lot stronger than my old MBP. The Firewire is a non-issue for me.There are two faults with this machine.1. The display should be better for this price. Overall it's a decent display, But the blacks arn't black. Apple really skimped on this display. If you use Supercal and calibrate your screen, you can lose the washout effect and it helps a lot. But the blacks are nearly unforgivable. I'm personally going to question any of Apples new products due to this one mistake.2. Overpriced! For what you get, I'm not sure it's worth it. The look is amazing, but performance lags compared to machines hundreds cheaper. Apple products have always carried a premium, but this is getting out of hand. My two year old MBP 2GHz machine is only slightly slower than this one.Overall I guess I'm pretty happy about this laptop. But Apple has lost my trust. They skimped on the display that they talked up during the release. They are going to need to earn my trust back, if they want a penny more from me. I ordered this product assuming I would get a quality product that I was willing to pay a premium for. Instead I get a very nice looking laptop with little substance that I paid a premium for. Apple is suffering from the "we can't do anything wrong syndrome". Well the display is lacking and the price is too much for this product. I don't think I could justify spending $1300 on this laptop again. I'll keep it for two years and upgrade again, but Im looking at Apple differently from now on.
