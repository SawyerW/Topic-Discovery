We ordered this machine because of the excellent specs for the given price point. However, we encountered blue screen issues for our first unit, and also on the second unit we ordered as replacement.The first unit worked well; but after a few hours of surfing the net, it blurted a "blue screen". We kept the machine for a few more days thinking that this is a legit error or conflict that will eventually be resolved by driver updates and/or windows updates. The blue screen, however, continued to hound the machine and has appeared intermittently for two weeks. We decided to return the item for a replacement for the same item.The second machine (replacement unit) arrived and we were quite happy of the fast turnaround (three days shipping is awesome). We opened the package, seated the battery in place and turned on the machine for some testing. After only a few minutes of surfing the internet, we were shocked to see the same blue screen (no time to check up the error codes though) on this second unit. We decided to ship this one back on the very next day; it's quite unusual to have the same blue screen issue to appear for two identical machines.We are not really sure as to what's the problem with these machines, but I guess part of our expectation is for the machine to work well out-of-the-box. I haven't heard or read too much issues with Windows 7 on a well-built machine throwing out blue screens when you haven't even installed much software into it. We were disappointed with this particular machine only FX400-062US (we previously owned an MSI U123 netbook, it never encountered issues like this) and would not want to have it anymore. We requested for a refund so we can get something that at least works with regards to specifications and common customer expectations. I hope this helps you.
