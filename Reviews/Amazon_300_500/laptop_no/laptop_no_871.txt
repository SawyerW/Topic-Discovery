The edges of the laptop cuts my wrists, and the laptop itself runs very hot when bootcamping Windows 7 or running anything semi-intensive on the Mac OS. The Mac OS also crashed upon using bootcamp to install Windows 7 (I had to re-install the entire Mac OS). I was recommended Macbooks for being the best Windows laptops (even though I did not purchase it for that reason entirely), however this is very far from the truth.Most users of these Macbooks will not tell you the serious heating issues these laptops bring. It is almost required to download a fan manager for your mac because it is believed that the manufacturers did not set the speeds appropriately. However, the downside to raising the speed of your fan is that you're degrading the integrity of your system greatly.The monitor has serious glare issues and is set so low on the Macbook it can cause neck pains for anyone at 6-foot.Also, these laptops are NOT durable by any means. I have scratches all over mine from just placing it into my bag. And please do not pick it up with a cd/dvd inside the system, else you can very easily get it stuck. Not to mention knock the alignment off of your hard-drive (done it countless times and froze the OS).The keyboard feels cheaply made. The keys are flimsy and takes some time getting used to.The macbook also comes with a very small amount of peripherals. No SD card slot, HDMI, VGA, and lack of any ability to get a bluray player into it. Also, the USB slots are terribly placed (some USB components will block the other USB ports).The Macbooks sacrifice their comfort for looking pretty. And to be honest, I rather have my computer be comfortable and work as a tool for my advantage, than to make it look pretty. Maybe you have to be a metrosexual man to get into this brand, I don't know...There are many more dependable and less expensive brands out there that would meet the needs of everyone who is good with their money (Lenovo, Sager, etc.).
