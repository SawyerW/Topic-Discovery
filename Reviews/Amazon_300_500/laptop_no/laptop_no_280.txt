People,This review is only about Acer Aspire S3 without any comparison with Macbook's - coz MACBOOK Still WINS in terms of Beauty and Looks.But Hey!! are you willing to pay that much in this economy when you get same comparable product for 674$, if your answer is NO and Read BelowPros,1. Chicklet keyboard is very responsive. I agree that Page up/down buttons are smaller but they are WAY BIGGER than any smart phone touchscreen buttons. So anyone using Smartphone shoud not have any issues.2. Screen is fantastic if not the Best is Business. But for this price it is better than VAIO's3. Battery life with normal use (Office 2010, Browser) is 3.5 hours4. Looks sleek and feel as much as Apple's 11 inchers5. Wake up Time -  WOW!!! Just 3 Seconds...now thtz one advantage Acer has over any ultrabooks, read below for details6. It has 20 GB of SSD and 320 GB HDD. 20GB SSD is invisible to users as it is used by system to bring up the computer to desktop as fast as possible and transfers the control to HDD. You wont find this AWESOME feature in any other Ultrabooks. Even if you find it than not at this price.7. Dolby speakers -  Speakers have always been one of the strongs points of Acer and they maintain that standard with this machine.8. Port - Go figure this many port in any MACS or Ultrabooks for this price, you will find NONE. Card Read, USB 2.0, HDMI, Headset.Not so great:1. Keyboard is not backlit now i am not a huge fan of backlit when i get this machine for 674$. How i got is for this price...read the last paragraph.2. Keyboard color is not that exciting, but it is much better than Asus and Lenovo's ultrabooks.If you have Microsoft Store Around, I have one in Tysons Corner, VA. MS Retail store is carrying 20% off on 500$ or more. 25% off on 1000$ or more.Here is what i did1. Bought this machine2. took there Microsoft Assure Plan worth 200$ - which provides 2 years extended warranty including accident coverage and a MS office software.3. That brought my total to 1100 and with discount of 275$ brought it down to 825. So the total I paid was 825+40$ = 865$ (which prints laptop price to 674$).4. If you simply buy the laptop, then it will be even 100$ less, but remember this are new genes of machine and you never know what may break.5. It is still much better deal than what Amazon is offering. If you dont have MS Store around than Amazon is the 2nd best.
