Just basic information up front.  I debated this purchase for about 2 months, looking at all of the different competitors' models, Toshiba, Dell, HP, and ASUS. For me it came down to Toshiba X875-7290 or this model.  I had to wait for over 6 weeks for the Toshiba model to finally hit the market, in the end; I went with the Samsung model.  (What you should know is that I own several High-end laptops already, I own 3 Toshiba Qosmio's systems and an earlier Dell Alien ware system, still went with this model based on the reviews that I had read!)Consideration 1 - For the money, this is about the most cost effective laptop and the least expensive model.  (I did not buy (this laptop) for this reason - it was just a strong selling point for me!)) Plenty of the competition that fell at the same price or slightly more expensive, had a weaker video card (important consideration), smaller HDD configuration or less system memory.Consideration 2- Display. I kept reading about the amazing display, I had to check it out for myself.  It is worth it, Resolution will match all others, but this display is bright, sharp and crisp.  It is the best display that I have seen on the high-end laptop. (Included without an upcharge.)Consideration 3 - Audio - well worth it - sound fantastic.  Beats all others that I have, you can play music in one room and hear it clearly in another!  (Not a technical review, true, but something that almost anyone can relate to.)  This is a laptop, and sounds are natural, loud and clear.Consideration 4 - Keyboard is fantastic.  Keys are well spaced and feel great, again well done.Consideration 5 - Plays all games that I have thrown out it with no issues.  I am running Adobe CS Suite 6 and it is quick, by far the best experience that I have had with running the software on any system.
