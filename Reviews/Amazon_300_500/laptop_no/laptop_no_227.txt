I am a long time Amazon customer - over 10 years, and thousands of orders.  At the time I ordered this, Amazon wasn't shipping them yet, so I had to order from Mac Connection - being the only other place that had free shipping and no tax.  I rarely order from anywhere but Amazon and have been a Prime member since the first day they offered that service ... just wanted to get that out of the way - Amazon has never done me wrong - but I just couldn't wait to get this laptop...I'm far from an Apple fanatic, because I do love my desktop, which runs Win7 64 Ultimate .... but I just love their laptops .... I still own a 17 and a 12 inch powerbook,and a 13 inch macbook, which I will be selling to get the 13 inch air ..I don't use my Air for work, but mainly for surfing, photos, movies, etc ... I plan on getting a 13 inch Air for my main laptop.The 11.6 is one of the most amazing computers I have had the chance to use.  It's very fast, and I still can't believe how light and slim it is.Once I saw it online, I knew I had to get one, and it didn't disappoint.  I went with the 2GB, and thought maybe I made a mistake by not getting the 4GB version,but it's plenty fast for what I do.  If I was going to be doing more with it, I would for sure spend the extra for the bump in ram.I know some people say it's overpriced, and maybe for some it is ... I don't mind spending a bit extra for quality products ... of any kind ...I was ok spending around $1k on this machine, it's a blast to use.  A little on the small side, but that's why I will be getting a maxed out 13 inch Air soon.Again, I am in awe of this machine - (a video review on youtube by marloon88 really sold me on it ...  )
