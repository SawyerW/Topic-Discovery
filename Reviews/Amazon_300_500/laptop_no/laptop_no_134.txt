I am a 31 yr old female and had a 3 yr old Dell laptop I was looking to replace that was super slow and froze on me constantly.  I've had this for a month. I am not computer savvy but needed a laptop for my classic ipod collection, connecting remotely to work, and various things like Microsoft office and tons of time in the internet.  I am not a gamer but figured a gaming computer would give me the power and speed I wanted.  I went strictly by ratings on Amazon.  I'm not disappointed by the computer. It's great because it is new and obviously faster.Like other reviewers have said, yes, the computer looks black to me not brown.  Only upon close inspection in the sunlight can you see there is a bit of brown.  Also This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.Pros:Love the ten key on the side. This is a must for me.Like the touch sensor where you can scroll and zoom; it was easy to learn.Good size monitor but not too big.Love windows 7 which I find very intuitive.Love there is tech support included from Asus.Computer keyboards seems a little more enclosed making it tougher for crud to get under keys.Cons:Though not bad, it's not the nicest looking computer. Toshiba and Sony are going to look and ergonomically feel better though you won't get as high of ratings overall with those.This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.Though I love the touch sensor that you can scroll and zoom with your fingers I still find it easier to use a mouse.Computer gets hot-you need a cooling pad for sure. Hardly a con for me though-has not slowed me down.With the shiny surface of the comp it is like a magnet for pet hair.
