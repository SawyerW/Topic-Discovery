Before this, I had the previous model of the white plastic Macbooks. I loved that computer, but the plastic was starting to show signs of wear after only a year and a half of use, so it was time to upgrade to an aluminum unibody MBP. I love this computer. OSX is such an easy to use operating system. I actually found when I switched from Windows to OSX, some tasks I would try to make harder than they were simply because I was used to Windows. When you hear people say that once they made the switch, they'd never go back, believe them.But, of course there are some gripes, although few. My biggest complaint is two fold: no hdmi ports, no BluRay support. Those two are really killers. Don't get me wrong, it's easy enough to get the necessary cables to hook the computer up to your HDTV, but it would be much easier with an HDMI. It really seems silly that a laptop this nice and this powerful doesn't have HD capabilities. BUT, I'm sure that those two things are PROBABLY coming in the next refresh, which will mean I'll likely have to upgrade again in a year or so, but I can deal with that. My only other gripe is with the display. The glass display is much more vibrant and lively than the old LCD's, but here is a significant amount of glare on the screen. Forget about using it in the sun at all.Lastly, a couple of tips. The "10 hour battery life" is a lie. No way does this thing get ten hours. BUT, if you turn off the backlit keyboard and turn the screen brightness down to 50%, you can easily get 5-7 hours of operation. I think for most folks that will get the job done. Also, learn to love the trackpad. I think that's the thing I like the most about the computer. The trackpad is HUGE, and the multitouch capabilities are so awesome, I don't even use my portable USB mouse anymore. To me, the trackpad is much better than any mouse I've ever used.
