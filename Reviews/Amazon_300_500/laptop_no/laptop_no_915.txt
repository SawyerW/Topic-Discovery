I purchased the HP Pavilion dm1-4210us 11.6-Inch Laptop to use while traveling. My HP Pavilion p6-2108p Desktop remains my primary PC and I also consider the dm1-4210us to be a back-up to it because it has a 500GB HD. The HP dm1-4210us is a very nice little laptop; I wanted something small enough to watch my own movies/listen to my music on a plane or in a hotel, light and easy to carry and good to check e-mail. This laptop fits the bill. My most serious complaint is the built-in speakers. The HP BEATS audio hype led me to expect some pretty good sound but these speakers are just too small to deliver. I guess that's why they sell the BEATS headphones. I'm going to make do with some headphones and a set of portable speakers. I also wish manuals were included in the box; I don't like printing out 40+ pages at home. Other than that, I am still trying to figure out my battery life. Initially, the indicators said I had about 4 hrs of battery life, considerably short of the 7 advertised and my expectations of 5-6 hrs. Today I found I had over 5 hrs of battery life indicated, more in line with what I expect. The touchpad is a bit tricky but not a problem after a short while. I did buy a wireless mouse to use when space permits but I'll be OK without it. I'm really happy with my HP Pavilion dm1-4210us and can highly recommend it.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS 2 MONTHS IN: I'm still happy with my purchase but concerns about speed have cropped up. The dm-1 was taking a while to boot up until I got ruthless about start-up programs. It can also be slow responding while web-surfing if too many background programs are running. A key to this laptop is getting it set-up properly. The HP external speakers make a big difference in the sound quality. I really like the HDMI output to put my movies on my 32" TV.
