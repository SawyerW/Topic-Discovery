So, the chromebook pixel came out today, and honestly I don't get it. Unless Google has something crazy planned for I/O in May, the Samsung series 3 is what you want. This value proposition is unbeatable. You're getting a shockingly high quality laptop for 250 dollars.BuildIt looks absolutely excellent. Many reviews rave about it's lightness, and I was somewhat worried it would feel too light, to the extent of feeling cheap. It's almost perfect.KeyboardSome will love this keyboard, I think it doesn't have quite enough resistance, but it's nice enough and gets the job done. I'm a little spoiled coming from a mechanical keyboard.TrackpadBig enough, quality enough, responsive and has good two finger scrolling. A little loud on clicks, but if that's an issue, you may just become a tapper and not a clicker.DisplayFrom reading the reviews I thought the display would be horrible. In reality I think it's quite excellent. I prefer a matte display, and this one is a perfectly fine matte display with enough brightness and enough viewing angles.Battery lifeOne of the prime selling points of this device, and for me almost any other. The battery life on this computer is superb. Much better than my nexus 7, much more capable too. Even with decent brightness, it seems like this thing lasts forever compared to my windows 8 upgraded pc.What it boils down to is, what are you looking for? Honestly, when was the last time you were on a PC and not connected to the internet? What applications do you use that aren't available online? Have you tried experimenting with chrome webapps to see if there is an adequate alternative out there to your favorite offline application? I've found that everything I need and more is available as a webapp and have been impressed with the level of capability available online for free. It's truly amazing. I highly recommend this product as well as the chrome OS. Very impressed.
