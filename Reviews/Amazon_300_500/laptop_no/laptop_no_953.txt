I bought the Samsung Chromebook with the idea in mind that it was even smaller than my laptop and would work great to read books on the go without having to drag along my kindle as well as my phone as well as...blah blah blah. Sometimes I honestly feel like all of my various devices turn me into a walking satellite receiver. The first thing I took note of when using the chromebook for the first time was how easy it was to set it up and make it personal. There is a handy one screen guide to walk you through the process. It is all pretty straight forward and if you are a user of google chrome, you pretty much have it in the bag already.I set up the chromebook and downloaded the apps I would need to use offline and found the process simple and satisfying. Typing on the chromebook is pretty much the same as on any other keyboard with the noted exception that the keys have somewhat large spaces between them which can cause my typing to be a little awkward since I am used to my laptop where the keys are all close together.The screen has beautiful even illumination and the apps download very quickly. It was a bit of a change to go from windows to the google operating system and took me a few days to organize things to where I could easily access them and remember where I put them.As for battery life, this thing rocks! I have used this thing for seven hours before and still had it estimate that I had over an hour left. Mostly I use the chromebook for business applications and perusing the web for my job so I have not had to much experience playing movies on it or listening to music. I don't do much with multimedia.So far it was a great purchase and I have been thrilled with it after a month of use. If you are looking for a lightweight, portable device to fill your basic needs, this is an excellent choice.
