First off, one needs to separate their thoughts and feelings about Win 8 when reviewing this laptop.  This review will be almost entirely hardware related.Pros:- Sleek, stylish design with a fantastic soft rubber coating on the body.- Screen, although on the small side, is beautiful with responsive touchscreen capabilities.- Fantastic keyboard texture and key press feedback.- Windows button is a God send for a Win 8 machine!- I actually like having the power button on the side of the screen and volume keys on the front of the screen.- Quiet operation.Cons:- Why is the FN key on the outer most corner of the keyboard?  I keep clicking FN when I want to CTRL - V.- Battery life is garbage.  Worse yet, the battery continues to drain while the laptop is in Sleep/Hibernate.- The touchpad is garbage.  It has a nice feel to it and once the sensitivity is turned waay down, it becomes responsive without being finicky, but it sorely lacks physical left and right mouse buttons.  The solid touchpad uses the lower corners to simulate mouse buttons that work fine, but if you're like me and rest your thumb on the left button while using a finger to navigate, the touchpad tends to get confused and the pointer will dance around  not knowing what you're trying to do.- The scroll feature on the touchpad is completely useless.  There's no markings where to slide leading your to search for that sweetspot that you'll never really find.- Auto rotate is hit or miss.- It could use a tiny bit more space between ports on the sides.  The USB plug always seems to bump up against the HDMI plug.It's a lovely little machine with more pros than cons overall but the cons are pretty significant as they are annoying like you wouldn't believe.
