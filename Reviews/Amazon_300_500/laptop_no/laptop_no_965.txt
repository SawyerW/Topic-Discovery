So I am a heavy chromebook user. I have/had the first Samsung chromebook, Chromebox, 550, and now just received the new $249 Chromebook today.For $249 it is a steal. Great looks (80% of a Macbook Air). I wanted to focus this review to give insight to people already using other chromebooks.1) Screen - The screen is nothing like the first 2 versions from Samsung. This is a cheaper screen that is very noticeable side by side. Many others mention about the viewing angle losing brightness, I agree. I also have a cloudy into (almost the wrong hue) on my screen. Very similar to my first notebook in 1998. Samsung, if you have a better option -please use it. This is the most glaring thing versus the 550.2) Design - LOVE IT! After comparing the two, I want the screen of the 550 pushed into the form factor of this new one. Measurably more thin without the rounded plastic feel that has dogged the first two Samsung chromebooks.3) Sound - It is like going back to the original Samsung chromebook. Almost half the volume of the 550. Ok, but don't expect the volume.4) Speed - Do not notice issues here.In summary, I would love if they made an option for $50-$100 more with a 12.5" - 13" higher quality screen (seems like enough room, as there is a large bezel around this new one). Also wished they would upgrade the speakers and volume. Put these two things into the current size and design and you have a STRONG business/higher end machine (for $299-$349, no more $449 chromebooks please as it defeats the purpose). That said, this is a great value for what it is and I strongly feel every house should have this laying around (you will use it more then a tablet). I just wish they had a higher quality machine like the 550 in this design (at a lower price point).
