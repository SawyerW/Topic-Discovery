My mom who is in her early 60's was looking for a new laptop after her Acer Netbook that she had had for a few years bit the dust. We had contemplated a tablet, because she has an iPhone and that would have been pretty much the same thing, but the price tag for even an iPad mini was way more that what she was wanting to spend! We went to BestBuy and played around with a few computers, but even those were upwards of $400 which she still wasn't quite comfortable with because she wasn't sure she'd use it enough to justify the price, so we left empty handed. Then I remembered hearing good things about the Chromebook, so I looked it up here on Amazon, showed her some pictures and explained the concept, and she was willing to try it out. We ordered it on Monday and it arrived today-- I literally opened the box, flipped open the lid of the Chromebook and it powered up instantly. I was very impressed! It prompted for language, and then to connect to a wireless network, and for a gmail address which my mom doesn't have (she still uses AOL! haha) so I made her a gmail address that's the same as her AOL SN-- I noticed there was also an option to "browse as guest" if someone didn't have a gMail account. I was on the internet setting up bookmarks for her facebook and amazon in literally 2 minutes after opening the box! If you're going to be doing extensive work I would say you will probably need something more powerful-- but for someone like my mom who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, just a nice machine to browse the internet and check e-mails, facebook, etc with a REAL keyboard-- the Chromebook is awesome!!! I have a Dell Inspiron Notebook that's about 4 years old, and after using this Chromebook I think I might get one too. It feels a lot like a macbook in a way, but at 1/10 of the price at least! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants something simple to use, convenient, lightweight, and awesome looking!!!
