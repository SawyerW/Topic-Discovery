I bought this laptop at a local Micro Center. This thing is amazing!!! i paid $399.99 plus taxes and a 2 year accidental warranty it came out to a total of $575.00. let me make this clear to you..i am a Techie, i love technology, and i like to be up-to-date with lots of things, Computers and laptops Being among them, let me put it to you like this. The best computers on the market Have " intel core i7 processors" those are quad-core computers and usually have at least 6 gigabytes of ram and 500 gigabytes of harddrive space. This computer, the HP Pavilion g6-2010nr Notebook PC can definitely compete with that. let me show you pros.PROS:1) intel i3 processor at 2.3 ghtz2)above average size screen, not big, but definitely not small a 15.6 inches.3) long battery life ive had it working on battery for over 5 1/2 hours.4) Altec Lansing Speakers for loud, and clear sound.5) 4 gigabytes of ram with just facebooking, school work or alot of other things 4 gigabytes is all you need. but you can also add 4 gigabytes of ram to this laptop. making it an 8 gigabyte monster. (which is what I am going to do soon)6) 640 gigabyte hard drive!!! way above average. alot of laptops still come with a 280 or 320 gigabyte hard drive. making this one amazing.7) Comes with windows 7. wich is very stable and well designed.8) HDMI port, to connect to a tv for slideshows movies and other awesome things.9) High Resolution Screen. running at 1366x768. its great for youtube, or movies.10) Great camera. comes with lots of cool built in features mom's will love to use. This laptop EVEN COMES WITH FLASH for pictures. not a whole lot of laptops come with flash, usually just $800 and up laptops.11) very light weight. less than 6 pounds.12) usb speed 3.0 the newest and fastest speed. making file transfers faster than before.13) Comes with 2 usb slots, a memory card slot a headphone slot9(3.5mm universal size in all laptops)14) DOESNT GET HOT!!! cool to the touch! even after 4 or 5 hours of use, due to new hp cooling technology, typing on you lap is now MORE COMFORTABLE!!!CONS:1)this laptop still comes with a DVD player i really dont care since i usually dont watch movies on my laptop, i mean come on, why do we have t.v.'s?Newer and more expensive computers usually haveintel i7 proccesors6 gigabytes of ram720 gigabytes of harddriveand bluray players. but if you want that, expect to pay well over $800Bottom Line: I highly recommend this laptop to anyone in need of one, but on a budget. HP is American and one of the highest rated laptop and desktop companies today. HP was so awesome that when i opened my box, i got a free 60 day anti-virus software FOR FREE!!!! HP has amazed me. hopefully it amazes you as well.P.S. What do you think i wrote this review with? ^_^
