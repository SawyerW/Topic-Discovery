I was originally very pleased.  I noticed the wifi was slower than other devices I have but not terrible.  However I couldn't save anything to one of the drives (it comes with s SSD and a traditional drive, the traditional drive wouldn't allow anything to be saved to it), Dell had me reinstall the OS. Since then while booting up I started getting a message that said one of the disk needed to be checked for consistency, it'd count down to 7 then skip the check.  Dell told me this was nothing to worry about.  Then one day (10 months after purchase) when I tried to shut it down I got the blue screen of death, and the fan became extremely loud.  Now it won't start up.  It doesn't matter if I try to start it in safe mode or regularly, it just goes back to the start up screen and asks if I want to launch startup repair or start windows normally.Update: After spending 1.5 hours on the phone with Dell one day, then over 2 hours today I have decided to never buy Dell again.  Neither one of the tech support people had any clue what was wrong and did not offer any more support than the onscreen instructions.  Well I can read for myself. When the reinstall popped up an unspecified error message they had no clue what to do. I'm now waiting on more restore disc although he couldn't explain how these were any different than the thumb drive, just that I should try them.  I asked about sending the lap top back to get a new one, or just a refund and they said no the lap top is fine.  Really? Because not being able to start up the lap top or reinstall windows is a pretty big problem in my book.
