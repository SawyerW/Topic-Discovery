I am in awe that a couple of the reviews on this laptop are not about the computer at all but gripes about the operating system "Windows" or customer service! Isn't a product review supposed to be about the product and not the operating system or the people that you bought the laptop from?  If you don't like Windows XP then get Vista or Windows 7 or even 8.  And if Windows just turns you off completely, then try Linux!As far as the HP NC6320 is concerned, it is very durable, fast, and reliable! Are there faster laptops - yes, but not at this price level.  I own a couple of Dell D630s, Lenovo  G560s and a Lenovo R500 and would say that this HP is the second fastest of the lot but at about half the price! Even better, things that wear out like batteries are available for the NC6320 at bargain prices on Amazon! And if you want to add memory or a larger hard drive, the upgrades are cheap compared to the Apple.My hobby is photography and one of the things that I use my laptops for is photo editing.  The display on the NC6320 is beautiful and there is enough speed in the Intel dual core CPU to let me edit photos without any major wait between edits.My suggestions to any prospective buyer is to make sure you get at least 2GB of memory and 4GB if it is available.  Opt for a larger 320GB drive and if you can choose an operating system, Windows 7 and 8 use less memory and CPU power than Vista. It also comes standard with a 4400mAh battery that lasts for about 2.5hrs new and most used ones last only 1.5hrs or so.  Get a 7800mAh replacement battery and you will have over 5hrs of computing time! The memory, larger hard drive, operating system, and larger capacity battery are all available on Amazon.I have had mine for years without any type of repair, just upgrades in memory and hard drive size and a larger capacity battery.
