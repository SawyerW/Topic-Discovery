I have owned two G570 laptops. One with i3 CPU, the other one with i5 CPU. In both cases, screws fall off not long after we used them within a month. So I had to re-screw the fallen screw. I believe the problem is that the thread is too shallow. This clearly indicates the design overlook.As for built-in software programs, I didn't find any of the them particularly useful besides Onekey Recovery, which makes factory pre-installation less of a headache.Based on the images I found on the Internet, the easy-to-take-off back panel makes CPU fan cleaning less of a headache, although I haven't had the chance to do that. Not many laptops have this convenient back panel.The keyboard is easy to use and easy to clean. Number pad is a plus.The laptop is very light because the case is made of plastics entirely. This also makes it very fragile. Make sure you need to avoid bumping or any kind of impact or compression.Some areas of the bottom gets hot when you used it for a while. However, the temperature is not high enough for any concern, based on the data gathered from third-party software.Finally, the stability of the laptop seems to be OK, as far as I know.NOTE: the Memory comes with two 2 GB memory modules, and there are only two slots available. Therefore, you will have to take off at least one of them for memory upgrade.Also, there are only three useable 2.0 USB ports, one one the left side is supposed to be a USB port, but I really can't stick any USB flash drive or USB cable into it.The power adapter is small and relatively shorter than ASUS laptops. The proximal end of the laptop adapter has nice right angle protector for easy wrapping.If you haven't noticed, this is an old model: no HDMI port, no 3.0 USB port.In conclusion: it's a cheaply made, good price for the specs laptop by Lenovo (Chinese). And it was made in China, if you want to know.
