I have had this laptop for 4 years. Granted, it is on it's last leg and if I had more patience, I could deal with all of its little issues like:1. having to contort the power cord into balloon animal shapes at the entrance to the jack and held in place with whatever is handy to actually get the thing to charge2. The battery holds about 5 minutes worth of energy3. the track pad only works if you use your WHOLE finger, not tip, whole. This makes fine tasks difficult but is easily solvable with a wireless mouse4. Some of the keys are starting to give out-one being the S, which is unfortunate as my name has 4 of them in it5. The fact that you could cook an egg on the palm rest after being on for more than 10 minutes. It is so HOT!! It will play a video (from any source) for about 1.5 minutes before the screen shuts off. The only way to get it back on is to force shut down with the power button, wait for it to cool off and then turn it back on. I have been able to get around this by setting the laptop on these really thick coasters (bench cookies)to increase the airflow underneath. When I must watch a video for school, a small bag of peas or a couple of burritos over the keyboard have kept it from over heating.So, even with all of that, I am writing this review from this laptop purchased 4 years ago. I have every intention of getting a new one in the next month but Ole Betty here has been able to assist me with:writing my thesispreparing presentationsgoing on mypace (back when that was cool)playing Guitar Hero (it skipped until I turned off all the background crap and then it was fine)playing music (duh)streaming NetflixFacebooking (is that a verb now?)wasting unimaginable time on the internetI felt I owed a review to this machine for being part of my life for the past 4 years.
