Okay, so I received the laptop today, and it is honestly the best laptop I have ever owned. The looks are great, the red LED lights are a spectacle and the blue LED trim in certain parts of the laptop make this thing look really awesome.two main games I have tried: Diablo 3, and BF4BF4: With a 780m, I managed to maintain about 55fps and higher with the settings selected on HIGH. It honestly looks amazing. I really can't notice major FPS drops unless HUGE explosions come my way (which is expected). UPDATE 5-6-14 I had to select the nvidia GPU through nvidia control panel because the game was running off my intel graphics 4000. A HUGE performance increase now. I am running ultra at around 45-60fps with no AA and no HBAO at 1080p. Love this thing :DDiablo 3: A piece of cake. Everything on ultra. The GPU rapes the game in quality and looks.For heat, I bought a coolermaster laptop cooling pad, so it helps with the extra airflow. I was in the 80's (80c mind you) when measuring temps on BF4 using coretemp. I did not play over an hour btw, I was just testing out the game for about 30 mins.Noise: The fan is ULTRA loud when you click on the fan setting on the keyboard. The noise from the game muffles it out, but not by much. But it's only to be turned on when gaming. Surfing the web and homework don't need extra cooling...Other than that it's very quiet when just idling.overall a nice piece of work cyberpowerpc has put together. Oh, yeah, the camera. It's whatever. It's not the greatest or the worse. It's just an average display. Unless you love seeing only complete clarity on laptop cameras, this will do just fine for your average user.
