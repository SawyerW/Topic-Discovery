I got this computer for almost 3 months. Bought one crucial 4G RAM from Amazon and update it.This is a great computer. Only thing I want to complain is that HP put too many HP program in it and I don't know which one I can remove and which I can't. But anyway, the computer is still fast, nice screen...hmmm that reminds me, this week, sometimes there's a blink line appears on the top of the screen and it disappears after few minutes or sometimes I had to restart the computer. I don't know what cause the trouble but I am still happy with the computer.PLus I got the computer when the price is just over $400, now it's over $500...UPdate on 01/14/2013So now my proud computer is slow, and keep freezing. I am still under warranty so I tried to contact with HP custommer support to asked about that. First Rep told me to disable all the start-up and services with msconfig, I did. After wasting my time, there's still no change.Next day I thought maybe too many programs installed, some are heavy, so I uninstalled almost of them, just keep the basic ones. No changes either.I said, ok, how about bring it back to Factory Setting. Sweep it all... I did try system recovery using HP Recover Partition on my hard disk, and got an error saying can't perform that. SO I contact HP again. Another rep told me to try again. And fail, and he's no longer there when I get back to him, so I had to talk with ANOTHER ONE. This one keeps me wait forever for her response, but once i leave my desk to get some water and came back, she closed the chat section.SO I am now taking my last chance with this HP customer service. And the conclusion is the HP recovery partition in my computer is corrupted, so I will have to PURCHASE recovery disc from HP even though I am still under warranty.FED UP
