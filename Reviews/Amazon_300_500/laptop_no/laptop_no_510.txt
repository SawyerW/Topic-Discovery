I've been an Acer fan since 1997, had my first major Desktop from them and it ran forever. I use to like Toshibas laptops back in the day, 2004 till about 2009 or so when they really took pride in their machines. Now they are cheap plastic toys, and fall apart like leaves in the fall. First off the lid has horrible wobbling when you open it, the keys smash down into the body of the computer like grapes on pavement. The fan runs either constantly, or it can't decide and kicks on and off, on and off etc. Very loudly i might add. The speakers are horrible, i have headphones that are much louder. And the over all feel of the machine is just bad. It's really a shame when a company like Emachines (now owned by Acer) makes (made) a better quality laptop the Toshiba. I had one back in 2010, and it was built rock solid, tiny speaker sound, and a decent processor, but definitely better than this doorstop. I remember taking this out of the box thinking, are you kidding me?I have an Acer 17.3 inch laptop that i got in 2010 as well, and it is fantastic, never an overheating issues, burned literally 100's of discs (maybe more), converted movies, great speaker volume, and the body is made very firm, with a good solid feel. I was never an AMD fan either, sure you get 4 cores, and it's more powerful than my laptop, but honestly, who games on them anymore? Hence the cheap price, look on Wal-Mart and the computer is 578$, ask why? Now you know. So good specs, don't mean your getting a good reliable quality machine. I've loved the underdog, (Acer) for years, and it's been great. Even my girlfriends new Gateway is made far superior. I miss the old Toshibas. Even the higher end models suffer from problems, i work on desktops only. But i've heard many people say they get more HP's Dell's and Toshibas coming through with problems, more than any others. So buy at your own risk. They didn't even make this model for 8 months, and now they are gone. Or overstocked at Wal-Mart. Buyer beware.
