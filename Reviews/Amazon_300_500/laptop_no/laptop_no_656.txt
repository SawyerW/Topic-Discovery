Love the computer, hate Windows 8.1. I miss XP so much. It was simple; Windows 8.1 (which I downloaded first thing based on other reviewers' suggestions) is complicated and I just plain hate it. The computer itself is a dream. Low price, long battery life, lightweight, sturdy, and it's a Dell, which speaks for itself. This computer is very fast for loading files and lightweight gaming - I don't know about more complicated games. Colors are brilliant. Photos are sharp and clear. I love having the card reader right on the front and it reads the card from my camera perfectly. As I don't have cable or satellite at the moment, watching tv programs and movies online with this computer is extremely satisfying (thank you, networks, for letting us watch episodes online). They stream fast (on my old computer the sound and picture lagged and were never in sync). I especially love having the HDMI connector on this computer, as I can now hook it to my HD tv and watch all programs on the big screen. If you haven't bought your HDMI cable yet, I advise you to buy a long one. Mine is short and I have to leave the computer on the coffee table. I would prefer having it on the sofa with me. Watching them on the computer is equally satisfying, just smaller. The touchscreen......well, I can't say I really love it but as most people do, I guess I'm in the minority on that subject. I hate that the menu bar pops up all the time on the right side when I'm just trying to move the cursor. I hate that the screen image magnifies when all I'm trying to do is swipe upward to scroll further along in the text. I am learning more every day and will get used to the touchscreen, but I find I'm using the touchpad to move the cursor for the most part. It is reliable and unwanted items aren't popping up onscreen all the time. I highly recommend this computer for its price, size, and performance.
