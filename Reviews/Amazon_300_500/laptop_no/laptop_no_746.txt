This is our third Toshiba laptop and, mostly, I love it; although I do long for the Harmon Kardon speakers which were in our prior two laptops.Our first Toshiba laptop, purchased July 2005, was husband's work computer for almost five years and the computer was subjected to heavy, every day use (mostly AutoCAD) and lots of travel.  It died January 2010.Our second was purchased July 2006 and was lightly used as my home computer until Jan 2010, when it became my husband's work computer (needed XP).  It is still doing quite well, especially considering it's over 4 years old.This being our third Toshiba, we were expecting it to be reliable and of good quality and are not disappointed.  It has given no problems during the 9 months we've used it.  The only downside is the speakers - they are so quite!  I have googled solutions and work-arounds to amp them up, but they remain noticably quieter than we prefer.  We are fairly quiet people and would set a computer in one corner of a room and play I-tunes, which would softly permeate the first floor of our house.  On this computer - sounds are barely audible in one room.  I sometimes watch a movie while going to sleep (alone in a quiet room) and will often catch myself 'turning up' the sound - after it had already been set as loud as possible.  Next laptop will have Harmon Kardon speakers.Although sound is important, this factor has been the only downside of this laptop.  I really enjoy using Windows 7, having a ton of memory and having a super fast start-up/shut-down.  The laptop's durability surprised me recently when we were puppy-sitting, puppy accidentally popped off 3 key tiles.  I figured they were ruined, but after studying them for a second, all 3 perfectly snapped right back on.We made a great decision in buying this laptop and hope we are able to use it for many more years.
