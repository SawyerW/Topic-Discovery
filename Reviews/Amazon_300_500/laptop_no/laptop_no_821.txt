I received this laptop on 3/17/11.  The number keypad was DOA. Since I purchased from an Amazon partner - I could not get a replacement - but could get my money refunded.  I opted to contact HP customer support.  Spoke with a total of 3 very nice young men. First one I spoke with I was disconnected from (cell phone) - called back - but call was dropped again.  Called back in and second one helped me realize that it was a hardware problem. He told me I could send it in for repair - I contacted Amazon and found out could only get refund - so called HP back to make arrangements to send laptop back in. They sent out through FedEx the box to ship it in along with the label. Dropped it off at FedEx Kinko's - will come back and let you know how long to get it back, etc.The display was quite good and it did several Windows updates in extremely fast time.  Please note - it took over 2 hours to make the recovery discs (7 dvds total).***UPDATE***  My laptop is working perfectly now.  It did take HP 2 tries to get it working - but customer service was extremely nice and quite professional.  They really wanted to make sure that the laptop was working correctly and to my satisfaction. The first time I sent it in with shipping and the weekends it took about 1 1/2 weeks to get it back.  The second time they upgraded it to overnight shipping and with the weekend it took less than a week.  All the keys work as they should and the keyboard has a nice touch. I'm not a big fan of the touchpad so I bought a bluetooth mouse - which works quite well.We purchased this exact same model for my husband and it worked perfectly right from the beginning and we had no issues with it. We feel that we got quite a bit for our money and would recommend this laptop to anyone.
