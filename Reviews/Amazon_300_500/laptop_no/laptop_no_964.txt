First, I am a huge fan of the Chromebooks and had one of the last generation from my work.  I bought the $250 Chromebook about two months ago as a personal laptop and have been very happy with it.First thing to know, THIS IS NOT A REGULAR LAPTOP.  You don't download and run programs like you do with Windows or Macs.  Imagine everything you do in your web browser like mail, Google Docs, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, web browser games, etc. Please make sure you understand what this laptop is and does.  I use it for school and only the thing that didn't work for me was MiniTab, a statistical program which only runs on windows.If you had an older version of a Chromebook, this is much lighter and thinner!  I consider it a perfect travel laptop and have taken it on a couple of trips already.  There is a trade-off between battery life and CPU speed, because the Samsung 5 was slower (to the point of being a negative) but the battery life was 9+ hours - really.  I downloaded movie AVIs and literally watched movies for a 6 hour flight.  So, overall I am happy with the trade-off and like the beefier CPU with 6 hours of battery.  The extra USB port is good as I like to have a wireless mouse and sometimes put in a USB key.Security wise, you can not ask for a better laptop.  All code is signed and downloaded from Google.  You can not add software unless you put it in developer mode, which you can clearly see warnings to avoid confusion.  No malware can exist and Google has hacking bake-offs to find and pay information security researchers.Overall, the 'Poor Mans MacBook Air' is a total winner at $250.  Really: no virus, patching, reloading stuff, and the typical computer things you have to do.  Patches apply automatically and since everything is stored in the cloud, you can wipe it and be working in minutes.Last thing, if you need PC remote control - there is a Chrome Remote from Google.  No frills or whistles, but it works.
