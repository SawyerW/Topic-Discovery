I wanted something that would be better for air travel and travel in general while still having great functionality. This is an amazing little laptop, so much power is so little space. If you like a big screen you'll hate it but I've had it for 6 months and while I mostly use it on trips I have no complaints. I bought the extended battery for really long trips in additional to having the standard battery for the shorter times away from the house. While many people complained about the touch pad and even I worried about it in the beginning I've gotten used to it and now adore it. Some of my pros and cons will depend on what specs you purchase but they will include my favorites even if they don't apply to your purchase.pros (there are too many to name...)- a usb 3.0 port- always on power usb capabilities- plenty of ports- textured touch pad- many different options for using the touch pad- thumb print reader- integrated mic and camera- plenty of space for wrists and curved/small form factor allows for comfortable resting space on whatever surface underneath- even though it's a small laptop the keyboard is still very manageable, granted I have small hands, I don't think someone with large hands could use it but I don't have any trouble- like all ThinkPads it's very sturdy, I actually dropped the thing not long after I got it (even though I've never once dropped a laptop) and while I did get a tiny split in the corner no internal damage was done- the little over screen light is convenient when you need to plug something in or see something while you are on a plane and trying not to disturb those around youcons- as all Lenovos are...the FN key is where the ctrl key should be, grr, I've gotten used to it but it's different from almost every keyboard in the world- it does have a very small screen but if you shell out the money for the nicer display it's worth it- should have gone all out and bought the SSD, I've heard it's completely amazing with this laptop; I'm more than happy with the hard drive in it but it would have been cool- some of my capabilities like the powered usb port was not enabled when I bought it, I figured all that would be on by default but I had to go into the bios and turn it on, no big deal just confused me- if you purchase the extended battery it doubles the weight of the little laptop- honestly...I know it's in the logo but why not option out the touch stick?So as you can tell, my cons are pretty silly and either opinionated or preference. It's a great little laptop and easily the best purchase I've made in a laptop at any given time.
