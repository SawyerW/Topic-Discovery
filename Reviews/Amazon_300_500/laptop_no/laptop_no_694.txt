I have the earlier black macbook 2.16ghz/1gb/160gb and it has been solid and an exceptional computer since i upgraded from a powerbook g4 1gz titanium that was over 4yo.  A lot of people complain about macs being too expensive, but if you know anything about apple, they target a specific market who can afford to pay for their premium computers.  if you complain that they cost too much, its usually a windows person who are used to paying $500 for a crappy laptop that eventually craps out or is overrun with viruses to a point where nothing works anymore.  Another thing that people don't realize is macs retain their value VERY well.  I sold my powerbook g4 1ghz titanium for $550 in oct 2007 which originally cost $3k in 11/02(i bought it used for $500 in 12/05).  It was still in great condition with no problems when i sold it... it was as fast as my old p4 2.53ghz desktop which has been gathering dust for a while now(i had been a windows user for nearly a decade).This is my current setup:Black Macbook 2.16ghz/3gb ram/160gb hd/superdrive w/ OSX 10.5.5westinghouse 24" LCD monitor @ 1920x1200fantom drive 250gb firewire external hdwestern digital passport 320gb usb external hdpinnacle hdtv stick for mac(hdtv tuner)logitech wireless keyboard & mouseAs you can see i have my macbook plugged in with a lot of accessories and i run 7+ programs at once when im using my mac, including eyetv(hdtv), isight cam w/ sightspeed video conferencing, as well as other less intensive applications.  If you want a great dependable and quick mac this is the one to get, especially now that you can find it at discounted prices since the new macbooks came out.  The only con that I have is that my old mac has the old 950GMA integrated graphics which can be an issue if you like to play/edit/encode high res videos or play graphic intensive games, especially full hd 1920P.  I can play 1920P videos fine but it will get bogged down if im using a lot of other cpu intensive programs.  im sure this won't be an issue for the majority of users since those people would probably get the macbook pro instead.  i have had no issues at all that people have complained about(fans, cracked plastic, screen flicker, etc) and im sure i'll use this mac for another 2-3years before upgrading again.pros:fast, lightweight, long battery lifecons:slow graphics chip
