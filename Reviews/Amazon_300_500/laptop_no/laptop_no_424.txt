So I had an Apple Macbook that I had gotten though the school in June 2008. Not only was it referbrished/used, but I was paying so much more than a brand new apple macbook pro would of cost. Got ripped off too. Yeah. I should've looked into that more, but I was right out of high school, so I didn't know much. And let's just say my old macbook pro is hunk piece of junk. Everything that went wrong with it did which I won't get too much into, but I wanted a replacement. PC laptops, I wasn't too crazy about, so I decided to go with an updated version of the Macbook Pro.I had to decide between the this and the Retina Display. I wanted the Retina Display one so bad. I think I wanted it mainly because it is thinner than the regular macbook pro, but did I really want to pay $400 more just for that. It did have other features, yes, but I won't pay $1400 for a laptop. I would do a $1000 for a brand new one though. Getting it in the mail is like Christmas! ALl packaged up securely and when I opened it, it was perfect.I had a 4-5 year old macbook pro. So there were some pretty big changes that I am still getting use to. The trackpad is a little confusing, it scrolls in opposite directions and you can click anyway in there. I think that's the biggest thing I have to use to. It is smaller in size, like weight like, I'm talking about. Love the black keyboard with the lighting. Finally I have photo booth again! I missed it. I am still basically messing around with it, but I remain in love with it.I have had my ups and downs with Apple products in the past, but honestly apple remains to be the best in my opinion. Everything is just so beautiful about their products. Since this one is brand new, I'm going to take care of it like it's my baby.
