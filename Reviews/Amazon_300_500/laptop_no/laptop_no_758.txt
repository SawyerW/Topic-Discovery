I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this laptop. After exhaustive research I chose this laptop as a gift for my wife. After reading favorable reviews and believing that HP produced a quality product I thought this laptop was a good buy given its pricepoint and features. BOY was I wrong!!!First off, despite this machines apparent hardware prowess it is SLOW AS DIRT!!! I have tried to investigate why the cpu always seems to be bogged down, but after turning off several services related to Windows Media Player, changing the power profile, and reducing instances of constant 50-100% cpu usage it still runs slow. Right out of the box, without any software tweeking it was a dog!Speaking of Windows media, although this is billed as an "entertainment" PC do not try and ask it to perform any media functions. I tried to stream music from this machine to a PS3 for playback and the associated services you must turn on caused the cpu to be pegged at 100%.....even when there was no music steaming, thus rendering it useless for any other function!!I work in IT and I know that computers are not supposed to perform like this if they are engineered correctly. It may just be that Windows 7 is total crap or that this machine is under-engineered to be able to run it. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk unless you fancy watching the spinning circle everytime you want to open a webpage, program or document. This computer is now a barely useable PC that my wife tries to work from home on. I never even got into in this review the cheap build quality.....Thin plastic...feels like you could break it just picking it up. I could tolerate this if not for all the other glaring flaws. HP should be ashamed to have there name associated with this product. Next time I buy a laptop I will be looking to a different manufacturer.
