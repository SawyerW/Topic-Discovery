Basically it's a good PC.  It is replacing my more capable, but heavier Dell 1505 (Core2, 3gb, 1440x900 15" LCD).Pros: Thin, light, ~6-8 hours of real-time battery depending on usage, 2 year warranty, 1 year accidental damage warranty, portableNote: The battery in this model is the smaller 10 hour+ 4400mah 8-cell, not the 12 hour+ 5600mah 8-cell found in the more $$$ UL30a's.  Battery life is not the 12+ hour rating Amazon claims. Asus claims only 10+ hour on their website for this model.Cons: Battery life doesn't live up to Amazon's 12 hour claim, Asus bloatware slows Win7, creaky, cheap plastic construction (flexy palm rest), easily smudges (which transfers from palm rest to screen bezel), blue-ish screen, easily scruffed plastic (ironically, the cloth-like protector that comes as a separator between the screen and keyboard can scratch the screen bezel if used to wipe down the smudges), noisy possibly cheap HDD (I moved the computer once, slightly, while shutting down to hear the HDD clack and screech in protest).I'm normally not one to complain about cosmetics of a PC - heck, I have been lugging around a 6lb+ Inspiron 1505 for 3 years.  But I'm astounded at how crummy this otherwise eye-catching Asus can look after a few smudges and now some scratches.  I'm not abusive to my other electronics, so I don't like the way this computer is showing signs of what looks like heavy wear after just a few weeks use.Ok, so I sound down on this computer, but I'm not.  I'm keeping it.  It just didn't live up to the high praise and my subsequent expectations.  I think the first thing I'll do is to put an SSD in it so I have no worries about the possibly bad HDD, or injuring the HDD.It'll be a good companion on the road for years to come, but just not a replacement for my Dell.
