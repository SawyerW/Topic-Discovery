I don't know what more I can add to all of these great reviewsbut believe the hype!!!this is one AWESOME laptop!I'll just make a list of why I love it --- forgive me if it comes off with any irrationality ---1. Portability ---- seriously, feel free to laugh, but this laptop really is portable....... yes, it can get heavy (by the end of the day) but it really is comparable, if not lighter, than most laptops available......... I commend Apple for doing such a great job on actually making this computer portable enough to throw in a backpack and take with you2. The Widescreen 17" screen!!! gosh this screen is beautiful! Sometimes I find myself using a smaller computer and I can't stand it ---- I've officialy been spoiled! Even 15" widescreens won't do anymore!3. Keyboard ---- there's something special about this keyboard - its pretty cool4. Speed ---- Apple gets knocked around a lot for its speed, but seriously, the G4 in this thing really handles things greatly! I highly recommend 1 gig of RAM, for the ultimate speed and stability ----- this thing will run Final Cut Pro, Garage Band, OS X, all of those programs, greatly! Take my word for it ---- no probs at all!5. Stablity ---- this is more of a software thing, but OS X is such a great OS!!! Never freezes, never crashes ------ I have five different apps open right now (Safari, AOL, Preview, MS Word, and iTunes) and the speed isn't slowing down one bit!6. Output options ----- were talking Firewire, Firewire 800, USB, DVI, best of all, SVIDEO and AUDIO output ---- making it VERY easy to connect this baby to a nice TV!!! its pretty freaking coolI don't know what else to say ---- buy it! IT ROCKSfor those of you afraid to switch, let me give you reasons why ---- Microsoft Office on OS X (which works better here than it does on XP)- Final Cut Pro (better than any Windoze editing system)- All Adobe apps available here- All Macromedia apps available heredid I forget anything?
