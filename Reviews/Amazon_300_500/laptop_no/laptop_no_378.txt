If you're looking for a Windows PC equivalent, you've come to the wrong place. A Macbook is not a Windows PC, and that's the beauty of it. Apple does not believe in the numbers game of the hardware spec of a computer. Instead, it focuses on creating a beautiful machine in which all the parts work in harmony creating a spectacular result for the end user.Being a PC-guy, it took me a long time to even give Apple a chance. In terms of raw power and customizability, a Macbook in the same price range could never come close to a PC. However, when I saw how beautifully the touchpad and hotkeys worked in sync with the OS, I was hooked. I saw the beauty in simplicity, and how the this Macbook had everything I needed and none of the junk.The MBA is a small, light, extremely portable, has roughly a 12hrs battery life. The 1.3GHz i5 processor isn't the most powerful in the world, but it's perfect for running the everyday things that most people use their computers for, such as surfing the web, emails, streaming videos, and writing word documents, all without destroying the battery life. And if you need that extra power, it can boost up to 2.6GHz for the extra tasks. I haven't noticed any performance deficiencies between this laptop, and the $1000 desktop I built 3 years ago (granted 3 years is a long time). One thing that I did notice though, is that it is not a PC. Coming from a PC, many of the programs that I used to use were really optimized for PCs only. Sure Macs have their own equivalents, but if you're thinking about making the leap, you have to know there is a slight learning curve. But who cares, when Apple's software updates are free or close to free, and they hand out their amazing iLife and iWork suites for free for purchases made after Oct 2013.Great product, and great company!
