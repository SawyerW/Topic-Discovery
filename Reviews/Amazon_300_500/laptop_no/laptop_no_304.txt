I bought this laptop new in July as a college graduation present from my parents. I was incredibly happy with the laptop... at first. I was excited to be able to game (play WoW at reasonable FPS for raiding and little latency; exciting for a little machine!!!). I had to laptop for just over two months and a USB port stopped working. After an over-the-phone attempt fix to see if it was a software problem, I had to mail the laptop in. I was guaranteed repair and having it hipped back in 5-7 business days. Over 3 weeks later, I finally received my laptop from the repair center complete with a damaged inner box where the repair center dropped the laptop. (There was a box packed in a box, so it couldn't have been from shipping.) Taking the computer straight out of the box, the track pad did not work properly which was not an issue I had when I sent it in. After calling Samsung they apologized about the broken track pad and the time it took to repair, but insisted they do not quote times for repair.... Okay, fine, you had one misinformed customer service rep. The agent I was dealing with them told me I needed to return the laptop again and I would "get it back when I got it back." Apparently, according to this agent, Samsung policy is that the repair center gets three attempts to take their time and return the laptop to you and it's not until after the third time that they offer refunds or exchanges. With the help of Amazon, I ended up getting a full refund, but I would not have been able to by myself. I will *never* purchase nor recommend another Samsung product nor laptop to anyone, ever; You've been warned about their "repairs," customer support, and faulty laptop repair policy.PS- Thank you Amazon for helping me correct the issue so I could have a college graduation laptop that brings me smiles, plenty of gaming, and isn't a Samsung.
