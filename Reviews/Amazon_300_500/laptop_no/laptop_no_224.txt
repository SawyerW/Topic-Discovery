I've had this for a few days, this is a well made netbook.  Well of course apple doesnt call it a netbook but that's what I am using it for.  I've went through about 3 netbooks and they all lack a proper processor and gpu; this came along and offers both.  Now I would have purchased a pc had any manufacturer actually made one with similar specs but they dont.I develop software so I primarily use Windows; and I've installed Windows 7 64-bit on this machine; it works wonderful with it.  I've tried the OSX partition a few times and the OS works just fine but isn't as feature rich or customizable as Windows 7 is, it also lacks software and ALL development tools I need.The build quality on this machine is very good; the chassis is made out of aluminum and keeps fairly cool on the palmrest and keyboard area; however it does get quite warm on the bottom of the machine - apple needs to work on their thermal design and/or include better fans inside their machines.  I suspect because they are using nvidia gpu's they heat up quite a bit.  Otherwise the machine is very well constructed.The screen is nice and bright and pretty much flawless; no dead pixels and the clarity and color accuracy is great.I get 5 hours and 55 minutes in Windows using the power saver mode, and exactly 4 hours using the balanced setting, high performance gets me around 3 hours.  I've found OSX give very similar results.  These figures are with wifi ON.The machine is very light and has a small form factor - this is pretty much the only reason I got this machine - its basically a netbook form factor and provides mid-performance of a standard laptop - which is something netbooks really should offer instead of intel graphics and atom processors.All in all this is an excellent Windows netbook if you want to go that option; of course if you want to use OSX theres that option too and it will work just as well.
