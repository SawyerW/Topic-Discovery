I purchased this laptop for $499.00 at PC Richard. It was the last one they had and was originally $699.00 and marked down so I said I can't beat this price anywhere for this model so I purchased it. I like the look, even though it is all plastic and I am not a fan of all plastic laptops I still think it is one of the best constructed ones I've seen. The ASUS are pretty good too. The keyboard is nice with the chicklet style which is pretty popular these days. The keyboard is attractive and I like the laptops simplicity in design. Vaios are always know for being pretty cool looking. I upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB and now this thing is blazing fast. It gets a Windows Experience Index of 4.7 overall within which is based on the lowest score which is the graphics but the rating says it can use up to 1.6 GB of video memory which is pretty good. The Processing speed is at 6.7, and the RAM is 7.2, so overall this laptop is fast for the price you pay. I don't care too much for Home Premium Edition but at least it comes with 64bit. I may redo the hard drive with Windows Ultimate 64bit version. Here is my list of pros and cons...Pros: Good processor speed, works fast with 4GB and 8GB RAM, Good stylish design, HD graphics, Good screen resolution, nice keyboard, expansion slots, 4 usb ports, DVD RW, good battery life.Cons: Touchpad can be quirky at times, Windows home premium---would prefer Pro or Ultimate, plastic. Changed to Windows 7 Ultimate...it was well worth it.Overall, I am glad I bought it. It satisfies me, and works well for what I do. I mainly do word processing, video, and browsing the net. Not really into laptop gaming, I've got a desktop for that and the Sony PS3.Thanks
