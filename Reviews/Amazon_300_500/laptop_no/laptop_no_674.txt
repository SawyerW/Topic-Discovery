The Apple MacBook Pro is an exceptionally amazing product.  I own the 15" and have been completely satisfied with it's performance and abilities.  The stylish casing and ease of use made it my first choice when buying my newest addition to the family.  We loved it so much my wife also purchased one as well.  The first thing you will notice about this laptop is it's metal casing.  Providing a sturdy casing to protect the important internal parts, it is also very cool looking.  Opening it up you first are drawn to the black keyboard that illuminates according the light in the room.  Apple has done a great job with this feature. This is also prevalent in the screen as well.  Depending on the light in the room, it will dim accordingly automatically.  Once this machine is on and running you will be amazed at how easy it is to use.  When transition from a PC to a Mac I would recommend you purchase the one on one sessions for only $99.  You get a year of personal training sessions to help you learn how to use the Apple's software and hardware.  Transitioning for me only took about a month to get confident enough to use strictly Apple software.  Given you can install any Microsoft software including the OS like Microsoft XP.  Apple lets you retain a PC feel if you want by allowing Microsoft operating systems to be installed.  Try installing Apple's OS on a PC, won't happen unless you are a genius computer wizard.I purchased the iWork suite and have been completely satisfied with that as well.  I am able to quickly produce some professional quality materials such as newsletters and brochures.  Powerpoints are a breeze with Apple's default templates.  It is very simplistic and easy to use.  Overall I have been completely satisfied with my purchase.  I would highly recommend anyone in purchasing one.  While they are considerably higher priced, you get what you pay for.  I prefer quality over cost and the Apple is well worth the price.
