UPDATE: After several months of use I am downgrading my review to 2 stars.  I am an advanced user (in IT professionally) and this little powerhouse is plagued by connection issues.  Wifi goes down frequently in many different environments, even while other devices connect without issue.Here is my original review:I am a big believer in Netbooks.  This is the 6th or 7th one I owned.  I started with a Dell Mini 9.  Contrary to popular belief, you *can* get plenty of work done on them, if you clean them up, put in the max RAM allowed, and don't have unrealistic expectations.  It is sad that this market is diminishing, but I am relieved at least -- contrary to what was reported -- netbooks are still being made.Pros for this Netbook:- super small size- ships with 2 gigs of RAM- fast processor- USB 3.0- HDMI out and VGA out- hi res for a small screenCons- ships with Win8- very clunky feel, almost like it is a solid plastic brick- does not feel as snappy as I expectedI have had this netbook for 3 days, ordered from Amazon.  First thing I have done is remove Asus bloatware, installed Windows updates, and installed Classic Shell to get back the start button and flyout navigation like XP had.I will update this review as I get more experience with the netbook.  But out of the gate, it does not feel as snappy as I expected considering the 2 gigs of RAM and processor.  And the chassis really does feel like a solid piece of cheap plastic.  The Acer 270D I bought last year -- although also plastic -- has a much better, metallic feel to it.  I am giving this netbook 3 stars so far, although I am confident I can eliminate unneeded apps and processes and get it up to speed as I have previous netbooks.
