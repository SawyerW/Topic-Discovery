This is a great light weight portable laptop. I would not get it for a heavy use laptop, but is great for traveling and light use. The speed is fast and the screen is good, but the keyboard is smaller and it is harder to type on for a long period of time. However, the keys work great and do not stick. I use mine for traveling and it works great. It has all I need for traveling and I got it for $400 refurbished. My only complaint so far is that the battery went completely dead just over having it for a year and I used it on the battery only maybe a dozen times max. I tried to see if HP would cover it, but they say it is out of warranty after a year. However, I bought the extended 2 year warranty from the computer store, and I called them and while they say that extended warranty does not cover the battery. If I sat on it by accident they would cover the screen, but if by no fault of my own and hardly using the battery it goes dead it is not covered. That's a big let down. That isn't HP, but the warranty company, but it is very frustrating that HP doesn't use a higher quality battery. There is no reason the battery should have died after hardly ever using it. The software in Windows 7 said the battery was good, but the start up battery test says FAILED. When I took it in on the extended warranty to have it tested since they thought it may be a motherboard issue, they discovered that with a test battery it worked fine, so it is not the motherboard, but the battery. I could understand the battery not lasting a long time, but to be unable to hold any charge at all and being dead, that sounds like the battery shipped with this was just plain junk. I am disappointed that HP doesn't cover this or at least does not ship it with a good battery of higher quality. However, it works great other than this battery issue, and for $400 it's worth every penny. I will keep it and get a new battery, but it would be nice if the battery that came with it was better.
