I ordered this laptop for my dad, who kept it for a day or two and then gave it to me.The pros: This laptop, which I'm using right now, has a very nice, sleek look to it. The top appears to be a brushed metal. The keyboard is spacious and easy to use. It also includes the number pad which is a nice addition to newer laptops.The processor is fast and I like Windows 7 OS. It has a built in card reader which is nice for photographers such as myself to save photos onto the computer. Like some other newer notebooks, the fan is on the side instead of idiotically on the bottom like all my other laptops. The 15 inch screen is a good size. Maybe too big to lug around but nice for home use.The cons: This laptop seems to have a mind of its own. It just does random things all the time. It's very frustrating. You might be in the middle of something and the page will close because you brushed some button. Also, the touchpad is the worst I've ever encountered. It just doesn't have a good feel to it and it's irritating to use. I have a USB mouse I use all the time. And worst thing about this laptop: The charger stopped charging the battery after only a couple of months. I called HP and they sent out a new charger, which I knew wouldn't work and didn't. Something in the computer itself is causing the battery to not charge. The battery was tested and the charger powers the laptop so there ya go. HP was no help at all. I also had this issue with my last HP laptop, a DV1000.For reasons listed above, mainly the battery charging issue, I will never buy another HP product.
