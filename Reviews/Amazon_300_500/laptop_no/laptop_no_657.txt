I do a lot of photography, graphic design, and web design.  I recently bought a 24" iMac (the $1799 model with the 120GTX discrete video RAM) and am loving it.I had a choice:  Spend $2500 for a Windows license of my Adobe products... or replace my Windows laptop with a Macbook.So I bought this Macbook.  Vista turned me off of Microsoft for good.  System requirements are asinine, which also means higher power requirements to do the same things I can do on the Mac.  I've worked with PCs ever since  Windows 1.0 -- and loathed the registry in Win95.  But I digress...  no more Windows.  I throw an Apple and broke the Windows.  :)I only mention price as a downer because the laptop has only 2GB of RAM and whose display contains a TN panel.  I was hoping for a M-PVA or better.  Still, looking directly at it, color shift is minimal.  Still, my iMac's H-IPS panel monitor blows it away in terms of gamut and shadow detail.  Not that 2GB is _bad_ or anything, but the screen was a disappointment for a $2000 notebook.As usual, OS X rocks.RAM is inexpensive, so to up this to 4GB is no ordeal.And I'll be honest:  This thing is light and has a very solid feel.  A comparable Windows laptop (think $1300) is twice as thick and needs far more than 2GB of RAM to make use of it.  I'd rather have efficiency and quality for a higher price than another piece o' junk to be upgraded all the time.I'll keep major photo editing on the iMac because of its superlative display (no $500 PC monitor even comes close; more TN garbage but larger so the flaws become even more apparent), but this is capable of most design work that doesn't require pinpoint color manipulation.  And there's plenty of that that can be done too.
