Overall this laptop is ok.  Its fast and easy to use but I have had some issues with the screen. I have had it about 6 months now and the screen had a bright spot develop near the bottom of the screen that was really distracting.  After I could not stand it anymore, I took it in to the Apple store to have it looked at.  They replaced the screen but it took them a week to do it.  When I got it back, the screen was badly misaligned when the laptop was closed so after I complained about it they tried several more times to fix it.  Finally they had to replace the screen again but it was still not aligned properly like it was when I purchased it.  They then told me it was all they could do and they would not do any more to fix it.  The technician said It was a common problem but only cosmetic so I am out of luck.  I though Apple products were supposed to be higher quality than this.  My wifes cheapo budget laptop has a better screen and its aligned properly.  She makes fun of me for wasting my money to but this one.  I am not really impressed with the quality of the product or service at this point.  Way overpriced for what you get.Other than that, it still works reasonably well.  I do like that its light and thin.  Its also pretty fast thanks to the SSD.  Not sure I will buy a Mac again though after this experience.  I do like the Mac OSX though, just not impressed with the hardware.  I might just have to make a hackintosh after this one.I am an IT specialist and have experience with a great deal of different computers and laptops and I can say there is nothing special about this one.  Should have spent my money on a more powerful windows laptop instead for the same price.
