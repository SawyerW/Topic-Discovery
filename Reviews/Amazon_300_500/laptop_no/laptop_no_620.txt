This baby is pretty much a hybrid of a tablet, laptop and ultrabook.  Its more powerful than a lot of ultrabooks (get the i5 cpu or higher).People complain about all types of things when it comes to electronics and expect a flawless product for the first of its kind.  That's not the case with anything that's even remotely complex that is brand new and revolutionary.  Yes, there have been tablets that can run windows OSes before but not full fledged versions with this stability.  I didn't have any of the issues ppl have mentioned, I guess there was just a few bugs in some of the Twists Lenovo shipped out.Don't expect to play intense video games on here or to run a home music studio out of this thing.  It can handle some music production programs (i5) but it takes it about three tries; in other words the music program will freeze 2-3 times before it runs fine.  This is not what you want when trying to produce professional sound tracks, video, photos etc.  Know what you are buying (the specs) and what they can do for you.  The CPU is great and from the best chip maker.  The ram, though not upgradeable, is enough to run just about everything.  I would avoid streaming more than 5-6 videos at once but only youtube maniacs do that.The sound is ok, tiny little speakers on a tiny computer.  The touch screen works great, just tilt it a little farther so it changes orientation when you want it to.  The ambient light sensor can be turned off.  I figured this out myself.  After that, the computer works great.  I am even running another Windows system inside of it (Virtual machine).  I can play my android games on there too with Bluestacks android emulator :D  Make sure you have it on the higher power consuming setting if youre not plugged in to AC to run those goodies.  Buy it and enjoy the awesome deal you are getting compared to the Yoga and what Asus is offering!
