I have to say that I like this little laptop.  I got mine for $369 at Office Depot.  At a "netbook" price I have a real laptop.  That means I have a 14" screen (not 7-10"), a full size keyboard (not a tiny one) and a CD/DVD burner (not available on netbooks).  In addition, it came with Vista Basic which is less of a resource hog than Vista Premium and a number of useful programs like Microsoft Works, NTI burning and backup software and Google Desktop.  My computer came with 2 GB RAM.I find the performance to be more than adequate for routine tasks and much speedier than netbooks that I have used.  With a real sized keyboard I feel that this computer could handle real tasks like typing a 10-20 page paper.  There is more than enough power to do those things that the typical user would want, like some simple photo editing.Obviously this is a bargain laptop so you can't expect the same features that you would get in a $1000 computer.  You won't find a webcam or even a SD card reader but you can certainly add those via USB if needed.  Speaking of USB, you only get 2 ports as opposed to the usual 3 and don't expect anything fancy like an HDMI or external SATA port.Will this computer:Run MS Office?  YesRun a simple photo editor?  YesRun Adobe Photoshop?  Probably not too wellRun Print Shop?  YesRun Adobe Illustrator?  Probably not too wellEdit a short You Tube video using MS Moviemaker?  YesEdit a long HD movie using Adobe Premier?  Probably notPlay simple 2D games?  YesPlay complex, high action 3D games?  Probably notUse a web cam for Skype?  Yes, but you will need to supply your own USB cameraRead flash cards?  Yes, but you will have to buy a cheap USB card readerAll in all I think the folks at eMachine thought long and hard to create a useable machine at the lowest price point.  In my opinion they succeeded.  If you want a super powered gamer in a fashion color look elsewhere.  If you need a basic machine that is bigger but also more user friendly than a netbook check out the eMachine.
