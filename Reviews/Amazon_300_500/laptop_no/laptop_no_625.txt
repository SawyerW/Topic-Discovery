First off, I purchased this item on Newegg for $599. Just wanted to share my review on the laptop here so more people can be informed.Pros: - Responsive Touch Screen- Decent speed- Lightweight- Great Size- Bright/Colorful Screen- Good Wireless- Quick Charge (see cons) *- 2x USB 3.0 ports- Price (got a $100 off coupon, thanks Newegg!)- Great Swivel- Decent Sound- Decent size HDD (see other thoughts) **- Gorilla Glass (see cons) ***- Spill Resistant KeyboardCons: - Battery doesn't last long (about 4.5 hours on use) *- Lots of Bloatware- Glossy Screen ***- Windows 8 Installation disc not included (but it is installed, easy to make restore cd's)- No backlit keyboardOther Thoughts: - The first thing that needs to be done is to update all the drivers. The laptop can be a bit finicky at first, but all was well after they were updated.- There was a lot of Bloatware (Lenovo Software) when I first booted it up. None of it is really all that essential, so I uninstalled most of it.- It works well (most of the time) with Windows 8. I had to deactivate the keyboard TrackPoint (red looking button in the middle of the keyboard) because when it was in Tablet mode, the stick would cause the mouse pointer on the screen to move. Not a big issue though.- ** I am unsure whether or not this actually has a 24GB SSD. Normally, the OS is installed onto it. The problem with this is that it would leave virtually no space for caching or programs. I would think more than likely that the 24GB is saved for the caching itself. However, the SSD doesn't show up under the drive listing. Plus, why not just add more RAM for caching instead? Something to look into...- Overall it runs fast, cool, and without hiccups. Glad we purchased it and my wife loves it so far (minus the non backlit keyboard).
