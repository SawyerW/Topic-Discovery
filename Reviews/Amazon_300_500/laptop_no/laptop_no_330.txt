I own a couple of this model ,for 2 months now ,got it from office depot for $700.00 a piece ,Pros good quality build, i7 quad cores 8 treads is more than capable on any task I put this machine through,keyboard is very responsive,dual harddrive compartments ,screen quality better that my 17 inch toshiba satelite, 6 gig ram is big enough memory I push this computer to the limit and it will only use a bout 4 gig of ram space so no need to waste your money on upgrading your ram to more than 6 gig ,also the i7 quadcores 8 hypertrades cores is alot of cores if your doing basic stuff your only ganna use about 3 to 4 treads at a time ,unless your using it for photoshop CS5 ,photoshop ligthroon 4.0 or gaming then 4 to 6 threads will start to kick in ,but if you used any 3D programs like ZBrush or Maya ,then you will start to used 6 to 8 threads but still it wont even used  more than 60 percent CPU power because you have 8 cores spreading the load ,so unless your into 3d stuff you really dont need the i7 ,the i5 will do great and youll save some of that hard earn money ,even the AMD A8 quadcore series APU models will also be powerful enough ,the way I see it i7 quadcore 8 threads models are for people who have money to waste or for people who thinks its really that much of a defferent when it comes to power ,but I believe its all about tricking you people to spend more money ,beware do not spend more money on things that you dont even need ,the reason why I bought this computer is to test the power and because I work on computers to be familiar with latest stuff,Cons the hard drive is only 5400rpm having 7200rpm would be better ,the harddrive tend to heat up because of lacking ventalation holes and the harddrive is pack so tight in the first comparment,simple fix take the harddrives cover drill bigger holes ,also transfer the harddrive from first to the second compartment because it has more space to cool down,also be careful on taking out and put in the harddrive - Ram cover back ,its very fragile almost impossible to take out and put back in with out damaging the pigs that hold it in place ,to take the cover out push the battery release to the opposite side that will help push the harddrive-Ram cover out then just grab and pull slowly ,installing it back in , the last part that came off is the first one to go in if your not sure what your doin dont atempt or youll just damage the cover pigs and it will never stay back in ....
